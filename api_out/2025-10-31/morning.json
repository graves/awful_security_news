Mamdani explains to CNN’s Anderson Cooper why he said the IDF had laced the NYPD’s boots \n       \n  By David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:42 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Zohran Mamdani  on Tuesday responded to a widely shared 2023 clip in which he suggested that the New York Police Department and Israeli army were linked in oppression, the latest example of the Democratic mayoral nominee  facing questions about his past record  of anti-police and anti-Israel statements.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF,” Mamdani says in the clip, from a Democratic Socialists of America convention held that year. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, are the armed forces of Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make, not specifically that example all the time, but just to say that for working-class people who have very little time, who have so many stresses, who are under so many pressures, there isn’t that much time for symbolism,” he then said. “We have to make it materially connected to their life.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Anderson Cooper played that clip Tuesday and asked Mamdani what he meant.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  “So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.\n \n\n   \n  “No, what I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mamdani would seek as mayor to end any training exercises or other cooperation between the NYPD and Israel. But the clip – and Mamdani’s explanation of it – became the latest instance during the mayoral campaign where the Democratic nominee had to answer for his past criticisms of both Israel and the police.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has apologized for some of his comments about law enforcement, including social media posts in which he called the police racist, wicked and corrupt. Seeking to reassure voters concerned about public safety, he has said he would seek to retain NYPD Commissioner  Jessica Tisch , though he acknowledged in an earlier interview with CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that he hadn’t spoken to Tisch about staying on.\n \n\n   \n  But he has not backed down on his criticisms of Israel, referring to its war in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7 attacks as a genocide. He has said that as mayor, he would seek to carry out an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  While Americans are  increasingly skeptical  of Israel’s actions in Gaza, Mamdani’s criticisms have caused anger within parts of New York’s Jewish community, the largest outside Israel. He has  sought to reassure  Jewish voters that he would fight antisemitism and provide requested security at synagogues.\n \n\n   \n  While the NYPD does not have international posts in the traditional sense, the department runs an “International Liaison Program” that stations detectives across more than a dozen countries around the globe with the purpose of developing contacts with local law enforcement and engaging in counterterrorism exercises, according to the New York City police foundation that helps fund the program.\n \n\n   \n  The program, which critics say has expanded for years with little oversight, was started after 9/11 as law enforcement professionals sought to learn more about overseas terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, the NYPD has continued to deploy senior law enforcement officers around the world, including to Israel, where they share in intelligence and training exercises.\n \n\n   \n  The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/wnba-players-union-cba-extension","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-04:00","title":"WNBA and Players Union Agree to 30-Day Extension for CBA Negotiations, AP Source Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The WNBA and players' union have agreed to a 30-day extension of negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement, pushing the deadline to November 30, 2025.

of ‘prince’ title and evicts him from royal mansion \n       \n  By Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:37 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of starting the process to strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from the royal estate in Windsor, in the most dramatic attempt yet to quell the scandal over the disgraced prince’s links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The move, described in stark terms by Buckingham Palace as “necessary censures,” cements the deepest split in the British royal family in decades. The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with  Epstein  from engulfing the monarchy.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”\n \n\n   \n  Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, said it’s been a “joyous and happy and sad day” in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.\n \n\n   \n  “She (Giuffre) should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts praised the move by King Charles, calling it “a big sense of vindication for (Giuffre).”\n \n\n   \n  “She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”\n \n\n   \n  Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”\n \n\n   \n  Buckingham Palace announced the stunning move in a statement that was shorn of the usual royal niceties. “His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew.”\n \n\n   \n  “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands Andrew will be moving to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles. The move will take place as soon as it is practicable.\n \n\n   \n  It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status  could be removed  by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerage in relation to York, Inverness and Killyleagh.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles has effectively taken place immediately.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the family’s statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n \n\n   \n    Calls for Andrew to face justice continue\n \n\n   \n  The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”\n \n\n   \n  The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew’s daughters to retain princess titles\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.\n \n\n   \n  The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

That office did not immediately respond to an after-hours email Thursday evening seeking comment on the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said in a statement that he was disappointed to learn of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “The law must apply equally to everyone regardless of the title or position they hold,” he wrote. “Know that if you betray the people’s trust in Mississippi, you will face consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Multiple Mississippi law enforcement agencies and sheriffs have faced federal scrutiny in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the former Hinds County Sheriff Marshand Crisler was  convicted  of accepting $9,500 in bribes and knowingly providing ammunition to a convicted felon.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Through the final days of this year’s campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo has at times lived up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo  relaunched his mayoral campaign  after his shocking Democratic primary loss, telling New Yorkers he was in it to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the  possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani . He has described his run as the last chance New Yorkers will have to save the city from Mamdani’s  democratic socialism , once referring in a debate to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “kid” and warning that his ideas were radical and unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s final general election ad leans on his executive experience and also questions whether Mamdani has enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Life in New York is tough right now,” he says in the ad. “Candidates who need on-the-job training can’t fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s election, early voting numbers were up dramatically ahead of the same point in 2021, reflecting the interest New Yorkers have in a mayoral race unlike any in recent memory. The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  And in a  new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters  released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 16%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).\n \n\n   \n  Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he  laughed with a radio host  who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11. Cuomo  later said  he believed the host’s comments were offensive as Mamdani accused him of playing to Islamophobia.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” host Jon Stewart joked with Mamdani about their back-and-forth.\n \n\n   \n  “You are clearly in the front-runner position right now – I can tell because they have gone 9/11 on you,” Stewart said eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “The closing argument,” Mamdani responded.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo reframes his legacy\n \n\n   \n  With every post and campaign stop, Cuomo tried a new media strategy while leaning into the legacy items of his 11 years as governor, including  legalizing same-sex marriage  and  raising the minimum wage . In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”\n \n\n   \n   Cuomo resigned  in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n \n\n   \n  He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi  wrote on X . “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”\n \n\n   \n    Embracing his inner influencer\n \n\n   \n  As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.\n \n\n   \n  Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.\n \n\n   \n  He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.\n \n\n   \n  At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.\n \n\n   \n    Experience, experience, experience\n \n\n   \n  Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that  Mamdani’s police reform agenda  would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.\n \n\n   \n  The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.\n \n\n   \n  On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Cuomo got the endorsement of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who was in office on the day Hurricane Sandy devastated the city.\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg, who also endorsed Cuomo in the primary and donated millions to a Cuomo Super PAC, reiterated his support for the governor and highlighted his experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Being Mayor of New York City is the second toughest job in America, and the next mayor will face immense challenges,” Bloomberg wrote in a post on X. “Andrew Cuomo has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/oakland-california-museum-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00-11:45","title":"Over 1,000 Items Stolen from California Museum’s Collection in Early Morning Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major early-morning burglary on October 15, 2025, over 1,000 items from the Oakland Museum of California’s collection were stolen, including Native American baskets, jewelry by artist Florence Resnikoff, and 20th-century memorabilia like campaign pins and athletic trophies.

Some live in ‘haunted’ houses to cut a deal \n       \n  By Chris Lau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:53 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In land-starved Hong Kong a tiny, no-frills apartment far from the city center can eat up half of a monthly salary. But for bold renters there’s one sure way to get a discount: choose a property haunted by a murder or unnatural death.\n \n\n   \n  The houses, often apartments inside the city’s tall residential buildings, strike so much fear among residents that anyone willing to live there can negotiate hefty discounts in one of the world’s most expensive property markets.\n \n\n   \n  “The discount could be massive and many people who don’t mind can rent these places below the market price” said Ng Goon-lau, an investor so well-known for owning dozens of these apartments that local media has dubbed him the “King of Haunted Houses.”\n \n\n   \n  Lists of haunted houses can be found on most estate agent websites. They are places where an unnatural or premature death has occurred and include the scenes of some of the city’s most gruesome murders.\n \n\n   \n  Property-listing website Spacious.hk compiles a 92-page list that dates back to 2006, featuring details of how each death occurred. In a city known for its tightly packed residential towers, many entries state the cause of death as “fell from height.”\n \n\n   \n  Other real estate agencies  offer advice  about how to identify spooky apartments, including checking death certificates and quizzing potential neighbors about the apartment’s history.\n \n\n   \n  In a city heavily influenced by Buddhism and Taoism, living in apartments associated with ghastly deaths often stokes fear of bad fortune.\n \n\n   \n  Feng shui master Andrew Kwan said people believe that those who died a tragic death may not get closure. “Their hatred may stay. (Their spirit) may remain in the apartment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The fear of a curse has created a unique market for bargain-hunting investors and tenants who are happy to try their luck.\n \n\n   \n  Property prices plunge by an average of 20% after they are labelled haunted – and up to 34% in the event of a murder, according to Utpal Bhattacharya, Chair Professor of Finance at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who led a study on the phenomena in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  A ripple effect spreads to properties on the same floor, which often see their value drop 10%, and even flats in the same building can fall 7%, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The belief in Feng Shui is quite strong among Chinese, and the population in Hong Kong is about 94% Chinese…implying that most buyers have a large distaste for haunted houses,” said Bhattacharya.\n \n\n   \n  Disclosure is not required under Hong Kong law, but regulators demand property agents provide accurate information about any death upon inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  These details matter because the circumstance of the death – from accidents to malicious murders – could determine the size of the discount.\n \n\n   \n    Turning bad fortune into dollars\n \n\n   \n  In death, Ng, a veteran investor in his 70s, sees opportunity. He scoops up the so-called haunted homes from owners who are desperate to sell, and leases them out at up to 30% below market price.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people don’t actually have a strong feeling against hung zaats. It all comes down to the extent of the discount,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the prevailing mood of the city is to stay away – or at least be cautious.\n \n\n   \n  That especially applies to properties linked to some of the city’s most chilling murder cases.\n \n\n   \n  In 2014, British banker Rurik Jutting  brutally murdered two Indonesian women  and hid one of the bodies in a suitcase in his upscale apartment in J Residence in Wan Chai, a popular nightlife district in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  As gruesome details of the murders emerged, the value of the one-bedroom apartment where they took place was estimated to have plunged from $1.16 million to $770,000, with its $3,740 monthly rental halved, Bloomberg reported at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Another unit in Tsuen Wan, a residential neighborhood in the New Territories, was sold at a loss of $142,000, shaving 40% off the original price, according to local news reports. The unit was the scene of a money-fueled murder in 2016 involving three men, who killed their friend and sealed his body in a slab of cement stored in the unit.\n \n\n   \n  Owners of the properties are almost certain to lose money. It’s very difficult to find a buyer for homes listed as a haunted house – partly because banks also tend to stay away.\n \n\n   \n  Eric Pau, Senior Associate Director at Ricacorp Properties, a major real estate firm in Hong Kong, told CNN many banks view them as high-risk investments. “In most cases, mortgages will not be granted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But he said others see it as an opportunity. As an investor, Ng’s playbook is to be selective about the type of “haunted homes” he buys.\n \n\n   \n  He tries to avoid properties associated with gruesome murders as much as possible and looks for places where the death occurred some time ago.\n \n\n   \n  “Fortunately, some ‘haunted houses’ have been around for so long that people have forgotten about what happened,” he said. “The main thing is to make people not to feel sad and unpleasant.”\n \n\n   \n  But like all investments, there are risks, and Ng has had some spooky failures.\n \n\n   \n  One time, he said, a tenant broke the lease just days after moving in. The tenant never told him why, so he turned to the neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  “The neighbors told me that the three-year-old son of this tenant opened a very difficult book in the middle of the night and read it attentively,” Ng recalled being told.\n \n\n   \n  “He thought his son was possessed,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/autism-covid-pregnancy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:06:00-04:00","title":"Autism diagnosis rates higher among children born to mothers who had Covid-19 during pregnancy, study suggests","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A large-scale study conducted by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Mass General Brigham found that children born to mothers who had Covid-19 during pregnancy were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, compared to those born to mothers without infection.

Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”\n \n\n   \n  The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n \n\n   \n  The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.\n \n\n   \n  “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in  a news release .\n \n\n   \n  About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a  report  published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has  caused the autism epidemic .”\n \n\n   \n  In a news conference in September on the “ cause of autism ,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of  Tylenol during pregnancy  can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.\n \n\n   \n  The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-black-river-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:44:00Z","title":"‘Hell on Earth’: Ravaged by Hurricane Melissa, this once-vibrant Jamaican town is now in desperate need of help","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa caused catastrophic damage to Black River, Jamaica, reducing homes, historical buildings, and greenery to rubble.

The shutdown, triggered by Senate Democrats withholding support for a temporary funding bill to force Republicans to extend Obamacare subsidies, has led to soaring health care costs—up to 26%—and the potential loss of food assistance for tens of millions, including vulnerable groups like children and elderly. Federal workers and military personnel face unpaid wages, while air traffic controllers operate under stress without pay. Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, remain unwilling to discuss healthcare policy changes until the government is open, deepening the stalemate. Democrats, led by Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, condemn the political exploitation of public suffering.

\nUpdated: \n        7:47 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump had his fun, with red carpet welcomes, impromptu dances, the  gift of a golden crown  and a yet another  Nobel Peace Prize nomination .\n \n\n   \n  But the trophies from  his Asia tour  won’t count for much when he arrives home Thursday just as the monthlong government shutdown takes its bitterest turn yet amid the worst domestic political crisis of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  His return and a confluence of suddenly harsher  consequences for millions of Americans  mean the next few days may represent the only way out of the increasingly damaging impasse before the run-up to Thanksgiving.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re pretending that everything is OK,” Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said this week, berating her colleagues in both parties for failing to act. “We’re pretending that people are not being impacted by this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the showdown, withholding support for a temporary government funding bill last month in an attempt to force Republicans to guarantee extensions for  expanded subsidies  for millions of  Affordable Care Act health plans .\n \n\n   \n  “They are completely and totally uninterested in solving or addressing, decisively, the Republican health care crisis that they’ve created,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “On November 1, when open enrollment begins, it’s going to be crystal clear to tens of millions of Americans, across the country, that their premiums, copays and deductibles are about to dramatically increase,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  But Republican leaders are standing firm. They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n \n\n   \n  The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare. Millions are getting notices showing Obamacare costs shooting up by an average of 26% and in some cases much higher, in the absence of the expiring enhanced subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Which pain point is the worst?” Collins asked Jeffries, referring to Americans hit by rising Obamacare premiums and those facing the potential loss of SNAP benefits. “None of this pain that Republicans have inflicted on the American people is acceptable,” Jeffries replied.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure on government workers — those forced to work without pay and colleagues who are locked out of their jobs — is also worsening.\n \n\n   \n  Flight disruptions are mounting as staff shortages emerge among air traffic controllers, who already operate  under acute stress . The controllers’ mental and emotional challenges are rising since they are  working without pay  — but still face housing, transport and childcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  A new crisis speed bump looms over paying military personnel. Trump accepted a  $130 million donation  from a fellow billionaire to fill the gap left by drained federal funds after reallocating Pentagon funds to meet a first wave of salary payments. But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.\n \n\n   \n    Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?\n \n\n   \n  Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.\n \n\n   \n  ► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?\n \n\n   \n  ► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?\n \n\n   \n  ► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?\n \n\n   \n    A hint of hope as senators talk\n \n\n   \n  A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a  dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators . One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.\n \n\n   \n  Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”\n \n\n   \n  The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.\n \n\n   \n  But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the  American Federation of Government Employees  union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans face their own risks.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who keeps accusing her party of negligence over the health care issue. The political equation could shift for Republicans next week if Trump is rebuked in  bellwether elections in Virginia and New Jersey .\n \n\n   \n  And leaving kids hungry could be a disaster. That’s one reason  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to fund SNAP benefits  until the end of the shutdown. Schumer said his party would vote for it. But Republican leaders will be loath to make a move that could alleviate pressure on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If millions of Americans going hungry doesn’t break open the deadlock, the shutdown could drag on even longer. The next potential off-ramp may come in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving with the horrible prospect of an air travel nightmare at the busiest time of the year.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/amazon-layoffs-andy-jassy-ai-culture","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00Z","title":"Amazon says it didn’t cut 14,000 people because of money.

EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is investigating whether leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during racial justice protests in 2020, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, federal law enforcement officials have issued subpoenas and at least one search warrant as part of an investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. and other Black-led organizations that helped spark a national reckoning on systemic racism, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss an ongoing criminal probe by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  It was not clear if the investigation would result in criminal charges, but its mere existence invites fresh scrutiny to a movement that in recent years has faced criticism about its public accounting of donations received. The recent burst of investigative activity is also unfolding at a time when civil rights groups have raised concerns about the potential for the Trump administration to target a broad variety of progressive and left-leaning groups that have been critical of him, including those affiliated with BLM, the transgender rights movement and anti-ICE protesters.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people said the investigation had been initiated during the Biden administration but is getting renewed attention during the Trump administration. A second person confirmed that allegations were examined in the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation said it  took in over $90 million in donations , following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a White Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the US and around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, have accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase  a $6 million Los Angeles-area property  that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders previously have denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old  Trayvon Martin  in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives.\n \n\n   \n  Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But as the movement’s influence grew, so did the number of organizations that became affiliated with BLM. In 2020, a tidal wave of public contributions in the aftermath of protests over Floyd’s murder came mainly to the BLM foundation, although other organizations were resourced from those funds.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation  opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022 , revealing detailed accountings of expenditures. The latest Form 990 filing shows the BLM foundation had $28 million in assets for the fiscal year ending June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation is being run out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles. The top prosecutor there, Bill Essayli, was  disqualified from several cases  earlier this week after a federal judge concluded that the Trump appointee has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. It’s not clear whether Essayli’s disqualification will impact the BLM investigation. He effectively remains the office’s top prosecutor with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s Covid-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against state policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.\n \n\n   \n  As a private practice attorney, he characterized BLM as a “radical organization” while defending a White couple charged in 2020 with a hate crime after they were videotaped defacing  a BLM mural in Martinez, California .\n \n\n   \n  At the time,  city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways  in cities throughout the US in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli told a San Francisco CBS TV affiliate his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matters.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple took plea deals to resolve the case in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/fetterman-democrats-shutdown-snap","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:26:00-04:00","title":"Fetterman Rails on His Colleagues for Not Getting Their ‘Sh*t Together’ with SNAP on the Line Amid the Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government enters its 34th day of shutdown, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has criticized his colleagues for failing to resolve the crisis, warning that millions of Americans—including over 2 million on SNAP and 400,000 on Affordable Care Act tax credits—will face food insecurity and financial hardship.

John Fetterman was exasperated with his colleagues Thursday, as the Senate heads home in the stalemate’s fifth week and millions of Americans are due to lose federal food assistance this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month, and now things are really going to land, and imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” the Pennsylvania Democrat told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman said his wife helps distribute free food to the community and has already witnessed longer lines. He lamented that when he returns home this weekend, he’ll have to tell constituents who have lost their SNAP benefits, “I don’t have an explanation for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Democrat, who  has been outspoken  against shutting down the government in any form, has been one of just three in his caucus to routinely break from the party and vote with Republicans more than a dozen times to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate left town on Thursday for the weekend with no measurable progress toward a deal to reopen the government, with impatience inside the US Capitol skyrocketing and  critical social safety net programs at risk  in the coming days. Senators will not return until Monday, which will mark day 34 of the shutdown – just two days shy of setting a new record for longest shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Key senators of both parties took part in some private meetings Thursday to discuss potential off-ramps, including how to get both parties to support a deal on long-term appropriations bills. But lawmakers involved in those talks offered no more clarity about whether it could indeed end the standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the effort by some Senate Democrats to pass a bill to temporarily extend SNAP benefits, Fetterman questioned why Congress couldn’t also pay Capitol police officers, saying that “the world’s biggest lethal military in the world has relied on a donor to pay our service members last week. I mean, that’s a disgrace.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to find a way forward,” the senator said. He added that while he “fundamentally” believes there will be an effort to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, as his fellow Democrats are demanding, his party must also consider those who receive other important benefits from the government.\n \n\n   \n  “You have 2 million people on SNAP in my state, and over 400,000 are receiving those kind of tax credits,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “For a Democrat, I can’t imagine a more sacred part of who we fight for is people that, that depend on SNAP to feed themselves,” he said, later adding, “Our party has bigger problems than I thought we might have already. It’s like that’s not controversial. Pay everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t even get our shit together and just open up our government,” he lamented.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s prior suggestion that each day of the shutdown plays better politically for Democrats, Fetterman responded, “Ask the hungry people on Saturday.”\n \n\n   \n  “Americans are not leverage. This is not, this is not some shitty game show about who’s winning or whatever. It’s just like we have to be better than this and just open this up,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/apple-earnings-q4-iphone-17-sales","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:13:00Z","title":"Apple Reports Record Earnings, Hints at Strong iPhone 17 Demand Amid AI and Trade Challenges","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Apple reported strong fourth-quarter earnings, with record revenue of $102.5 billion and a record $49 billion in iPhone sales, slightly below Wall Street expectations.

\n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:13 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that provided an early glimpse into how the iPhone 17 lineup may be catching on so far.   \n \n\n   \n  Apple’s earnings for the quarter that ended in September met analysts’ expectations on revenue but slightly missed on iPhone sales.   iPhone sales in the fourth quarter were $49 billion, up from $46.2 billion compared to the same period a   year ago but slightly lower than the $50.1 billion Wall Street was expecting. Overall revenue was $102.5 billion, an increase from $94.9 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Apple says both revenue and iPhone sales   numbers represent a record for the fourth   quarter. Services revenue, another closely watched metric ,  also hit an   all-time record at $28.8 billion, an increase from roughly $25 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  During Apple’s earnings call on Thursday,   CEO Tim Cook said the company expects the December quarter’s revenue “to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for the iPhone,” suggesting strong iPhone 17 sales.\n \n\n   \n  Apple shares were up around 3% in after-hours trading.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street is looking for assurance that Apple’s biggest revenue driver is still growing despite concerns that the company is behind in the AI race. Analysts had estimated strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup, which Apple launched in late September.\n \n\n   \n  However, overall sales in China   shrunk compared to a year ago, with the company generating $14.5 billion in revenue in the region. In 2024, Apple earned $15 billion during the same period. Cook said on Thursday that he expects iPhone revenue to return to growth in China in the current quarter based on how the iPhone 17 is being received.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s results paint an early picture of iPhone sales since its fourth quarter ended on September 27, eight days after the iPhone 17 launch. Still, it’s possible that sales slowed in the July and August months as consumers waited for the iPhone 17.\n \n\n   \n  The iPhone 17 series outsold its predecessor by 14% in its first 10 days in the United States and China, according to  Counterpoint Research , with the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max being the most in demand. The iPhone Air, touted as the thinnest iPhone ever, is seeing “muted customer interest” according to UBS, which has been tracking retail wait times for new iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  Apple’s iPhone business is always under a microscope as the company’s largest revenue driver. But the tech industry is particularly paying close attention, prompted by speculation that another AI-powered gadget may eventually supplant the smartphone.\n \n\n   \n  While analysts previously grilled Apple about its AI strategy on recent earnings calls, Wall Street was more interested in the factors driving iPhone demand and the impact of tariffs. Apple said it expects to incur $1.4 billion in tariff-related costs this quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But Cook said he sees “opportunities on the App Store” for AI when asked about whether the rise of chatbots and AI apps will change how consumers use apps. He also said Apple Intelligence — a suite of AI-powered features for the iPhone and the company’s other products — is motivating people to upgrade their iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  “I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor, and that’s the way that we look at it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Apple delayed an update to Siri earlier this year that would have brought it closer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Rivals like Google, Microsoft and Samsung,   meanwhile, continue to pour billions into their AI infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The earnings come in what has been a challenging year for Apple.\n \n\n   \n  The company has been impacted by   President Donald Trump’s trade war and has faced pressure from the Trump administration to make its iPhones domestically. Earlier this year it committed to investing $600 billion toward expanding its US operations. But Thursday’s earnings, along with the company surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization earlier this week, represent a turnaround.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/americas/hurricane-melissa-damage-jamaica-cuba-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:31:00-04:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa Leaves a Trail of Devastation After Tearing Through the Caribbean","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean, reaching Category 5 strength with winds of 185 mph.

death to the Caribbean as it tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds unleashed widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas. At least 30 people have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  As the hurricane headed toward Bermuda early Thursday, emergency officials in countries along Melissa’s path have begun to pick up the pieces – clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, traveled to some of the hardest-hit areas of the island nation Wednesday to survey the significant damage caused by punishing winds and widespread flooding.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the difficulties, the Jamaican spirit shines through as a strong reminder that we are a resilient nation with the capacity to triumph over adversity,” he wrote  on social media .\n \n\n   \n    Path of destruction\n \n\n   \n  In the Caribbean, hotter-than-average waters paired with minimally disruptive winds higher in the atmosphere to create the perfect fuel and prime conditions for Melissa to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa rapidly  intensified , jumping from a 70 mph tropical storm on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  By Tuesday, Melissa had morphed into a high-end Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, tying it with  four other hurricanes  as the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic since records began in 1851.\n \n\n   \n  As it headed toward Jamaica, where it slammed into the coast as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned it expected the situation to be “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” WMO tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, it crossed into eastern Cuba, still a formidable Category 3 hurricane by the time it made landfall in the province of Santiago de Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  By the time it reached the Bahamas on Wednesday, Hurricane Melissa had been downgraded to a Category 1, but its broad wind field continued to drive torrential flooding rain, damaging winds and dangerous storm surge at the coast.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were  evacuated in Cuba  as Melissa approached, according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel, while in the Bahamas, preliminary estimates show 1,485 residents were evacuated before all flights were suspended ahead of the approaching storm.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders were also issued for six islands in the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, also felt the cataclysmic impacts of Melissa.\n \n\n   \n    Devastation left behind\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, officials painted a consistent picture of the destruction Melissa left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions here are devastating. ‘Catastrophic’ is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” Richard Solomon, the mayor of the southwest Jamaican city of Black River, where Hurricane Melissa made landfall, said in a  video  posted by the Jamaica Constabulary Force.\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government has said.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday.

He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional development.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00Z","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean, with Jamaica taking the worst hit as it made landfall as a Category 5 storm, causing complete destruction, widespread flooding, and at least 39 confirmed deaths.

Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:33 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is now headed for Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, where it won’t make landfall but will bring quick-hitting bursts of strong winds and rain.\n \n\n   \n  In preparation, authorities in Bermuda have closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands.\n \n\n   \n  At least 39 people are known to have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported. Many are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.\n \n\n   \n  Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are complicating recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”\n \n\n   \n  “What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17 th  century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.\n \n\n   \n  But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.\n \n\n   \n  In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters. Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, he said: “At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes’ time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape.”\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, education minister Dana Morris Dixon said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government said.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, the country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, minister for local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel pushing more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Schools around the capital Kingston on the eastern side of the island are expected to reopen Monday, Dixon, the education minister, said in a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Extensive damage’ in Cuba\n \n\n   \n  Cuba was also hit hard after the hurricane made landfall there as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday. The country sustained “extensive damage,” according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n \n\n   \n  This included flooding, mudslides, property destruction and infrastructure damage, particularly in Cuba’s eastern regions, where hundreds of rural communities were left isolated. In the province of Santiago, at least 241 communities were cut off due to the storm, Reuters reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were evacuated in Cuba as Melissa approached.\n \n\n   \n  Cuba’s foreign ministry said it is in touch with the US State Department to get clarity on how the United States would be willing to help with recovery.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio  announced  earlier Thursday that the US is “prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance” to the Cuban people – both directly and through local partners.\n \n\n   \n  The administration of President Donald Trump has historically taken a hard-line stance against the communist-ruled island. In June, the president signed a  memorandum  that the White House said would increase pressure on the Cuban government and support the long-running US economic embargo of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio said Thursday that US law includes exemptions that authorize private donations of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío responded to the offer by  saying : “We have been in contact with the State Department and are awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuba is already receiving some aid from partners such as China and Venezuela, as well as the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n    High death toll in Haiti\n \n\n   \n  The highest death toll so far has been reported in Haiti, where the hurricane did not make direct landfall but caused significant damage and at least 23 deaths due to severe flooding and landslides. Twenty of these fatalities, including 10 children, were due to flooding in Petit-Goâve, where a flooded river burst its banks.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    International efforts\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding. The British government also said it was chartering a limited number of flights to help British nationals leave Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  on Tuesday showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Mitchell McCluskey, Briana Waxman, Karina Tsui, Michael Rios, Patrick Oppmann and Maija Ehlinger contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/january-6-doj-memo-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s push to rewrite the history of January 6 takes an especially brazen turn","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump and his Justice Department have engaged in a coordinated effort to rewrite the historical narrative of January 6, 2021, by altering official legal documents to remove references to the violent nature of the Capitol attack.

\nUpdated: \n        5:23 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Shortly after the  January 6, 2021, attack  on the US Capitol, the political right spent a lot of time parsing whether the word “insurrection” was an apt description of the day’s events.\n \n\n   \n  Today, President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is apparently  sanctioning its own prosecutors  for calling January 6 a mere “mob of rioters.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s difficult to fully convey just how brazen Trump’s efforts to rewrite the history of the day have become. He’s spent years trying to turn people who launched the worst attack on the US Capitol in two centuries into sympathetic figures. He even pardoned a bunch of people who assaulted police that day, despite  more than 8 in 10 Americans opposing that .\n \n\n   \n  But sometimes something comes along that completely drives the whole thing home.\n \n\n   \n  That’s what happened this week, in the  case of Taylor Taranto .\n \n\n   \n  To recap: Taranto was among those pardoned by Trump for his actions on January 6. But before that pardon, he committed an unrelated crime. In 2023, he was arrested in former President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood with numerous firearms and materials to make explosives. He was convicted in May.\n \n\n   \n  By late Tuesday, a reporter at Politico noted something interesting: Prosecutors in their sentencing memo for Taranto noted his presence in the “mob of rioters” on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building,” the  sentencing memo  said. “After the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  This wouldn’t normally be surprising, mind you. It’s a factual statement that notes the defendant isn’t a newcomer to legal trouble.\n \n\n   \n  But it  was  notable next to Trump’s own rhetoric about January 6 – and given the Trump DOJ’s efforts to  force out a batch of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, mere hours later the prosecutors on the case – Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White – were  placed on leave . Then their sentencing memo was pulled from the docket and replaced with a new one, signed by different prosecutors, that excised the paragraph on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  And just in case it wasn’t clear that the changes were made to benefit Trump, consider another change to the sentencing memo.\n \n\n   \n  The other interesting aspect of Taranto’s crime is Trump’s proximity to it. In fact, Taranto was apprehended near Obama’s home  shortly after Trump reshared a post that included an alleged address for the former president  to social media. Prosecutors said Taranto began livestreaming in the area shortly after promoting Trump’s post.\n \n\n   \n  The new sentencing memo also removed a reference to that fact.\n \n\n   \n  The US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, declined to shed light on why the prosecutors were put on leave.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n  We still have plenty to learn about what happened here. But it’s one of the most glaring examples of the fruits of Trump’s long-running campaign to retcon January 6 – and to turn it into anything other than a tragic day for our country and our democracy.\n \n\n   \n  After the dust settled on that day, Trump and some allies in Congress began suggestively questioning how violent the day was, with one GOP congressman infamously comparing it to a “ normal tourist visit .”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump launched his 2024 campaign, he began featuring a  music video from a choir of January 6 defendants  that effectively lionized them. He began talking about the defendants as if they were ill-treated political “hostages,” often  citing misinformation  in the process.\n \n\n   \n  Then he, on his first day back in office, pardoned nearly all of them – even the worst offenders.\n \n\n   \n  But that was merely the first step.\n \n\n   \n  We’ve also seen a  purge of dozens of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases, despite them merely enforcing the law. Trump’s Justice Department agreed to  settle a wrongful death suit for $5 million with the family of Ashli Babbitt , who was killed after breaking into a sensitive area of the Capitol, cementing her status as a martyr for some portions of the extreme right. The administration has also  pressured the Smithsonian , which has in some cases  softened its language about the events that day . The president and allies have continued to overhype  relatively minor   disclosures  about the government’s actions vis-a-vis January 6, which took place while Trump was in office, as if they proved a massive conspiracy against Trump and the GOP. The House is now undertaking an investigation that  appears aimed at recasting the narrative  of that day.\n \n\n   \n  Oh, and we recently learned Trump is reportedly  seeking $230 million  from his own government for alleged damages from the January 6 probe and other federal investigations. (Trump was never tried in these cases, which were dropped after he was reelected president, but nor was he acquitted.)\n \n\n   \n  If anything epitomizes Trump’s attempts to turn those who fueled what happened on January 6 into victims, it’s surely that. Even if you don’t think Trump committed a crime, the people who attacked the Capitol were clearly spurred by his lies about voter fraud and the supposedly stolen election.\n \n\n   \n  Trump just keeps pushing the envelope here, and we keep seeing that manifest itself in actions by his Justice Department and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  The question from there is whether he’s able to actually rewrite history in Americans’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  To this point, that’s been  a tough slog . Trump’s pardons of violent January 6 defendants were overwhelmingly unpopular. Strong majorities of Americans still regard that day as an attack against democracy.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a steady downgrading of the right’s views on that day.\n \n\n   \n  By mid-2021, a Monmouth University poll showed 62% of Republicans labeled that day a “riot,” and 33% called it an “insurrection.” Two years later, though, those numbers  dropped significantly – to 44% and 15%, respectively .\n \n\n   \n  In that way, the erasure of the “mob of rioters” from the memo reflects how the political right has come to view that day.\n \n\n   \n  But that doesn’t mean it’s a reflection of the truth.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-checks-into-prison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:56:00Z","title":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs Checks Into Fort Dix to Begin Prison Sentence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, the music mogul, has been transferred to Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey, to begin serving the remainder of his 50-month sentence for transporting individuals to engage in prostitution.

nukes. It caught even some advisers by surprise. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:13 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with  President Donald Trump  in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.\n \n\n   \n  Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump  instructed the Pentagon  to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  “That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”\n \n\n   \n  “To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”\n \n\n   \n  Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n  A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”\n \n\n   \n  He seemed less cautious in his  Truth Social message  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.\n \n\n   \n  “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.\n \n\n   \n  In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.\n \n\n   \n  In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”\n \n\n   \n  “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.\n \n\n   \n  “If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-guard-quick-reaction-force","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:53:00Z","title":"Trump’s National Guard quick reaction force largely already exists, officials say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's August 2025 executive order directed the Pentagon to establish a standing National Guard quick reaction force for domestic emergencies, but officials state that such forces already exist in most states under existing frameworks like the National Guard Reaction Force and Homeland Response Force.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon is moving forward on orders from President Donald Trump to build a National Guard quick reaction force in each state for domestic use, though two US officials say the effort is largely making incremental changes to a mission the Guard already undertakes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ordered that the Pentagon “ensure the availability of a standing National Guard quick reaction force that shall be resourced, trained, and available for rapid nationwide deployment,” in an August  executive order .\n \n\n   \n  But the two officials said those reaction forces already exist.\n \n\n   \n  “This whole thing – we’re already doing it,” one of the US officials said. “This is just updated guidance.”\n \n\n   \n  The officials said that plans are being developed within the Defense Department and National Guard for possible additional training or increase to the number of personnel available for existing units to meet the new requirement.\n \n\n   \n  Internal Pentagon guidance directs that most states have roughly 500 individuals dedicated to the reaction force, one of the officials said, though that number could vary depending on the size of the state.\n \n\n   \n  Some states may have to increase the size of their Guard contingent dedicated to the mission to meet that guidance.\n \n\n   \n  The Guardian was first to report on the guidance, which was issued earlier this month, with the director of operations for the Pentagon’s National Guard bureau outlining troop numbers for the quick reaction forces ordered by Trump including a total of roughly 23,500 troops nationally.\n \n\n   \n  The Guard already has two types of forces that meet this mission – the National Guard Reaction Force and the Homeland Response Force.\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard Reaction Force in each state provides “a rapid response capability focused on incidents requiring defense support of civilian authorities,” a publicly available fact sheet says.\n \n\n   \n  When needed, that force is meant to be able to deploy 25% of its personnel within the first eight hours, 50% of its personnel within 12 hours, and the entire contingent within 24 hours. Their mission, according to the fact sheet, includes civil disturbance control and personnel and site security.\n \n\n   \n  The Homeland Response Force, meanwhile, is meant to be able to assemble within six hours and support emergency response chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive disasters. Within that force, the US official said, is a group of roughly 200 US soldiers whose job is riot and crowd control.\n \n\n   \n  Those forces are organized matching the 10 regions the Federal Emergency Management Agency uses to subdivide US land, the US official said, meaning they are responsible for responding first for a group of states and/or territories. Region 2, for example, includes New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon guidance comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to use the Guard in various states as support to law enforcement and immigration officials. The administration has been caught up in legal disputes over its deployment of the Guard in  Los Angeles ,  Portland , and  Chicago , and CNN reported Wednesday that orders for the National Guard in Washington, DC, have been  extended into 2026 .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/thanksgiving-travel-shutdown-vance-duffy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:49:00-04:00","title":"Vance and Duffy warn Thanksgiving travel ‘could be a disaster’ if shutdown barrels on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the 2025 government shutdown enters its critical phase, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have issued stark warnings that the situation could spiral into a travel 'disaster' during the Thanksgiving holiday.

It is costing the travel industry $1 billion a week in economic damage and that is before we get to the most important travel week of the year.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite the issues that were raised on Thursday, Vance maintained the administration’s position that the only way out of this was for Democrats to pass a clean spending bill to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Freeman, as well as O’Brien and Kirby, have all now joined Republicans in calling for Congress to pass the short-term funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  “Congress should pass a clean continuing resolution now,” Freeman told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Vance reiterated that point when addressing reporters after the meeting, acknowledging that the key issue Democrats have fought with the GOP over — healthcare subsidies expiring — are valid, but that those negotiations would not happen “at the barrel of a gun.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Democrats response to that is, give us everything we want, or we’re going to shut down the government and keep it shut down. That is not reasonable behavior,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance added that Republicans “can’t reward” Democrats for using the shutdown as a negotiating tool, because if it works, they will continue to use it — a point the officials said he also made during the roundtable.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how a child behaves. That is not how a responsible governing party behaves in the United States of America,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN Thursday they have no intention or need to meet with Democrats until the government is reopened.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll see if things change,” the official said. “Nothing to meet about right now though.”\n \n\n   \n  The full list of attendees at the White House roundtable on Thursday:\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/travel/halloween-decorations-st-jude-fundraiser","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:34:00-04:00","title":"This Veteran’s Halloween Spirit Gave Him a New Purpose.

We want to help sick children get out of the hospital so they can see all these neat Halloween decorations.’”\n \n\n   \n  So the family printed a simple sign on their front yard that said in part: If you like what you see, feel free to donate to St. Jude – a leading children’s hospital for kids with cancer and other diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Within days, Robertson said a car pulled up with an emotional couple and their young daughter in the backseat. The tearful father told Robertson that they’re a St. Jude family and wanted to thank him for raising money for pay for treatment for families like them.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson didn’t get their names and they never saw each other again. But that encounter changed everything for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d been looking for purpose after retiring from the service,” he said. “This little girl was going through such a tough time, but she saw these goofy plastic skeletons in my yard, it put her in an awesome place.”\n \n\n   \n  The family raised  over $8,000 in 2020  – and the next year, Robertson created a Facebook group called Skeletons for St. Jude to spread the idea nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  This spooky season, the group has more than 5,000 members, and over 1,000 partner homes across the country have joined the cause and raised funds. On October 21, they officially hit the $1 million mark.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson’s neighborhood in North Carolina looks forward to his epic display every year with scores of visitors stopping by every day all month long to soak in the skeleton spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  It takes Robertson a whole year to plan the theme and build new props. He’s accumulated 100 or so toy skeletons that he keeps in storage, and he adds onto the display every day until Halloween — so there’s always something new for visitors to see.\n \n\n   \n  This October, skeletons are sailing on a 25-foot phantom pirate ship that Robertson has positioned so it appears to have crashed through the first and second stories of his house.\n \n\n   \n  “The real focus isn’t on me,” Robertson said. “It’s on the thousands of people giving five or ten dollars here and there. That’s what made this a success.”\n \n\n   \n  Robertson is grateful knowing this money will help families focus on getting their kids better.

Next week, they’re getting one of the most outspoken: Rep.

She once  railed against  “the angry, nasty women on The View” and  publicly beefed  with co-host   Joy Behar. Greene has also accused Disney of being “ pro-child predator ” for its opposition to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “The View” co-hosts have often criticized Greene’s behavior and rhetoric.

after DOJ scrubs mentions of Trump and January 6 from court records \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, Holmes Lybrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:15 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department’s decision to sideline two US attorneys and remove mentions of Donald Trump and the US Capitol attack from court papers before the sentencing of a pardoned January 6 rioter is being viewed by former and current career prosecutors as an alarming whitewashing of history.\n \n\n   \n  The events around the case of Taylor Taranto, who was convicted of bringing illegal guns near Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, residence after talking online about violence toward the federal government, has shocked the network of Justice Department employees and alumni, several sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested in June 2023 after claiming on an internet livestream that he had a detonator the day before, law enforcement officials  told CNN at the time,  and was searching for underground tunnels that led inside Obama and others’ homes.\n \n\n   \n  He had also been present at the Capitol riot and charged with related crimes, though he was never convicted because Trump pardoned him before a trial. He has already spent 23 months behind bars and hasn’t been detained since he was pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Carl Nichols, a 2019 Trump appointee, had found him guilty at trial in May of the gun crimes and for making a false threat to use a car bomb against a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  In a  sentencing memo for Taranto filed Tuesday , prosecutors Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White wrote that after “then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama,” Taranto had re-posted Trump “and thereafter started livestreaming from his van” as he drove through Obama’s neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s original post – which included the Obama address – was itself a repost of a blog article.\n \n\n   \n  Politico reporter Kyle Cheney highlighted the filing and mentioned it also included Taranto taking part in the January 6 riot, on the social media platform X late Tuesday night. Within 24 hours, the court filing was no longer available in the court record and the two prosecutors who had signed it were suspended from their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  Two new prosecutors then  filed an amended version  of the sentencing memo to the court on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  That new memo scrubbed all references to Trump and him posting Obama’s supposed address – which Taranto had reposted – as well as Taranto’s participation and conviction related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s shocking that prosecutors could be put on leave for accurately stating the court record in a sentencing memo, and it’s just as shocking that those truthful statements have been whitewashed in a revised filing,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney and now executive director and founder of Justice Connection, which works to represent the viewpoints of former federal prosecutors, especially those who have been fired by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These prosecutors did their job and upheld their duty of candor by informing the court of clearly established facts relevant to their case,” Young added.\n \n\n   \n  Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney in Washington, DC, did not comment on the suspensions and filing changes when asked about it during a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Orwellian’\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the moves made by the Justice Department had employees reeling within the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the FBI, which had investigated and caught Taranto, believing he was a danger to the public in 2023, people familiar with the office told CNN on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One source called the sentencing memo change “Orwellian.”\n \n\n   \n  Valdivia had no indication he may have employment issues — especially given that on Tuesday, the day before his suspension, he helped to secure a guilty verdict from a jury in a fraud case where he was on the trial team, according to two people familiar with the US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, White is a supervisor on Superior Court cases and was a US Marine.\n \n\n   \n  A Justice Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday following the suspensions: “While we don’t comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously. We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n    Taranto sentenced to 21 months\n \n\n   \n  When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ continued to seek the 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto’s attorney asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention. The defense attorney, Carmen Hernandez, has asked for rehabilitation that the court could order, noting Taranto’s past military service and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, according to a filing on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Typically, a defendant’s history and characteristics become part of court arguments for or against leniency when a judge decides a sentence.\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing Thursday, Nichols sentenced Taranto to 21 months in prison, essentially covered by time served.\n \n\n   \n  Nichols found that Taranto “made troubling statements” in his online livestream but noted he had no criminal history and his conduct “was far from egregious.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto spoke briefly during Thursday’s hearing, not to apologize for his conduct but to highlight a book on the 1787 constitutional convention and mention that some people questioned the results of the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to keep people’s minds open,” he concluded.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also said he thought the two prosecutors placed on leave “upheld the highest standard” throughout the case.\n \n\n   \n  “My view is that they did a commendable and exceptional job,” Nichols said of the prosecutors, adding that he felt “they did a truly excellent job in this case.”\n \n\n   \n  White and Valdivia attended Taranto’s sentencing and declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz and Casey Gannon contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/democrats-leave-classified-briefing-on-us-military-strikes-unsatisfied-after-pentagon-pulls-lawyers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00Z","title":"Democrats Leave Classified Briefing on US Military Strikes Unsatisfied After Trump Administration Pulls Pentagon Lawyers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major escalation of political tensions, the Trump administration faced sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers for withdrawing Pentagon lawyers from a classified briefing on recent US military strikes targeting suspected drug boats in the Western Hemisphere.

Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Morgan Rimmer, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:39 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democrats say the Trump administration still won’t share critical details of  recent US military strikes  on suspected drug boats in the western hemisphere, asserting that Pentagon lawyers were pulled at the last minute Thursday from a briefing on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  As they emerged from the closed-door session, they railed on the administration for not being transparent and appearing to flout the law. The briefing came a day after  Democrats say they were shut out of another meeting  where administration officials shared information on the strikes with their Republican colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “Am I leaving satisfied? Absolutely not. And the last word that I gave to the admiral was, ‘I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in and the peril you are putting our troops in’,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts told reporters of the Thursday briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “What I heard here today was a tactical brief. I heard no strategy, no end game, no assessment of how they are going to end the flow of drugs into the United States, which needs to happen, by the way,” Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, who sits on the House Armed Services and the Intelligence committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Fuming at a separate press conference over his accusation that the White House  cut Democrats out  of a Wednesday briefing, Sen. Mark Warner had an even sharper take: “bullsh*t.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be blunt, what the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive, not only to our democracy, but downright dangerous for our national security,” Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in recent weeks has accelerated its attacks against boats they allege are involved in drug trafficking. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly criticized the administration for failing to provide them with enough information related to those strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has defended its information sharing with Congress, telling CNN earlier this week it has given  seven separate classified briefings  on the strikes to various committees. But the information that Pentagon officials have offered so far on those attacks during closed-door briefings has largely fueled more questions and concerns from Democrats about the administration’s legal justification for them – especially as only select Republicans have been allowed to see the classified legal opinion detailing that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats said the information provided to them Thursday fell short of what they needed to provide proper congressional checks on the president’s war powers.\n \n\n   \n  “I sit on the Armed Services and the Intelligence Committee. Our job is to oversee the use of lethal force by our military outside of the United States, and I’m walking away without an understanding of how and why they’re making an assessment that the use of lethal force is adequate here,” Crow said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California similarly said “the level of transparency was not OK” and added that “there’s nothing that we heard in there that changes my assessment that this is completely illegal, that it is unlawful and even if Congress authorized it, it would still be illegal because there are extrajudicial killings where we have no evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  The briefers, Jacobs said, only cited Article II as the legal justification for the strikes and said they didn’t know the identities of all of the individuals involved in them. They also told lawmakers that cocaine was the only narcotic targeted in the strikes so far and claimed it is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl,” according to the congresswoman. “It was not a satisfactory answer for most of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the Democratic ranking members, Republican chairmen of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees attended the meeting but declined to comment to reporters afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Mike Rogers, the Armed Services chairman, would only tell CNN he expects an additional briefing.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans defend need for bipartisan briefings\n \n\n   \n  Still, several Senate Republicans said Democrats should have been invited to Wednesday’s briefing on the Caribbean boat strikes, though they insisted their exclusion wasn’t malicious.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an unfortunate situation, and I wish it wouldn’t have happened this way. It did, but I’ve talked to a number of my colleagues already and told them that we still agree that this should be delivered on a bipartisan basis,” Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Rounds added that his understanding was that several GOP senators had requested a further briefing on the legality of the strikes, and other Republicans, including him, also asked to be included.\n \n\n   \n  “When I got into the meeting, I realized that there were people from a lot of different committees, but I couldn’t identify the group in particular, but there were no Democrats there,” he said. “And so afterwards, we went back and followed up. The White House called us and said, ‘Yeah, this was a separate meeting. It was asked for by one of your colleagues.’ We just happen to have also been invited to it, and that is consistent with what we saw.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Kevin Cramer agreed that his Democratic colleagues should have access to the same briefings as Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that any administration should leave out any party from a briefing of that level of importance. And I think their justification — you can argue it, and no doubt people will — but I don’t think that something of that importance shouldn’t be shared. Whether it’s legal justification or if there’s — if there are details about who are on these boats and what these boats are containing, you know, the tactics, I think all of that should be available to people who oversee the Pentagon,” Cramer said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats didn’t hide their their frustration with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally unprecedented in my 15 years of service in the United States Senate that intelligence briefings on a matter of this consequence would be held for one party alone,” said an angry Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes to this administration concealing the facts and worrying about the law.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/credit-scores-medical-debt-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:49:00Z","title":"Trump Team Takes Aim at State Laws Shielding Consumers’ Credit Scores from Medical Debt","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), issued new guidance claiming that federal law supersedes state laws preventing medical debt from appearing on credit reports, reversing a previous Biden-era policy that supported state-level protections.

Levey, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:49 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration took another step Tuesday to weaken protections for Americans with medical debt, issuing new guidance that threatens ongoing state efforts to keep that debt off consumers’ credit reports.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen states, including Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Maryland, New York, and most of New England, have enacted laws in recent years to keep medical debt from affecting consumers’ credit.\n \n\n   \n  And more states — including several in conservative regions of the Midwest and Mountain West —  have been considering  similar protections, spurred by bipartisan concerns that medical debt on a credit report can make it harder for people to get a home, a car, or a job.\n \n\n   \n  Nationwide,  about 100 million people  have some form of health care debt, with millions burdened by $10,000 or more in unpaid bills.\n \n\n   \n  But  in the new guidance , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau asserts that federal law bars states from restricting medical debts from credit reports, arguing that only the federal government has this authority.\n \n\n   \n  “Congress meant to occupy the field of consumer reporting and displace state laws,” the bureau concluded in an “interpretive rule” signed by Russell Vought, the White House budget director and acting head of the CFPB.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance, which offers a new interpretation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, reverses policies advanced under former President Joe Biden that sought to empower states to expand protections for people with medical debt.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s latest move will not immediately roll back existing state protections.\n \n\n   \n  But advocates for patients and consumers warn that the new guidance may stall progress elsewhere, just as millions of Americans are poised to lose federal aid that helps them buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The aid is tied up in the current budget showdown between congressional Republicans and Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “You’d be hard-pressed to find a crueler regulatory interpretation,” said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president for the Community Service Society of New York. The nonprofit has pushed for medical debt protections in that state.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Culp, who oversees state lobbying efforts by Blood Cancer United, formerly known as the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, warned that the Trump administration’s guidance could reverberate across the country. “This rule will have a chilling effect on states’ willingness to pass these critical patient protections,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The new CFPB guidance might spur more litigation challenging state restrictions on medical debt credit reporting.\n \n\n   \n  Trade groups representing credit reporting agencies and debt collectors went to court early this year challenging  regulations issued by the Biden administration  that would have removed medical debt from credit reports nationwide. They argued that the administration exceeded its authority in issuing the credit reporting restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  The federal restrictions would have helped an estimated 15 million people. But the Trump administration chose not to defend the new regulations, and a federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulations should be scrapped. They never went into effect.\n \n\n   \n  The Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit agencies and has argued that regulating medical debt should be left to the federal government, welcomed the new guidance from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “There should be one national standard to govern how information is provided to consumer reporting agencies and what information can appear on a consumer’s credit report,” association president Dan Smith said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Broader health insurance protections could prevent more Americans from sinking into debt and depressing their credit scores.\n \n\n   \n  But millions of Americans  are expected  to lose health coverage in the coming years as a result of the tax and spending bill signed by the president in July.\n \n\n   \n  “Millions of Americans are avoiding medical care, putting off needed surgeries, skipping essential treatments,” said Allison Sesso, president and chief executive of Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that buys up and retires patients’ debts and advocates for broader patient protections.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t just a health care issue,” Sesso added. “It’s an economic crisis that’s keeping families from building wealth and fully participating in the economy. When credit scores are dinged by medical bills, everyone loses.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/science/interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-sun","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:20:00Z","title":"Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS just made its closest pass of the sun.

Discover where it’s going next \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An interstellar comet that originated outside our solar system just made its closest pass of the sun, setting it on an outgoing path — but it’s not leaving our cosmic neighborhood yet.\n \n\n   \n  The comet, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, came within about   126 million miles (203 million kilometers) of our star, according to  EarthSky . The object is currently behind the sun from the perspective of ground-based telescopes on Earth, but astronomers anticipate being able to view the comet again in a few weeks, said Darryl Seligman, assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University.\n \n\n   \n  Stargazers using telescopes should be able to see the object in the predawn sky beginning November 11, according to EarthSky.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers will have a few more months to observe the comet before it begins heading   out of our solar system, Seligman said.\n \n\n   \n  The comet will make its closest approach of Earth on December 19, coming within about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) — but it poses no threat to our planet, according to the  European Space Agency .\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers have been observing the comet, only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, since its discovery on July 1.\n \n\n   \n  Each observation is shedding light on this interstellar object and how different it may be from comets that originated in our solar system.\n \n\n   \n    The ingredients of an interstellar comet\n \n\n   \n  Comets are like dirty snowballs left over from the formation of solar systems.\n \n\n   \n  A comet’s nucleus is its solid core, made of ice, dust and rocks. When comets travel near stars such as the sun, heat causes them to release gas and dust, which creates their signature tails.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers are interested in capturing as many observations of the comet as they can because as it nears the sun, material releasing from the object could reveal more about its composition — and the star system where it originated.\n \n\n   \n  “When it gets closest to the sun, you get the most holistic view of the nucleus possible,” Seligman said. “One of the main things driving most cometary scientists is, what is the composition of the volatiles? It shows you the initial primordial material that it formed from.”\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have used powerful tools, such as the Hubble Space and James Webb Space telescopes, along with a multitude of space-based missions, such as  SPHEREx , to study the comet.\n \n\n   \n  The SPHEREx and Webb observations detected carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide,  carbonyl sulphide  and water ice releasing from the comet as it neared the sun, according to the ESA.\n \n\n   \n  Preliminary estimates indicate that the interstellar comet is 3 billion   to 11 billion years old, according to a  study  coauthored by Seligman and Aster Taylor, a doctoral student and Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellow at the University of Michigan, in August. For reference, our solar system is estimated to be about 4.6 billion years old.\n \n\n   \n  Carbon dioxide turns directly from a solid into a gas in response to temperature changes much more easily than most elements — which means the comet has likely never been close to another star before its brush with the sun, Seligman said.\n \n\n   \n    All eyes on 3I/ATLAS\n \n\n   \n  The interstellar comet faded from the view of ground-based telescopes in October, but it remained in sight for missions such as  PUNCH , or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, and  SOHO , or the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. The object also made its closest approach of Mars on October 3, coming within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the red planet — and the spacecraft orbiting it.\n \n\n   \n  While the government shutdown has prevented data sharing from any NASA missions that have observed the comet since October 1, the ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter attempted to capture views of 3I/ATLAS in October.\n \n\n   \n  The cameras aboard those missions are designed to study the relatively close, bright surface of Mars, but ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter managed to observe the comet as a fuzzy white dot.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the orbiter’s camera, said in a statement, noting the comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times “fainter than our usual target.”\n \n\n   \n  ESA’s  Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer , or Juice, will also attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS in November using multiple instruments despite the comet being farther from the spacecraft than it was when observed by   the Mars orbiters. But astronomers don’t expect to receive the observations until February due to the rate at which the spacecraft is sending data back to Earth.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got several more months to observe it,” Seligman said. “And there’s going to be amazing science that comes out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/basketball-nba-nikola-topic-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:54:00Z","title":"Oklahoma City Thunder Guard Nikola Topic Diagnosed with Testicular Cancer and Undergoing Chemotherapy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Oklahoma City Thunder guard Nikola Topic has been diagnosed with testicular cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy.

30-room mansion in Windsor \n       \n  By Lianne Kolirin and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles has announced that his brother,  Andrew , will be stripped of his “ prince ” title and ordered to leave Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion that has been his home since 2003, over the swirling Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the sprawling property in Windsor Great Park, west of London, that is home to Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and where their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, spent much of their teenage years\n \n\n   \n    Why does Andrew live in Royal Lodge?\n \n\n   \n  The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, which is officially owned by the Crown Estate. The prince paid £1 million for the property in 2003, and under the terms of the 75-year lease, which was due to expire on June 15, 2078, he was expected to pay for any refurbishment work and the maintenance of the surrounding grounds.\n \n\n   \n  He was also required upfront to pay £7.5 million ($10 million) to cover necessary refurbishments that were completed in 2005, according to a  National Audit Office report.  According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent “if demanded” was only required to be “one peppercorn” per annum.\n \n\n   \n  The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener’s cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in.\n \n\n   \n  It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n \n\n   \n  There had been intense media speculation in recent weeks over Prince Andrew’s continued occupancy of Royal Lodge. Before Thursday’s announcement, Buckingham Palace and the Crown Estate had declined to comment on reports that he was in talks to leave the residence.\n \n\n   \n    Two centuries of royal residents\n \n\n   \n  A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. Its first links with the royal family came in the early 19th century when George IV, then the prince regent, converted the rustic-styled cottage into a hunting lodge and then private retreat. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a “grace and favor” residence for most of the rest of the century.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Chapel was added to the site in 1865, but, though situated within the grounds of the lodge, it does not come under the current lease.\n \n\n   \n  The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV’s original cottage.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents — then the Duke and Duchess of York — in 1932. The family remained at Royal Lodge until the duke and duchess were crowned four years later, following the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n  Following her husband’s death in 1952 and the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother used the Royal Lodge as her Windsor residence until her death in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  After his grandmother died, Prince Andrew approached the Crown Estate about acquiring the leasehold on the property. The property was not offered to the wider market because of its sensitive location in the heart of Windsor Great Park and the need for security, given its proximity to the Royal Chapel.\n \n\n   \n    What changes has Andrew made?\n \n\n   \n  The renovation work that Andrew carried out on the family property included internal alterations to the tiled ceiling, external repainting, new tarmac for the gate entrance and light fittings and cameras for outside the lodge, according to a planning application lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001.\n \n\n   \n    Queen Elizabeth’s fairy-tale playhouse\n \n\n   \n  Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as “little cottage.” The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children — as did their children and grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n  In a 2012 BBC documentary called “The Diamond Queen,” Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been “lucky enough” to play there together with their cousins as children.\n \n\n   \n  She described it as the “most glamorous Wendy house ever” and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a “bit of a spruce-up.”   \n \n\n   \n  Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.   \n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Eugenie’s sister, Beatrice, tied the knot on the estate itself, marrying Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a small ceremony in the chapel while Covid-19 restrictions were in place.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/africa/tanzania-election-protests-dar-es-salaam-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:54:00-04:00","title":"More protests in Dar es Salaam after chaotic Tanzanian election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a general election in Tanzania marked by the exclusion of major opposition candidates and accusations of government repression, protests erupted in Dar es Salaam and other cities.

\nUpdated: \n        3:43 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  2025 campaign trail  has become a popular stop for potential 2028 presidential hopefuls looking to help the Democratic Party’s candidates for governor.\n \n\n   \n  Pete Buttigieg joined Democratic nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey Thursday morning to criticize President Donald Trump’s threats to cancel a major commuter rail project connecting her state and New York City. In Virginia, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona appeared with the party’s nominee Abigail Spanberger to rally Latino voters before holding a similar event with Sherrill in her state this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg and Gallego’s appearances come as the off-year and midterm elections have turned into an early testing ground for 2028 presidential hopefuls – giving them a chance to sharpen their campaign skills outside of their home states and help elevate fellow Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the high-profile Democratic surrogate work has played out in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  But the New York City mayoral race has drawn the progressive star power of hometown Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ardent backer of Democratic nominee  Zohran Mamdani . And in California,  Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Prop 50 campaign  to push through mid-decade redistricting in his state has further propelled him into the national conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re thinking about future campaigns, it’s smart to have a strategy that’s not just about going to the primary states but also showing that you’re a team player in the Democratic Party and that your message can help turn voters out,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for the Democratic Governors Association.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Buttigieg, a former transportation secretary, touted his work with Sherrill to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel project, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City that Trump said he had “terminated” earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg described the move as “mob boss politics” and criticized Sherrill’s  Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli  for not having “the backbone” to push back on the president.\n \n\n   \n  “This state needs a governor who can think for herself, and someone who will put the best interest of the state first. And there’s only one candidate who will do that,” Buttigieg said at an event with Sherrill at a Westfield, NJ, train station.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg was slated later Thursday to help turn out voters in Red Bank and raise money for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. His appearances with Sherrill came one week after he headlined an event with Spanberger and Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of his stop with Sherrill this week, Buttigieg sent an e-mail to his fundraising list saying he was “back on the campaign trail” to help candidates across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Gallego, who has said the Democratic Party needs to do more to win back Latino voters, is tapped this week with taking that pitch to Latino communities in Virginia and New Jersey, a state where the  Latino vote could be key  to picking the next governor.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, all we want is to have a chance at the American Dream, to be able to build a family here, to have a chance to continue to grow this country and the beautiful vision that everyone has,” Gallego said Thursday at a “Latinos for Spanberger” event in Alexandria, Virginia. “And this is why we as Latinos have to come out and vote today and all the way until Tuesday, because the only way we get that dream is when we have friends that care about us.”\n \n\n   \n    Big names out on the campaign trail for Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Several sitting Democratic governors potentially eyeing higher office have descended on New Jersey and Virginia to give a boost to the women they hope will join their ranks next year. That includes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  “The big names you’re hearing in the Democratic Party are more and more governors,” said Leopold. “It’s especially helpful if you’re running for governor to have a governor campaign with you to show the executive experience and show what a governor can do.”\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker  has been a frequent surrogate for Sherrill in his home state. Other high-profile Democratic surrogates who have hit the campaign trail in New Jersey or Virginia this year include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; California Rep. Ro Khanna and former US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, who is now a CNN commentator.\n \n\n   \n  “These are the type of leaders that are focused on the everyday problems, the everyday concerns of Americans, and that can be the type of leaders that re-earn the faith of the American people,” Beshear, vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said of Sherrill and Spanberger during a virtual event with the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have helped raise money for the off-year candidates. Newsom, who has said he will make a  decision about 2028  after the midterms, participated in a virtual fundraiser with Sherrill for New Jersey’s Democratic campaigns and state committee, a source familiar with the event said. Meanwhile, Pritzker has donated six-figures across the New Jersey and Virginia races, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  While 2028 hopefuls on the Democratic side have eagerly stumped during this year’s off-year elections, the Republican side has not drawn as much attention from presidential aspirants.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz joined Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial nominee  Winsome Earle-Sears  last week for a fundraiser. New Jersey’s GOP gubernatorial nominee Ciattarelli has recently campaigned with Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor in Florida in 2026. Trump also held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli this month.\n \n\n   \n  Though New Jersey and Virginia have seen frequent visits from high-profile Democrats, the New York City mayoral race has not drawn as many national party figures to campaign on behalf of Mamdani, a democratic socialist.\n \n\n   \n  But  he has received a boost  from Ocasio-Cortez and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – both popular figures with the progressive base who are able to draw large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m talking to you, Donald Trump,” Ocasio-Cortez declared at a rally last weekend, saying that “we will work our hearts out to elect Zohran Kwame Mamdani as the next mayor of the great city of New York.”\n \n\n   \n  While each of these high-profile Democrats has taken a turn on the campaign stage, former President Barack Obama remains the party’s most sought-after surrogate. He’s taped ads for Sherrill and Spanberger and will campaign in-person for the two Democratic candidates in their states on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  But the Democratic party’s most recent leaders – former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden – have not appeared on this year’s campaign trail as Democrats still grapple with the fallout of last year’s election.\n \n\n   \n  Harris, who has left the door open to a possible run in 2028, sent a fundraising e-mail on behalf of Sherrill this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Again and again, Mikie has shown that she is not afraid of a tough fight, and that she will stand up to anyone who attacks the rights, freedoms, or livelihoods of the people she serves,” Harris wrote. “That is exactly the kind of leadership we need right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden has not made any campaign stops since leaving office but is scheduled to appear at a political event for the Nebraska Democratic Party three days after Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Biden was one of the Democratic Party’s most active surrogates for the midterm elections, stumping for candidates in places like Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. He launched his presidential campaign the following spring.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new crop of Democrats is trying to chart its own path to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the start, 2025,” said Leopold. “And you’re going to see a lot more of it in 2026.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/scream-stranger-things-trailers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:25:00Z","title":"'Scream 7' and 'Stranger Things 5' Trailers Drop on Halloween Eve","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Halloween Eve, 2025, trailers for 'Scream 7' and the final season of 'Stranger Things' were released, generating excitement among fans.

fight over SNAP food assistance money \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:46 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight over the Trump administration’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to help cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” US District Judge Indira Talwani said near the end of a hearing, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Though the judge’s options vary, one possibility is that she issues an emergency order that essentially compels the administration to tap into the emergency funds. While she indicated from the bench that she was likely to issue a ruling favorable to a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors who sued the administration earlier this week, she acknowledged that benefits, which should start being sent to recipients on November 1, will be delayed.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani said she would work quickly to issue her decision later Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps, a critical piece of the  nation’s safety net.  The program costs roughly $8.5 billion to $9 billion a month, while the contingency fund now has about $5.3 billion in it, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which is representing USDA in the case.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge orders the government to use the emergency funds, it will take time for the US Department of Agriculture and states to get their systems up and running again, which means at least some beneficiaries will likely have to wait for the November allotment.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also unclear whether recipients will receive their full November benefits since the USDA’s contingency fund does not have enough money to cover the entire payments without drawing from other resources. But the Trump administration has shifted money to fund other priorities during the shutdown, including transferring $300 million to keep the  WIC food assistance program  for pregnant women, new moms and young children afloat for October.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the discussion during Thursday’s hearing centered around the fact that the contingency fund contains far less than what is needed to fully cover November benefits for the millions of Americans who receive them. The judge said multiple times that federal law made clear that when the government is unable to pay benefits, it should reduce what it provides, not suspend the program altogether.\n \n\n   \n  “It does seem to me really clear what Congress was trying to do,” Talwani said. “What Congress was trying to do is protect the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger, Talwani added.\n \n\n   \n  A group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC,  sued the administration on Tuesday   over the US Department of Agriculture’s recent decision to not tap into the contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, USDA said that it was unable to use the rainy-day fund, reversing course from earlier agency guidance that said such a move was possible. In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene on an emergency basis to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  In the food stamps case, the attorneys general and governors argued the administration was violating federal law that requires the government to consistently fund the food stamps program and that its decision to not tap into the contingency fund ran afoul of federal rulemaking laws.\n \n\n   \n  “USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits,” they wrote in the lawsuit. “Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information – ranging from a week before the start of the month to the first day of the month – in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to acknowledging the likely delay in benefits, the judge on Thursday also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney for Massachusetts told Talwani that it would be up to the states to figure out how to reduce payments based on the available federal funds, but an attorney representing the Trump administration pushed back strongly on that idea.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department lawyer, Jason Altabet, said that while it was up to USDA officials to make decisions on reductions in benefit amounts, the agency was extremely concerned about the prospect of having to do that work.\n \n\n   \n    Changing positions\n \n\n   \n  In its shutdown contingency plan, which has since been taken offline, USDA indicated that the contingency fund can be used for benefits in case of a lapse. The plan noted that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue.”\n \n\n   \n  But on October 10, the agency began raising red flags, informing states that there is  not enough money  to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues and asking them to hold off on next month’s payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins doubled down on that position the following week, telling reporters that food stamps will run dry by the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  And last week, the USDA said it  will not tap into the fund , stating in a memo that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/ed-martin-doj-trump-political-prosecutions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00Z","title":"The Weapon of Justice: Ed Martin’s Influence at DOJ","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ed Martin, a former US Attorney for Washington, DC, has emerged as a powerful and politically active figure within the Trump Justice Department despite failing to secure Senate confirmation.

Unconfirmable and intent on rewriting the consequences of the January 6 prosecutions, Martin was, as one Trump ally said, being put under more “adult supervision.”\n \n\n   \n  That move, though, didn’t appear to hold him back. Martin now wields a surprising amount of political power and four titles: Associate Deputy Attorney General, Pardon Attorney, director of the Weaponization Working Group and Special Attorney for Mortgage Fraud. He’s also become the chief enforcer of using the Justice Department to exact President Donald Trump’s personal agenda — including by playing a role behind the scenes in the recent indictments of Trump foes  James Comey  and  Letitia James,  delving into so-called “weaponization” within the federal government and Biden-era pardons, and continuing to bear down on others Trump wants to see investigated.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Martin told the Republican-led House Oversight Committee that he was working on an “ongoing investigation” of pardons and commutations during Joe Biden’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, which adds fuel to Trump’s attacks of presidential clemency given to members of the House Select Committee that investigated January 6 and others before they faced charges, recasts the traditional role of a pardon attorney in the extreme. Previously the job focused on reviewing and making recommendations to the president after prisoners petitioned for clemency. Under Martin, it’s become a much more active, politicized approach, where he is now critiquing past presidents’ clemency, a Constitutional power that has few limitations.\n \n\n   \n  “My ongoing investigation has revealed abuses of the pardon and commutation process by political actors in the Biden Administration. The use of AutoPen at the direction of staff and perhaps others is troubling,” Martin wrote to committee chairman James Comer, according to an email to obtained by CNN’s Jake Tapper. The Justice Department has previously said a president’s use of an autopen is legally sound.\n \n\n   \n  Martin’s influence also has become evident in cases where career prosecutors have balked at charging Trump political opponents and which his bosses, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, had reservations about before bringing.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, prosecutions of Comey and  James  have moved ahead over the protests of career prosecutors and even some Trump political appointees. Firings and resignations by experienced prosecutors have followed, and Martin has been in close contact with  Lindsey Halligan , whom Trump placed as the lead US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, who initiated those indictments, sources tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, Martin has turned his focus toward building his connections to other US Attorneys’ Offices, including in Atlanta, St. Louis and upstate New York, according to sources familiar with Martin’s efforts. Some of that effort may include known probes around Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor whom Trump has tried to fire, on mortgage fraud allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Ed Martin is one of the most dangerous people in the Justice Department. He’s not a serious lawyer, but he has serious power,” said Liz Oyer, a former career Justice Department official who preceded Martin as pardon attorney. “He seemingly has the power to open criminal investigations, which is serious business. Being subject to a criminal investigation can ruin someone’s life.”\n \n\n   \n  Oyer noted that investigating Trump’s political opponents and holding the pardon post gives Martin especially unusual influence — as a political force who can both punish Trump’s enemies and reward his friends.\n \n\n   \n  His willingness to use the Justice Department to advance MAGA movement politics stands in contrast with the Justice Department norms since the Richard Nixon era. Reforms after the Watergate crisis led to a tradition under Republican and Democratic administrations to distance prosecution decisions from the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the first Trump administration, attorneys general generally enforced rules limiting contact between White House officials and Justice Department employees.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has no such qualms and is known to maintain regular contact with White House officials, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A Missouri Republican, Martin burnished his MAGA credentials following the 2021 Capital attack, becoming a vocal defender of Trump vote fraud claims in the 2020 election and of January 6 rioters — some of whom he represented as an attorney.\n \n\n   \n  As part of his so-called weaponization probe, Martin brought onto his staff former FBI agent Jared Wise, who was prosecuted for allegedly urging January 6 rioters to attack law enforcement officers, calling the officers “Nazis” and the “Gestapo.”\n \n\n   \n  Martin maintains at least two offices at the Justice Department – one in a complex north of the US Capitol where the pardon attorney office is located, the other inside the Justice Department headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  His active social media presence including a Substack blog and his support for January 6 rioters caused wary Senate Republicans to tank his nomination to lead the federal prosecutors’ office in Washington, DC, which prosecuted more than 1,000 January 6 riot defendants, in May.\n \n\n   \n  But Martin appears undaunted despite receiving cautions from top Justice officials about some of his public comments.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Martin has been posting nearly every day on social media photos of people he meets with, including right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the comedian Russel Brand, US Attorneys from outside of DC, and Trump supporters in politics from around the country.\n \n\n   \n  He also has been lobbying prosecutors in Maryland to pursue mortgage fraud allegations around Democratic California Sen.  Adam Schiff,  another one of Trump’s political opponents, who helped lead congressional investigations of him, sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department and Martin didn’t comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Martin sought to flex his influence earlier this month as former New York Rep. George Santos won a sentence commutation from the president, after serving in a minimal-security federal prison camp only three months of his seven-year sentence for fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Santos for months had sought the help of intermediaries to get Trump’s attention for a pardon and Martin tried to help behind the scenes, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  After the president granted the commutation, Martin said in a post on X: “I was honored as U.S. Pardon Attorney to have played a small role” in the clemency grant, and he thanks the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  “Martin has made it known that his intent with pardons is to use them to benefit people with MAGA affiliations,” Oyer said. “For Martin to have both of those roles,” of pardon attorney and prosecutor, “it shows how this department is operating a system of both punishment and reward.”\n \n\n   \n    Catching Trump’s attention\n \n\n   \n  Some of Martin’s recent campaigns have been channeled into the president’s own social media feed. For instance, with Martin as the mortgage fraud investigator, Trump lashed out at Bondi, demanding in a  remarkable Truth Social  post for the prosecution of his political enemies.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Blanche has sought to bring a measure of control to Martin’s efforts, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The tension between Blanche and Martin spilled out into the public in late September, after Martin sent a letter to an FBI agent who had responded to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Martin, in his letter, disclosed what he said was an investigation of the agent, after the agent had testified about being smeared in a conspiracy theory pushed by Jones, who gained notoriety with claims that the Sand Hook attack was staged by the FBI. The agent was awarded nearly $100 million in a case against Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Jones made Martin’s letter public, demanding responses from the FBI agent, until Blanche demanded Martin retract his requests.\n \n\n   \n  Martin then wrote to the agent’s lawyer, “I write to inform you that there is no investigation of you or your client. Because of this, I hereby withdraw my request for information from you or your former client.”\n \n\n   \n    An ally in Virginia\n \n\n   \n  But Martin’s power has accrued alongside the arrival of another former Trump adviser, Halligan, who Trump installed to run the powerful US Attorney’s Office in Alexandria, Virginia, in late September.\n \n\n   \n  While career prosecutors and top Justice officials viewed cases against Comey and James to be duds, Halligan managed to deliver the two indictments Trump publicly called for.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan replaced Erik Seibert after attorneys in the office objected to charging Comey with lying to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Both Comey and James have pleaded not guilty and are challenging the prosecutors’ handling of the cases.\n \n\n   \n  In the James investigation before she was charged, Martin took several steps that fall outside the norms of prosecutorial conduct.\n \n\n   \n  Martin this summer sent a letter to James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, suggesting that James should resign as attorney general. And he paid a visit to James’ Brooklyn  home  in August, posing for photos outside it wearing a long trench coat, accompanied by an assistant who acts as an unofficial spokesperson, unusual for a person in Martin’s position to have at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to go to the very bottom of the facts, and if somebody did something wrong, we’re not only going to hold them accountable. We’re also going to look at everything else that they’ve been doing. Because when you’re a liar, you lie not just on one thing,” Martin said on Fox News in August when asked about the mortgage investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Some senior DOJ officials were frustrated by the stunt, one source said, as they had no idea Martin would be traveling to New York.\n \n\n   \n    Attention in Maryland\n \n\n   \n  Apparently emboldened by the charging successes in Virginia, Martin’s fast-moving advocacy turned in recent weeks to Maryland’s US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The office’s US Attorney Kelly Hayes, a respected career prosecutor who worked for years out of Greenbelt, recently secured the indictment of former Trump national security adviser  John Bolton , another Trump political foe. Prosecutors accuse Bolton of keeping national security secrets in unsecured personal accounts and on printed paper after he left the government.\n \n\n   \n  Hayes’ approach, and the Bolton case itself, are viewed more seriously than the indictments and investigations of other political figures who have faced charges at Trump’s urging, several sources familiar with the case and the office have told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But the Maryland office still has a prosecutor looking into the financial records of Schiff, another Trump target, and Martin continues to push Hayes to bring an indictment against him.\n \n\n   \n  Last week after it became known Hayes’ team had doubts about the case, sources said the investigation was continuing and the Deputy Attorney General’s office may be working with Hayes, in a vote of confidence for the US Attorney in a precarious moment.\n \n\n   \n  Yet because of Martin’s pushes for prosecution in Maryland and Virginia, the districts are now buzzing with speculation Martin could end up as a prosecutor in one of the offices.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-7-500-refugees-limit-white-south-africans","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:54:00-04:00","title":"Trump sets 7,500 annual limit for refugees entering US.

forces a radical rethink of T. rex remains \n       \n  By Katie Hunt, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:03 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A legendary fossil housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh features skeletons apparently locked in prehistoric combat — an epic meeting of two of the world’s favorite dinosaurs: Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex. Or so paleontologists thought.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers who spent the past five years studying the stunning collection of bones called the “dueling dinosaurs” say they have uncovered a case of mistaken identity, determining that the small-bodied dinosaur was not a juvenile T. Rex but rather a fully grown example of a hotly debated species known as Nanotyrannus lancensis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have the growth record preserved in the microstructure of the bone, which shows that it’s an adult,” said James Napoli, a vertebrate paleontologist at Stony Brook University and coauthor of the new study published Thursday  in the journal Nature.  The discovery has triggered a rethink of many other fossils previously identified as teenage T. rex remains, Napoli added.\n \n\n   \n  While similar in appearance, the two dinosaur species would have been very different: Nanotyrannus was 18 feet long, agile and built for speed, with long legs and strong arms to grasp prey, while 42-foot-long T. rex had stocky legs and used its devastating bite to devour huge, slow-moving dinos.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its relatively diminutive size, Napoli said that Nanotyrannus had larger upper limbs than a fully grown T. rex, which had famously tiny arms. “Bones don’t shrink when animals grow so this could not have possibly become an (adult) T. rex,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The finding “flips decades of T. rex research on its head,” according to study coauthor Lindsay Zanno, associate research professor at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.\n \n\n   \n  “A wealth of studies on the biology of T. rex over the past three decades have unknowingly mixed data from Nanotyrannus with that of T. rex. Those studies need to be reevaluated in light of this discovery,” Zanno said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The dueling dinosaurs  fossil was first discovered 2006 , exposed as sedimentary rock eroded from the Hell Creek Formation, which dates back 65.5 million years and stretches across parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n    Mistaken identity\n \n\n   \n  Nanotyrannus lancensis, which like T. rex is part of the larger tyrannosaurid family in taxonomic classification, was first identified from a fossil unearthed in the 1940s from the same rock formation as the dueling dinosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  However, scientists later shifted the narrative and interpreted that initial find and many other small Tyrannosaur fossils uncovered in the following decades to be juvenile T. rex specimens. The idea that another species might have produced the fossils fell out of favor, though the possibility was still debated at scientific conferences and other forums.\n \n\n   \n  The new research, which examined and compared over 200 Tyrannosaur fossils, suggests that juvenile T. rex fossils were not as common in the fossil record as paleontologists previously thought. For years, the study authors reported, paleontologists have misidentified Nanotyrannus fossils as juvenile T. rex specimens and used the morphological features of the remains to  model T. rex growth and behavior .\n \n\n   \n  “What’s exciting is that this discovery opens the door to a whole series of new questions about how these different predators — one built for brute strength and one built for speed — interacted in the twilight of the dinosaurs,” Zanno said.\n \n\n   \n  The study authors said they also had identified a fossil called “Jane” as a  second species of Nanotyrannus , which they dubbed Nanotyrannus lethaeus. The name is a reference to the River Lethe, the river of forgetfulness in Greek mythology, a nod to how this dinosaur remained hidden in plain sight and “forgotten” for decades.\n \n\n   \n    Uncomfortable questions\n \n\n   \n  The finding raises “uncomfortable” questions about why a scientific consensus came together so quickly around the idea that all Nanotyrannus specimens are juvenile T. rexes, said Larry Witmer, Chang Ying-Chien Professor of Paleontology at Ohio University. Witmer didn’t take part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Many T. rex fossils, which can sell for  tens of millions of dollars at auction , were commercially collected and are in private hands, making them difficult to study, he noted in a commentary published alongside the research.\n \n\n   \n  “This exceptionally researched study by Zanno and Napoli puts Nanotyrannus on a solid foundation,” Witmer said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the implications of the findings go beyond settling a scientific disagreement.\n \n\n   \n  “There is much more at stake here than declaring a victor in the debate, because there are literally decades of research and probably hundreds of publications based on a premise that this article overturns,” he said. “These analyses will all need revision.”\n \n\n   \n  Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology at the University of Edinburgh said the finding should prompt “a fundamental reassessment of tyrannosaur classification and evolution.”\n \n\n   \n  “For many years in my research on tyrannosaurs, I’ve considered a set of smaller skeletons found in the same rocks as the famous skeletons of huge T. rexes to be juveniles of T. rex rather than a distinctive smaller species,” Brusatte, who wasn’t involved with the new study, explained.\n \n\n   \n  “Reading this new paper, I think new evidence from this exquisite new specimen in the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences shows that I was wrong — at least in part,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  However, not every smaller tyrannosaur skeleton should be classified as Nanotyrannus, according to Brusatte. “T. rex was the size of a bus as an adult, and bones of adult T. rexes are very common across western North America, from Saskatchewan down to New Mexico,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of these must be juvenile T. rexes, and I think it is ultimately going to be very hard to tell apart adult or near-adult Nanotyrannus from teenage T. rex, as they were probably both very similar in size, and in their skeletal features,” he noted. “That will be the challenge for future paleontologists.”\n \n\n   \n  The evidence presented in the study that the smaller animal in the dueling dinosaurs fossil is in fact Nanotyrannus is “pretty conclusive,” according to Thomas Carr, a senior scientific advisor at the Dinosaur Discovery Museum and an associate professor of biology at Carthage College. However, fresh fossils are needed to understand the differences between Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named species of Nanotyrannus lethaeus, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Carr also said he isn’t sure about whether the fossil “Jane” should be reclassified as Nanotyrannus lethaeus, as the new research suggests. “They’ve done strong work, but we must be cautious,” said Carr, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Napoli said dueling dinosaurs, which is still partially encased in rock, has many more secrets to spill. Scientists still don’t know how the two animals died — or why they were found entangled. But the Nanotyrannus specimen is 100% complete, which is extraordinarily rare in the fossil record, Napoli noted.\n \n\n   \n  “There are some bones that are partially broken with a piece missing, but every individual bone is represented to some degree,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers hope skin or feathers might also be preserved in the sediment surrounding the remains and that there are injuries on the specimen, such as a broken finger, they haven’t yet explored.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a tremendous amount of science to do on the dueling dinosaurs,” Napoli said. “It’s an amazing fossil to work on.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/cte-gene-damage-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:18:00Z","title":"Hidden genetic damage is part of CTE, too, study finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in Science reveals that chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease linked to repeated head trauma in contact sports and military service, involves significant hidden genetic damage in brain cells—damage resembling that seen in Alzheimer’s disease.

study finds \n       \n  By Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:18 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The neurologic disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE has most often been found in people who experienced repeated blows to the head while playing contact sports and there’s now  evidence  of genetic damage inside the brain, too.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers examined the brains of football players and others with the  rare neurological disease , and the genetic damage they found looks similar to what they see in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. The damage was so extensive that it was the equivalent of hundreds of years of aging.\n \n\n   \n  CTE typically develops years after someone has received repeated blows to the head. Symptoms can include memory loss, impulse control problems, anxiety, depression and anger issues. It’s most often seen in people who play sports like football, hockey and soccer, but it’s also been detected in the brains of soldiers who have been injured in explosions and in some people who experienced domestic violence.\n \n\n   \n  The disease was first identified nearly 100 years ago in boxers – at the time, scientists called it  “punch-drunk syndrome”  – but there’s still much that experts don’t know about CTE. Not everyone with repeated head trauma develops the condition, and scientists don’t totally understand why or even how head trauma can lead to this disease.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Chris Walsh, co-author of the  study published Thursday  in the journal Science, says there are still people who deny that CTE is even a disease. The latest research, he said, should change naysayers’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel like this study helps establish that CTE is something distinct from just repetitive head trauma. It represents a more gradually developing pathological process and is a well-defined entity,” said Walsh, who is chief of the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Children’s Hospital and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.” We suspect it involves immune activation in a way similar to Alzheimer’s disease.”\n \n\n   \n  At this point, scientists don’t have a simple blood test or scan that can detect CTE   in a living person. The only way to make  a definitive diagnosis  is to take thin slices of the brain after the person’s death and use a microscope to look for an abnormal accumulation of tau, a protein that stabilizes certain elements of the brain. Too much tau can damage blood vessels and brain cells, and this buildup is also a hallmark   of Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  The brain is made up of a mosaic of cells that each have their own genome. Every time a stem cell divides, it accumulates mutations. The new study used sequencing and amplification technology only recently made available to look at the genes of single cells in hundreds of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain used for decision-making and other thinking skills.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers compared the results from four groups: 15 people who had repeated hits to the brain and were diagnosed with CTE; four people who had repeated head injuries but hadn’t developed CTE; 19 people without a history of head injuries or signs of CTE; and seven people who had Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  Among the people with CTE, the cells showed genomic damage that looked similar to the brains of people who had Alzheimer’s. The people who had repeated brain trauma but were not diagnosed with CTE did not have the same kind of damage.\n \n\n   \n  “Cells carry a bar code of their whole developmental history, including reflecting environmental influences, and that’s what’s happening in CTE,” Walsh explained. “The abnormal environment created by the repeated trauma damages the genomes of the cells.”\n \n\n   \n  With better understanding of the mechanisms that cause CTE, Walsh hopes the work can eventually lead to developing treatments. Because brain damage with CTE looks similar to Alzheimers, it may even be possible to use therapies for CTE patients that helped people with Alzheimer’s, but much more research will be needed before that could happen.\n \n\n   \n  The new study builds on recent research indicating that brain damage from repeated blows to the head can show up much earlier than the excessive tau markers that are seen with CTE become clear.\n \n\n   \n  A  2023 study  showed that the brain’s immune cells were increasingly activated in proportion to the number of years an athlete played contact sports, suggesting that early cellular damage may be setting the stage for the disease to progress.\n \n\n   \n  A  2020 study  also found that the risk of CTE doubles for every 2.6 years spent playing football. The condition has been reported in people as young as 17, meaning by the time a football player goes pro, they have experienced hundreds of thousands of hits to the head, and that damage seems to be adding up.\n \n\n   \n  The NFL has implemented several rule and equipment changes to reduce the number of head injuries, and the number of concussions has declined, with data from the  2024 season  showing the lowest number of concussions since tracking began in 2015.   Other sports leagues including the NHL, MLS and the English Premier League have also made changes to reduce the number of concussions among their playeres.\n \n\n   \n  But experts say it’s not just concussions that are the problem; any hit to the head can cause damage. Some suggest that if children really want to play football, their parents might skip early leagues, which can start as early as age 5, and instead wait until children turn 14 or 18 to let them play tackle football. The American Youth Soccer Organization doesn’t recommend heading the ball before the age of 10, and coaches are not encouraged to teach or practice heading at early ages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:26:00-04:00","title":"Teacher Shot by 6-Year-Old Student Testifies in $40 Million Lawsuit Against Former Assistant Principal","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A first-grade teacher, Abby Zwerner, was shot by a 6-year-old student at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, on January 6, 2023.

I thought I had died,” Abby Zwerner said Thursday, shortly before her attorneys rested their case, recounting the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner raised her hand instinctively as she realized what the student was going to do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The look on the student’s face is the large memory that I have,” Zwerner said Thursday. “It was like a very blank look, but it wasn’t a blank look at all.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN All Access has live coverage of teacher shot by student trial \n \n\n   \n  One of Zwerner’s last memories at the school the day she was shot, she said, was thinking, “I was on my way to heaven or in heaven.”\n \n\n   \n  “My next memory is I see two coworkers around me,” Zwerner said. “I process that I’m hurt, and they’re putting pressure on where I’m hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million lawsuit against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial offers a peek inside some of the key details that will be presented during the criminal case next month against Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect.\n \n\n   \n  Filing charges against school officials in the aftermath of a school shooting is rare, a law professor at the University of Virginia told CNN, and this case could set a precedent for future events as US communities grapple with questions of responsibility after a school is scarred by gun violence.\n \n\n   \n  It remains an increasingly pervasive problem: As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States so far this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n    Official ignored warning signs, lawsuit alleges\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner described the consequences of the physical trauma wrought by the shooting. Because of her injury, which prompted multiple surgeries, Zwerner is unable to fully use her left hand to this day, she said. \n \n\n   \n  “Overall, I would say I do struggle with things, doing things,” she said, like opening a bag of chips and water bottles. \n \n\n   \n  She also testified to lingering emotional trauma such as being afraid to go out in public with her mother and sister and feeling distant from friends. \n \n\n   \n  “I just want to stay home,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The  lawsuit alleges  Parker ignored concerns raised by several teachers and staff members, including that the student may have had a gun in his possession hours before the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Parker is accused of ignoring “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and that the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  A guidance counselor and administrator at the school said Parker also “forbade” teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his mother would pick him up soon, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was required to be accompanied by a parent at school “because of his violent tendencies.” But the day of the shooting, school administrators “allowed him to remain unaccompanied,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  During the previous school year, the boy strangled and choked a teacher and pulled up a female classmate’s dress and touched her inappropriately on the school playground, the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led up to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment. On Thursday, during cross-examination, an attorney for Parker worked to undercut Zwerner’s claims about the shooting, limiting her willingness to go out in public.   \n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had attended concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until after her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal was reassigned to another school. The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.\n \n\n   \n    Teacher’s witnesses describe emotional toll\n \n\n   \n  The third day of testimony began with Zwerner’s attorneys calling to the stand a psychiatrist who testified Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner had overcome mental stressors in the past, Dr. Clarence Watson testified, like when she had a heavy workload in college or soon after her father’s sudden death. But the shooting was “like throwing gasoline on top of the fire,” causing her recurring nightmares.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Zwerner wiped away tears as her twin sister reflected Wednesday on the   changes she’s seen in Zwerner since the first-grade teacher was shot by her 6-year-old student more than two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner told the court, saying the shooting dimmed a sister who used to be a bright light.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot to be excited about. And she doesn’t anymore.”\n \n\n   \n    Injuries were devastating\n \n\n   \n  The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.\n \n\n   \n  After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.\n \n\n   \n  A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.\n \n\n   \n    School official is only defendant\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit. A judge previously dismissed the others, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  The student’s mother was  sentenced  to a total of nearly four years in prison for    child neglect and federal weapons charges.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was  not charged  with any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother  previously told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  However, prosecutors  later said  authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock. The boy stood on a dresser drawer and took the gun from his mother’s purse.  ﻿ He then brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s mother had no criminal record and cooperated with authorities since the shooting. She  turned herself in  to police after state charges were filed  against her and was released after posting a $5,000 bond.\n \n\n   \n    Case could set precedent\n \n\n   \n  Because attempts to hold school officials criminally accountable for school shootings are rare, this case could set a precedent, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The closest thing to something like the case against Parker is when charges were filed against the deputy who stayed outside during the mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, he said. The deputy in that case  was acquitted  on all counts against him in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  As of October 26, there have been  356 mass shootings  in the US this year, leaving  at least 300 people dead  and 1,600 injured,  according to  data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one that injured or killed four or more people.\n \n\n   \n  Charging school officials for neglect appears to be an “emerging strategy,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to be kind of the only strategy left that we can put responsibility on the people who provide access to guns, at least to children, at least to school children and children under 16 or 18,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the civil trial could be a “dry run” for what’s to come in the criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone on both sides the prosecution and the defense should have a very clear idea of what the evidence is going to be and what the witnesses are going to say,” the professor said.\n \n\n   \n  The cases could end up setting “a very big” precedent and lead to school officials more aware of their duties to act on any information they have about a child with a gun or who poses a danger to students and staff, Brown said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-global-tariffs-senate-rebuke","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:16:00-04:00","title":"Senate Republicans Rebuke Trump for a Third Time This Week, Voting with Democrats Against President’s Global Tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant political development, four Senate Republicans — Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, and Mitch McConnell — joined Democrats in voting against President Donald Trump’s global tariffs by supporting a resolution to terminate emergency declarations used under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Senate on Thursday passed a resolution aimed at ending President Donald Trump’s  global tariffs  introduced last spring, with four Senate Republicans joining Democrats to object to the president’s trade policy.\n \n\n   \n  For a third time in as many days, Sens. Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and Mitch McConnell, the former GOP leader, crossed the aisle to advance the measure in a 51 to 47 vote. All four voted for separate resolutions earlier in the week targeting Trump’s tariffs on  Canada   and  Brazil .\n \n\n   \n  The resolutions seek to end the tariffs by terminating emergency declarations from the president.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, the week’s tariff votes amount to symbolic rebukes of the president’s trade policy, as they aren’t expected to be taken up by the House. Earlier this year, House Republicans moved to block members from being able to force a vote in the near future on the president’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Paul was a co-sponsor of the resolution and McConnell pledged that he would vote for all three of the resolutions. “Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive. The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Tim Kaine, one of the sponsors of this resolution, as well as the other two that passed earlier this week, said earlier in the week that the president’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was not appropriate.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m against tariffs generally, unless they’re used very specifically. But I’m also against letting presidents just invent a reason to use emergency powers to do all kinds of things without coming to Congress,” he told reporters Tuesday, comparing congressional oversight of the executive to a muscle that has to be exercised regularly.\n \n\n   \n  The Virginia Democrat has acknowledged the House will not take up his resolution, and that they don’t have a veto-proof majority backing the measure in the Senate. But he has insisted that adopting anti-tariff resolutions will still send a strong message to the president.\n \n\n   \n  “I did learn in the, in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,” Kaine said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/federal-judge-blocks-asylum-application-fee","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:10:00-04:00","title":"Federal Judge Halts Asylum Application Fee","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Maryland, Stephanie Gallagher, has temporarily halted the enforcement of a new $100 annual asylum application fee introduced under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, citing confusion and conflicting guidance from two federal immigration agencies—USCIS and EOIR.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge in Maryland on Thursday temporarily paused the government’s rollout of a new annual asylum application fee, citing confusion and inconsistent policies between federal agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Stephanie Gallagher said two agencies, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Executive Office for Immigration Review, acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” by issuing conflicting guidance on how and when asylum seekers must pay the $100 annual fee created under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n \n\n   \n  Gallagher found that the lack of coordination between the two agencies had caused “significant confusion” and even led to some asylum seekers being ordered removed before any mechanism to pay the fee existed. She temporarily stayed both agencies’ policies, blocking enforcement of the annual fee nationwide, until they issue clear, uniform guidance.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants have not resolved the inconsistency between the two agencies’ policies,” Gallagher wrote, adding that the government’s conflicting rules created “irreparable harm” for asylum applicants.\n \n\n   \n  The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP) filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maryland accusing the government of unlawfully applying a new annual asylum fee to people who filed their cases before the law took effect.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed on July 4, asylum applicants are required to pay the $100 fee each year their case remains pending.\n \n\n   \n  Previous to the legislation, there was no fee required when applying for asylum.\n \n\n   \n  The US Citizenship and Immigration Services began sending notices of the new fee on October 1, giving applicants a 30-day window to pay the fee —meaning the fee will start being due as early as October 31.\n \n\n   \n  ASAP says the rollout has caused panic and confusion among asylum seekers. One member, a man from Russia who applied in 2022, told the group he’s been “very worried” because he hasn’t received any instructions from the government on how or when to pay, according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, some applicants do not have the financial means to pay the fee, plaintiffs say.\n \n\n   \n  “They would have to choose between feeding their families or paying the fee,” Susan Pelletier, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said during Tuesday’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit includes stories of people who say they’ve been impacted by the fees. A woman from Honduras says she fears she’ll face deportation over a fee she can’t afford and has no way to pay.\n \n\n   \n  Another asylum seeker from Nigeria says he only learned about the new rule from social media and worries missing a payment could jeopardize his case.\n \n\n   \n  In response to ASAP’s lawsuit, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, has established a payment portal that allows asylum seekers to pay the annual asylum fee.\n \n\n   \n  EOIR has also stated that it will provide notice to individuals who are subject to the new annual fee and credit any payments made through other existing systems.\n \n\n   \n  ASAP argues that USCIS and EOIR are retroactively applying the new annual asylum fee and providing contradictory information — and even set conflicting deadlines. In at least one case, the lawsuit says an immigration judge rejected an asylum application and ordered a removal for nonpayment, despite there being no mechanism to pay the fee at the time.\n \n\n   \n  During a hearing on Tuesday, Gallagher, an Obama appointee, pressed Department of Justice attorney Zareen Iqbal on whether the asylum application fee was being applied retroactively. Gallagher also noted that many applicants have already been waiting years for a decision on their cases.\n \n\n   \n  Iqbal responded that the policy was not being applied retroactively, explaining that it was intended to help address the high volume of asylum cases that have been pending for years. She compared the fee to a property tax — a recurring payment meant to sustain the system rather than penalize past applicants.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department acknowledged that some applicants have faced difficulties following the announcement of the new fee. Iqbal told the court she would reach out to the plaintiffs and USCIS to help resolve the issue.\n \n\n   \n  The judge on Thursday said she would quickly entertain a motion to lift the stay on the fee once agencies enacted “uniform policies providing asylum applicants with fair notice of the applicable fee deadline, the mechanism for payment, and the adverse consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/economy/xi-trump-trade-deal-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-04:00","title":"A Trump-Xi trade deal won’t fix either country’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes a recent trade agreement between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which includes a 10% reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports and China’s promise to delay rare earth export controls and increase soybean purchases.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The extraordinary trade war President Donald Trump unleashed has been taking a toll on the Chinese and American economies. China is in a far more precarious state, mostly due to preexisting problems, but  the new trade agreement  is unlikely to move the dial much for either of the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  On the surface, the headlines coming out of the historic meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggest a big victory for both sides. The agreement calls for the United States to lower tariffs on China by 10%, bringing the effective rate on Chinese exports down to 47%; and for China to delay export controls on rare earths and increase purchases of American soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  Such measures might alleviate some of the pain businesses and consumers have felt since Trump returned to office. However, it’s going to take a lot more to address the wounds that have been festering.\n \n\n   \n    Too little, too late?\n \n\n   \n  For one particular part of the American economy that’s been hurting the most from the resurgent trade war with China, the agreement may be coming too late.\n \n\n   \n  American soybean farmers  have been reeling  from China’s effective embargo on the commodity that began in May, when higher tariffs went into place. Up until this week, China hadn’t purchased any American soybeans, the top agricultural export for the US. China has historically been the largest export market for American soybeans, so the embargo has significantly depressed American soybean prices for the past few months.\n \n\n   \n  And even though Trump said China will buy “tremendous amounts” of soybeans, with  peak harvest season already in full swing , many US farmers may have already sold crop yields at lower prices.\n \n\n   \n    No quick fix in sight for the US job market\n \n\n   \n  Trump inherited a labor market that was already weakening, and the latest data shows that hiring  slowed to a crawl in recent months .\n \n\n   \n  His aggressive and unpredictable tariffs have only exacerbated that, as businesses have become hesitant to hire more workers due to uncertainty. Increasingly, US companies are now laying off workers, too. For the first time in years, there are more people unemployed than jobs available, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  Advances in artificial intelligence are also playing in to some layoffs, as highlighted by  Amazon’s massive job cuts  this week. And while rate cuts have traditionally been the Federal Reserve’s primary tool to support the labor market, central bankers say AI may already have caused systemic damage that can’t be fixed through monetary policy.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Christopher Waller noted in recent remarks that even over a longer horizon, “if AI constitutes a structural shift in the demand for labor, monetary policy will not be an effective tool.”\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, there are growing concerns that lower rates could do more harm than good, pushing up inflation at a time when goods and services are already  more expensive . Some of that inflation is attributable to higher tariffs, and some is from tighter immigration controls that have cut back on the supply of workers in areas like child care and farming.\n \n\n   \n    China’s cocktail of economic woes\n \n\n   \n  For China, while its exports have shown remarkable resilience this year in the face of Trump’s global tariff offensive, its longstanding domestic economic woes have persisted to the point where there are even fewer immediate benefits of a trade deal compared to the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Chief among the factors clouding China’s economic outlook are a prolonged property downturn, persisting deflation, dampened consumer confidence and high youth unemployment.\n \n\n   \n  “Beyond a cyclical impulse, it’s hard to see today’s revised trade terms as materially shifting China’s more structural challenges at home, where we think tariffs are, if anything, fading in macro relevance,” Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at research firm Oxford Economics, said in a note on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the fentanyl-related tariff reduction as part of the Thursday deal could at best add a “marginal” 0.2% upside to China’s growth forecast next year.\n \n\n   \n  Recent economic data from China continues to paint a gloomy picture. In September, the decline in China’s factory-gate prices, a gauge of deflation, extended into the 36th straight month, though the drop has narrowed following Beijing’s attempt in recent months to rein in price competition in certain sectors. China’s much-touted electric vehicle industry, for example, has been embroiled in a relentless race to the bottom, partly due to excess capacity.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also not helping that consumer demand is on the decline, as evidenced by the pace of retail sales slowing to a 10-month low at 3% in September compared with a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the mix of challenges, China’s new home prices sank in September at their fastest pace in 11 months, despite traditionally being a peak season for property spending. The protracted slump, which  began with developers’ debt defaults in 2021 , is expected to continue weighing on consumer sentiment.\n \n\n   \n    Not a done deal\n \n\n   \n  The agreement Trump and Xi reached Thursday can merely be thought of as a rough draft — nothing has been signed. It’ll likely take several more meetings between American and Chinese counterparts to nail down a firmer agreement that eventually becomes a signed deal. Or it may not even get to that point at all.\n \n\n   \n  For now, though, both economies can take some solace in the fact that Trump’s threat of an additional 100% tariff on Chinese exports, which Beijing almost certainly would have retaliated against, is off the table.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/sudan-massacres-rsf-rebels-darfur-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:17:00-14:00","title":"Rebels Accused of Massacring Hundreds in Sudanese City as Videos and Satellite Evidence Surface","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, videos and satellite imagery have revealed mass atrocities committed by the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in El Fasher, a city in Sudan’s Darfur region.

city \n       \n  By Ivana Kottasová, Vasco Cotovio, Nada Bashir, Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:17 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  took over the city  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”\n \n\n   \n  Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.\n \n\n   \n  Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s  withdrawal from El Fasher  earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.\n \n\n   \n  RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration,  accused the RSF of committing genocide  against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.\n \n\n   \n  One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.\n \n\n   \n  The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.\n \n\n   \n  Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.\n \n\n   \n  Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.\n \n\n   \n  Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.\n \n\n   \n  “So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”\n \n\n   \n  “(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.\n \n\n   \n  “All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the  Russian paramilitary group Wagner .\n \n\n   \n  The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears for the missing men\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”\n \n\n   \n  Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.\n \n\n   \n  “The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.\n \n\n   \n  The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.\n \n\n   \n  As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-diary-ceo-interview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00.000Z","title":"Kamala Harris opens up about ‘complicated’ relationship with Biden, including when he ‘greatly disappointed’ her","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a recent interview on 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast, former Vice President Kamala Harris revealed a 'complicated' relationship with former President Joe Biden, citing a frustrating phone call before her debate with Donald Trump.

Kamala Harris, in an interview out Thursday, said a frustrating phone call with Joe Biden ahead of her debate with Donald Trump showed her that the former president wasn’t focused on her success – citing it as an example of why she has a “complicated” relationship with Biden.\n \n\n   \n  “My takeaway is his motivation was all about himself,” she said on “The Diary of a CEO” podcast. “It wasn’t about my performance at the debate.”\n \n\n   \n  Harris recounted the call, moments before her high-stakes confrontation with Trump, in which Biden told her “a group of people” were speaking poorly of her in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state, “because they heard I was saying bad things about him.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was told that he wanted to call so that I’d be ready,” Harris said. “‘I was so sure it was to buck me up and (say) ‘go get ‘em’ … When I hung up the phone I was just – it was unbelievable, and I was – yes I was angry, and deeply disappointed. It was so unnecessary.”\n \n\n   \n  The podcast appearance, part of Harris’ media tour promoting her book “107 Days,” marked the former vice president’s latest candid conversation rehashing what happened during her brief and unsuccessful bid for the presidency, as well as the fallout from her loss.\n \n\n   \n  Harris said she is still friends with Biden, who she said had called her two days earlier for her birthday.\n \n\n   \n  “I have a great deal of affection for him, and there were times, that I’ve been quite candid about, where he greatly disappointed me and, frankly, angered me,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Harris also discussed her perception of Biden’s mental state leading up to his disastrous June 2024 debate against now-President Trump. Harris said in the  interview that she didn’t think Biden actually wanted to hold the early general election debate, but was talked into it.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like any competition you go in, whether it’s you’re bidding for something, if it’s sports – you gotta want it, right?” Harris said. “If you don’t want to be in the competition it will absolutely have an impact on your performance, and I don’t think he – I’m pretty sure he did not want to debate.”\n \n\n   \n  The former vice president also suggested that she is open to running for president again.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the case for running again is if I can make a difference,” she said. “If I feel that I can offer something as president of the United States that would be not only uplifting to the American people, but would be about getting us on a correct trajectory.”\n \n\n   \n  Harris was asked if she thinks she can offer such a message to the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, that’s why I ran the last time,” she said. “We’ll have to see what happens over the course of these next few months, several months.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/football-nfl-week-9-preview-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:55:00-04:00","title":"Lamar Jackson is back and the Chiefs visit the Bills: Five things to know about Week 9 in the NFL","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Week 9 of the 2025 NFL season, several key storylines unfold: Lamar Jackson returns to action with the Baltimore Ravens after recovering from a hamstring injury, with the team facing the Dolphins; the Chiefs and Bills clash in their 10th meeting in six years, with Mahomes and Allen locked in a high-stakes quarterback rivalry; the Denver Broncos and Houston Texans are set for a low-scoring, defensive battle with minimal scoring, due to elite defenses and a low over/under; and Kyler Murray, injured with a foot sprain, is expected to play against the Dallas Cowboys, where his strong historical performance at AT&T Stadium adds significance.

\n       \n  By Andy Scholes, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:55 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hard to believe we’ve already reached the halfway mark of the  NFL season . Week 9 brings the return of Lamar Jackson, another Mahomes–Allen duel, and hopefully a few games that actually keep us on the edge of our seats. Here are five things to know about Week 9:\n \n\n   \n    Lamar’s finally back\n \n\n   \n  Let’s try this again. Baltimore Ravens quarterback  Lamar Jackson  is set to start Thursday night in Miami against the Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson practiced last week, and many expected him to suit up against the Chicago Bears, but the team opted to give his hamstring one more week to heal. Jackson now says he’s “100 percent healthy,” and the Ravens are banking on that being true.\n \n\n   \n  At 2-5, Baltimore is in dangerous territory – only two teams in NFL history have reached the postseason after starting 2-6. After their slow start, Jackson and the Ravens have almost no margin for error the rest of the way.\n \n\n   \n     Chiefs-Bills showdown \n \n\n   \n  No matchup in football has delivered more drama over the past five seasons than the  Kansas City Chiefs  vs. the Buffalo Bills. Sunday’s clash will mark the 10th meeting in six years between Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. It’s become must-see TV anytime these two square off and is undoubtably the league’s best quarterback rivalry.\n \n\n   \n  Allen owns a 4-1 record against Mahomes in the regular season, but Mahomes is undefeated where it counts – he’s 4-0 in the postseason. After a sluggish start, Kansas City’s offense is back in sync, averaging 30.8 points over its last five games, fourth best in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  Buffalo’s defense dominated in last week’s 40-9 rout of the Carolina Panthers but suffered another setback,  losing Ed Oliver  to a torn bicep. Will we get another epic shootout? This latest installment of Mahomes vs. Allen headlines Sunday’s CBS slate, kicking off at 4:25 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n     Can we get a close game, please? \n \n\n   \n  Here’s hoping Chiefs-Bills gives us a thriller because  Week 8 was a snooze fest .\n \n\n   \n  It was the first NFL Sunday since 1970 with one or fewer games decided by single digits (with a minimum eight games). The lone nail-biter came in the New York Jets’ 39-38 comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n \n\n   \n  Week 9 features more big spreads, but in the NFL, these things tend to even out. Here’s to some games that actually go down to the wire.\n \n\n   \n     Don’t expect points in Houston \n \n\n   \n  If you like fireworks and 40-point shootouts, you might want to skip the Denver Broncos going to Houston to play the Texans.\n \n\n   \n  Both defenses are elite. Houston leads the NFL in yards allowed (266.9) and points allowed (14.7) per game. Denver, meanwhile, tops the league in sacks with 36. The over/under is set at just 39.5 – one of the lowest totals all season.\n \n\n   \n  The Texans, sitting at 3-4, can’t afford many more losses if they hope to chase down the 7-1 Colts in the AFC South.\n \n\n   \n     Kyler owns Arlington \n \n\n   \n  Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray is officially questionable for Monday night’s showdown with the Dallas Cowboys because of a foot sprain, but don’t expect him to sit this one out – AT&T Stadium is basically his personal playground.\n \n\n   \n  Murray has never lost there – 5-0 in high school at Allen High (with three state titles), 1-0 at Oklahoma (Big 12 Championship) and 2-0 as a pro against Dallas.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes are high again. At 2-5, the Cardinals are clinging to postseason hopes. Fall to 2-6, and those hopes all but disappear.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/david-drake-mfa-boston-tan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"MFA Boston Returns Works by Enslaved Artist David Drake to His Heirs","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) Boston has made a historic first in the art world by returning two works by the 19th-century enslaved potter David Drake to his descendants, marking the first time a U.S. museum has resolved ownership claims for art taken under slavery.

PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a very rare and likely precedent-setting agreement, the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) Boston has agreed to return two works from 1857 by the Black potter David Drake, who made his ambitious jars while enslaved, to his present-day descendants.\n \n\n   \n  By the terms of the contract, one of those vessels will remain on loan to the museum for at least two years, according to the lawyer George Fatheree, who is representing Drake’s descendants. The other vessel — a masterpiece known as the “Poem Jar” — has been purchased back by the museum from the heirs for an undisclosed sum. Now the work comes with “a certificate of ethical ownership.”\n \n\n   \n  “In achieving this resolution, the MFA recognizes that Drake was deprived of his creations involuntarily and without compensation,” a museum spokesperson said in a statement. “This marks the first time that the museum has resolved an ownership claim for works of art that were wrongfully taken under the conditions of slavery in the 19th-century US.”\n \n\n   \n  Fatheree goes further, saying he believes their agreement “is groundbreaking in the art world.”\n \n\n   \n  “The application of principles of ethical restitution to artwork created by enslaved Americans, this is the first time that has ever occurred to my knowledge,” he said in a video call.\n \n\n   \n  Ethan Lasser, chair of the art of Americas at the MFA, said the museum has learned from its work restituting Nazi-looted art. “We’ve become very expert in Holocaust restitution. We’re dealing with (repatriation) issues in our African collections and Native American collections,” he said over the phone. “And we want to bring the same standard to the fullness of our collection.”\n \n\n   \n  He considers Drake’s work an example of “stolen property,” too, “since the artist is always the first owner of his work and he never got to make the call about where it went or what he was paid for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Born enslaved around 1800 in Edgefield, South Carolina, a region known for its rich clay, Drake (who was also known as Dave the Potter) was one of relatively few African American potters to sign his work. He also dared — despite punitive anti-literacy laws for enslaved people in the state — to etch short sayings or poems on the jars, making them powerful acts of resistance. Some inscriptions boast of the jar’s intended contents or enormous capacity; others remark more poignantly on his own life or working conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The “Poem Jar,” which the MFA originally bought in 1997 from a dealer in South Carolina, features a couplet that hints at Drake’s financial exploitation. The inscription reads: “I made this Jar = for cash/Though its called Lucre trash.” Currently in a gallery for self-taught and outsider art at the museum, it will assume a more prominent spot at the entrance of the Art of Americas wing once renovated in June 2026. (The jar that Drake’s family now owns has a signature and date but no writing.)\n \n\n   \n  Another jar made the same year, 1857, has a particularly wrenching inscription in light of Drake’s forced separation from a woman believed to be his wife and her two sons. That vessel, at the Greenville County Museum of Art in South Carolina, reads: “I wonder where is all my relation.”\n \n\n   \n  One of Drake’s great-great-great-great grandsons, the children’s book author and producer Yaba Baker, said he feels the restitution process offers one answer to that question. “It’s been exciting, overwhelming and feels full circle,” he said in a video call. He praised the MFA for “showing integrity and leadership” in “allowing us to connect to Dave’s legacy,” noting that “to go from being slaves to having a family of engineers and doctors and people in executive positions is a testament to Dave’s legacy in a different way.”\n \n\n   \n  These descendants began talking about getting involved in Drake’s legacy in 2022, upon the opening of “Hear Me Now: The Black Potters of Old Edgefield, South Carolina,” an exhibition jointly organized by the MFA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The family soon hired Fatheree, fresh from his win in the  Bruce’s Beach  land reparation case. Earlier this year they established the David Drake Legacy Trust, governed by five of the oldest heirs.\n \n\n   \n  So far there are about 15 family members involved, according to Fatheree, but they have created a website so that other descendants of Drake can be identified and join the efforts — what Fatheree calls “a big tent approach.”\n \n\n   \n  The initiative’s repercussions could be widespread. There are thought to be around 250  pots by Drake still in existence, and over the past five years the market for his work has exploded, driven mainly by American museums competing for pieces in the hopes of telling a more complex story about the history of slavery in the US. Several have paid six figures for his work, and in 2021 the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas paid a record-setting $1.56 million for a 25-gallon stoneware jar at auction.\n \n\n   \n  Other museums that own Drake’s work include the Met, the Philadelphia Art Museum, the De Young Museum in San Francisco, the Art Institute of Chicago, Harvard Art Museums, the St Louis Art Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, as well as smaller venues in the American South.\n \n\n   \n  Fatheree confirmed he has begun to reach out to some of these other art institutions on behalf of the family. “Our approach has been one of collaboration and invitation. I am not a litigator; we did not go to the museum and file a lawsuit (or) threaten to sue them. But our hope and frankly our expectation is that other institutions” — and private collectors of Drake’s work, he added — “will follow the Boston museum’s lead here.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not just an opportunity for museums to be on the right side of history,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for museums to rewrite history and think not just about ownership and stewardship, but think about stewardship and justice.”\n \n\n   \n   Read more stories from The Art Newspaper  here .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/palestinian-american-teenager-remains-in-israeli-jail-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:36:00-04:00","title":"Palestinian American teenager to remain in Israeli jail despite growing pressure in Congress for his release","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American from Palm Bay, Florida, has been detained by Israeli authorities in the West Bank since February 2025 after being accused of throwing rocks at Israeli settlers.

American teenager to remain in Israeli jail despite growing pressure in Congress for his release \n       \n  By Jeremy Diamond, Zeena Saifi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:36 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An American teenager held in an Israeli prison without trial for more than eight months will remain in detention for at least another week and a half, despite growing pressure from US lawmakers for his release.\n \n\n   \n  Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American from Palm Bay, Florida, was arrested by Israeli forces in February 2025 after being accused of throwing rocks at Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. Ibrahim has told lawyers that he confessed to the accusations out of fear after he was beaten and threatened with more beatings.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Prison Service said it doesn’t comment on individual cases for privacy considerations but added that it operates according to the law and under the supervision of oversight bodies.\n \n\n   \n  A court hearing on Wednesday ended without Mohammed’s release and his next hearing is scheduled for November 9.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just been hell,” his father Zaher Ibrahim told CNN. “We never thought something like this would go on for eight months.”\n \n\n   \n  Zaher said US officials have told him there a deal is being negotiated to secure his son’s release, but it has yet to be finalized. Mohammad’s family had been hopeful he would be released following Wednesday’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  “The State Department is tracking Mr. Ibrahim’s case closely and working with the government of Israel on this case,” a US State Department spokesperson told CNN. “The Ambassador and the Embassy Jerusalem staff have been deeply involved in working on this case and continue to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Mohammed’s case was brought to the attention of senior US officials over the summer, after his cousin — 20-year-old American Said Musallet — was beaten to death by Israeli settlers. Zaher Ibrahim raised the case with US ambassador Mike Huckabee this summer when Huckabee visited Musallet’s father in the West Bank.\n \n\n   \n  But Zaher Ibrahim says it took months for US efforts to truly ramp up, saying he felt betrayed by his own government.\n \n\n   \n  “What got us to this point is the pressure of the media and lawmakers on Capitol Hill,” Zaher said. “If it wasn’t for the pressure, I think they’d care less.”\n \n\n   \n  Twenty-seven US senators and representatives wrote a letter this month calling on US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Huckabee to secure Mohammed’s “swift release,” expressing concern about the alleged mistreatment he has faced in Israeli prisons.\n \n\n   \n  A lawyer for Defense for Children International – Palestine visited Mohammed in prison and reported that he had “lost a considerable amount of weight” during his imprisonment and suffered from scabies.\n \n\n   \n  During his hearing on Wednesday, Mohammed reported stomach pain and headaches, his father said. One of the two guards flanking him during the hearing then called him a liar, according to Zaher.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard,” Zaher said, describing seeing his son on a courtroom monitor.\n \n\n   \n  At one point, Mohammad tried to raise his cuffed hands to wave to his family. One of the guards slapped his hand away, his father said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just very, very sad,” Zaher said, his voice cracking. “You don’t know after they take him in – you don’t know if they’re gonna hit him again.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/milorad-dodik-sanctions-trump-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00.000Z","title":"US lifts sanctions on Putin-backed Bosnian Serb strongman after Trump allies’ lobbying","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US has lifted sanctions on Milorad Dodik, a Russian-aligned Bosnian Serb leader accused of undermining the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement and engaging in ethnic division and corruption, following months of lobbying by allies of Donald Trump.

While the agreement stopped the bloodshed, it carved Bosnia into two entities: the Federation, where Bosnian Muslims share power with Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska.\n \n\n   \n  Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia’s integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.”\n \n\n   \n  Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump’s Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “What sort of message does this send – that if you have the right connections and the right lobbyists, you can be removed from the sanctions list? It’s setting a negative precedent,” Andi Hoxhaj, a Balkan expert at King’s College London, told CNN. Coming three weeks before Dayton’s 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration’s decision was especially dispiriting.\n \n\n   \n  The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska’s National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska’s installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik hailed Trump and his allies for waiving the sanctions against him, saying the decision corrected “a grave injustice” inflicted upon Srpska “by the Obama and Biden administrations.” What Dodik failed to mention, however, is that he was also sanctioned by the Trump administration in  July 2017  for obstructing the Dayton agreement. The Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on him in 2022 and again in early 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik began to court Trump before the 2024 election, when the president was facing dozens of criminal charges. “America needs you, but the rest of the world as well!” Dodik wrote to Trump in September that year, following the second assassination attempt against him.\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump’s return to the White House, Dodik’s overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska.  Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich’s firm, signed a  contract  with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. The value of that contract was redacted.\n \n\n   \n  Marc Zell, another lobbyist, also signed a  contract  with the Srpska government in December 2024 worth $1 million for one year’s work, plus a bonus if Zell’s firm successfully brought about the removal of sanctions on Dodik and his allies, according to documents also filed with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agents Registration Act website. In an email, Zell told CNN that the bonus fee provision was canceled in accordance with US law.\n \n\n   \n  This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik’s cause. Laura Loomer, the far-right influencer with a direct line to the president,  said  Dodik’s removal as president of Srpska was “the latest example of the brazen assault against Trump-like leaders across the world.” She claimed Dodik – a “Christian” leader – was “enduring ruthless political attacks from a coalition of Muslims and globalists.”\n \n\n   \n  Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser,  called  for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.”\n \n\n   \n  Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump’s one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump’s famous MAGA hats.\n \n\n   \n  Hoxhaj, the Balkan expert, said Dodik will use the sanctions relief to claim “to his people and to the public that he has been vindicated by the US, and that what was done to him was unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denounced the lifting of sanctions as “reckless and premature.”\n \n\n   \n  “Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said. “The American people deserve answers.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/6-7-meme-slang-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00-04:00","title":"The ‘6-7’ meme can be annoying.

(In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/rap-falls-out-top-40","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:19:00-04:00","title":"Are We Living Through a Rap Drought?

after far right’s election setback \n       \n  Story by Reuters\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:08 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  Dutch centrist leader Rob Jetten said he was “very confident” of being able to put together a government after his party’s strong showing in parliamentary elections that saw  Geert Wilders’  anti-Islam Freedom Party lose ground.\n \n\n   \n  With most of the votes counted from Wednesday’s election, which was seen as a test of the far right’s strength in Europe, Jetten’s D66 and Wilders’ PVV were tied on Thursday, with both projected to take 26 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament.\n \n\n   \n  That was a sharp drop for Wilders’ party, which lost over a quarter of its seats in two years, stemming from a poor performance in its first attempt at government and growing competition on the right. D66 tripled its score.\n \n\n   \n   Major mainstream parties  have ruled out governing with Wilders this time after he brought down the last coalition, which was led by his own party. This leaves him no viable path to a majority, unlike D66’s young leader Jetten - who will still need to clinch the support of several other parties.\n \n\n   \n  At 38, Jetten would be the Netherlands’ youngest, and first gay, prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  The election delivered a “very strong message form Dutch voters that they want positive political powers in the center to work together and deliver for all the people in the Netherlands,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  With polished messaging and a surge in advertising spending, Jetten moved beyond his D66 party’s traditional themes of climate change and education, plunging into the divisive topics of immigration and a housing crisis. In the process he won over some voters who had previously looked to right-wing parties.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very excited that we’re going to have the first homosexual prime minister in the Netherlands and also one that is combining all the positive forces,” Lotte van Slooten, a 25-year-old voter, said at a D66 election rally overnight.\n \n\n   \n  Talks to form a government, which usually take months in the Netherlands, will be particularly complex in a very fragmented parliament. “It will be very difficult,” said Kajsa Ollongren, a D66 party member who served as defense minister in government with Jetten.\n \n\n   \n  With D66 and PVV tied for first spot, it was still unclear who would get the first chance to form a government.\n \n\n   \n  Party leaders will likely convene on Friday to decide on the next steps, and could either appoint a “scout” to start holding coalition talks or decide to wait for final results, which are likely to come in a few days.\n \n\n   \n  The Dutch election was seen as a test of whether the far right can expand its reach or whether it has peaked in parts of Europe.\n \n\n   \n  The outcome suggests there are some limits to its appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve shown not only to the Netherlands, but also to the world that it is possible to beat populist and extreme-right movements,” Jetten told the crowd at his party’s election-night celebration.\n \n\n   \n  But with PVV tied for the top spot, it also showed the far right is an enduring part of an increasingly fragmented European political landscape at a time when many other parties have toughened their stance on immigration.\n \n\n   \n  Wilders said he would take the lead in forming a government if the PVV ultimately came out with more votes.\n \n\n   \n  “As long as it’s not 100% clear, D66 can’t take the lead. We will do everything we can to prevent that,” he said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Counting of ballots was still under way, but with 98.8% of votes accounted for it was not expected to change the fact that the two biggest parties are tied for the top spot.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/white-house-ballroom-east-wing-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:03:00-04:00","title":"The White House ballroom saga could be worse for Trump than he realizes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's decision to demolish the East Wing of the White House and replace it with a $300 million, privately funded ballroom has triggered significant public backlash.

worse for Trump than he realizes \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:03 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s White House ballroom saga last week followed a familiar Trump-era arc: A bunch of the president’s critics sounded the alarm about his latest provocation – in this case, the sudden and surprising demolition of the East Wing – and a bunch of other people questioned what the big deal was.\n \n\n   \n  He’s just building a ballroom, after all. And the White House kind of needed a ballroom!\n \n\n   \n  “Of all the reasons to criticize President Trump, this must count as the silliest,” the often-Trump-skeptical  National Review wrote .\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Post editorial board said Trump was characteristically “pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible.” But it praised him for charging ahead and delivering “ a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere .”\n \n\n   \n  Well, it turns out most Americans see plenty to dislike about Trump’s handling of the East Wing and the ballroom.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, it appears to be one of the more unpopular things he’s done in this second term. And it’s not just those  who dislike Trump that are objecting.\n \n\n   \n  New  Yahoo News-YouGov  and  Washington Post-ABC News  polls are the first quality surveys to dig into the ballroom saga in depth. And both show similar things.\n \n\n   \n  The former shows Americans disapproved of Trump’s demolition of the East Wing (57%-26%), his plans for replacing it with a 90,000-square foot ballroom (61%-25%) and his broader handling of the situation (55%-28%) all by around a 2-to-1 margin.\n \n\n   \n  The latter shows Americans also oppose the broader project by a 2-to-1 margin, 56%-28%.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump’s supporters aren’t defending him too hard.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, just 55% of Republicans in the Yahoo poll approved of both demolishing the East Wing and building a ballroom. That’s compared to 94% of Democrats who disapproved of both. Around one-quarter of Republicans disapproved on both counts.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the passion on this issue seems to be very much on the “anti” side.\n \n\n   \n  In both polls, the percentage strongly opposed to the project far outpaced the percentage strongly in favor – 46%-18% in the Yahoo poll and 45%-15% in the Post-ABC poll. In both surveys, about half of independents strongly opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  So this  does  appear to have animated people of many stripes, to a significant extent.\n \n\n   \n  None of that means this is a game-changer of a political issue which will suddenly send Trump’s overall approval numbers plummeting to new depths. But it does reinforce that he just keeps doing things rather haphazardly that give lots of people reason to dislike what they’re seeing – even, it seems, some people who generally approve of him.\n \n\n   \n  An important question from there is why people disapprove.\n \n\n   \n  Is it just because they don’t really like change? Were the images of the demolished East Wing just that jarring? Or maybe people objected to the lack of transparency and the fact that Trump downplayed the extent of the construction. (Trump said less than three months ago that the ballroom project “ won’t interfere with the current building ,” even though the White House had released images showing the gigantic ballroom completely replacing the East Wing.)\n \n\n   \n  All of those are valid hypotheses. But the numbers might actually point in another direction.\n \n\n   \n  While people disapproved by about a 2-to-1 margin no matter how you asked the question, they were actually slightly more likely in the Yahoo poll to object to the ballroom plans (61%) than they were to the demolition of the East Wing (57%).\n \n\n   \n  That’s a little counter intuitive.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing demolition was the jarring part. You could see a situation in which people might think the ballroom is okay and even necessary, but don’t like how the East Wing was summarily torn down. But in fact, Americans disliked the ballroom slightly more than the East Wing teardown.\n \n\n   \n  What that might suggest: People don’t really like the idea of building an elaborate new $300 million ballroom – privately funded, Trump says – on the White House grounds during a time of significant economic hardship and inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has shown remarkably little concern about these kinds of optics issues. He’s  gilded the interior of the White House . He and his family have taken little care to insulate themselves from allegations that they’ve ignored conflicts of interest and enriched themselves using the presidency, most notably with their crypto ventures. Even as the country is dealing with the impacts of a government shutdown, Trump is overseas accepting gifts  like a golden crown from South Korea .\n \n\n   \n  There are signs that maybe people are starting to pay attention to this. A  Pew Research Center poll  conducted a month ago showed 61% of Americans and even 31% of Republican-leaning people said they believe Trump has at least “probably” improperly used his office to enrich himself, his friends and his family.\n \n\n   \n  A  CBS News-YouGov poll  around the same time showed 75% of Americans said Trump wasn’t focused enough on the issue of “lowering prices of goods and services.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it doesn’t seem to have been a great time to bulldoze part of the White House in the name of building an expensive place to hold parties. And Trump did a great job of making sure people noticed that’s exactly what he was doing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/nuclear-weapons-testing-trump-china-russia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:35:00-04:00","title":"Trump instructs Pentagon to start testing nuclear weapons 'on an equal basis' with Russia and China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced that he has instructed the Pentagon to begin testing U.S. nuclear weapons on an equal basis with Russia and China, marking a dramatic reversal of the 1990s nuclear testing moratorium.

‘on an equal basis’ with Russia and China \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, Brad Lendon, Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:35 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to begin testing US nuclear weapons “on an equal basis” with Russia and China, heralding a potentially major shift in decades of US policy at a time of growing tensions between the world’s nuclear-armed superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made the announcement moments before his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, for what had been billed as make-or-break talks intended to restore stability after almost a year of trade and economic turmoil.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on social media Trump said, “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China as “a distant third” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House and Department of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to a nuclear weapons test, or  a test of a nuclear-capable weapons system . Not since the 1990s has one of the world’s three major military powers conducted a nuclear weapons test, with China having conducted its last known test in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  The US last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, when it began a voluntary moratorium on such explosive testing. It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, when a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.\n \n\n   \n  Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said that the country had tested a new nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.\n \n\n   \n  Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many, account for 90% of the world’s arsenal,  according to  the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia would “act accordingly” if any country withdraws from the moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  “There is indeed an ongoing (nuclear testing) moratorium,” Peskov told reporters Thursday, adding that he was unaware of any nuclear tests being conducted by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump mentioned that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Up until now, we have not known that anyone was testing. And if the reference was to the (nuclear-powered) Burevestnik (cruise missile) test, that is by no means a nuclear test,” Peskov said.\n \n\n   \n  “All countries are developing their defense systems,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  China is also believed to be rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade, according to a Pentagon report.\n \n\n   \n  China has constructed at least three complexes for launching ballistic missiles in recent years,  according to the Federation of American Scientists , and it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  At  a military parade  in Beijing in September, China showed off its nuclear triad – systems that can launch nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”\n \n\n   \n  “They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”\n \n\n   \n  The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.\n \n\n   \n    A new arms race?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.\n \n\n   \n  But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.\n \n\n   \n  “If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”\n \n\n   \n  The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear powers, including rival nations India and Pakistan, as well as North Korea, which analysts have warned in recent years could be preparing for a new nuclear test.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea is responsible for the world’s most recent nuclear test in 2017– and all tests that have taken place in the 21st century. Only three countries – India, Pakistan and North Korea have tested nuclear weapons since a 1996 test ban treaty, according to the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  After testing cruise missiles earlier this week, Pyongyang said that it is taking steps to toughen its “nuclear combat posture” – a line not out of step with numerous bellicose statements from the country that has resisted calls to give up its nuclear arsenal.\n \n\n   \n  There have been signs that a new era of nuclear testing may be in the offing.  CNN reported in 2023  that the US, Russia and China had all built new facilities and dug new tunnels at their nuclear test sites in recent years, according to satellite imagery.\n \n\n   \n  “There are really a lot of hints that we’re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/casey-means-surgeon-general-hearing-delayed-labor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:15:00-04:00","title":"Confirmation hearing delayed for Trump’s surgeon general nominee as she goes into labor with her first child","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee postponed its confirmation hearing for Dr. Casey Means, President Donald Trump’s nominee for surgeon general, due to her going into labor with her first child.

China’s commitments to strengthen its crackdown on fentanyl production and export of precursor chemicals.

The article highlights that while China has taken tangible steps in fentanyl control—such as expanding controls on key chemicals—the broader trade imbalance and geopolitical tensions remain unresolved. The deal also risks alienating U.S. allies like Mexico and Canada, which have independently worked to address fentanyl infiltration, and underscores a broader pattern where U.S. economic leverage has been weakened by China’s strategic market control. Despite these risks, the agreement reflects a strategic calculation by Trump to balance economic pressure with diplomatic engagement, potentially as a stepping stone toward more durable

EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump made an extraordinary concession in his  landmark deal  with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday: In exchange for promises that China will crack down on fentanyl, the United States will shave 10% off the tariffs it charges on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  On the surface, it’s a promising deal that could restore some of the trade that tariffs had stymied between the world’s two largest economies. The reduction will bring the minimum tariff on Chinese imports down to 20%, and the average tariff rate will fall to around 47%. That’s lofty compared to many other US trading partners but still more in line with the rest of the world.\n \n\n   \n  It could give some relief to US consumers, and it means Chinese goods can shed the outcast status in the United States that Trump’s high tariffs had imposed on them.\n \n\n   \n  But the tariff reduction is also a significant gamble for the Trump administration, which has encountered a persistent problem in its unprecedented trade war with China: ﻿Trump has been  bested by Xi in the trade war  at every turn. Even the fact that they met in person Thursday means Trump has already given into China’s demands. And, as history has proven in these on-again, off-again deals, it’s not clear the United States will get anything serious back by giving in on fentanyl tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Trump risks further eroding America’s relationship with its key allies while gaining a friendlier relationship with its chief economic adversary.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is betting this time will be different. History suggests otherwise.\n \n\n   \n    China’s successful fight against Trump\n \n\n   \n  Trump wanted  four main outcomes  from his  tariffs on China : A reduction in fentanyl coming into the United States, a return of manufacturing to the United States, restoration of the balance of trade and a sale of TikTok’s US assets.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has made real progress on all four: China has pointed to strong actions it has taken toward preventing the export of the foundational chemicals used to make fentanyl. Dozens of companies have promised multibillion-dollar investments in US manufacturing. The US-China trade gap hit a 21-year low in August. And Trump and Xi agreed to the framework of a TikTok deal.\n \n\n   \n  But the frosty relationship has also caused major problems for the United States. China has restricted the export of  rare-earth minerals  – crucial elements in electronics and military equipment. It has refused to buy US soybeans, devastating American farmers. And it has made life more difficult for some key US businesses by launching antitrust investigations. China also has put in place hefty tariffs of its own on US imports.\n \n\n   \n  Despite several rounds of talks with US trade negotiators, China has continued to slow-walk promises to the Trump administration. Rare earths, in particular, became a key sticking point, and earlier guarantees of a free-flowing rare-earth market never materialized. Beijing has even tightened its controls by expanding its restrictions earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Under Thursday’s deal, China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, TikTok’s future in the US remains uncertain after rounds of trade talks between the two countries. Beijing stopped short of confirming a final deal on TikTok has been reached following the Xi-Trump meeting, pledging only to work with the US to “properly address” the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently acknowledged that China often fails to hold up its end of the bargain – including when he  announced in November  2024 that he would raise tariffs on China because of the fentanyl crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social several weeks after Election Day. Then President-elect Trump claimed that Chinese officials promised him the country would execute drug dealers caught funneling drugs into the United States but “never followed through.”\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump is making a deal\n \n\n   \n  So why would Trump make a deal with China on fentanyl now if Xi keeps reneging?\n \n\n   \n  First, China has taken honest-to-goodness action on fentanyl. For example, the country over the summer added two more elements used to make fentanyl to its list of controlled substances. When criminal networks adapted and began selling those elements on the black market, China worked to thwart those exports, too.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Thursday cited China’s  “ very strong action ”  in cracking down on fentanyl as a reason for lowering US tariffs on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  It appears that some  progress has been made on reducing fentanyl  emanating from China in recent years – and there’s some limited evidence that China’s actions are making an impact since Trump’s tariffs went into effect. The US Drug Enforcement Agency in an  annual report  released in May said fentanyl purity declined throughout 2024, consistent with indications that fentanyl cooks in Mexico were having trouble obtaining key precursor chemicals. US Customs and Border Protection have also  reported  that fentanyl stopped at the border was down in 2024 and is on pace to fall again in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Trump may or may not agree that China has made progress on fentanyl, but he sounded a different note on the subject this week than he has sung in the past. He claimed Wednesday that “China is going to be working with me” on restricting the drug.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that they’re going to help us with the fentanyl situation,” Trump said. “They’re going to be doing what they can do.”\n \n\n   \n  Second, China holds significant leverage over the United States. Trump’s tariffs have backfired in numerous ways, including by angering US farmers – a key voting bloc – and creating a rare-earth shortage. China has also refused to fully open up their market to American AI chips, a major Trump goal to help cement US dominance in artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs remain one key lever that Trump can pull, even as China has found markets outside the United States willing to buy its goods, blunting the damage Trump’s levies have imposed.\n \n\n   \n  Still, reducing tariffs represents one key Chinese demand. Trump’s meeting with Xi was another.\n \n\n   \n  Giving up some of that ground – particularly if China has shown some goodwill on fentanyl – gives Trump some ability to get what he wants out of these negotiations. In a vague statement on Thursday, China said it will make “corresponding adjustments” to its countermeasures on fentanyl-related tariffs after Trump agreed to cut the levies by half.\n \n\n   \n    What’s next?\n \n\n   \n  A potential problem for the United States: The other two countries on which the Trump administration has imposed fentanyl tariffs – Mexico and Canada – probably watched Thursday’s announcement with a raised eyebrow and some raised blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries have also made real efforts to restrict fentanyl coming over the US border. And fentanyl coming in from Canada has never posed a major problem, making up less than 1% of overall fentanyl coming into the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, Trump has threatened to raise  Mexico’s  and  Canada’s tariffs  while he is reducing tariffs on China. The deal could improve America’s relationship with its chief economic adversary while angering key allies and its two biggest trading partners.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the reduction in tariffs could help Americans who are paying the price. Albeit slowly, tariffs have raised prices in the United States. Any reduction will be welcome news for inflation-wary consumers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Liu and Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/asia/us-china-trump-xi-meet-south-korea-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:49:00-04:00","title":"Trump says rare earths deal and tariff cut agreed with China after high-stakes talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark meeting in South Korea, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a significant trade and policy agreement, including a one-year suspension of export controls on rare earth minerals and a 10% reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, in exchange for China cracking down on fentanyl smuggling.

deal and tariff cut agreed with China after high-stakes talks \n       \n  By Betsy Klein and Simone McCarthy\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A landmark meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on  the sidelines of an international summit  in South Korea Thursday appears to have made major strides to resolve frictions in the volatile relationship between the world’s two largest economies and rival superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders had agreed on “almost everything” and reached a trade deal that could be signed “pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after wrapping up the highly anticipated meeting with Xi, which capped his five-day tour of Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Xi also pointed to the “consensus” reached on resolving “important economic and trade issues” and called on the two sides to “refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results,” according to a Chinese readout.\n \n\n   \n  “Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of Sino-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict,” the Chinese leader said.\n \n\n   \n  The two appeared to find common ground on their duelling export controls, with a readout from Beijing saying that the Chinese sides would suspend for one year the implementation of sweeping export controls  on rare earth minerals , in exchange for the US hitting a one-year pause on a rule announced in September that would vastly expand the number of Chinese companies restricted from buying certain American technologies.\n \n\n   \n  In his comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.\n \n\n   \n  Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%. China said it would make “corresponding adjustments” to its US tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  China would also ramp up purchases of “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, Trump said, with Beijing noting that the two sides had “reached consensus” on expanding agricultural trade. Beijing also said the two sides would suspend tit-for-tat port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors.\n \n\n   \n  One of China’s top concerns – US export controls blocking its access to high end technology including semi-conductors – was discussed, according to Trump, but didn’t appear to have yielded any new breakthroughs.\n \n\n   \n  On the lingering issue surrounding TikTok’s future, China said it will work with the US to “properly address” it, but stopped short of confirming a final deal has been reached.\n \n\n   \n  The one-hour-and forty-minute meeting – the leaders’ first in six years – also appeared provide a key venue for the two men to stress their interest in stabilizing their countries’ fractious relationship.\n \n\n   \n  In comments ahead of the talks, Trump praised Xi as the “great leader of a great country” and said he thought the two “were going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” while the Chinese leader said it was a “great pleasure” to see Trump after many years.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then … you and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course,” Xi said, adding the two nations could “prosper together.\n \n\n   \n    Troubled trade\n \n\n   \n  The global economy has for months been roiled by a tit-for-tat of mounting tariffs, export controls and other penalties hitting areas from high-tech goods to high-seas shipping, as the US and China have vacillated between escalation and negotiation.\n \n\n   \n  At the crux of those tensions are a gaping trade imbalance and efforts from the US to ensure its national security against an increasingly assertive China, including by expanding restrictions on China’s access to American high tech, like the advanced semiconductors needed to power AI.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also appeared to raise the stakes of the meeting moments before landing in Busan, announcing the end of a more than three-decade moratorium on US nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the US “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China “a distant third,” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to as neither of the three countries has tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes the US will “earnestly uphold its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s statement added to other twists and turns ahead of the meeting, including Trump openly questioning whether it would happen and threatening additional tariffs and export controls on critical software in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Eleventh-hour trade negotiations by top officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, set the meeting on track. Expectations rose on both sides, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, with the hopes that the deal would produce more than just a low-key touchpoint between the two world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  But the consensus reached will be just one touchstone in a thorny and volatile great power rivalry between the world’s superpower democracy and an authoritarian China, whose growing military assertiveness under Xi in the East and South China Seas is rattling US allies in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides have seen a leader-level meeting as key to stabilizing the relationship as they continue to grapple with how to structure their economic ties.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting offered a win for China, which wants predictability in its US relations while it sprints toward self-sufficiency from American high-tech, and also for Trump, whose meeting with Xi delivers a big-ticket finale for what has already been a dealmaking blitz across Asia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/lukoil-to-sell-foreign-assets-gunvor-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:44:00-04:00","title":"Crushed by punishing US sanctions, Russia’s Lukoil accepts offer to sell its international business","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to severe U.S. sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s second-largest oil company, Lukoil, has accepted an offer from global commodity trader Gunvor to sell its international assets.

Lukoil over the possible acquisition of its foreign assets.\n \n\n   \n    Gunvor uses post-2022 profits to fund acquisitions\n \n\n   \n  The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a license giving companies until November 21 to wind down any transactions with Lukoil and Rosneft, another Russian energy firm targeted by the new round of sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  “If necessary, the parties plan to apply for an extension of the current license,” Lukoil said.\n \n\n   \n  The deal is subject to permission from the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, it added.\n \n\n   \n  Gunvor rose to prominence in the 2000s as the world’s biggest trader in Russian oil.\n \n\n   \n  Its shareholders at the time included Gennady Timchenko, a close ally of President  Vladimir Putin , who sold his stake in Gunvor after the U.S. targeted him with sanctions following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n \n\n   \n  Like many trading houses, Gunvor has profited heavily from a rally in oil and gas prices that began with the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and Europe’s move to cut its dependence upon Russian energy.\n \n\n   \n  Gunvor and peers Vitol and Trafigura have used those profits to acquire assets ranging from refineries and oil fields to power plants and wind farms.\n \n\n   \n    Lukoil’s foreign assets\n \n\n   \n  Moscow-headquartered Lukoil accounts for around 2% of global oil output.\n \n\n   \n  Its biggest foreign asset is Iraq’s West Qurna 2 oil field, one of the world’s largest, in which it holds a 75% stake. The field’s output topped 480,000 barrels per day in April, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  It also owns the 190,000 bpd Lukoil Neftohim Burgas refinery in Bulgaria, the largest in the Balkans, as well as the Petrotel oil refinery in Romania.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil supplies oil to Hungary and Slovakia, as well as to Turkey’s STAR refinery, which is owned by Azerbaijan’s state oil company SOCAR and depends heavily on Russian crude.\n \n\n   \n  Lukoil also holds stakes in oil terminals as well as retail fuel chains in Europe and owns upstream and downstream projects in Central Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/rare-earth-minerals-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-04:00","title":"What Are Rare Earth Minerals, and Why Are They Central to Trump’s Trade Deal with China?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. and China reached a trade deal to resolve tensions over rare earth minerals, with China agreeing to roll back recently imposed export controls on key rare earth elements, though some restrictions remain in place.

Beijing even  tightened earlier this month  its controls by massively expanding its restrictions..\n \n\n   \n  Under  Thursday’s deal , China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration; China  for years  has built up near-total control of the   minerals   as part of its wider  industrial policy .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about rare earths.\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths, and are they actually ‘rare?’\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths include   17 metallic elements in the periodic table made up of scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides.\n \n\n   \n  The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth’s crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process and are   also  environmentally damaging .\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths used for?\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are ubiquitous in everyday technologies, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They’re crucial for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments.\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are also essential for the US military. They’re used in F-35 fighter jets, submarines, lasers, satellites, Tomahawk missiles and more, according to a 2025 research  note  from CSIS.\n \n\n   \n    Where do rare earths come from?\n \n\n   \n  Sixty-one percent of mined rare earth production comes from China, according to the International Energy Agency, and the country controls  92%  of the global output in the processing stage.\n \n\n   \n  There are two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn’t have the capability to separate rare earths after extraction.\n \n\n   \n  “Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Trump administration’s announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America’s reliance on China for rare earth separation, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has one operational rare earth mine in California, according to Baskaran.\n \n\n   \n    Why do rare earths matter in the trade war?\n \n\n   \n  Beijing is using rare earths as major leverage in the trade war, and its latest restrictions were a major topic of conversation when Xi and Trump met Thursday at the APEC summit in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, China  added five rare-earth elements  – holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and related magnets and materials – to its existing control list, requiring export licenses. That makes the total amount of restricted rare earths to 12.   China also required licenses to export rare earth manufacturing technologies out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time this year that Chinese restrictions on rare earths have angered Trump. In June, Trump said on Truth Social that  China violated a trade truce  as   Beijing kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products.\n \n\n   \n  The export controls could have a major impact, since the US is heavily reliant on China for rare earths. Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a  US Geological Survey report .\n \n\n   \n  But China’s latest restrictions were seen as a dramatic escalation in Trump’s trade war between the world’s two biggest economic powers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nectar Gan, John Liu, Donald Judd, Kylie Atwood, Phil Mattingly and David Goldman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/lily-allen-nun-west-end-girl-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:25:00Z","title":"Look of the Week: Lily Allen is a wayward nun, cigarette and all","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lily Allen’s new album 'West End Girl,' released in October 2025, is interpreted as a post-mortem on her five-year marriage to actor David Harbour, which began in September 2020.

Though Allen did  tell Vogue  the album is only “inspired” by the relationship and not “all gospel.”\n \n\n   \n  Since its release, listeners have been piecing together a bigger picture of their relationship and its fallout, referencing the lyrics with years of reports and rumors. Also in the crossfire: the couple’s divisive  Architectural Digest feature  in early 2023, featuring their eclectic Brooklyn townhouse, which is now being retrospectively eyed as a warning sign. (“Perhaps The David Harbour-Lily Allen Home Is Worth Wrecking,” pop culture critic Hunter Harris  penned  as a Substack headline at the time.)\n \n\n   \n  Blessedly, the album visuals are striking not in their maximalism, but their quieter reverie. Throughout the images, Allen unsettles Catholic iconography: In one looped video, she clasps her hands in prayer, wearing the blue and red of Mother Mary; on the album’s cover, painter Nieves González  depicts  the singer as an updated Baroque icon, stoic in polka dots and chiaroscuro lighting.\n \n\n   \n  In the video loop of Allen as a nun, she crosses a leg to reveal sheer tights and black pumps as she smokes a cigarette. She seems to be grappling with the duality of desire — something she candidly sings to in the song “Sleepwalking” (“I know you’ve made me your Madonna / I wanna be your wh**e”). But the visual metaphor resonates across the album at large. Allen doesn’t depict herself as the virtuous, scorned wife, but a real and raw person who cycles through anxiety and insecurity until everything reaches its bitter end.\n \n\n   \n  Nun imagery has often been deployed in music, art and fashion to symbolize a reverence that is readily subverted, by sex, sin or feminism. Lady Gaga has worn the habit in music videos and on tour, while designers including Rick Owens have frequently played with the cloth caps’ austere form. And though Allen’s version of a nun is certainly no stranger to vice, she is perhaps most subverted by a lack of faith in herself, as she painfully recounts going against her better judgement again and again.\n \n\n   \n  “Listen, I am in a period of self-discovery at the moment and I’m really trying to explore how I’ve got myself into certain situations in the past,” she told Vogue. “I need to unpack some things and break some patterns and probably talk to my therapist about my relationship with my dad.”\n \n\n   \n  Online, some commentators have already dubbed the upcoming months “West End Girl Winter,” as Allen ushers in a period of self-reflection, leaving 2024’s “ Brat summer ” far in the rearview mirror. The key items for this new season are yet to be determined, but will presumably include a posh home, smudged eyeliner, revenge heels and an incisive pen. The full nun’s habit remains optional.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/boxing-mayweather-pacquiao-rematch-negotiations-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:26:00Z","title":"Blockbuster rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao ‘almost’ agreed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A potential rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao is reportedly 'almost' agreed upon, following their historic 2015 fight in Las Vegas, where Mayweather won by unanimous decision.

6:05 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Danny Rensch is at the vanguard of chess.\n \n\n   \n  He, alongside a few others, has helped to develop the sport from one which was played by the elites to a phenomenon that has exploded in recent years, particularly thanks to the rising popularity of online chess.\n \n\n   \n  But to get to where he is now – a self-described “shepherd” for chess in his role as chief chess officer at Chess.com – Rensch has been on quite the life path.\n \n\n   \n  As he describes in his new memoir, “Dark Squares: How Chess Saved My Life,” Rensch was raised in Arizona in what he describes as a cult, a group that he says orchestrated a separation from his own mother and exploited his proficiency at playing chess for its own reputational gain.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch had to overcome many hurdles: Surviving emotional and substance abuse, developing tinnitus and allegedly being manipulated by a charismatic leader by being told he’d be the savior of chess. But along the way, his journey has taken him from a small commune to becoming a guiding light in a sport which, he believes, still has plenty of opportunity to grow.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the hardship and trauma he’s dealt with over his life, Rensch says he doesn’t hold any resentment. He believes the struggles of his past are all part of life’s rich tapestry, highlighting a quote from influential Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung as the motto he lives by: “We are not what happens to us, we are what we choose to become.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we can learn through pain and suffering sadly, but also it can give us an appreciation for what we have,” Rensch told CNN Sports. “Part of my journey is that what grief has taught me is that your relationships are what matter the most and connecting with other people through whatever you’re doing is what actually gives you purpose.\n \n\n   \n  “Your purpose is not anything you do. It is what you feel and what you find within why you do it. And I adhere myself to the fact that I am not what has happened to me. I am what I’ve chosen to become. And I try to take that into everything that I do and everything that we do at Chess.com.”\n \n\n   \n    Life in the ‘Collective’\n \n\n   \n  Growing up, Rensch recalls in his memoir that he was afforded the freedom to run around with children his own age, spending days in the woods with his friends or splashing around in the water.\n \n\n   \n  That was initially what life was like inside the now-disbanded Church of Immortal Consciousness.\n \n\n   \n  According to the group’s beliefs, the Church of Immortal Consciousness followed the teachings of Dr. Pahlvon Duran, a figure who last lived in the 15th century. Rensch describes the group as a spiritual haven for those looking for direction. Known internally as the Collective, the group sought to give lost souls direction – or as they called it, a Purpose – in a supposedly egalitarian society.\n \n\n   \n  Run by Steven and Trina Kamp, the Collective would meet to ensure members focused on their spiritual alignment and, as a group, would pool their money together to ensure they were financially merged.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch recalls they would organize meetings – called Processes – where the members of the Collective would discuss whether or not a fellow member was following the teachings of Duran and, therefore, if they were spiritually pure. Rensch says in his memoir that these meetings often descended into loud arguments due to the amount of alcohol being consumed, and it would not be uncommon for someone to be “glassed” by having a full cup of liquid thrown in their face.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Kamp has previously denied the Church of Immortal Consciousness was a cult.\n \n\n   \n  Families would share accommodations, with Rensch recalling sharing beds with other kids across multiple abodes. But as a child, this was just something he was used to at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Many traveled to the Collective in search of meaning. But, as Rensch came to find out, life in an idealistic commune often doesn’t end in spiritual happiness.\n \n\n   \n  Despite preaching an equal society, it became apparent to Rensch that that wasn’t the case. He references a famous George Orwell quote from the classic novella Animal Farm when describing the hierarchy inside the Collective: “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.”\n \n\n   \n  “There were leaders and there was a literal hierarchy, a totem pole system. In some ways, the members self-ranked and sort of self-flagellated in order to keep everything in check,” Rensch explained to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Hassan, a licensed mental health professional and one of the leading experts on cults, told CNN Sports that these kinds of groups can cause a “dissociative disorder and a disruption of identity” in members.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan has personal experience having been a former member of the  Unification Church , the controversial religion founded by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954 and accused by critics of being a cult.\n \n\n   \n  “So in my case, I went from Steven Hassan of Flushing Queens, youngest of three kids, nice Jewish boy, wasn’t political, to a right-wing fascist wanting to take over the world,” Hassan said.\n \n\n   \n  “And so I had a pseudo-identity in the image of the cult. So my own critical thinking was pushed down. It wasn’t erased, but it was pushed down. The public has this incorrect assumption that people who get into cults are weak or stupid or uneducated, and it’s just not true. In Danny’s case, he had no choice.”\n \n\n   \n  As a child, the social dynamics of the group didn’t register with Rensch. But in hindsight, he is now able to recognize the pitfalls of the group.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch says in his book that the Kamps were able to weaponize the faith the Collective preached in an attempt to alter people’s life courses for the gain of the individual and the group. Whether it be how they raised their children or the job they were doing, the Kamps could decide whether it was the right fit spiritually and, if not, take steps to adjust.\n \n\n   \n  Also, in the search of spiritual happiness, it was commonplace for families to undergo dramatic changes. Husbands would leave their wives in search of their “Like Vibration” – a better fitting partner in the eyes of the Collective – and Rensch says children would be separated from their parents and adopted into other families to allow the child to flourish.\n \n\n   \n    Separation\n \n\n   \n  Rensch was an ordinary kid who liked ordinary activities. But his whole life changed upon watching the film “Searching for Bobby Fischer.”\n \n\n   \n  He was immediately gripped by a sport which was so different to any other, one which tested the brain in completely different ways than any other.\n \n\n   \n  And, as it turned out, Rensch was good at it from the outset. He would spend hours playing and teaching himself until his skills eventually caught the eye of church leader Steven Kamp.\n \n\n   \n  Kamp, a chess fan himself, saw the potential in Rensch’s game. Rensch said he later came to realize that Kamp saw Rensch’s ability at chess as a way of legitimizing the teachings of the Collective and justify the way the group worked.\n \n\n   \n  CNN Sports has attempted to contact Kamp to offer him the chance to comment.\n \n\n   \n  According to Rensch, Kamp took it upon himself to make sure that the boy received special chess training – including hiring the former Soviet defector, Igor Ivanov – and providing funds and transport so Rensch could travel to tournaments around Arizona and the country to test his skills. More than that, Kamp instructed Rensch that chess had become his Purpose, therefore instilling a religious importance to a game he was in his formative stages in learning.\n \n\n   \n  This added pressure on chess distorted his view on what was meant to be an enjoyable game, Rensch says.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was receiving discipline, to say it was wrapped up in shame and self-worth doesn’t even do it justice because the shame and self-worth was meant to transcend this lifetime. It was meant to transcend the planet,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like: ‘Oh, I’m actually, literally going to hell if I’m not putting my efforts into getting as good as I can at chess all the time.’”\n \n\n   \n  This added attention and time to focus on chess meant Rensch quickly went from promising youngster to tournament winner and chess prodigy. Over his chess career, he would become the youngest national chess master in Arizona history and a multi-time national scholastic champion.\n \n\n   \n  But this success came with a catch: Kamp took it upon himself to push Rensch further and further into the chess world, no matter the consequences, Rensch says. He saw Rensch as a future grandmaster.\n \n\n   \n  The constant flights and elevation changes involved in the journeys he was making across the US resulted in Rensch developing tinnitus, he said, which would eventually develop into chronic pain, infections and sinus pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch describes the most painful moment of his time with the group as being when he was separated from his mother, with his future success at chess given as a main reason why that move was orchestrated.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan said that children being separated from their parents is commonplace in cults, saying “parent alienation” is a typical practice.\n \n\n   \n  “This is something that typically happens with authoritarian cults. One of the parents gets into a cult, the other one doesn’t want to,” Hassan said. “So I’ve seen that one for 48 years. Every single cult does that as a thing.”\n \n\n   \n  Rensch’s chess playing career would eventually fizzle out, and looking back in hindsight, his relationship with the sport changed as he grew up and could recognize the environment he was living in.\n \n\n   \n  “The game gave me everything and then it took everything away. And I’ve been to hell and back with chess so many times,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Moving on\n \n\n   \n  As Rensch went through his life in the Collective and his chess playing faded away, his issues continued to pile up.\n \n\n   \n  While he met his wife Shauna and had children of his own, Rensch says he dealt with alcohol and substance abuse as he struggled with the dynamic of the Collective and how he fit in. Shauna was briefly with the Collective when she was six but moved away before returning later in life.\n \n\n   \n  He recalls the moment he decided to leave the Collective shortly after the birth of his second child and coming to the painful realization that it was time to move on.\n \n\n   \n  That decoupling wasn’t an easy thought to process for Rensch, having spent most of his life with the group.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever I could do to myself, whatever baggage I was willing to carry, as long as it was just me, there was probably a part of me that could or would do it forever,” he said. “And that’s part of how you dip in and out of addictive behavior and back out again, you dip in and out of almost ruining your marriage but then barely saving it.”\n \n\n   \n    Stewards\n \n\n   \n  By that point, in 2009, Rensch had begun coaching on Chess.com. It was a humble beginning, but it allowed him to get his foot in the door at an organization which would soon enjoy a meteoric rise.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t easy at the beginning. The website was set up in 2007 and, at that time, the main online chess platform was the Internet Chess Club (ICC).\n \n\n   \n  Through years of development and clever marketing, Chess.com was able to develop into the dominant force of internet chess, with Rensch playing a key role behind that growth.\n \n\n   \n  As well as making it the main platform for coaches to help nurture the next generation of chess stars, a key manta in developing Chess.com was to open the sport to the wider community, with Rensch admitting that the game has at times been a “gatekeep community” by the “intellectually elite or (those who) want to revere and worship the intellectually elite.”\n \n\n   \n  “We were like: ‘This is wrong.’ And I saw that it was wrong from having failed to try to reach the mountain as a prodigy and (Chess.com CEO and co-founder) Erik (Allebest) saw that it was wrong as someone who always loved the game but felt kept out of the club,” Rensch said.\n \n\n   \n  Nowadays, Chess.com is home to over 230 million members, sees more than one billion moves being played every day, and is valued at over $1 billion with no venture backing, according to the company. During those early years as a start-up, the only financial backing the site was ever able to receive was a $70,000 temporary loan from the mom of Allebest’s friend.\n \n\n   \n  As one of the biggest organizations in the sport, Chess.com has also had to weather its fair share of controversy, most notably a  cheating scandal  involving an accusation from Magnus Carlsen that Hans Niemann cheated in an over-the-board game. Niemann was  eventually cleared of cheating  in that particular match.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch said that the episode taught the people involved with Chess.com that it had “way more influence than we thought we did.”\n \n\n   \n  But despite the meteoric rise and the sway the site now has over the sport, Rensch and his colleagues see themselves as guiding hands.\n \n\n   \n  “We really are the shepherds of something that belongs to humanity and we do not take that for granted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “The truth is we always had a bit of an existential – viewing ourselves from 30,000 feet – view that this was kind of bigger than us and that we owed chess the opportunity to reach more people.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/basketball-nba-sports-business-cosm","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00+00:00","title":"NBA Extends Partnership With Cosm to Bring Live Games to Immersive Domes","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NBA and Cosm, a start-up entertainment company reinventing the sports bar with immersive 'shared reality' domes, have extended their partnership into the future, with plans to air live NBA games in Cosm’s domes through 2030.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of the sports world’s most intriguing start-up companies is renewing its long-term partnership with its first-ever major  professional sports league  partner.\n \n\n   \n  The  NBA  and Cosm, the entertainment company that’s reinventing the sports bar with what they like to call “shared reality,” announced Thursday an extended partnership to air live NBA games in Cosm’s domes. The IMAX-esque experience allows Cosm’s customers to watch live sporting events on its unique 87-foot-diameter, 12L+ LED screens that have gone viral for offering a first-of-its-kind experience for fans.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA was Cosm’s first-ever league partner long before the company opened its first location in Los Angeles in 2024. The two entities are now set to work together into 2030 and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  “Our ambition is to give another option for fans that might be out of the marketplace or their favorite team is on the road, or they haven’t been able to get to those courtside seats or lower bowl seats,” said Jeb Terry, Cosm’s president and CEO, in an interview with  CNN Sports . “So, it’s really complementary, I would say, to the NBA’s ambition of opening up access, giving fans more ways to celebrate the game, and providing other opportunities to lean into that action.\n \n\n   \n  “And that’s why it was really an obvious opportunity from the beginning. Because not only is that the innovative spirit of the league, the tech-forward approach, but the same way we approach it by leveraging technology to augment that fan experience and give more optionality, so fans can just lean in and celebrate wherever they are, whether they’re in-market, out-of-market, wherever that may be.”\n \n\n   \n  The extended partnership will allow Cosm to produce and distribute live NBA games at Cosm’s venues for at least the next five years. That means Cosm will be able to send its in-house production team, which is responsible for the unique views provided to viewers at their domes, to key national TV games, events from next year’s  All-Star Weekend , the  playoffs  and  NBA Finals .\n \n\n   \n  Teddy Kaplan, NBA vice president and head of new media partnerships at the league, said working with Cosm has been a no-brainer for his team from the start.\n \n\n   \n  Kaplan was on a ski trip to Park City, Utah, in 2022 when he got the opportunity to visit Cosm’s headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. He diverted from that vacation for a bit to see what the company was working on and was introduced to Cosm’s experience center for the first time, which gave him an idea of what the finished domes would be like.\n \n\n   \n  He left that meeting wowed.\n \n\n   \n  “I got there and I said, ‘Oh my God, this is, this is the future. This is what we need,’” Kaplan told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  He added, “Our fans are young, tech-savvy, diverse, and they push us to be innovative. And as you’ll see, across our portfolio of distribution points, we’re always looking for ways to innovate the way fans watch our game, whether it’s alt streams, whether it’s via virtual reality, whether it’s with our social partners. Cosm is the perfect piece in our broader network here.”\n \n\n   \n  The initial partnership with the NBA, agreed to in February 2023, was an important inflection point in the company’s history, according to Terry.\n \n\n   \n  That kind of high-profile partner gave Cosm – at that point about a year-and-a-half from opening its first location near SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California – much needed legitimacy as it entered into discussions with other leagues and broadcast companies that hold the rights to sporting events aired in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “When you’re building companies, there’s always these pivotal moments along the way. You get the technology sorted. You’re like, ‘OK, it works.’ Then you have to work on getting market adoption, and there’s a lot of ways to do that with our business,” Terry said.\n \n\n   \n  “Partnerships are paramount. They are critical to how we bring this to life with our fans. And so, having the NBA as our first, it was a great moment for our company to announce it … and then get that word of mouth trending within the industry and then pushing that forward. And so, you look to have all these credible moments along the way in this growth phase. And this was one of the big ones.”\n \n\n   \n  The next move for Cosm is scaling up into more locations. It currently has domes open at that initial location in Inglewood and one in Dallas. Three more locations have been announced in Detroit, Cleveland and Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  That puts the company in five NBA cities and looking to expand to more, including overseas locations that could put international fans closer to professional American basketball in a way that’s much cheaper and easier than flying across an ocean to get into an NBA arena.\n \n\n   \n  Given that Cosm is able to show its customers views that they would have to pay dearly to afford – the courtside view from the scorer’s table, underneath the hoops in the front row at either end of the floor – all from the comfort of a sports bar environment, Kaplan said the hope is that NBA fans will be able to approximate that experience from the domes.\n \n\n   \n  “We like to use the stat that 99% of our fans will never make it to an NBA game, and that’s in the US. When you go global, it’s 99.99%. And when you think about sitting courtside, basically 100%, right?” Kaplan said.\n \n\n   \n  “And so having Cosm as a tool to bring fans closer to the game and speak to those tech-savvy fans is really perfect for us.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/louvre-jewels-heist-arrests-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:08:00Z","title":"Five new suspects arrested over Louvre heist – but still no sign of looted jewels","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five new suspects have been arrested in connection with the theft of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre museum, bringing the total number of arrests to seven.

 \nUpdated: \n        4:30 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For certain workers at the Federal Aviation Administration, the government shutdown hit hardest this week with a $0 paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  It’s “disheartening,” to not be paid by an employer, said Cleverson Schmidt, a radar technician based in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to stay level, and I’m praying I don’t get a heart attack or stroke,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  His job, which he is required to do even though he is not being paid, includes certifying aircraft systems for controllers to use. The equipment has to be flawless, he said. It’s how controllers make air traffic decisions with planes full of hundreds of passengers.\n \n\n   \n  His family mostly relies on his income, as his wife works part-time and stays home with their son.\n \n\n   \n  It broke Schmidt’s heart as a father to tell his son a month ago that he couldn’t get his allowance due to the family’s financial situation.\n \n\n   \n  “Having to tell your child that you can’t provide for them is a difficult burden,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Working six days a week and now not getting paid\n \n\n   \n  Many of these critical federal jobs were understaffed, and the people who do them overworked even before the shutdown, making the gap in pay even harder to take.\n \n\n   \n  Corinne Wiseman’s husband – a controller at the Boston TRACON - supports them on his sole income, often working Thursday through Monday and then a sixth day on Tuesday, when he must pick up mandatory overtime.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s not really home,” Wiseman said. “He doesn’t already see his kids hardly at all. Not his fault. It’s his schedule.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has omitted her husband’s name to maintain his anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  The schedules at the FAA are demanding – oftentimes controllers work long hours through the evenings or overnights, making critical decisions and setting personal life aside to maintain the safety of the flying public.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman said it is “hard to not get personal about it,” knowing that her husband has missed years with their four children already, and now he’s not getting paid to do his job and support his family. Her husband has built up exhaustion and resentment, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “(Being an air traffic controller) has been my husband’s dream for almost two decades and in the last five years, I have only seen a decline in his mindset,” she said. “He loves the work, he is angry that the federal government could get away treating them the way they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, some controllers are calling out sick causing a rippling effect of staffing shortages and delays.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to this shutdown, the family had taken out a loan to complete some much-needed repairs around their home. That included new windows, a new roof and more, she said. Now, they’re left to cut costs elsewhere to ensure bills get paid. She said the family keeps the heat off in the house for as long as possible and mostly uses firewood to keep warm.\n \n\n   \n  “As a spouse, watching your significant other feel the full weight of the financial strain of the family while also being unable to physically be present is painful and stressful,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman stays home to take care of their children, but since the shutdown she has been looking for an online job to help their family while still managing their schedules.\n \n\n   \n  “In our family, the stress is just always there, just because the career itself is already extremely stressful and takes a lot of time away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    No end in sight\n \n\n   \n  For now, Schmidt is calling creditors to figure out what bills must be paid. He takes side jobs to make extra cash, and many of his colleagues are doing the same, he said. Schmidt’s union, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, represents about 11,000 FAA employees. About 5,000 of them, like Schmidt, are working without pay during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to stay strong and do my job with dignity and with the best of my ability,” Schmidt said. “I don’t think I could handle if I was responsible for a loss of life, a loss of lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Keeping the public safe is something that drives many aviation workers, even when they aren’t getting paid, despite the hardships on their families.\n \n\n   \n  As the holidays approach, Wiseman’s family of six is already making adjustments to pinch pennies where needed. She’s canceled or postponed doctor’s appointments, chiropractic care and vet appointments to avoid co-pays or bills piling up.\n \n\n   \n  All four of Wiseman’s children are in their pre-teen to teenage years, involved in activities and costly sports. One has even started driving, which helps Wiseman keep up with the schedules, but adds another cost given high car insurance rates for a new driver.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been just trying to be very frugal, like extra spending at a very bare minimum,” she said, noting the family doesn’t eat out anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman’s children carpool for sports to avoid additional expenses. The couple is not sending their youngest son to an out-of-state hockey tournament in two weeks because of the financial strain it would cause. He’s a goalie.\n \n\n   \n  The family has been through this before. In January 2019, the decision by 10 air traffic controllers, which didn’t include Wiseman’s husband, to call out sick helped end that 35-day long shutdown. Their absence temporarily shut down travel at New York’s LaGuardia airport and caused delays at other major hubs in New Jersey, Philadelphia and Atlanta, driving President Trump to agree to a temporary government funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  How this shutdown will end is anyone’s guess, but for now these families are struggling to cover their costs as they still report to work.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/food-banks-snap-funding-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Food banks face a ‘perfect storm’ of surging demand as shutdown drags on","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown drags on and the Trump administration signals a suspension of federal food benefits in November, food banks nationwide are facing a 'perfect storm' of rising demand.

to dip into emergency hurricane reserve funds to meet demand. Meanwhile, a Florida charity is giving out 300,000 meals per day but, an official there says, “still it’s not enough.”\n \n\n   \n  After a nearly monthlong  government shutdown , the looming  suspension of federal food benefits  in November is poised to put millions of Americans at risk of going hungry — and food banks and other charities across the country face a bleak outlook as they head into a busy holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen large and small charitable nonprofits told CNN they have exceeded their ability to help and warned that the level of support they can provide will fall far short.\n \n\n   \n  “The real impacts are starting now,” said Brian Greene, CEO of Houston Food Bank. “There’s been some uptick, but nowhere near what we’re going to see by the time we get to early November. … it’s going to be unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  With Thanksgiving just weeks away, hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay are becoming new faces at food banks and other charities, which are also bracing for more demand as the Trump administration signals that it doesn’t have the funds to provide food stamps to nearly 42 million Americans next month.\n \n\n   \n  Those factors combine to form a “perfect storm” that will push charities past their brink, said Miette Michie, a board member of the Emergency Food Network, which serves parts of central Virginia. The volunteer-based food distribution site has consistently been at capacity since the shutdown began, Michie said — at which point all the volunteers can do is tell people to call back the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you angry. … You’re messing with people’s lives here,” Michie told CNN. “This is not just a game, it’s actual people, working people, whose lives are being affected by this.”\n \n\n   \n  Dave Silbert, who leads So What Else, a food bank in Washington, DC, told CNN that “it’s brought a level of chaos and uncertainty.”\n \n\n   \n  “How do we expand?” he asked. “How do we go from 450,000 pounds of food to 550 or 600,000 pounds of food a week? How do we go from raising $300,000 a month to $400,000 a month?”\n \n\n   \n    States rush to provide support\n \n\n   \n  States across the country are working to fill the gap on their own.\n \n\n   \n  California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster have deployed their state’s National Guard troops to support food banks, and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican,  has signaled he’s prepared  to do so as well.\n \n\n   \n  New Mexico, Minnesota, Washington and West Virginia have announced millions in funding to support relief programs, while Virginia, home to tens of thousands of federal workers, is setting up its own food-assistance system for residents who receive SNAP benefits. That program is expected to cost $37.5 million a week and can be funded through November from the state’s surplus, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  But not every state is able to match federal funding. Several nonprofit directors told CNN that food banks were always meant to supplement, not replace, federal aid programs and that the timing of this influx of need will only further stretch social safety nets.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in Georgia, for example, receive about $250 million in SNAP benefits monthly. Food banks distribute only about $4.5 million worth of food each month, said Amy Breitmann, the CEO Golden Harvest Food Bank, which serves 24 counties in that state and South Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  “The food bank is supposed to be the safety net underneath SNAP, right?” Breitmann said. “It’s not supposed to replace that.”\n \n\n   \n    Food banks already reeling from federal cuts\n \n\n   \n  The surge in demand at food banks across the country comes months after the Trump administration terminated millions  in funding for a program  that allowed food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Higgerson, Chief Development Officer of Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida, said that there’s been “an erosion of the federal food support,” over the past year. A quarter of the food the Second Harvest Food Bank distributes comes from the Emergency Food Assistance Program, he explained.\n \n\n   \n  Between the shutdown and an already-lost millions of dollars from federal budget cuts this year, the situation is “unprecedented” for the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, a charity that has scrambled to launch pop-up shops in areas with the most SNAP-reliant and federal-worker-heavy communities, said president and CEO Amy Beros. Her group lost $2 million when the local food purchasing program was cut earlier this year and had roughly 80 truckloads cancelled from the Emergency Food Assistance Program.\n \n\n   \n  “We know there’s no way for the food banks to fully fill the gap,” Beros said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/democratic-senators-us-military-strikes-briefing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:50:00-04:00","title":"Trump administration cuts Democrats out of a briefing on US military strikes, top Senate Dem says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration conducted a classified briefing on U.S. military strikes against suspected drug-smuggling boats, exclusively for Republican lawmakers, without informing Democratic members.

EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Trump administration officials briefed Republicans on Wednesday about  US military strikes on suspected drug boats  without telling Democratic members about the briefing, according to a top Senate Democrat and a source with direct knowledge of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner slammed the Trump administration for cutting out Democratic lawmakers Wednesday, calling the move “a partisan stunt” that “is a slap in the face to Congress’ war powers responsibilities and to the men and women who serve this country.”\n \n\n   \n  During the briefing, administration officials showed the Republicans a classified Justice Department OLC memo outlining the administration’s legal justification for the strikes, which CNN  first reported  on earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Warner said, “shutting Democrats out of a briefing on U.S. military strikes and withholding the legal justification for those strikes from half the Senate is indefensible and dangerous.”\n \n\n   \n  “Decisions about the use of American military force are not campaign strategy sessions, and they are not the private property of one political party,” he said. “For any administration to treat them that way erodes our national security and flies in the face of Congress’ constitutional obligation to oversee matters of war and peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “It also sets a reckless and deeply troubling precedent,” the Virginia Democrat continued, adding that the administration should immediately provide Democrats the same briefing and the OLC opinion.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Warner’s comments come as the Trump administration accelerates its attacks against boats that they allege are involved in drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that the US military  conducted another strike against a vessel  in the Pacific Ocean that day, killing four people.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  The action marks the 14th known US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel. The operations have killed 61 people aboard 15 total boats.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration told CNN earlier this week that it has provided  seven separate classified briefings  on US military strikes on alleged drug boats.\n \n\n   \n  But some lawmakers have said they have not received the information they want. One Democratic Senate aide told CNN that the administration “appears to be counting the same briefing given multiple times to certain staff or members (including in small groups.) So seven briefings is highly misleading.”\n \n\n   \n  House Armed Services Committee members are expected to get a classified briefing from Pentagon officials on Thursday about the recent US military strikes on boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking, two sources told CNN earlier Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/americas/pictures-devastating-aftermath-hurricane-melissa-jamaica-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"21:25:00Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa devastates Jamaica: in pictures","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, made landfall in Jamaica’s southwest coast near Black River, causing extensive damage to homes, businesses, and farmland in St. Elizabeth Parish.

departed Asia without meeting Kim Jong Un. North Koreans don’t seem to care \n       \n  Analysis by Will Ripley, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:52 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President Donald Trump  danced on the tarmac  in Malaysia,  met Japan’s emperor  in Tokyo, and  accepted a gold crown  in South Korea, one key question kept following him – would he hold a surprise meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un?\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions  Trump made public overtures  that he’d “love” to meet Kim while in the region. It could have been a made-for-TV sequel to his  surprise 2019 visit at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) , when Trump made history as the first sitting US president to step foot on North Korean soil.\n \n\n   \n  In the end it never came together. And in Pyongyang, just a few hundred miles away, it was like Trump’s trip never happened.\n \n\n   \n  There were no headlines. No television news reports. No mention of the US president’s offer to “work very hard with Kim Jong Un” to bring peace to the Korean peninsula. Even as Trump’s entourage rolled through Asia and speculation swirled about a possible reunion between the two leaders, North Korean state media stayed silent.\n \n\n   \n  American filmmaker and manager at  Young Pioneer Tours  Justin Martell just returned from an eight-day trip to Pyongyang, where he was attending an international film festival that happened to coincide with much of Trump’s Asia trip.\n \n\n   \n  He said most people he spoke with in Pyongyang didn’t even know Trump was in the region, and none were aware that Trump wanted to meet Kim again.\n \n\n   \n  “They weren’t negative about it,” he told CNN. “They weren’t overly hopeful either. They just kept repeating Kim Jong Un’s recent remarks — that while he has warm memories of President Trump, politics are different from feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  Martell said the tone wasn’t hostile, just detached. “It was more or less, ‘Here’s how we feel right now. If it happens, great. If not, it doesn’t really change much.’”\n \n\n   \n  That matter-of-fact indifference marks a striking change from 2018 and 2019, when Trump’s summits with Kim — first in Singapore, then in Hanoi, and later at the DMZ — gripped both capitals and dominated global headlines.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward to 2025 and Trump’s overtures barely registered. But there’s good reason for that.\n \n\n   \n  Only last month Kim stood side-by-side with China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin in the heart of Beijing at a historic military parade in an unprecedented and  historic show of unity  against the West.\n \n\n   \n  Kim now has Moscow for weapons deals and oil, Beijing for trade, and a domestic narrative of resilience under sanctions and  heroism on the battlefield in Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  Frankly, a handshake with the US president no longer carries the weight it once did.\n \n\n   \n    Why the meeting didn’t happen\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the missed meeting with Kim was  “a matter of timing.” \n \n\n   \n  “We never were able to talk because… look I was so busy,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Thursday after departing South Korea and ending his Asia tour.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was also away on a diplomatic mission of her own this week. She first flew to Russia for a  meeting with Putin  to discuss strengthening ties before speaking at an international forum in Belarus.\n \n\n   \n  That made it logistically impossible for North Korea’s top diplomat to help arrange any last-minute meeting between Kim and Trump  as she did in 2019 , when Choe helped pull together the DMZ meeting just hours after  Trump posted on social media  he wanted to meet Kim.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, North Korea test-fired cruise missiles to the west of the Korean peninsula ahead of Trump’s visit, during which he held a summit with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung.\n \n\n   \n  But as Martell’s conversations in Pyongyang suggest, timing may be only part of the story. North Korea simply may no longer feel strongly compelled to say yes.\n \n\n   \n  Kim has made his terms clear: he’ll meet Trump only if Washington abandons what he calls its  “absurd obsession” with denuclearization . In a September speech, he said he still has “fond memories” of Trump, but that his country “will never trade away nuclear weapons to be free of sanctions.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, the deal Trump offered six years ago – trading sanctions relief for disarmament – is no longer on the table. North Korea wants to be recognized as a nuclear-armed state.\n \n\n   \n  What Martell saw in Pyongyang underscores why.\n \n\n   \n  The North Korean elite in Pyongyang – whose support is crucial to maintaining national stability, despite Kim’s near-absolute power – appear to be enjoying a higher living standard than previously, with more access to modern technology and amenities. For the elite, at least, sanctions have done little to dent their lives.\n \n\n   \n  Even South Korea’s President Lee seems to recognize the challenges in bringing Kim to the table.\n \n\n   \n   In an interview with me this week , Lee said he hopes Trump can act as a “peacemaker,” while Seoul plays “pacemaker” — creating the conditions for dialogue that remain “difficult” to achieve directly. “If the two leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together,” Lee said, “we would welcome such engagement.”\n \n\n   \n    High-rises and traffic jams in ‘Pyonghattan’\n \n\n   \n  Martell had not been to Pyongyang since 2017. The capital’s development over the past eight years, despite sanctions and the extreme isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, stunned him.\n \n\n   \n  “It used to feel much less developed compared to others in the region,” he said. “Now, honestly, Pyongyang feels very much like a modern city.”\n \n\n   \n  He described futuristic high-rises, residents paying with QR codes, new domestic apps for ordering taxis and food, and social media.\n \n\n   \n  “What used to take twenty minutes now takes forty,” he said, referring to the traffic. “We kept joking with our Korean guides that it was Pyonghattan” because it has developed so much.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the capital’s new Hwasong district, he dined at sleek restaurants offering both Asian and Western menus, with high-end liquor on display. He says all the restaurants were full of locals dining when he visited.\n \n\n   \n  Private car ownership was once rare and politically sensitive. Now, it’s common enough to cause occasional traffic jams in busy areas. “There seems to be a burgeoning middle class now,” Martell said.\n \n\n   \n  Even outside the capital, he saw evidence of growth. Traveling two hours north to Mount Myohyang, he noticed new housing under construction. “For farmers, too,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite sanctions, he said, “the DPRK seems to be in a much different position than it was ten years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  At a national gallery near Kim Il Sung Square, he saw new murals commemorating 80 years of the Workers’ Party. Toward the end, one section vividly depicted North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Large North Korean-style murals of soldiers fighting Ukrainians — and winning,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Even North Korean cinema has evolved. At the Pyongyang International Film Festival, Martell watched Days and Nights of Confrontation, a new state-produced thriller dramatizing a real-life plot to assassinate Kim Jong Il.\n \n\n   \n  The film featured violence, modern production values, and even brief nudity — all unheard-of in North Korean films. “A character getting suffocated with a plastic bag — that’s something I’ve certainly never seen in a DPRK movie,” he said, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s portrait still ‘front and center’\n \n\n   \n  Despite the silence around Trump’s latest Asia visit, he has not been erased from Pyongyang’s official memory.\n \n\n   \n  Martell’s group was the first Western delegation in years to visit the International Friendship Exhibition, a sprawling mountainside museum that displays gifts and artifacts from foreign dignitaries. Taking photos inside the exhibition is strictly forbidden.\n \n\n   \n  “In the section devoted to Kim Jong Un, there were the expected photos — Putin, Lavrov, Xi Jinping, Dennis Rodman,” Martell said. “And President Trump was still there, displayed very prominently.”\n \n\n   \n  Based on my experiences traveling to the country, if the door were truly closed to future dialogue, that photo would probably have been removed.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s still displayed very much front and center,” Martell said.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump has indicated he still wants to meet Kim when he next comes to Asia. “We’ll have other visits, and we’ll work very hard with Kim Jong Un and with everybody on getting things straightened out,” he told reporters on Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/louvre-heist-suspects-investigation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:56:00Z","title":"Louvre Heist Suspects Admit Involvement in Jewels Theft","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two suspects arrested in connection with a brazen seven-minute daylight heist at the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery on October 19, 2025, have admitted partial involvement in the theft of high-value French Crown Jewels, including an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to Queen Marie-Amélie.

 Two suspects arrested in connection with the theft of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre museum have admitted involvement in  the heist  and have been remanded in custody, the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The Paris prosecutor also said the  stolen jewels  are not in the authorities’ possession.\n \n\n   \n  Both suspects were presented before an investigative judge on Wednesday and placed under formal investigation for organized theft and criminal conspiracy, according to Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau. The pair had “partially admitted” their involvement under questioning, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The heist – a brazen, seven-minute daylight raid on the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery – captured the world’s attention after thieves escaped with jewels worth tens of millions.\n \n\n   \n  The two men were arrested Saturday evening and held in custody, where they were questioned for 96 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Police arrested a third suspect in the Paris region on Wednesday evening, CNN affiliate BFM TV reported on Thursday, citing sources. That suspect was in police custody, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  The first suspect, 34, is of Algerian nationality. He had prior records for traffic-related offenses and was identified through DNA recovered from one of the scooters.\n \n\n   \n  The second suspect, 39, is an illegal taxi driver and delivery driver born in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. He was previously known to police for aggravated theft. His DNA was found on glass that had been broken from one of the display cases, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  “There is nothing to suggest that the four perpetrators benefited from any form of inside help within the museum,” Beccuau. said in a Wednesday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  The crime of theft as part of an organized gang carries a potential 15-year prison sentence and a heavy fine, the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  More than 100 investigators have been involved in the manhunt, and authorities were able to track down the individuals after analyzing more than 150 DNA samples and examining several items the group left behind, such as gloves, a helmet and high-vis jackets left at the scene.\n \n\n   \n  One of the men was arrested at Charles de Gaulle Airport as he attempted to leave the country. He was stopped during a passport check before he could board an evening flight to Algeria.\n \n\n   \n  The stolen jewels – among them an emerald necklace set with more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife – were not recovered during the arrests.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves raided the Apollo Gallery on the Louvre’s upper floor, which houses the French Crown Jewels, on October 19. They used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the museum, through a window. They broke into two high-security display cases and made off with nine items, including a diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The jewelry taken from the museum is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million).\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to keep the hope that they will be found and could be returned to the Louvre museum and the nation,” Beccuau added. “These jewels are now unsellable.

deposed Thursday over agency’s tactics in the Chicago area \n       \n  By Devan Cole, Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:43 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to sit for a deposition Thursday morning in a lawsuit over his agency’s immigration enforcement tactics in the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The debrief from plaintiff’s attorneys, who accuse federal agents of aggressive behavior against peaceful protesters, is scheduled to last up to five hours. It comes a day after an appeals court halted a judge’s order requiring him to  provide her daily court briefings  on his agents’ activities.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise order Wednesday came just hours before Bovino was meant to brief US District Judge Sara Ellis, who told him Tuesday he must be in court every weekday for the next week as she considers reports that federal agents were not following her order to limit aggressive tactics and warn protesters and journalists before using tear gas and less-lethal munitions.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration quickly pressed a federal appeals court to put her order on hold, arguing that Bovino having to appear would be “extraordinarily disruptive” and “irreparably harming the government.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’ requirement “significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.\n \n\n   \n  In a Wednesday afternoon ruling, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted their request, meaning Bovino did not make an appearance in court Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  As the Trump administration carries out targeted immigration enforcement in several major US cities, Bovino has emerged as the  on-the-ground face  of “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago. The targeted operation has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since it began in September, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n  But the operation has also drawn persistent protests outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, just outside Chicago. While federal agents say threatening protest activity has led them to intensify their crowd control tactics, demonstrators argue their response is often disproportionate.\n \n\n   \n  The appeals court’s decision is intended to give the intermediate court time to review a request from the Trump administration to completely scrap Ellis’ order regarding Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the Wednesday ruling, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it is “thrilled this act of judicial overreach has been paused.”\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear whether Bovino will appear in court to brief the judge Thursday.   \n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, a group of protesters, local journalists and clergy members sued the Trump administration, accusing federal agents of shooting pepper balls and tear gas at demonstrators without warning and unlawfully restricting the press.\n \n\n   \n  Before the appeals court ruling, Bovino told Fox News he was anticipating the meetings with the judge.\n \n\n   \n  “If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s gonna have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino said on Fox’s  “The Faulkner Focus”  on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino appeared before Ellis on Tuesday after the plaintiffs accused him of  throwing a tear gas canister  into a crowd of demonstrators without justification or warning – a characterization DHS has refuted.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis’  restraining order , which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from using tear gas and less-lethal munitions on protesters unless there is an “immediate threat to safety.” It also requires clear warnings before these methods are used.\n \n\n   \n  During Tuesday’s hearing, Ellis expressed concern that her order was not being followed. She cited videos of interactions between agents and crowds, which she said appeared to show agents firing gas without notice and with no apparent threat.\n \n\n   \n  “Halloween is on Friday,” Ellis said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge provided guidance on how agents should comply with the order, including wearing body cameras to document interactions, wearing visible identification and providing clear warnings before deploying gas.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis ordered that all use-of-force reports and body camera footage during those interactions for Operation Midway Blitz from September 2 through last Satur﻿day be turned over to the court under seal by the end of this week.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing to determine whether Ellis should convert her temporary restraining order into a longer-lasting preliminary injunction is scheduled for next week.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/us-strikes-another-boat-pacific","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:49:00-04:00","title":"US military strikes another boat in the Pacific, killing 4","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 29, 2025, the US military conducted a strike in the Pacific Ocean, killing four people aboard a vessel suspected of illicit narcotics smuggling.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military conducted a strike against a vessel in the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, killing four people, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth said in a  post on X . He added that US forces were not harmed.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s action marks the 14th known US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel. The operations, which began in early September, have  killed 61 people aboard 15 total boats .\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has been accelerating its attacks against boats that they allege are involved in drug trafficking. Last week, the administration  struck two boats  in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which appeared to mark an expansion of its campaign as previous strikes had targeted vessels in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the US military struck four more boats in the Pacific, killing 14 people with one survivor, Hegseth announced a day later.\n \n\n   \n  Those strikes marked the first time multiple were conducted on the same day as part of Trump’s campaign against drug cartels and trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion that justifies lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers,  CNN previously reported . The opinion argues that the president is allowed to authorize deadly force against a broad range of cartels because they pose an imminent threat to Americans.\n \n\n   \n  However, Democrats on Capitol Hill are continuing to raise concerns about the legality of the strikes. Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner slammed the Trump administration for  only briefing Republicans Wednesday on the military strikes  without telling Democratic members.\n \n\n   \n  “Decisions about the use of American military force are not campaign strategy sessions, and they are not the private property of one political party,” Warner said in a statement. “For any administration to treat them that way erodes our national security and flies in the face of Congress’ constitutional obligation to oversee matters of war and peace.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican-led Senate blocked a push earlier this month to limit Trump’s ability to command the military to strike alleged drug boats without congressional authorization.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Zachary Cohen contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/feathers-fashion-runway-shows","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:48:00-04:00","title":"The plume boom: Feathers are coming for your spring wardrobes","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the resurgence of feathers in high fashion, from New York to Paris and London, where designers are incorporating plumes into coats, gowns, and accessories.

Black feathers spilling out the front of a beige car coat at Brandon Maxwell. An Altuzarra knit two-piece that made its wearer look like they had been tarred and feathered, but beautifully rather than as some heinous ancient punishment. A strapless gown that appeared cloud-like through rows and rows of delicate white plumes at Prabal Gurung.\n \n\n   \n  The London shows were in on the game too — the cascading, multi-colored plumage of a Roksanda evening gown, or feral, feather-stuffed Converse high tops at Oscar Ouyang. In  Paris , designers moved with the synchronization of a swallow murmuration. Pierpaolo Piccoli’s proposition for Balenciaga rested on feather-work: There was the full, plume-covered maxi skirt paired with a casual T-shirt, since worn in the wild by Elle Fanning, as well as a number of boxy dresses finished with delicate feather trims.\n \n\n   \n  For Chanel,  Matthieu Blazy  set its specialist atelier Maison Lemarié on the task of creating feather Camellias, headpieces, earrings and large skirts. At Victoria Beckham the dresses were smaller, but no less quilled. Even The Row, the cult favorite of every millennial minimalist, dipped its toe into the showy textile with mid-length skirts that were given a feathery facade. Stella McCartney, fashion’s stalwart eco-warrior, joined in too with the invention of the world’s first plant-based alternative to feathers.\n \n\n   \n  There was Big Bird Energy all over the runways this season. But how did bird feathers become a symbol of luxury in the first place?\n \n\n   \n  Plumage has been in fashion since ancient Egypt, when ostrich feathers were used to decorate fans and even appeared in hieroglyphics. In Babylonian and Assyrian artworks, too, feathers are often seen covering the bodies of deities or embellishing royal crowns.\n \n\n   \n  Around the mid-1500s, feathers entered the wardrobes of real people, at least in the UK. “That’s when they start to be worn specifically for fashionable reasons,” said Dr. Elisabeth Gernerd — a fashion historian and professor at De Montfort University in England. The ever-practical Brits worked with what they had to hand; attaching goose, chicken and egrets feathers that had been sterilized in chalk and sulfur to hats and fans. But while the material was fairly common, working people often reserved it for more everyday tools like making brooms or bedding.\n \n\n   \n   18th century trend-setter Marie Antoinette  popularized the style of having large, stately plumes — usually ostrich, the most prominent feather globally traded — erupting from a tower of hair. So giant were these headpieces, newspapers at the time often wrote salaciously about whose feathers caught fire from a candlelight at which ball. But it wasn’t until the 19th century, as the British Empire expanded and global trade routes became more established, that the “feather craze” reached its peak, according to Gernerd.\n \n\n   \n  Birds of paradise from islands such as New Guinea were hunted and skinned, then exported to Europe and the US, where they were sold to milliners at auctions in London, Paris and Amsterdam. Their exotic feathers became associated with a new level of luxury and access. “In the 19th century, the Empire was in fashion and feathers are a way to display that fashion,” said Gernerd. “You’re wearing something that has travelled thousands of miles to get to you. You’re a symbol of growing Imperialism and trade.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t just the odd plume, either. Entire hummingbirds were taxidermied and mounted on circular, feathered fans in the 1870s; while larger preserved birds adorned velvet bonnets. By the 1900s, millions of birds had been killed for the feather trade, threatening the extinction of several species. Demand was so high, the millinery industry was even pricing out American ornithologists from buying specimens for scientific research. When the Titanic sank in 1912, one of the most valuable commodities onboard was a container of ostrich feathers being shipped to New York. “They were insured for around $2.3 million in today’s money,” Gernerd said. “They were worth essentially as much as diamonds.”\n \n\n   \n  But the style wasn’t universally accepted, and some campaigned against the mass slaughtering of the endangered animals. Harriet Hemenway and Minna B. Hall, two Boston socialites, turned against the fashion of their peers — launching a series of tea parties to attempt to dissuade other high-society women from wearing feathers. They founded the Audubon Society, an environmental conservation group, in 1905 — managing to influence state laws, such as the 1910 Audubon Plumage Law which prohibited the sale or possession of feathers from protected birds in New York State. By 1918, they had their first major victory: the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a federal law that made it illegal to hunt, capture or sell any migratory bird. In 1921, the UK passed its own anti-plumage legislation which outlawed the importing of exotic birds for fashion. But frustratingly for activists, ostrich — one of the most prominently used feathers in the fashion industry today because of their unique individual filaments and diffused softness — were exempt from conservation laws, according to Gernerd, since their feathers can technically be harvested without killing or skinning the animal.\n \n\n   \n    Are feathers the new fur?\n \n\n   \n  Today, many fashion designers such as Donatella Versace, John Galliano and the late Giorgio Armani, have openly rejected the use of fur after decades of animal welfare campaigns — while luxury brands such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada and Burberry have also committed to going fur-free. Earlier this year Conde Nast  announced  it will no longer feature new animal fur in editorial content or advertizing across its numerous publications. But could the success of the anti-fur movement be fueling a plume boom?\n \n\n   \n  “Fashion designers are definitely using ostrich feathers as an alternative to fur, but it’s an ill informed decision to do so,” said Emma Håkansson, founder of ethical fashion activist group Collective Fashion Justice, in a phone interview. “Because we don’t want to kill animals specifically for fashion, we’re just replicating that same problem with a different species here.” Despite the fact ostrich feathers can be harvested without slaughtering, Collective Fashion Justice  published research  in 2023 that found all ostrich feather production systems ultimately kill the bird.\n \n\n   \n  It was Håkansson and her team who worked with Copenhagen Fashion Week to ban all wildlife materials on its runways in 2024, and who convinced the British Fashion Council to prohibit the use of fur and exotic animal skins later that year. Currently they are lobbying organizers at New York, Paris and Milan to commit to similar bans, and Håkansson is “hopeful” that their dialogue will lead to action.\n \n\n   \n  But change needs innovation, as well as restriction, to stick. One of the most feather-filled shows of the Spring-Summer 2026 season came from Stella McCartney. According to the fashion house, the plant-based “Fevvers” used to adorn dresses are the world’s “first ethical alternative” to bird feathers. Inventors Nicola Woollon and James West, who have protected the technology with a strict Non Disclosure Agreement, used Stella McCartney’s runway as a proof of concept. The idea, they told CNN, only took a few intense months of development.\n \n\n   \n  “With so many brands trying to move beyond animal-derived materials, it felt like the right moment to reimagine something so loaded with history and emotion,” Woollen told CNN in an email. “The conversation around materials has mostly focused on leather and fur. Feathers slipped through the next, and we wanted to change that,” West added.\n \n\n   \n  Their first foray into faux feathers took inspiration from ostrich — the final frontier animal campaigners couldn’t restrict over 100 years ago. “Ostrich feathers are the ones most associated with couture and cruelty in equal measure. We wanted to reclaim that form and give it new meaning,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the feather-filled runways of the latest season, it’s developments like Fevvers that keep Håkansson going. “What I hope people come to realize is that having policies in place that make fashion more ethical and sustainable is not restrictive of creativity,” she said. “It actually helps to produce more of it, because you have to think outside the box a bit more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/three-star-pushed-out-by-hegseth-caine-over-tensions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:45:00-04:00","title":"Exclusive: Three-star general pushed out amid tensions with Hegseth","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A three-star general, Lt.

Two other sources said there were discussions internally as far back as the spring about pushing out McGee.\n \n\n   \n  Caine and Hegseth also got frustrated with McGee at times because they believed he moved too slowly, one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, some in the Office of the Secretary of Defense saw McGee as too close to the “old guard” of the Pentagon, particularly former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  Gen. Mark Milley  and former Secretary of Defense  Lloyd Austin , one of the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  McGee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that “General McGee is retiring, and the war department is grateful for his service.” He denied CNN reporting that Hegseth and McGee had clashed.\n \n\n   \n  “Lt Gen. JP McGee will retire after nearly three years of outstanding leadership and service on the Joint Staff. We are grateful for his 35 years of honorable and dedicated service to the Nation,” a Joint Staff spokesperson told CNN. “We owe him a great debt for his service and it is regrettable anonymous sources would put the focus anywhere else.”\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth has pushed out more than a dozen senior military officials since taking office in January, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CQ Brown, the Chief of Naval Operations, the directors of the National Security Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency, and the top uniformed lawyers for the Army and Air Force.\n \n\n   \n  All were suspected of being insufficiently aligned with Hegseth’s agenda, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the senior military officials, including the former director of the Joint Staff Lt. Gen. Doug Sims and the commander of US Southern Command Adm. Alvin Holsey, have been allowed to retire, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Holsey offered to resign amid stark disagreements with Hegseth and Caine over the legality of the US military’s strikes on suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean, CNN has reported. Like with McGee, Hegseth had been frustrated that Holsey tended to move too slowly and saw him as an obstacle, according to sources. Holsey announced on October 16 that he would be retiring in December, just one year into the job.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/taiwan-worries-us-support-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Taiwan worries about US support wavering ahead of Trump’s meeting with Xi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As President Donald Trump prepares for a high-stakes meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Taiwan is deeply concerned about a potential weakening of U.S. support, particularly in military and diplomatic areas.

Ripley, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:45 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Days before President  Donald Trump  departed for Asia where he will sit down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday for their first in-person meeting of his second term, the president refused to count out the possibility of America’s position on Taiwan getting tangled in US-China trade talks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to be talking about a lot of things. I assume that’s going to be one of the things, but I’m not going to talk about that now,” Trump said when asked about reports that China may pressure the US to oppose Taiwan’s independence in exchange for a larger trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  The refusal to definitively count out Taiwan becoming a pawn in trade talks between the world’s two largest economies comes as Trump has privately and publicly suggested he believes China will not invade the self-ruled island that Beijing claims it owns while he is in office – raising questions about how seriously the president will prioritize boosting Taiwan’s defense during his second term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump again gave an evasive answer on Taiwan as he spoke with reporters on Air Force One en route to South Korea Wednesday for the Asia-Pacific Cooperation summit where he will sit down with Xi, saying he is  not even sure  the topic will be raised by the Chinese leader. A senior administration official expressed confidence that Trump would not be backed into stating opposition to Taiwan’s independence during the meeting, adding that the meeting will be focused on Xi “holding a gun to the head of the global economy” with its critical mineral export controls.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said over the weekend that no one in the administration is contemplating a trade deal that includes “favorable treatment” for walking away from Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Some experts remain worried, however, that Trump might be willing to make concessions on Taiwan for a better trade deal, but former Trump administration officials argue that those concerns are over-blown.\n \n\n   \n  “That idea of a grand bargain, of Trump selling out Taiwan, gets most of its oxygen from Chinese Communist Party trial balloons that are floated in US media, and from isolationists on the far left and the far right who believe in appeasement,”   said Matt Pottinger, Chairman of the China Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and Trump’s former deputy national security advisor. “Trump understands the strategic nature of Taiwan.”\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is also publicly downplaying concerns about the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting, and with a senior Taiwan government official saying they are “cautiously optimistic” about the meeting and pointing to Rubio’s latest remarks as an encouraging sign.\n \n\n   \n  Whenever leaders of the United States and China meet, Taiwan’s government is closely watching and calibrating its own strategy. Very little is typically said publicly given the precarious position Taipei finds itself in – wedged between two superpowers with vastly conflicting agendas and interests.\n \n\n   \n  And Taiwan’s anxieties have amplified in Trump’s second term, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s team is filled with more isolationist and far-right figures than the establishment Republican and Democratic officials who have traditionally shaped US foreign policy. And while Trump has prioritized securing a major trade deal with Beijing, his administration has paused some US military support to the island and complicated basic engagements such as the transit of Taiwan’s president through the US earlier this year, current and former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some stakeholders in Taipei have found it really jarring to be in this position where they’re suddenly so unclear on whether the US president will support them,” said Henrietta Levin, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), adding they have found an “unwelcome surprise” in how challenging it has been to bolster the US-Taiwan relationship this year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went into his first term having taken a phone call from Taiwan’s president  during the transition,  which upended protocol because there are no formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan. His administration then accelerated the sale of weapons to the self-governing island and allowed the transit of Taiwan’s president though the US on multiple occasions – which is in line with past norms.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, Trump came into office for his second term after having repeatedly claimed in recent years that Taiwan “stole” the US chip business, which resonated uneasily in Taipei. He has been careful in public statements about Taiwan, his administration has halted the flow of some weapons from US stockpiles to the island and complicated the transit of the island’s president through the US.\n \n\n   \n    The return of strategic ambiguity, or a downgrade of the relationship?\n \n\n   \n  Some experts make the case that to date, Trump in his second term has acted in line with decades of US policy with a return to strategic ambiguity.\n \n\n   \n  While it may be a hard shift after former President Joe Biden declared multiple times while he was in office that the US would militarily defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, they say it’s not an abnormal approach.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at Obama, Bush before that, it’s always been a little bit of a hands-off approach, and trying to keep Taiwan at arm’s length and being very careful about any messages you sent to China. So, we are somewhat back to that new normal again,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, the chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a foreign policy think tank.\n \n\n   \n  But Taiwan is grappling with whether the current state of the relationship with the US is a short-term aberration as Trump focuses on a productive meeting with Xi, or more of a long-term reality.\n \n\n   \n  It has led them to parse over the deeper meaning of every single engagement with the administration – or lack thereof.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this fall, there was a gathering on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly with Taiwan’s foreign minister at Le Bernardin, an upscale New York restaurant. Multiple senior US administration officials were expected to attend but they didn’t show up, according to a source who attended the gathering. Even though the administration signaled through intermediaries that the no-show was simply the unintended consequence of over-packed schedules, it left Taiwan feeling defeated, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The island is actively re-evaluating how they can move to bring the Trump administration to their side, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Facing pressure from both Washington and Beijing, President Lai Ching-te has pledged to raise defense spending sharply to 3.32% of GDP by 2026 and 5% by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  But there are also actions that are being taken – or considered – that won’t attract headlines but could impact the overall relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One option being considered is recalling their de facto ambassador to the US Alexander Yui in order to replace him with a diplomat who is more politically savvy, sources said. Some Trump administration officials have said that the current career diplomat doesn’t have the juice to effectively engage despite support from some close to the president, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan flatly denied that suggestion on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Taiwan and the US maintains a smooth communication channel,” Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung, told a legislative committee meeting. “Our representative office in the US has been functioning well. We are not recalling him.”\n \n\n   \n  Taipei has also launched an unprecedented charm offensive aimed at conservative media figures and influencers aligned with Trump’s movement.\n \n\n   \n  President Lai granted  a rare interview  to radio host Buck Sexton, praising Trump and even suggesting he would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if he could persuade China to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President  Hsiao Bi-khim spoke with  YouTuber Shawn Ryan, while Taiwan’s de facto ambassador appeared on Steve Bannon’s podcast and hosted Ryan at Twin Oaks, the historic ambassadorial residence in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Such outreach marks a sharp departure from Taipei’s conventional diplomatic approach, underscoring its effort to engage directly with the Trump-aligned ecosystem currently shaping US foreign policy discourse.\n \n\n   \n  Taipei is also trying to offset its US trade deficit by purchasing 6 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Alaska, a move officials describe as both an energy-security measure and a goodwill gesture toward Washington while they are still working on a trade deal between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Taiwan is not willing to concede to the US across the board. The island   vowed  to resist pressure  from Washington to shift half of its chip production capacity to the United States, throwing down the gauntlet to the Trump administration just earlier this month. The subject is expected to continue as an active piece of the ongoing trade talks between the US and Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n    Making Taiwan a porcupine ‘without giving Beijing the middle finger’\n \n\n   \n  Chinese leader Xi Jinping views Taiwan’s “reunification” with the mainland as a core requirement for the sweeping vision of a “national rejuvenation” China aims to achieve by mid-century.\n \n\n   \n  Senior Communist Party officials recently drew up their upcoming five-year plan, which analysts expect will see Beijing prioritize greater economic integration with Taiwan as part of its push for “peaceful reunification.” State media on Monday released a sweeping commentary laying out the many economic carrots it said would be available to Taiwan’s people “after reunification.”\n \n\n   \n  China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has not ruled out using force to take control of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US officials have said that Xi has ordered the country’s military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration plans to adopt a policy on Taiwan with the goal of making the island a “porcupine” by investing strategically in precision and smaller weapons built for asymmetric warfare to deter Chinese aggression or make an invasion so costly and painful that costs would outweigh benefits, two sources briefed on the policy discussions said. US officials also want to get Taiwan to that place “without giving Beijing the middle finger,” the sources explained.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration refused to green-light the transfer of US weapons stocks to Taiwan earlier this year, under a process known as Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), sources said. The move led to questions about the US military’s commitment to Taiwan. But the move was not meant to signal a complete abdication of US support, sources said. While the administration does not want Taiwan pulling from US weapons stocks — with one administration official pointing out that most of the stockpiled weapons that the US can give to Taiwan would be ineffective in a fight against China — there are no plans to halt sales of weapons which would be purchased by Taiwan, administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Taiwan to put in more orders for military equipment, and they are still waiting on those new orders, the senior administration official said. This private push comes as the administration has made clear that it views the economically prosperous island through the same lens that it views Europe – that it must invest more towards its own defense.\n \n\n   \n  Still, speed needs to be addressed. Taipei is waiting on a backlog of more than $20 billion in undelivered US military equipment, with production times in the US delayed in part because of the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the delayed National Defense Strategy from the Pentagon and internal disagreement over the extent to which the administration plans to prioritize sending military resources to the Western Hemisphere and Europe versus the Pacific is raising questions about the military focus and resources that will actually be put towards Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Dictating the flow of US arms to allies and partners would typically be the job of the defense secretary but the Pentagon has tried to make those calls in recent months with policy memos that have at times been slapped down by Trump directly, sources pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has publicly claimed in recent weeks that Xi won’t invade Taiwan because of US military strength.\n \n\n   \n  “China doesn’t want to do that. First of all, United States is the strongest military power in the world by far, it’s not even close,” Trump said earlier this month. “Nobody’s going to mess with that and I don’t see that at all with President Xi.”\n \n\n   \n  While US officials claim Taiwan must act more quickly to shore up its own defenses, there are concerns on the island that Trump’s personal conviction that Xi will not invade while he is in office could impede the US from effectively boosting their military capabilities in the coming years.\n \n\n   \n  “They are concerned about that, so if there’s no invasion until 2029, but all the time between now and then is wasted, both on the US side and the Taiwanese side, that will set us up for a disaster in 2029 or 2030,” Alperovitch said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/redistricting-rebellion-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-04:00","title":"Both Democratic and GOP-led states are starting to rebel against the national redistricting push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Multiple U.S. states are engaged in a high-stakes political arms race over mid-cycle redistricting ahead of the 2026 congressional elections.

      4:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  National political leaders are making frantic, last-ditch efforts in multiple states to  redraw more US House districts  ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  But their ambitions face big political and procedural obstacles and in some cases, open rebellion from state lawmakers pushing back against pressure from the top leaders in their own parties.\n \n\n   \n  Consider Kansas, where Republican lawmakers are trying to force a special session and join the wave of states undertaking once-rare, mid-decade redistricting to gain an edge in the 2026 congressional elections. GOP leaders this week were working to secure the signatures from two-thirds of lawmakers in both chambers needed to bypass the state’s Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and proceed. On the line: the US House seat currently held by four-term Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s terrible for democracy,” said Kansas state Rep. Mark Schreiber, one of the remaining Republican holdouts, in an interview with CNN. “It’s fairly simple: Redistricting was meant to accommodate changes in the population, based on the decennial census, and that’s it.”\n \n\n   \n  “This mid-cycle redistricting is being done only for political purposes, in this case to maintain a Republican majority in the US House,” Schreiber added. “I don’t think that’s an appropriate use.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have faced resistance as they ramp up their redistricting campaign. In Maryland, for instance, a top Democratic lawmaker has balked at taking up map-drawing, warning it will only escalate the ongoing redistricting arms race and help Republicans in the end. National Democrats are seeking changes to maps in at least three other states: New York, Virginia and Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections. If Democrats gain three seats next year, they will win the House and obtain the power to block parts of President Donald Trump’s agenda. But Republicans have more opportunities than Democrats do to shape the election outcome through congressional mapmaking.\n \n\n   \n  So far, GOP lawmakers have redrawn seats in three states – Texas, Missouri and North Carolina – to add a  total of seven potential seats  to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the Democrats’ push\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the political arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to undertake redistricting and create five additional GOP-friendly seats. Next week, California voters will decide whether to counter that and  approve five additional Democratic-friendly seats , representing the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state.\n \n\n   \n  The states now eyeing new maps represent “the third-tier opportunities for redistricting,” said Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor of Inside Elections, an independent political newsletter. But, he said, “in order to squeeze an advantage, you have to go piecemeal once you get beyond the big hitters. For Democrats, especially, California is all they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Virginia, a purple state where Democrats hold the majorities in both chambers of the legislature, is potentially the biggest remaining redistricting prize for the party. Democrats currently hold six of the state’s 11 seats in the US House, and an aggressive map redraw could potentially give the party nine or 10 seats.\n \n\n   \n  But it will take a monthslong effort to get there as lawmakers tackle multiple hurdles to bypass the redistricting process the state established five years ago. Under current law, the power to redistrict rests with a bipartisan redistricting commission created by voters through a constitutional amendment.\n \n\n   \n  First, Democrats must pass language to amend the state constitution before Tuesday’s elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. Then, it must be approved again next year in a second legislative session before voters have their say in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Republicans have signaled that they intend to mount legal challenges to any action by the legislature, arguing that Democrats already have run afoul of a requirement to pass the proposed constitutional amendment before the election since early voting is underway.\n \n\n   \n  The US House’s top Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is working to persuade Illinois lawmakers to eke out an additional seat there, despite objections from the head of the state Senate’s Black caucus. In Jeffries’ home state of New York, a  new lawsuit  by a leading Democratic-aligned elections firm takes aim at the sole Republican-held seat in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  After meeting with Jeffries this week, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch said in a statement that “all options must remain on the table to protect our democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  But at least one Democrat in the state – state Sen. Willie Preston, who heads the Black caucus in his chamber – has opposed it, arguing the new map risks diluting Black political power in the state. Preston is running for a US House seat now held by Rep. Robin Kelly. Kelly is running for an open US Senate seat to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.\n \n\n   \n  “Black Democrats have given our all to our party - the answer to fighting back against Trump’s efforts to crush Black political power cannot be diluting Black political power,” Preston said in statement.\n \n\n   \n  In deep-blue Maryland, the state Senate President William Ferguson has publicly opposed map-drawing targeting the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation. But other Democrats, including Jeffries, insisted Wednesday that redistricting remains a viable option in the state.\n \n\n   \n    Rare GOP resistance to Trump\n \n\n   \n  For Republicans, the most immediate battleground is Indiana, where GOP Gov. Mike Braun has announced a special legislative session starting next week to tackle a redistricting plan that could possibly yield two more seats for his party – although it’s uncertain that the plan has enough support among Republicans in the state Senate majority to succeed.\n \n\n   \n  Some Indiana Republicans have been among those resisting Trump’s moves, despite significant lobbying by the president and two visits to the state by Vice President JD Vance. Braun, a staunch Trump ally, has called legislators back to the statehouse to start working on a redraw next week.\n \n\n   \n  But on the same day that Braun announced the legislative session, Molly Swigart, a spokeswoman for the top Republican in the state Senate, said there still were not enough Republican votes to support redistricting in that chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Wednesday for an update, Swigart   responded: “I do not have anything new to share.”\n \n\n   \n  Prominent Republicans in the state, including former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, have opposed the redistricting. Under the current map, the GOP holds seven of the state’s nine US House seats.\n \n\n   \n  In a  recent Washington Post column , Daniels said the current map is fair and urged Republicans in the Hoosier State to continue to resist. “Someone has to lead in climbing out of this mudhole,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “We generally pride ourselves in doing what’s right, not what’s easy,” Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and former Indiana lawmaker, told CNN. “We take our time. We weigh things.”\n \n\n   \n  In another Republican-controlled state, Louisiana lawmakers this week took steps that could give their party an edge next year. Legislators voted to delay the state’s 2026 primary elections by a month to give them more time to draw new congressional lines if the US Supreme Court decides a redistricting case in the state’s favor.\n \n\n   \n    ‘An incredible Pandora’s box’\n \n\n   \n  While Republicans have structural advantages that allow them to rack up more seats through redistricting than Democrats can, Rubashkin of Inside Elections said the final outcome of the ongoing redistricting battle is unclear, particularly if next year becomes a wave election for Democrats, akin to 2018 midterm elections when the party gained more than 40 House seats during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  “If the partisan, national environment is favorable enough to one party or the other, you cannot redistrict your way into the majority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, Rubashkin added, the redistricting push now underway likely has changed US politics, by opening “an incredible Pandora’s box … that will persist long after this election cycle. I don’t see what will stop states that have the capacity from simply redrawing every two years.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/china/zion-church-crackdown-ezra-jin-trump-xi-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-11:22","title":"Grace Jin Drexel Appeals to Trump to Free Her Father Detained in China for Leading a Church","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, Ezra Jin Mingri, a pastor and founder of the underground Christian church Zion Church in China, was detained along with dozens of other members during a sweeping government crackdown.

She hopes Trump can free him in meeting with Xi \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, and CNN staff\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Grace Jin Drexel couldn’t contact her father on October 10, she tried not to panic. She had just heard that one of the pastors of his underground Christian church in  China  had been detained by authorities; maybe he was busy sorting out the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Then her fears were confirmed. Her father, Ezra Jin Mingri, and dozens of other members of Zion Church had been swept up in a mass crackdown across various congregations and Chinese cities – the largest suppression since  a similar wave of arrests in 2018. \n \n\n   \n  Chinese authorities have long seen Christianity as an unwelcome foreign influence and a threat to government control, experts say – and this crackdown sends a particularly stark message, targeting a well-known church that has been shut down once before.\n \n\n   \n  But Drexel and her family, all American citizens living in the US while Jin resided in China, hope a major diplomatic meeting this week might change that.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, US President Donald Trump is  meeting  Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. While trade is expected to dominate the conversation, there are growing calls for Trump to raise the issue of the crackdown and Jin’s detention.\n \n\n   \n  The summit presents “a very unique timing,” said Drexel, who works as a staffer in the US Senate. “We think that the Trump administration’s prioritization of Americans in this scenario also could be helpful for my father as well, to bring a family member of an American citizen home to be with us in the US and safe,” she told CNN on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not publicly commented on the issue, and it’s not clear whether it will be on the agenda on Thursday. Tensions remain high between the US and China, which reached a  framework agreement on trade  this week ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting, after a series of escalatory tariffs imposed on each other.\n \n\n   \n  But Drexel and her family see this as a rare window of opportunity before Jin’s potential indictment for illegally disseminating information online – which, Drexel said, would make his release much harder to negotiate.\n \n\n   \n  She and Jin have some powerful backers, including Secretary of State  Marco Rubio  and members of the  Congressional-Executive Commission on China. \n \n\n   \n  “We must make it clear to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) that the persecution of Christians and other people of faith must stop, and that the United States will use every tool, diplomatic and economic, to hold Chinese Communist officials accountable,” Sen. Ted Cruz said in a video shared by the Hudson Institute think tank, where Drexel’s husband works as a fellow.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, when asked about Rubio’s call for the pastors’ release, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “The Chinese government manages religious affairs in accordance with the law, protecting citizens’ freedom of religious belief and normal religious activities. We firmly oppose the US interfering in China’s internal affairs under the guise of so-called religious issues.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the foreign affairs office in Beihai, where Jin is detained, and to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau for comment.\n \n\n   \n    A string of crackdowns\n \n\n   \n  This crackdown is the latest in a long history of religious suppression in China. Religious practice is legal but tightly controlled and surveilled by the government, which registers “official” state-sanctioned churches.\n \n\n   \n  The government only recognizes five faiths: Chinese Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism and Taoism. Other local spiritual and religious movements have been subject to harsh crackdowns over the years. But that hasn’t stopped communities from creating their own underground, non-registered churches known as “house churches.”\n \n\n   \n  One 44-year-old Christian in Beijing told CNN she’d attended several “house churches,” and had seen plainclothes police officers entering and asking everyone to register themselves.\n \n\n   \n  During previous crackdowns, “when brothers and sisters were arrested, we would all donate money and send someone to visit them in jail and buy them food and clothes,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Zion Church is one such “house church” that the 44-year-old recalled attending in previous years. Jin founded Zion Church in 2007 in Beijing while his family was still living in China; it gradually became one of the largest churches in Beijing, Drexel said.\n \n\n   \n  By 2011, Jin was speaking out about crackdowns on other congregations, in the hopes underground churches might become legally recognized. “We are very aware of what we are doing,” he said in 2011, when he granted CNN rare access to film inside his church. “And we are ready to pay the price.”\n \n\n   \n  That price came in 2018. Drexel described a “pressure campaign” that year, with the government installing facial recognition cameras in the lobby of the church’s building after Jin refused to install them inside the church itself.\n \n\n   \n  Hoping to appease the authorities, Jin and his family moved to the US – and when the harassment toward church members in Beijing continued, Jin decided to return to China later that year while his family stayed behind.\n \n\n   \n  That was the last time most of the family saw Jin. The crackdown came soon after; Zion Church was shut down, and Jin was barred from leaving the country. In Chengdu, more than 100 worshipers from a different church were detained, and its pastor, Wang Yi, was jailed for nine years for “inciting subversion of state power.”\n \n\n   \n  Drexel visited her father in 2019 – and she, too, was prevented from leaving China for 11 months, derailing her plans to attend law school. She was eventually allowed to return to the US but hasn’t seen her father since.\n \n\n   \n  After 2018, Jin transformed Zion Church into a semi-virtual network, uploading sermons online and encouraging members around the country to gather and watch sessions together. When the pandemic hit, Zion was quick to adapt to Zoom – and the church’s membership exploded.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of the CCP’s own policy of locking people up inside their house, and there was nothing to do for people, a lot of people went to church (online), and it was the only place where you could interact with people,” Drexel said, referring to China’s stringent zero-Covid and lockdown policies at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The church became a national organization that now reaches 10,000 people each day, Drexel said. But there were also signs that it was once again under threat; authorities were watching Jin’s movements closely, and even blocked him from traveling to other cities within China. Church members reported an uptick in harassment and intimidation.\n \n\n   \n  A fellow Zion pastor asked Jin earlier this month: “What if this is the big thing, that they arrest everyone? What would happen?”\n \n\n   \n  “My dad did not hesitate one moment, and was not scared,” Drexel said. “He just said immediately, ‘Hallelujah, the gospel will spread further.’”\n \n\n   \n    Why now?\n \n\n   \n  The Zion pastors and church leaders arrested in October are now being kept in two detention centers in the southern city of Beihai, according to Drexel.\n \n\n   \n  Though a few have since been released, close to two dozen remain detained, she said.\n \n\n   \n  All the detainees are “innocent Christians,” the church said in a statement on October 12. “Their only ‘offense’ is worshiping God peacefully, preaching the Gospel faithfully, shepherding their flock, and serving their neighbors. These acts of faith are protected under both the Constitution of China and international human rights law.”\n \n\n   \n  It didn’t just happen to Zion, said Drexel – other underground churches have been targeted, too, including Bitter Winter and Early Rain Covenant Church.\n \n\n   \n  The detainees’ families are deeply worried, she said. Some are elderly with health problems, while others have young children at home. Her father, Jin, has severe diabetes – and while he’s now being provided generic medication, he hasn’t been able to receive the prescription issued by his doctor, she said.\n \n\n   \n  And in a rare development that Drexel credits to the international attention on their case, most of the detainees have been granted legal representation.\n \n\n   \n  Jin’s lawyer said he appears in “relatively good spirits,” said Drexel – he even joked that the bad food in detention was good for controlling his diabetes.\n \n\n   \n  But the stakes are high under China’s opaque judicial system, which legal observers say has a conviction rate around 99%. Wang Yi, the pastor arrested in 2018, is still in prison today.\n \n\n   \n  Drexel is still trying to understand why the CCP under Xi – whose grip on power has tightened since 2018 – is so threatened by “this small group of Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  One theory, she said, points to China’s ongoing economic hardships. Wary of growing public discontent, the government may “try to clamp down on everything, including freedom of speech and other civil and society organizations,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Fenggang Yang, a professor of sociology and director of the Center on Religion and the Global East at Purdue University, partially agreed. While he’s not convinced it has to do with the current economic situation, he emphasized that the churches pose a deep ideological threat to Xi, who has tightened religious regulations since taking office and increasingly emphasized the need to “Sinicize” religions.\n \n\n   \n  “The Chinese authorities always considered Christianity as one of the institutions that pose the greatest challenge – for (starting a) color revolution, for changing people’s attitudes towards the government,” Yang said.\n \n\n   \n  The detainees don’t seem to be a particularly high priority for either Trump or Xi ahead of their meeting, he added.\n \n\n   \n  As the world watches for signs of easing US-China tensions out of their leaders’ high-stakes talks, Drexel has a much simpler wish: she just wants her dad back.\n \n\n   \n  “I just wanted to emphasize that my dad went back to China because he had a deep love for China and Chinese people,” she said. “We want to be able to keep being faithful to our God, as well as to serve our community and serve China.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/national-guard-dc-extension-february-2026","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00-04:00","title":"Exclusive: National Guard orders in DC extended through February 2026","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Guard’s deployment in Washington, D.C., originally scheduled to end in November 2025, has been extended through February 2026 under the direction of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, despite legal challenges from the city’s attorney general.

remain mobilized in the city at least through February 2026, according to people familiar with the guard’s orders.\n \n\n   \n  The troops’ orders had been expected to lapse at the end of November before Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth extended them, which has not been previously reported.\n \n\n   \n  The  DC mobilization  is currently the subject of a legal fight between the Trump administration and DC’s attorney general, who has requested that a judge order the removal of the roughly 2,000 troops from DC’s streets.\n \n\n   \n  As of Wednesday morning, there were 2,387 National Guard troops mobilized in DC, including from DC, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama. The pay for those guard members has also been in jeopardy as part of the ongoing government shutdown. The mission is costing roughly $1 million daily.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said in August he was mobilizing the guard in DC to help fight crime. The troops are on Title 32 orders, meaning they are authorized to conduct law enforcement activities, as opposed to Title 10 orders which means they are federalized and therefore barred by law to engage in law enforcement activities.\n \n\n   \n  But since they arrived in the city over two months ago, guard members have largely been tasked with “beautification” efforts around the city, including cleaning up parks, laying mulch and picking up trash.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that there was frustration with the mission’s unclear timeline, particularly as troops often leave behind higher-paying civilian jobs while deployed with the guard.\n \n\n   \n  A  previous extension  through November was largely intended to ensure the continuity of benefits for service members and their families, a senior official familiar with the planning previously told CNN. Guard members do not typically qualify for things like health care benefits or housing allowances unless they are on orders for more than 30 days.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration has also left the door open for how long the mission could continue. In August, Vice President JD Vance said if Trump “thinks that he has to extend this order to ensure that people have access to public safety, then that’s exactly what he’ll do.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/federal-prosecutors-january-6-mob-of-rioters-taranto","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:46:00-04:00","title":"Two Federal Prosecutors Placed on Leave After Describing January 6 Attack as 'A Mob of Rioters' in Court Document","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White, were placed on leave after a sentencing memo described the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack as a 'mob of rioters,' prompting backlash and scrutiny.

January 6, 2021   attack at the US Capitol as stemming from a “mob of rioters”  in a sentencing memo  Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The two prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White, were notified of their suspension hours after they submitted a sentencing request for Taylor Taranto, the person said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump pardoned Taranto for charges related to his participation in January 6, but the Washington man still faces gun charges stemming from his arrest in the summer of 2023, when he was  detained nearby President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, home .\n \n\n   \n  When describing Taranto’s history, prosecutors wrote that, “On January 6, 2021, thousands of people comprising a mob of rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol while a joint session of Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.”\n \n\n   \n  The original sentencing memo, dated Tuesday, was removed from the court docket Wednesday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  A  new sentencing memo  was posted by different prosecutors late Wednesday that removed all references to January 6 or the Trump social media post that Taranto reposted, which included an alleged address for President Barack Obama, where Taranto was arrested the next day.\n \n\n   \n  In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  They asked the judge to sentence him to 27 months behind bars. That same punishment is still being requested by prosecutors in the new memo.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested in June, 2023 in Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood after claiming on an internet livestream that he had a detonator, law enforcement officials  told CNN at the time,  and was searching for underground tunnels that led inside Obama and other’s homes.\n \n\n   \n  Valdivia and White wrote in Tuesday’s memo that after “then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama,” Taranto had re-posted Trump “and thereafter started livestreaming from his van” as he drove through Obama’s neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by a federal judge of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors have said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.\n \n\n   \n  The move to place federal prosecutors on leave follows a list of other firings in US Attorney’s offices.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration fired the top national security prosecutor in the nearby US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia,  Michael Ben’Ary,  earlier this month after a social media post by a  right-wing activist and writer falsely tied  him to  the case of FBI Director James Comey .\n \n\n   \n  The former US Attorney of the same Eastern District, Erik Siebert, resigned in September after mounting pressure to bring charges against  New York Attorney General Letitia James , and was replaced by a White House advisor who lacked prosecutorial experience.\n \n\n   \n  Another prosecutor in the Alexandria, Beth Yusi, was  dismissed earlier this month  after drafting a memo outlining why prosecutors believed there was not enough evidence to bring charges against James.

Chicago, Illinois (AP) — A  Democratic congressional candidate  in Illinois has been accused of blocking a federal agent’s vehicle during September protests outside an immigration enforcement building in suburban Chicago, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.   \n \n\n   \n  The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of  excessive force .\n \n\n   \n  Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by US District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court  blocked the order  before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on September 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.\n \n\n   \n  Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.\n \n\n   \n  Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.\n \n\n   \n  Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on September 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.\n \n\n   \n  A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”\n \n\n   \n  She’s running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring US Rep. Jan Schawkosky.\n \n\n   \n  Protesting the  immigration crackdown around Chicago  has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.\n \n\n   \n  “As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,” she said. “I hope you won’t either.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/shutdown-talks-thune-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-04:00","title":"Rank-and-file senators engage in 'shadow negotiation' in search for shutdown end","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Rank-and-file senators from both parties are engaging in behind-the-scenes 'shadow negotiations' to end a 29-day government shutdown, focusing on resolving the funding impasse for key programs like food stamps through full-year appropriations bills and addressing the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies.

8:17 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A group of rank-and-file senators increasingly frustrated by the weeks-long stalemate on Capitol Hill believe they have found a possible path to end the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear if it will work.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, this gang of Republicans and Democrats have been engaged in a dual-track negotiation. One of their goals is to resolve the impasse on health care and reopen the government for the next few weeks. They are also hoping to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments, including the US Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps, through next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the private conversations that are going on are trying to create like a shadow negotiation, so that we have some clarity about what we need to vote on,” Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, one of those involved in the conversations, told CNN on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But these senators still face an uphill climb to get their warring parties on the same page. Their task has been made more complicated by GOP leaders’ fierce commitment not to negotiate with Democrats on health care until Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his members agree to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Thune appeared to suggest on Wednesday that he would have a conversation with those involved in the negotiations. Asked if he would personally engage with centrist Democrats involved in the talks, Thune told CNN: “I think that will happen pretty soon.”\n \n\n   \n  But his office later told CNN that he remains unwilling to discuss any Obamacare policy changes until the government is open. And Thune stressed he could not guarantee any resolution to Democrats: “I’ve offered up a process. I can’t guarantee an outcome or result,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the emerging talks are a fresh sign of optimism inside a gloomy Capitol building. Finally, after weeks of total gridlock with half of Congress not even present in Washington, there appears to be some movement. The push comes as members of both parties brace for worsening effects of the shutdown, including the lapse of food stamps for the first time in the program’s history starting this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mike Rounds suggested that — if party leaders agreed — the Senate could vote as early as next week on full-year spending bills that would allow Democrats to move on past the current funding fight and pivot to longer-term spending bills.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re focused on - Is there a way for our Democratic colleagues to save face and perhaps not vote directly to a continuing resolution?” Rounds said, referring to the same stopgap bill that Democrats have blocked more than a dozen times. Instead, he said, Republicans would put the bipartisan, full-year spending bills on the floor “as a way around the continuing resolution.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once that’s moving, maybe then we’ll look at a continuing resolution,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers have faced increased pressure to reopen the government this week with  crucial safety net programs  – including federal food assistance for more than 40 million people – at risk of shuttering in the coming days. Thune’s remarks come hours after he and numerous other senators voiced a rare sense of optimism that there could be a way out of the 29-day shutdown. Still, neither side has made any commitments publicly.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s ticked up significantly and hopefully that’ll be a precursor of things to come,” Thune told reporters earlier in the day when asked about the status of talks with rank-and-file Democrats. “But yeah, there’s a lot of higher level of conversation.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders, Thune said, are not involved in the negotiating. Asked whether he thought there would be enough moderate Democrats in the mix to reach a deal that would reopen the government, he expressed optimism.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a possibility that could happen. So, let’s just hope that the conversations continue,” he said, noting he’s “being kept briefed and read-into most of those conversations. I’m hoping something here very soon will be fruitful.”\n \n\n   \n  One Democrat involved in the talks, who requested anonymity to speak on the discussions, told CNN the conversations Thune cited are real. The Democrat would not elaborate on whether they were focused solely on resolving the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies or if other matters – such as the White House’s recent moves to flout Congress’ spending power through “rescissions” – were also involved.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether the talks could offer a way out of the shutdown, the Democrat would only say: “Maybe.”\n \n\n   \n  One component of the ongoing talks – how to win support in the Senate for full-year appropriations bills that would prevent another shutdown cliff in the coming weeks. Two other Democrats involved in the discussions suggested to CNN that they are interested in those long-term bills as part of an off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about whether emerging talks involved full year spending bills, Democratic Sen. Gary Peters said he didn’t “want to get into specifics but clearly that would be nice.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, told CNN that “it’s accurate to say we’re pushing for full-year appropriations bills because that’s what we should be doing,” when asked whether the party was pursuing them as a way out of the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen, who has been involved in the talks, declined to confirm Thune’s assessment that they are making progress, but said, “I think there have been good discussions. That’s all I’m going to tell you about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and has been perhaps the most vocal Republican calling for bipartisan talks, told reporters Wednesday that she was “encouraged” by the direction of talks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that there are, have been enough of the pieces that have been talked through that if, if somebody can just diagram out how it all comes together and present that — Yes, I do believe it’s possible to kind of come together quickly,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no great magic in how we get out of this. It’s the same stuff we’ve been talking about for months,” added Murkowski.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, said that he did not think that Republicans had offered anything new in the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  “There have been, there are occasional talks between Democrats and Republicans on this issue, but our Republican colleagues don’t seem to be offering anything different than what their leadership has had so far we hope that will change,” the New York Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t want to pit health care and food. They do, we think you can have both.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/middleeast/analysis-gaza-ceasefire-israel-strikes-new-normal-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-04:00","title":"Gaza’s new normal is a truce without peace","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gaza has entered a fragile and cyclical 'new normal' of ceasefires that are short-lived and frequently violated, despite being brokered by the United States.

new normal is a truce without peace \n       \n  Analysis by Oren Liebermann, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Anyone who looked at the situation in Gaza  on Tuesday  might reasonably have concluded that the ceasefire had collapsed.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli forces in Gaza came under grenade and sniper fire in Rafah, according to the military, killing an Israeli soldier. In retaliation, Israel unleashed punishing strikes across Gaza that killed more than 100 people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n \n\n   \n  The US-brokered ceasefire looked like it had disintegrated. But by Wednesday morning, both Hamas and Israel had announced they were once again committed to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  It was the second violent escalation since the  ceasefire  took effect on October 10. But, just like the fighting that occurred nine days later, when two Israeli soldiers and at least 36 Palestinians were killed, it was short, ending within a matter of hours.\n \n\n   \n  Gaza’s new normal seems to be a ceasefire that is both fragile and durable. A truce that holds in general but can vanish in an instant, only to be restored within hours or days.\n \n\n   \n  Until the next escalation.\n \n\n   \n  This situation between all-out conflict and a comprehensive peace provides no closure: Palestinians will be in constant fear of the next wave of deadly strikes, while Israel will teeter perpetually on the brink of war.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week the ceasefire was “not going to be a linear journey.” It would have “ups and downs” and “twists and turns,” he said. Vice President JD Vance said yesterday there would be “little skirmishes here and there.” And yet both were optimistic about the ceasefire holding.\n \n\n   \n  The deal was imposed in large part by the sheer willpower of US President Donald Trump, who reined in Israel, while mediators pressured Hamas to accept. It will take continued US interest to keep the deal intact, especially during the next phase, which requires the creation of an international force for Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas, among other difficult tasks.\n \n\n   \n  The ceasefire’s fragility is a function of the chasm between what the agreement has so far accomplished and what it has yet to achieve. The fighting has largely stopped. Hamas has turned over the living hostages and more than half of the deceased. Israel has pulled back to the yellow line that demarcates the first withdrawal position inside Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But in the current limbo between the nearly complete first phase of the agreement and the far more difficult second phase, which requires a more complete withdrawal and an end to the war, Israeli forces occupy more than half of Gaza’s territory.\n \n\n   \n  According to Muhammad Shehada, a Gaza expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, that territory includes isolated Hamas cells trapped in tunnels and outside the militant organization’s command and control. With limited resources and no connection to Hamas’ remaining leadership, each cell is “a catastrophe in the making,” Shehada says.\n \n\n   \n  “The closer those IDF vehicles come to a tunnel or to a hideout to those disconnected, isolated militants or the more they run out of food, the higher the chances that they emerge in battle with Israeli soldiers,” Shehada told CNN. “They would rather die in combat than die of starvation or wait for the IDF to find them.”\n \n\n   \n  After the first major violation of the ceasefire on October 19, Hamas issued a statement saying that “contact with the remnants of our groups” in areas like Rafah had “been cut off since the resumption of hostilities in March.” It is these “remnants” that Shehada says are ticking “time bombs.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hamas doesn’t even know how many are there that are still alive,” said Shehada.\n \n\n   \n  Israel and Hamas have engaged in short, sharp escalations many times prior to this war. In 2018 and 2019, the two exchanged fire in rounds of hostilities that would frequently end within 48 hours. But now these escalations are almost exclusively in one direction, with Israel unleashing its firepower on Gaza against a depleted Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire started, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the vast majority during two days of escalation on October 19 and 28. Three Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza during the same period.\n \n\n   \n  Yoav Limor, military and defense analyst for the right-wing Israel Hayom newspaper, says more conflict is inevitable, and it will take US involvement to keep the deal from falling apart.\n \n\n   \n  “Hamas will remain Hamas: it will grow stronger and continue to carry out attacks. Anyone who believes it has changed does not understand the movement or the nature of the region,” said Limor. “That is why Washington must push forward and advance the next phase of the ceasefire deal and work to edge Hamas out of power. Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate.”\n \n\n   \n  The US has sent a parade of its top officials to monitor the ceasefire and begin to create the mechanisms needed for the next phase of the deal, including humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of Gaza. It is a tremendous expense of political capital, but it has signaled to Israel – and to the region – that the White House remains engaged as all the details are still being worked out. The US is determined to keep the process moving forward, even if progress is incremental.\n \n\n   \n  In the short-term, Limor said, “it is likely that the ceasefire will hold this familiar patten of violence and response.” Israel is preparing for an election year during which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be wary of resuming a total war. Hamas is also looking for a  hudna , or period of calm, in which it can recuperate and rebuild, he said.\n \n\n   \n  To break this pattern of a ceasefire marred by violent escalations – and prevent the emerging new normal – requires major progress on some of the 20-point plan’s most difficult conditions, including the disarmament of Hamas and creating new governance in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  At a press conference on Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Hamas was willing to cede power in Gaza, even as he acknowledged that Doha was “trying to push them all in order to get to a point where they acknowledge that they need to disarm.”\n \n\n   \n  He said Hamas needs to be ready to move to the next stage of the deal. “We need to make sure the Palestinians are safe and the Israelis are safe … creating a political horizon for the Palestinian people and creating a Palestinian agency that will be able to be the sole holder of arms.”\n \n\n   \n  If that cannot be done, Israelis and Palestinians will remain in limbo, trapped in a short-term truce without peace that offers no long-term prospect for a solution.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/us/abby-zwerner-teacher-shooting-trial","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"19:55:00-04:00","title":"Trial Underway in $40 Million Lawsuit Filed by Teacher Shot by 6-Year-Old Student","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A civil trial is underway in a $40 million lawsuit filed by former Virginia elementary teacher Abby Zwerner, who was shot in her classroom by a 6-year-old student in January 2023.

school teacher who was shot in her classroom by a 6-year-old student saw emotional testimony Wednesday from her sister along with descriptions of the injuries.\n \n\n   \n   Abby Zwerner , who taught first grade at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, is suing a former assistant principal for $40 million, saying she ignored multiple warnings the boy had a gun in the hours before the January 2023 shooting. Zwerner was shot in the hand and chest as she sat at a reading table.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the key developments from Day 2 of the trial, which is set to continue Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit accuses former school administrator Ebony Parker of failing to act after four people went to her with  concerns  the student brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s attorney, Diane Toscano, said in opening statements Parker made “bad decisions and choices that day.”\n \n\n   \n  Parker had the authority but failed to search the student, remove him from the classroom and call law enforcement, Toscano added.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting occurred on the first day after the student had returned from a suspension for slamming Zwerner’s phone two days earlier, Toscano said. It sent shock waves through the community and the country, with many wondering  how a child so young could get access to a gun  and shoot his teacher.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner  spent nearly two weeks in the hospital , required six surgeries and does not have the full use of her left hand.\n \n\n   \n  “No one could have imagined that a 6-year old, first-grade student would bring a firearm into a school,” Parker’s attorney, Daniel Hogan, told jurors. “You will be able to judge for yourself whether or not this was foreseeable.

If they run an ad we don’t like, we’ll increase the tariffs by 10%.”\n \n\n   \n  Kaine did acknowledge that this resolution likely won’t advance beyond the Senate, but he insisted it can still send a message to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “I did learn … in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this.

Republicans in Congress actually vote to rebuke Trump \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:25 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s no secret at this point that congressional Republicans are loathe to vote against President Donald Trump. Fealty to Trump has become the animating principle in the party – so much so that GOP lawmakers have willfully relegated themselves to second-class citizens in Washington as they’ve steadily ceded their powers and prerogatives to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But all of that makes it even more striking when they decide to actually stand up for themselves, for once.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s now happened twice just this week.\n \n\n   \n  Enough Senate Republicans voted against Trump’s tariffs on Brazil and Canada so that a majority of the chamber has now expressed its opposition to both. They did so even after the White House  mobilized Vice President JD Vance  to try to prevent the rebukes.\n \n\n   \n  So when have Republicans in Congress actually been willing to vote against Trump? It’s most often happened with foreign policy.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s run through the big examples.\n \n\n   \n    The tariffs\n \n\n   \n  These were not large-scale GOP defections, but they were large enough that they enabled the  GOP-controlled chamber to rebuke the president.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, four GOP senators – Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – voted to terminate Trump’s national emergency declaration to impose tariffs on Canada. That meant the measure passed with 51 votes.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined them to  make it five Republicans voting against Trump’s tariffs on Brazil . The overall vote was 52-48, against Trump.\n \n\n   \n  (Tillis has raised concerns about Trump’s tariffs before. He said he voted against the Brazil tariffs, specifically, because they appeared to be related to Brazil’s prosecution of Trump-allied former President Jair Bolsonaro rather than actual trade disputes.)\n \n\n   \n  Then on Wednesday, the same four GOP senators voted against the Canada tariffs again.\n \n\n   \n  It’s highly unlikely the House will ever vote on terminating these tariffs. In fact, the GOP-controlled House actually took action earlier this year  to prevent such votes . And these senators could go much further if they wanted to in trying to force the issue.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s significant that a majority of the GOP-controlled Senate is rebuking Trump on his tariffs, and it certainly undercuts his supposed mandate on the issue.\n \n\n   \n    2017: The Russia sanctions\n \n\n   \n  This was perhaps the first big congressional rebuke of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  During the early portions of the Russia investigation, Congress  passed new sanctions against Russia  that the Trump White House explicitly opposed. The legislation  also gave Congress additional powers to block Trump from easing existing Russia sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The measure passed almost unanimously in both GOP-controlled chambers – 98-2 in the Senate and 419-3 in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ultimately signed the legislation – likely knowing Congress could simply override his veto – while claiming it contained “a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.”\n \n\n   \n    2018: Ending US involvement in Yemen\n \n\n   \n  The Senate  voted 56-41  in late 2018 to end US support for the Saudi Arabia-led war in Yemen. The move came shortly after Trump signaled a solid relationship with the Saudis despite their murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n \n\n   \n  Seven Senate Republicans voted in favor.\n \n\n   \n    2019: No NATO withdrawal\n \n\n   \n  With Trump occasionally flirting with a withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in his first term, the Democratic-controlled House in early 2019 passed legislation to make that more difficult.\n \n\n   \n  It  voted 357-22  to prohibit funds from being used to withdraw from the alliance.\n \n\n   \n    2019: The Syria rebukes\n \n\n   \n  Few Trump moves have alienated congressional Republicans likes the ones he made in Syria in 2019. And they led to separate rebukes in both the Senate and the House.\n \n\n   \n  After Trump moved to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan, the GOP-controlled Senate passed nonbinding amendments expressing its opposition.

The changes are meant to accelerate approvals of cheaper alternatives to medications that treat a wide range of illnesses, leading to increased market competition and lower drug costs for Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Biologic drugs are developed using living sources such as bacteria, yeast and animal cells, which inherently creates  more variation  and makes manufacturing more complex than for chemically derived drugs. Biologics have a special pathway to FDA approval, and  biosimilars  — alternatives to the brand name products — have long been treated differently than other generic drugs.\n \n\n   \n  As part of Wednesday’s announcement, the FDA released new  draft guidance  that proposes allowing companies to scale back on the studies and trials needed to prove that a biosimilar product is similar enough to an existing FDA-approved product.\n \n\n   \n  “Biosimilars are often far more affordable to patients and have the promise to significantly lower health care costs in America,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a statement. “By streamlining the biosimilar development process and helping advance interchangeability, we can achieve massive cost reductions for advanced treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and rare disorders affecting millions of Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  Biologic medications account for just 5% of prescriptions in the US but more than half of total drug spending, according to the FDA. The agency has  approved only 76 biosimilars  as of early October, it says, and only about 1 in 10 biologic drugs that will lose patent protection in the next decade currently has a biosimilar in development.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed changes will help drug companies cut the time needed to bring a biosimilar to market in half and can slash development costs by $100 million, Makary said at a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “The fastest-growing area of health care spending in the United States is drug spending, and the fastest area of drug spending increases is with this new class of medicines called biologics,” he said. “Lower prices for drug development means lower R&D costs and lower drug prices for everyday Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  The first biosimilar approval in the US happened in 2015. In analyzing data from the decade since, the FDA says that clinical efficacy studies that directly compare a biosimilar to its reference product to confirm that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy “add little scientific value compared with analytical testing.”\n \n\n   \n  The new guidance “reduces this unnecessary resource-intensive requirement for developers to conduct comparative human clinical studies,” which can take years and cost tens of millions of dollars, the agency said. Instead, it allows drug developers “to rely instead on analytical testing to demonstrate product differences.”\n \n\n   \n  Humira is an injectable biologic drug used to treat several autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, and has been one of the top-selling medications since it was approved by the FDA in 2002. Ten biosimilars for Humira have been approved since 2016, but the first one just became available in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  “The fundamental problem in health care is that we have non-competitive markets,” Makary said. “When you have that gap, it allows a longer period of no competition. So we want to see more competition, and we want to see more innovation.”\n \n\n   \n  In June, Truveta Research analyzed prescription trends for nearly 67,000 people taking Humira. It found that between January 2023 and April 2025, about 13% of them had evidence of switching to a biosimilar. But among those who switched, about 13% had evidence of switching back to Humira.\n \n\n   \n  “This means for every 100 people on bio-originator Humira, 13 switched to a biosimilar, and 2 switched to a biosimilar and then switched back to bio-originator Humira,” Truveta wrote in a  research blog post. \n \n\n   \n  The switch to biosimilars “may reflect changes in insurer policies, growing trust among providers and patients in biosimilars, or broader shifts in the drug market,” Truveta researchers wrote, but “initial switches may not always be sustained despite lower cost.”\n \n\n   \n  “Notably, nearly 40% of patients who returned to bio-originator Humira did so within 30 days of initiating a biosimilar, suggesting early dissatisfaction [or] adverse reactions. Given that many patients switched back before completing a typical Humira dispense, this pattern may also reflect fear or uncertainty about switching to a biosimilar,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Biosimilars are not exact copies of reference drugs like other generic drugs, and there’s an added layer of approval needed for a biosimilar to be considered “interchangeable” — a classification that allows pharmacists to substitute it without consulting a prescriber.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said Wednesday that it also plans to remove regulatory barriers — generally recommending against “switching studies” — required for biosimilars to receive this classification.\n \n\n   \n  “Science continues to evolve, and the FDA remains committed to advancing common-sense policies that further promote efficient and effective biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar development, without compromising safety and effectiveness,” Dr. George Tidmarsh, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA’s new guidance for biosimilars could start to make an impact quickly, said John Murphy, president and CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group for generic and biosimilar drugmakers.\n \n\n   \n  “I think you will start to see clinical development and investment capital allocation decisions happen fairly quickly,” he said. Drug development will still take time, but there could be meaningful signals of change in pipeline strategies made within the next three to six months.\n \n\n   \n  Lower costs for biosimilar development could also encourage drugmakers to broaden their scope to include biologic products with smaller patient markets, Murphy said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, experts say there are additional challenges to ensure that insurance plans and other health care economics allow for investment into biosimilars and create competition as intended.\n \n\n   \n  “We welcome the administration’s focus on increasing biosimilar access and affordability,” Alex Schriver, senior vice president of public affairs for PhRMA, a trade group representing pharmaceutical companies, said in a statement. “Policymakers must fix the misaligned incentives and business practices by middlemen who block biosimilars and profit off medicines at the expense of patients.”\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s announcement is among several steps by the Trump administration to lower drug costs, including an executive order calling for drugmakers to offer drugs to US patients with the lowest, or “ Most Favored Nation ,” price and the creation of a “ TrumpRx ” direct-to-consumer website for certain drugs.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said in a  fact sheet  that costly drugs can lead to people skipping doses and abandoning treatment, and many people face insurance coverage gaps and high deductibles.\n \n\n   \n  “With today’s action, the FDA aims to help more companies bring affordable, high-quality biosimilars to market and reduce costs for the American people,” the agency said in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/economy/fed-october-rate-decision","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00-04:00","title":"Fed Chair Powell Says Don’t Count on a December Rate Cut","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to a range of 3.75%–4.00% in a second rate cut this year, the lowest in three years, amid growing uncertainty due to a prolonged government shutdown.

one from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who backed a larger, half-point cut; and another from Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who preferred to hold borrowing costs steady.\n \n\n   \n  It is the first time since 2019 that there were dueling dissents — both calling for easier and tighter policy — underscoring the heated debate among officials over how President Donald Trump’s sweeping policies on trade, immigration and spending are affecting the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  To make matters more complicated, it was also the first time officials have set monetary policy while lacking an entire month of crucial government employment figures in the modern era.\n \n\n   \n  Central bankers began to lower rates last month after data through August showed employers were adding jobs at the weakest pace since 2010. Major companies such as Amazon and Target have recently announced tens of thousands of layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The problem: A prolonged government shutdown could stand in the way of further rate cuts, especially with some officials such as Schmid concerned about persistent inflation pressures in the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” Powell said.\n \n\n   \n    Powell on the Fed flying blind\n \n\n   \n  Powell made it clear that the Fed doesn’t have the full picture of the economy’s health without government data.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s latest policy statement noted that “more recent indicators” were “consistent” with earlier data, before the shutdown, that showed weak hiring and slightly higher unemployment.  Powell said as much when taking reporters’ questions.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s just no story over the last four weeks, it’s kind of stable,” he said. “You don’t see anything that says that the job market, or really any part of the economy, is making a significant deterioration.”\n \n\n   \n  Data from payroll software provider ADP released this week showed that hiring picked up in September, but remained weak. And while there have been prominent layoff announcements in recent weeks, that doesn’t immediately translate to higher unemployment. Workers who’ve been laid off sometimes receive generous severance packages.\n \n\n   \n  Powell mentioned that private data cannot replace government figures, which are widely known as the “gold standard” of measuring the world’s largest economy. And the persistent absence of those figures could put future rate cuts at risk.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious,” Powell said.\n \n\n   \n    Powell on the lingering question of tariff inflation\n \n\n   \n  The inflation situation also remains murky, Powell said.\n \n\n   \n  So far, inflation hasn’t surged due to new tariffs that have gone into effect, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, largely thanks to businesses managing higher costs without passing the buck to consumers.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed chief said that officials expect “that there will be some additional increased inflation because it takes a while for tariffs to work their way through the production chain and, finally, get to consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  Economists widely expect tariff inflation to pick up as well, especially if Trump makes good on his recent tariff threats.\n \n\n   \n  The September CPI, which was released last week despite the shutdown, for Social Security’s cost-of-living adjustment, was cooler than economists had predicted, but it showed persistent price pressures that could worsen because of Trump’s tariffs. Trump is meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jingping late Wednesday US time for a wide-ranging discussion in South Korea, which will likely include a potential US-China trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  Powell reiterated that there’s a “reasonable” expectation that tariff inflation may be short lived, which helped pave the way for September’s rate cut. But that would also remain unclear if the October CPI, which is scheduled for November 13, isn’t released because the shutdown persisted. Fed officials normally look to the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, widely known as their preferred inflation measure, but that figure also hasn’t been released due to the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Powell said once the tariffs have kicked in, the hope is that “they stop generating inflation,” reflecting a one-off effect.\n \n\n   \n  “This is how we believe and hope that it will work out,” Powell said.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate decision, policymakers announced the end of a three-year process to shrink the size of their enormous portfolio by December 1.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s portfolio, or balance sheet, reached about $9 trillion in mid-2022, but is now around $6.6 trillion after a careful effort to reverse the stimulus it introduced into the economy during the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s a tool that works in the background while the Fed’s key interest rate does much of the heavy lifting to achieve its macroeconomic goals. Officials have judged that the balance sheet is close to a more normal state.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/entertainment/snl-kevin-nealon-claustrophobia-makeup","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:50:00Z","title":"Kevin Nealon Says He Developed Claustrophobia After Being Fitted with a Fake Chin to Play Jay Leno on 'SNL'","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kevin Nealon, a former 'Saturday Night Live' cast member, recounted how the process of creating a fake chin to impersonate Jay Leno during a live performance led to severe claustrophobia and agoraphobia.

\n        5:42 PM EDT, Wed October 29, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  During an expedition to search for a famed shipwreck, researchers discovered something unexpected: striking geometric patterns on the floor of Antarctica’s western Weddell Sea created by fish.\n \n\n   \n  The seafloor had once been obscured beneath a thick ice shelf, but that changed in July 2017 when the massive  A68 iceberg  calved from the Larsen C Ice Shelf. The iceberg measured 2,239 square miles (5,800 square kilometers) — about the size of Delaware.\n \n\n   \n  Seizing an opportunity to study the previously hidden seafloor, researchers organized the Weddell Sea Expedition 2019 with two goals in mind: exploring the biology of the western Weddell Sea and searching for the wreckage of the HMS Endurance, which became trapped and  ultimately ripped apart by ice  in 1915.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers set sail in January 2019 for a 49-day expedition aboard the South African polar research vessel SA Agulhas II. Ironically, the expedition experienced extreme sea ice conditions similar to what Endurance faced more than a century earlier, preventing the team from conducting a search for the wreck.\n \n\n   \n  “The sea ice in particular was a challenge as at the time there was a bottleneck and a build of sea ice around that area — we were heading directly towards this, playing chicken with icebergs as we went,” said Dr. Michelle Taylor, senior lecturer in the School of Life Sciences at the UK’s University of Essex. Taylor is the coauthor of a new study published Wednesday in the journal  Frontiers  about what the expedition uncovered.\n \n\n   \n  Despite not finding the wreckage, the expedition captured invaluable underwater footage of marine life that inhabits the frigid depths of the Weddell Sea. The research vessel’s remotely operated underwater vehicle, nicknamed Lassie, spied a series of nests arranged in distinct shapes sprawling across the seafloor.\n \n\n   \n  “Over a thousand maintained nests within the areas studied goes to show that exploration of our world is still underway, with constant new findings,” lead study author Russ Connelly, postgraduate researcher in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Essex, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The discovery  showcases the diversity of life that exists in a place experiencing rapid climate change — which is why scientists are petitioning for the Weddell Sea’s fragile ecosystem to be protected by law.\n \n\n   \n  (The HMS Endurance shipwreck was ultimately  discovered during a 2022 expedition .)\n \n\n   \n    A geometric neighborhood\n \n\n   \n  As Lassie passed over the Weddell seafloor, large dimples appeared in the sand. The round spots seemed neat compared with their surroundings, clear of the layers of decomposing plankton spotted elsewhere on the seafloor.\n \n\n   \n  “This was the first time we have seen this area of seafloor, so there is always a realm of mystery to be expected,” Connelly said.\n \n\n   \n  When scientists looked at the video footage that Lassie took, they noticed fish and fish larvae within the dimples. A closer look revealed the fish to be a species of rockcod called Lindbergichthys nudifrons, otherwise known as the yellowfin notie. The fish are found from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia in the Atlantic section of the  Southern Ocean , Connelly said.\n \n\n   \n  “These species are extremophiles; they thrive in high-pressure and cold-water environments,” Connelly said. “They build small, circular nests in the fine sediment, and then the males guard the eggs for around 4 months. Their main threat comes from predators on the seafloor, like brittle stars and predatory worms, which try to eat the eggs.”\n \n\n   \n  The researchers also noticed that the 1,036 active nests, located across five sites on the seafloor, showcased six different patterns.\n \n\n   \n  There were clusters of nests  found close together or overlapping, and crescents of nests arranged in a curved line, like a crescent moon. Other nests were evenly spaced in a straight line, arranged in an oval shape with even spacing around the perimeter or following a distinct U-shape.\n \n\n   \n  There were also individual, isolated nests, which were typically larger than any that were arranged in a specific shape, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  The finding marks the first time that complex patterns have been observed in yellowfin notie nests.\n \n\n   \n  Clusters were the most common arrangement, representing more than 42% of the nests, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  The team believes the patterns represent a strategy for survival against predators. For those living in cluster patterns, the fish at the center receive the most protection from predators. The researchers think this arrangement represents the  “selfish herd” theory , “where individuals reduce their domain of danger by putting other individuals between themselves and an approaching predator,” the study noted.\n \n\n   \n  Previous research has shown that yellowfin notie males will defend territories up to 9.8 inches (25 centimeters) away from their nests, which would mean their neighbors are also protected within the cluster arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  “In the absence of refuge, they can group together to form greater levels of protection,” Connelly said.\n \n\n   \n  The fish are likely protecting against ribbon worms, or Parborlasia corrugata, a type of nemertean, observed living in the vicinity. The ribbon worms detect chemical signals from their environment to find food.\n \n\n   \n  “(The clusters) could create a confusing sensory environment for the nemertean, making it more difficult to detect and target a single nest, a crucial adaptive strategy during the long incubation period (for the eggs),” the authors wrote in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the isolated nests on the outskirts of the fish communities are thought to belong to larger, stronger members of the species capable of defending their own nests.\n \n\n   \n    Protecting a vulnerable place\n \n\n   \n  The ice-covered Weddell Sea is a challenging place to study, but it’s home to a diverse community of fish, brittle stars, sponges, cephalopods, marine birds and mammals.\n \n\n   \n  Another expedition to the Weddell Sea in 2021 observed a vast colony of icefish, or Neopagetopsis ionah, with  see-through skulls and transparent blood .\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Autun Purser, a senior researcher in deep-sea ecology and technology at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, led the 2021 icefish research. While he did not participate in the new research, Purser said he believes both studies benefited from underwater camera systems that can spot patterns within extensive fish nests.\n \n\n   \n  “With mobile camera systems, we can now investigate larger structures and areas of seafloor in studies than was possible in the past,” Purser said.\n \n\n   \n  Return trips to the Weddell Sea have confirmed that such nesting behaviors are more abundant within the icy ecosystem, he added.\n \n\n   \n  He also said he suspects that species within the environment, such as the icefish and the yellowfin notie, benefit from rocks dropped by icebergs as they drift and melt. In the new study, the authors noted that 14.9% of the active nests had pebbles within or around them.\n \n\n   \n  “(The rocks) are ideal to lay eggs on as they allow good oxygenation of the eggs, helping to prevent rotting on the seafloor, whilst also providing a barrier to animals living within the muds to eating the eggs,” Purser noted. “The soft sediments make a ridge wall around these eggs, furthering defense. … It is just an idea, but I like it.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors believe the new research provides crucial evidence of breeding habitats that strengthens the idea of the  Weddell Sea Marine Protected Area , proposed by the  Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources .\n \n\n   \n  “If successfully designated as (a marine protected area), it would mean these vulnerable marine ecosystems are protected,” Connelly said. “It is incredibly important to explore and study these unique environments before we lose something we never knew we had.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/world/morocco-charged-over-2400-gen-z-protests-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:45:00Z","title":"Morocco Charges Over 2,400 People Over Gen Z Protests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Morocco has launched a sweeping legal crackdown, charging over 2,400 people in connection with youth-led Gen Z 212 protests that began in October 2025.

Instead, the justices appear to be debating one of the administration’s more nuanced justifications for the deployment.\n \n\n   \n  “Although we can’t know for sure, the order certainly seems like a bad sign for President Trump,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “There would be no need for the Supreme Court to ask the parties to address this question if five justices had already agreed to vote for the federal government on one of the other two possible grounds.”\n \n\n   \n  The order comes as multiple courts have been reviewing deployments to other cities – most notably, Portland, Oregon. In that case, the full 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said this week that it will re-review a decision in Trump’s favor.\n \n\n   \n  The call for additional written arguments is almost certainly a response to a  brief submitted  in the case by a Georgetown University Law Center professor, Martin Lederman, who suggested the law Trump is relying on to deploy the Guard to the Chicago area doesn’t apply to civilian law enforcement agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  Rather, Lederman argued, the National Guard can only be called forth under that law to augment regular military forces. In its order Wednesday, the Supreme Court asked the Department of Justice and officials in Illinois to address that very issue in a series of new briefs due through mid-November.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has argued that calling up the guard is necessary to confront protesters at an ICE facility outside Chicago that he has claimed are engaged in “coordinated, violent opposition to the enforcement of federal law.” He has relied on a federal law that allows a president to take that action if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the litigation, Trump has argued that the protestors are impeding ICE operations. Therefore, he has claimed, ICE has been unable to execute federal immigration laws.\n \n\n   \n  But Lederman dropped a new twist into the case with a brief earlier this month: When the law refers to “regular forces,” he said, it meant the regular military, not civilian law enforcement agencies like ICE.\n \n\n   \n  “There can hardly be any question that the term ‘the regular forces’ in the 1908 Act…referred to the standing, professional military forces, who were commonly known as ‘Regulars,’” Lederman wrote. “The effect of the law was to prescribe the National Guard as the ‘second line of defense, as a supplement to the regular army.’”\n \n\n   \n  Now, both the Trump administration and local officials in Illinois will file a series of briefs debating that issue.\n \n\n   \n  In the Chicago case, Trump federalized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard earlier this month to “protect officers and federal property” outside of Chicago. Another 400 federalized members of the Texas National Guard were also deployed to the state. The administration said those guard members would serve “solely in a protective capacity” and would not engage in law enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied heavily on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison’s order to mobilize during the War of 1812.\n \n\n   \n   The Supreme Court rejected Mott’s argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/defense-contractor-hacking-tools-russia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"16:46:00Z","title":"Former US defense contractor employee pleads guilty to selling hacking tools to buyer in Russia","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Australian former employee of a U.S. defense contractor, Peter Williams, pleaded guilty to selling advanced hacking tools—originally meant for exclusive U.S. government and allied use—to a Russian software exploit broker.

Here's what that would mean \n         By Geoff Brumfiel \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:06 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump said on Thursday that  the U.S. would begin testing nuclear weapons again  for the first time in decades. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We've halted many years ago, but with others doing testing I think it's appropriate to do so,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. Experts say that the resumption of testing would be a major escalation and could upend the nuclear balance of power. \"I think a decision to resume nuclear testing would be extremely dangerous and would do more to benefit our adversaries than the United States,\" said Corey Hinderstein, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for Nuclear Peace. Here's what a test would involve, and why the president might be calling for one now. There's currently only one place America could test a nuke — near Las Vegas, Nevada The Nevada National Security Site , approximately 60 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is currently the only place where America could test a nuclear weapon, said Robert Peters, a senior research fellow for strategic deterrence at the Heritage Foundation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Nevada site is around 1,300 square miles in size, larger than the state of Rhode Island. Starting in the 1950s, scientists conducted atmospheric nuclear tests at the site, but from 1962 to 1992, testing was done underground. Today, testing would likely be done in \"a complex of deep underground mineshafts,\" Peters said. Scientists dig a deep shaft either directly below ground or into the side of a mountain. They then put a nuclear device in a chamber at the end of the shaft and seal it up. The detonation is contained by the rock, reducing the risk of atmospheric fallout. Although underground testing is far safer than atmospheric testing, it still carries risks, said Hinderstein. In the past, some radioactive fallout has leaked from test shafts. Additionally, the test could shake buildings as far away as Las Vegas, and Hinderstein said some of the newer buildings in Vegas could even be at risk of damage. \"All of these big high-rises — including Stratosphere, including the Trump Hotel,\" she said. \"They're not designed for massive, significant seismic activity.\" America's last test in Nevada was over 30 years ago At the end of the Cold War, the world's major nuclear powers declared a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. Russia, then the Soviet Union, tested its last nuclear weapon in 1990, the U.S. conducted its final test in 1992, and China conducted its last test in 1996. The voluntary test moratorium has been in place as part of an effort to maintain nuclear stability. The U.S currently uses scientific experiments and supercomputer simulations to make sure its bombs still work. Last year, NPR was one of a handful of organizations granted  rare access  to the top-secret underground tunnels where the tests take place. Scientists working in the tunnels said they were confident they could continue to ensure the safety of America's nuclear weapons without testing. Although a full-scale nuclear detonation would be \"complementary\" to current experiments, \"our assessment is that there are no system questions that would be answered by a test, that would be worth the expense and the effort and the time,\" Don Haynes, a nuclear weapons scientist from Los Alamos National Laboratory told NPR as they walked through the tunnels. Indeed Hinderstein says, preparing for a nuclear test is no small matter. While a basic demonstration test could be done in approximately 18 months. Conducting a test that would produce scientifically useful data would likely take years. Trump's announcement is likely reacting to some recent tests by Russia On Sunday,  Russia announced  it had conducted a successful test of a new nuclear-powered cruise missile. Then on Wednesday President Vladimir Putin announced the successful test of another doomsday weapon —  a nuclear-powered underwater drone , which Russia says can be used to attack coastal cities. Trump never called out Russia by name, but he did suggest recent testing was behind the announcement. \"I see them testing,\" he said aboard Air Force One, \"and I say, 'Well if they're going to test I guess we have to test.'\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While testing nuclear-powered weapons is not the same as testing nuclear weapons themselves, Russia's tests are highly provocative. They come just months before the expiration of the last nuclear treaty between the U.S. and Russia, designed to put limits on their arsenals. The back-and-forth has all the hallmarks of the start of an arms race, noted Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation for American Scientists. \"We saw this play out throughout the Cold War through nuclear testing, nuclear deployments, nuclear investments,\" he said. Many experts warn that now is not the time to resume nuclear testing Hinderstein, who served as a deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency responsible for America's nuclear weapons, from 2021 to 2024, said that a decision to resume testing would not be in America's interests. By the end of the Cold War, the U.S. had conducted more than a thousand nuclear tests — far more than any other nation (China, by comparison, had conducted just 45). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Other nations \"have more to gain by resuming nuclear testing than the United States does,\" she said. Testing would likely be expensive, adds Paul Dean, vice president for global nuclear policy at the Nuclear Threat Initiative. \"The cost estimates I've seen have been at around, ballpark, $140 million per test,\" he said. \"It's not necessary to conduct a nuclear explosive test right now,\" agreed Robert Peters of the Heritage Foundation. But he added, \"But there could very well be compelling reasons to test in the coming months and years. That's how bad things are getting.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   It has been 33 years since the United States last tested a nuclear weapon. Now President Trump says he wants to do it again. Here he is on Air Force One earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, we have more than anybody. But I see them testing. I say, well, if they're go to test, I guess we have to test. SUMMERS: What might the president mean by that? Let's bring in NPR science and security correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Hi. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Hi there. SUMMERS: So Geoff, the president said, if they're going to test, I guess we have to test. So I guess my question is, who's they? BRUMFIEL: Yeah. It wasn't entirely clear from what he said, but experts I spoke to today agree it's almost certainly Russia. On Sunday, Russia announced it had successfully tested a nuclear-powered cruise missile. Then yesterday, it said it had tested a nuclear-powered torpedo. Now, nuclear-powered things obviously aren't the same as nuclear bombs, but both the missile and torpedo are designed to carry nuclear warheads. And these tests are very provocative because these devices could get around Trump's proposed Golden Dome missile defense system. SUMMERS: OK. So if the U.S. were to test a nuclear weapon, let's say, what would be involved? BRUMFIEL: Well, first of all, there's only one place they can do it, and that's in the desert outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. It's a place called the Nevada National Security Site. It's absolutely massive. I was out there last year. It's bigger than the state of Rhode Island. SUMMERS: Huh. BRUMFIEL: Basically, they dig a hole, bury the weapon thousands of feet underground, and then they detonate it. Corey Hinderstein is at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and until last year, she was high up in the agency that manages America's nuclear weapons. She told me this. COREY HINDERSTEIN: The president is talking about sending a signal. And if the goal is to shake the ground, then we could do it on the timeline that he's required. BRUMFIEL: But the test site is not ready to do a really scientific test. They don't have the experiment design. They don't have the instrumentation. That kind of test would take years to develop because the U.S. hasn't tested since 1992. SUMMERS: Well, why has it been so long since the U.S. tested a nuclear weapon? BRUMFIEL: At the end of the Cold War, the world's great nuclear powers voluntarily stopped testing kind of as a gesture of goodwill. That voluntary moratorium has held in part because the U.S. has spent billions of dollars on supercomputers to simulate nuclear weapons. They like to call it a bang in a box. And actually, many experts told me the moratorium works to the U.S.' advantage. They have data from over a thousand nuclear tests already on the books. China, by contrast, for example, has just 45. Hinderstein says America's adversaries would gain a lot more from additional testing than the U.S. would. HINDERSTEIN: While we could potentially gain incrementally - but even that is questionable - they could stand to gain a lot and not suffer the political hit by being the first to resume testing. BRUMFIEL: I should add, there are possible environmental consequences too. Radioactive material can leak from underground sometimes. And there's some concern that shaking from the test could actually damage buildings all the way in Vegas. SUMMERS: So Geoff, the Russians have tested these new weapons, and America may test a nuclear bomb for the first time in decades. So I do have to ask, is this a new arms race? BRUMFIEL: You know, the experts I spoke to were divided on that. During the Cold War, we had so many nukes, and so did the Russia. It was sort of insane. Now, things aren't as bad as they used to be, but everyone agrees these are the dynamics that drive an arms race. You know, one side does one thing, and then the other side says, I've got to look strong, so I'm going to respond with something else. So there's a lot of concern over what's happening. SUMMERS: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, thank you. BRUMFIEL: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591347","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:29:00-04:00","title":"A judge is set to decide whether SNAP benefits can be cut off on Saturday","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Boston, Indira Talwani, is poised to rule against cutting off SNAP benefits during a government shutdown, rejecting the Trump administration's claim that emergency funds are insufficient.

 \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 3:29 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         BOSTON — A federal judge indicated Thursday she is inclined to take steps to ensure that  federal food assistance  keeps flowing to 42 million Americans who depend on it. Trump administration officials say because of the government shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, will be cut off on Saturday.  \"The well has run dry,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, posted on  its website . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Democratic governors and attorneys general from some two dozen states  sued the federal government  to keep the payments coming, arguing SNAP benefits are an entitlement that cannot legally be cut off. They also make the case that stopping benefits would cause irreparable harm to millions of Americans, and to the state governments who will be left to deal with the fallout. The Trump administration had argued the opposite; officials say they are legally  prohibited  from extending the benefits by using emergency funds. But after an hour of arguments in Boston federal court Thursday, Judge Indira Talwani wasn't buying it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Congress put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency,\" Talwani said. \"It's really clear to me that what Congress was trying to do was protect the American people,\" she said, and she believes it was lawmakers intent to ensure that in the event of something like a shutdown, \"we're not going to make everyone drop dead because it's a political game someplace else.\" Even if the emergency fund is tapped for SNAP benefits, administration officials say its $5.5 billion falls short of the $9 billion needed to fully cover the whole month of November. They say recalculating benefits and arranging for partial payments would be a logistical nightmare — and could take weeks. That means millions of Americans would still see some delay in receiving their next benefit, and they would also be receiving less than usual. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95841","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:43:00-04:00","title":"King Charles III strips Prince Andrew of his titles and evicts him from the Royal Lodge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has removed Prince Andrew from royal residence and stripped him of his princely title, following allegations of a connection with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and claims made by victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre.

That would be unconstitutional \n         By Tamara Keith \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Flying on Air Force One somewhere between Japan and South Korea, President Trump, after repeatedly teasing it, appeared to finally acknowledge a third term isn't in the cards. \"I have my highest poll numbers that I've ever had,\" Trump said wistfully. \"And you know, based on what I read, I guess I'm not allowed to run. So we'll see what happens.\" Trump's job approval rating,  as tracked by Gallup , is not in fact at a high point — though at 41% he isn't at his lowest point, either. Saying \"we'll see what happens\" is a standard Trump line that leaves his options open. Though, in this case, legal experts say there is no way around the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution. It states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"There are many parts of the Constitution that are unclear,\" said Rick Hassen, who specializes in election law at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"But the 22nd Amendment is quite clear: no more than two terms. And it was passed because there was a president who served more than two terms and the country thought that that was not good.\" While Trump has previously floated the prospect of a third term, the issue came up again most recently when Steve Bannon, an on-again off-again Trump ally and MAGA mastermind, began talking about a third Trump term as a certainty. How Bannon stirred the pot \"Well, he's going to get a third term,\" Bannon said in  a recent interview with The Economist . \"Trump is going to be president in '28 and people just ought to get accommodated with that.\" Asked about the Constitution, Bannon said, \"There's many different alternatives.\" In an April interview  with  Morning Edition  host Steve Inskeep , Bannon gave slightly more detail. \"We're working on some things that are well inside the Constitution … and I think people will agree there will be very smart workarounds,\" Bannon said, before adding that talk of a third Trump term is \"exploding liberals' heads, exploding progressives' heads that Trump's going to be with them forever.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It would be easy to chalk this up as wishful thinking or even just trolling from a professional provocateur trying to ingratiate himself to Trump. But the president himself has kept it going, too. Monday on Air Force One, when asked about Bannon's assertions about a third term, Trump said he would \"love to do it\" and again said it is \"very terrible\" to have such good numbers. Asked if that meant he was \"not ruling it out,\" Trump said, \"You have to tell me.\" Though he also suggested that Republicans have a strong bench of potential 2028 candidates and said a ticket featuring Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be unbeatable. He did bat down one of the possible loopholes floating around — that he could run for vice president and then return to office after the elected president steps aside. \"I think the people wouldn't like that,\" Trump said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\" But, just like Bannon, Trump leaves the option of somehow staying in office dangling out there. What Congress has to say about that Just outside the Oval Office, red campaign-style \"Trump 2028\" hats sit on a bookcase of merchandise the president shows off to visitors. \n       \n       Twitter \n       Last month, when Democratic leaders visited the White House to talk about averting a government shutdown,  the hats appeared on the resolute desk mid-meeting .  \"It was the strangest thing ever,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN afterward. \"I just looked at the hat, looked at JD Vance, who was seated to my left and said, 'Don't you got a problem with this?' And he said 'no comment' and that was the end of it.\" That is, until the White House tweeted out photos of the meeting with the hats looming large. As Trump talked repeatedly about a third term this week, members of Congress were asked to weigh in, too. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday he didn't see a path to a third Trump term because amending the Constitution takes a long time. \"I think the president knows, and he and I have talked about the constrictions of the Constitution,\" said Johnson. \"As much as so many of the American people lament that. The Trump 2028 cap is one of the most popular that's ever been produced, and he has a good time with that, trolling the Democrats whose hair is on fire at that very prospect.\" In an  interview with NPR's  Here & Now  on Wednesday, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also said Trump was simply trolling. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Brendan Nyhan, a government professor at Dartmouth College, says it doesn't really matter if at this moment the president is serious or not. \"We are probably going to hear about it for the next three years, because he enjoys it,\" said Nyhan. \"It gets the kind of reaction he wants and it serves his political purpose.\" Trump is both making liberals' heads explode — as Bannon put it — and trying to delay becoming a lame duck president, whose power wanes as the campaign to replace him heats up. Nyhan said the fact that anyone is talking about it is a symptom of what he calls an \"authoritarian malaise\" in the country. \"It's profoundly destabilizing to call into question something as blatant as the 22nd Amendment, which explicitly rules out what Trump is 'joking' about,\" said Nyhan, who leads Bright Line Watch, which monitors the status of American democracy. \"We've seen again and again him joking about things that he means to encourage or at least seems to give tacit approval to.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In his second term, Trump has massively expanded his executive power, as Republicans in Congress largely either cheer or shrug. \"Is it possible that he could try to suspend elections, suspend the Constitution, run for a third term,\" said Hassen, who leads UCLA's Safeguarding Democracy Project. \"All of these things are possible, but that means we are no longer the American democracy that we've had, and then the country's in real trouble. But if you're asking about a legal path to a third term, it's just not there.\" Plus, he asked slyly, would Trump really want to run for a third term against former President Barack Obama? ( Trump says he would .)

Here he is last night on Air Force One. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Based on what I read, I guess I'm not allowed to run. So we'll see what happens. MARTIN: The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution clearly states, no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice. So why is Trump talking about it again? NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith digs in. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: This week's outbreak of Trump 2028 mania began when Trump ally and MAGA mastermind Steve Bannon sat down for an interview with The Economist. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE BANNON: Well, he's going to get a third term. So Trump '28. Trump is going to be president in '28, and people just ought to get accommodated with that. KEITH: Asked about the 22nd Amendment, he said there are many different alternatives, but he didn't detail them. Bannon said nearly the same thing back in April in an interview with MORNING EDITION host Steve Inskeep. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) BANNON: We're working on some things that are well withinside the Constitution, and it'll be very - I think people will agree that'll be... STEVE INSKEEP: Give me an example. BANNON: ...Very smart workarounds. INSKEEP: Give me an example of one thing. BANNON: I don't want to whet your appetite. Let's get through... INSKEEP: (Laughter). BANNON: ...Let's get through the hundred days. INSKEEP: You've already whetted my appetite. BANNON: Let's get through - no, because it's exploding liberals' heads, progressive heads that Trump's going to be with them forever. KEITH: Now, it would be easy to chalk this up as Bannon stirring the pot, but President Trump himself has kept it going. Here he was on Air Force One, Monday morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever. It's very terrible. I have my best numbers. If you read it... UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: You're not ruling out a third term? TRUMP: ...If you read it - am I not ruling it out? You'll have to tell me. All I can tell you is... KEITH: He did bat down the idea of running for vice president and then assuming the presidency. But just like Bannon, Trump leaves the possibility of a third term dangling out there. Here he was back in March, again, on Air Force One. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I'm just telling you, I've had more people say, please run again. I said, we have a long way to go before we even think about that. KEITH: I followed up, asking, are you planning to leave office on January 20, 2029, or are you saying you might not? He looked directly at me and then looked over my head. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Go ahead. Any other questions? KEITH: The president stocks red Trump 2028 hats on a bookcase of merch just outside the Oval Office. Last month, when Democratic leaders visited to talk about averting the government shutdown, the hats showed up on the president's desk, as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HAKEEM JEFFRIES: It was the strangest thing ever. And I just looked at the hat, looked at JD Vance, who was seated to my left, and said, don't you got a problem with this? And he said, no comment. KEITH: Yesterday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he didn't see a path to a third Trump term. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE JOHNSON: I think the president knows - and he and I have talked about the constrictions of the Constitution, as much as so many of the American people lament that - the Trump 2028 cap is one of the most popular that's ever been produced, and he has a good time with that. KEITH: So is it all just a troll? Brendan Nyhan is a professor of government at Dartmouth College. BRENDAN NYHAN: We're probably going to hear about this for the next three years because he enjoys it. It gets the kind of reaction he wants, and it serves his political purpose. KEITH: Trump is both making liberals' heads explode, as Bannon put it, and trying to delay becoming a lame duck president - less relevant than those competing to replace him. Again, Nyhan. NYHAN: It's profoundly destabilizing to call into question something as blatant as the 22nd Amendment, which explicitly rules out what Trump is, quote, \"joking\" about. And we've seen again and again him joking about things that he means to encourage or at least, you know, seem to give tacit approval to. KEITH: In his second term, Trump has massively expanded his executive power as Republicans in Congress either cheer or shrug. But Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA, says, there's no nuance in the 22nd Amendment. RICK HASEN: Is it possible that he could try to suspend elections, suspend the Constitution, run for a third term? All of these things are possible, but that means we're no longer the American democracy that we've had, and then the country's in real trouble. But if you're asking about a legal path to a third term, it's just not there. KEITH: Plus, he asks, would President Trump really want to run against former President Barack Obama?

The comet is special both because it is interstellar — meaning it came from outside our solar system — and also because nickel vapor was detected in the gas surrounding the comet. This comet,  called 3I/ATLAS , is only the third such interstellar object to enter our solar system in recorded history. Observing such a rare occurrence is \"extremely valuable for us,\" because it's the only opportunity to look at this object before it moves out of our solar system, said Darryl Z. Seligman, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University, who is coordinating international teams of scientists that are observing 3I/ATLAS. Rohan Rahatgaonkar, a Ph.D. student at the Instituto de Astrofísica-Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, and Thomas Puzia, who led the team there that made the discovery, were among the authors of a new  research paper  describing the nickel vapor detection. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The findings are notable because the nickel   gas surrounding 3I/ATLAS was detected at a huge distance from the sun (nearly four times Earth's distance from the sun) where temperatures are too cold for metals to normally vaporize, Rahatgaonkar told NPR in an interview. \"It was pretty clear that it was nickel,\" Puzia said of the data. \"So it was super, super exciting.\" Puzia cautions that there's still a lot of evidence collection and research to be done into what these findings could mean. But this study into  3I/ATLAS  opens the door for new insights into the chemistry of objects and materials that originate far outside of our solar system and are likely billions of years old, he said. The comet could be older than our solar system 3I/ATLAS was first confirmed on July 1 to be the third interstellar object known to have come into our solar system, in a sky survey by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). When Rahatgaonkar and another student, Baltasar Luco, were set to observe the comet through the Southern Astrophysical Research (or SOAR) Telescope in Chile, they were not looking for nickel vapors. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But over multiple days of observations with the Very Large Telescope in Chile and as 3I/ATLAS continued its journey closer to the sun, Rahatgaonkar and other researchers found that levels of nickel vapor continued to increase. They measured the nickel using a host of instruments including a spectrograph and by looking at characteristics of the light coming off the comet. Rahatgaonkar and Puzia also credit a team of researchers around the world, using telescopes and other instruments, for helping to observe and analyze data on the comet. The analysis of this object is far from over. As it continues its journey close to the sun, it will undergo thermodynamic changes which will cause reactions that could, hopefully, give scientists more clues about where 3I/ATLAS was formed, how it evolved, what it carries and many more potential answers, Puzia said. This particular interstellar comet \"could be maybe older than our solar system,\" Rahatgaonkar said. The chemical signatures being emitted from 3I/ATLAS \"reflect the ancient origin and its long journey through interstellar space.\" Rahatgaonkar, Puzia and Seligman emphasized how valuable interstellar objects are to understanding star systems outside of our own solar system. They offer chemical and physical details from those systems and where they formed, potentially billions of years ago. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95855","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:12:00-04:00","title":"Judge sentences Jan. 6 defendant for hoax threat near Obama's home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge sentenced Taylor Taranto, a Navy veteran from Pasco, Washington, to time served for making a hoax threat near the home of former President Barack Obama in 2023, which prompted a massive law enforcement response involving bomb squads and sniffer dogs.

Obama two years ago, prompting a massive law enforcement response that included a bomb squad and sniffer dogs. Taylor Taranto, of Pasco, Wash., spent 22 months in the troubled D.C. jail facility while he waited for trial on allegations that he suggested his van was rigged with explosives.  Authorities never found any such devices, though they did recover firearms and a machete. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols noted that Taranto had no criminal history — partly because the Justice Department had previously moved to dismiss several charges related to Taranto's participation in the siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. President Trump  granted clemency  to Taranto and virtually every Jan. 6 defendant on the first day he returned to the White House this year. But the storming of the Capitol and the Justice Department response to it continue to reverberate, especially within the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington. Trump and his cabinet officials are trying to rewrite the history of that day, in part by firing or forcing out law enforcement officials who investigated cases related to the riot.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This week the Justice Department sidelined two veteran prosecutors who had worked on the Taranto case and took the rare step of withdrawing a sentencing memo they had filed. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro declined to comment on any personnel decisions but in a statement said \"we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously.\" \"We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target,\" Pirro said in the statement. Original sentencing memo sealed, replaced The original sentencing memo in Taranto's case detailed how a \"mob of rioters\" attacked the seat of government as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 election. It also mentioned that Taranto headed in the direction of Obama's home after Trump reposted an address of a location on social media. A replacement sentencing memo, filed by a new pair of DOJ lawyers, scrubbed both of those references. The electronic court docket last night listed the original memo as sealed. Judge Nichols said it was \"not entirely clear\" how that memo had come to be sealed and that he intended to release it unless the DOJ could justify keeping it hidden. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The judge did not press the new attorneys for details about the rare, last-minute personnel switch. But he went out of his way to praise the sidelined prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White. \"I just want to express my view that they did a commendable and excellent job in this case,\" Judge Nichols said. \"They also held the highest standards of professionalism.\" At a press conference on a D.C. crime issue, Pirro declined to answer whether she ordered the original sentencing memo in the Taranto case to be revoked. \"I think the papers speak for themselves and what goes on in this office is not something I'm going to comment on to the press,\" Pirro said. Valdivia and White listened on from the audience in the sixth floor courtroom, surrounded by some of the lawyers who had supervised hundreds of Capitol riot cases — only to be fired or forced out of the Justice Department this year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Taranto, a Navy veteran with two children, has since returned home to Washington state. He will be required to serve three years of supervised release, undergo a mental health assessment, and to avoid firearms and controlled substances. \"There's nothing that he did, in fact, that was violent,\" said defense attorney Carmen Hernandez. \"The firearms were in a locked compartment in a van.\" Taranto signaled he would appeal in the coming weeks. He used his brief time before the judge to address what he called \"deeply troubling issues concerning our founding, our history\" and \"election fraud for the 2020 election.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591301","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:31:00-04:00","title":"GOP Senators Join Democrats to Rebuke Trump on Tariffs for a Third Time This Week","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A bipartisan group of four Republican senators — Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell, and Rand Paul — joined Democrats in voting to roll back President Trump’s emergency tariffs on Canada and Brazil, marking a rare internal Republican rebuke.

Kaine said the strategy behind Trump's tariff policy amounted to, \"Announce tariffs on everyone, then announce that they may be suspended or delayed while I work out one-on-one deals.\" Earlier this week, the same four Republican senators joined Democrats to approve resolutions to terminate tariffs on  Brazil  and Canada that were announced using emergency powers. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., joined Democrats to terminate the Brazil tariffs, which he argued specifically had no rational basis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The vast majority of Senate Republicans voted against the measures, with many saying that at this point they're counterproductive to the president's tariff program. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said  Trump's new plans to lower China's tariffs  Thursday were a good reminder. Trump announced the plans after meeting in South Korea with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.  \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit. President Trump already announced new trade deals,\" Crapo said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. \"Other deals are, hopefully, forthcoming.\" However, the success of this week's resolution votes, which only needed a simple majority to pass, may not go far. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., installed a special rule to block such votes in the House, so they're currently unlikely to reach the floor. Even if they were to somehow pass the House, President Trump would almost certainly veto them. Still, the vote marked a test of support for the president's tariff policies among Republicans, reflecting unease inside the party about their impacts on the U.S. economy, and specifically the farming and manufacturing sectors. It came ahead of  arguments at the Supreme Court  this fall in a case challenging Trump's authority to put sweeping tariffs in place using emergency powers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Thursday's vote wasn't the first time Senate Republicans took up Trump's authority to set global tariffs. In April, a similar measure failed 49 to 49. That same month,  a measure to block tariffs on Canada drew a simple majority in the Senate . \"Since then our nation's trade policy has looked pretty much like a dog chasing a squirrel,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a lead co-sponsor of the global tariffs resolution, said on the Senate floor on Thursday. \"More tariffs threatened, added, taken away, thousands of packages being destroyed because the customs service wasn't prepared, secretive deals to lift tariffs for certain companies and products that have influence at the White House.\" The Republicans who broke ranks did so despite a lobbying push by Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and urged them to back the president's policies. Vance told reporters after the lunch meeting that the tariffs are critical leverage for Trump in international negotiations. But Tillis, for example, was one of those Republicans not convinced when it came at least to the Brazil tariffs. \"I just don't think there's a rational basis for it,\" Tillis said. Trump triggered the Brazil tariffs this summer to pressure the country's government to end what he called a \"witch hunt\" against his ally, former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Last month, Bolsonaro was sentenced to  27 years in prison  for attempting a coup to stay in power following his 2022 election defeat. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587760","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"15:02:00-04:00","title":"Are you worried about your SNAP benefits?

 \n\n         SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Cuba — The rumble of large machinery, whine of chain saws and chopping of machetes echoed through communities across the northern Caribbean on Thursday as they dug out from the destruction of Hurricane Melissa and surveyed the damage left behind. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In Jamaica, government workers and residents began clearing roads in a push to reach dozens of isolated communities in the island's southeast that sustained a direct hit from one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record. Stunned residents wandered about, some staring at their roofless homes and waterlogged belongings strewn around them. \"I don't have a house now,\" said Sylvester Guthrie, a resident of Lacovia in the southern parish of St. Elizabeth, as he held onto his bicycle, the only possession of value left after the storm. Emergency relief flights began landing at Jamaica's main international airport, which reopened late Wednesday, as crews distributed water, medicine and other basic supplies. Helicopters dropped food as they thrummed above communities where the storm flattened homes, wiped out roads and destroyed bridges, cutting them off from assistance. \"The entire Jamaica is really broken because of what has happened,\" Education Minister Dana Morris Dixon said. Police said at least 14 people have died in Jamaica, and they expected the death toll to keep rising. In one isolated community, residents pleaded with officials to remove the body of one victim tangled in a tree. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       More than 13,000 people remained crowded into shelters, with 72% of the island without power and only 35% of mobile phone sites in operation, officials said. People clutched cash as they formed long lines at the few gas stations and supermarkets open in affected areas. \"We understand the frustration, we understand your anxiety, but we ask for your patience,\" said Daryl Vaz, Jamaica's telecommunications and energy minister. Water trucks have been mobilized to serve many of Jamaica's rural communities that are not connected to the government's utility system, Water Minister Matthew Samuda said. Slow recovery in Cuba In Cuba, heavy equipment began to clear blocked roads and highways and the military helped rescue people trapped in isolated communities and at risk from landslides. No deaths were reported after the Civil Defense evacuated more than 735,000 people across eastern Cuba ahead of the storm. Residents were slowly starting to return home Thursday. The town of El Cobre in the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba was one of the hardest hit. Home to some 7,000 people, it is also the site of the Basilica of Our Lady of Charity, the patron saint of Cuba who is deeply venerated by Catholics and practitioners of Santería, an Afro-Cuban religion. \"We went through this very badly. So much wind, so much wind. Zinc roofs were torn off. Some houses completely collapsed. It was a disaster,\" said Odalys Ojeda, a 61-year-old retiree, as she looked up at the sky from her living room where the roof and other parts of the house were torn away. Even the basilica wasn't spared. \"Here at the sanctuary, the carpentry, stained glass and even the masonry suffered extensive damage,\" Father Rogelio Dean Puerta said. A televised Civil Defense meeting chaired by President Miguel Díaz-Canel did not provide an official estimate of the damage. However, officials from the affected provinces — Santiago, Granma, Holguín, Guantánamo, and Las Tunas — reported losses of roofs, power lines and fiber optic telecommunications cables, as well as roads cut off, isolating communities, and heavy losses in banana, cassava and coffee plantations. Many communities were still without electricity, internet and telephone service because of downed transformers and power lines. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In an unusual statement Thursday, the U.S. State Department said the United States was \"ready to assist the Cuban people.\" A press release said the U.S. \"is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance directly and through local partners who can deliver it more effectively to those in need.\" The statement did not specify how the cooperation would be coordinated or whether contact had been made with the Cuban government, with which it maintains a bitter conflict that includes six decades of economic and financial sanctions. Death and flooding in Haiti Melissa also unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, where at least 30 people were reported killed and 20 others were missing, mostly in the country's southern region. Some 15,000 people also remained in shelters. \"It is a sad moment for the country,\" said Laurent Saint-Cyr, president of Haiti's transitional presidential council. He said officials expect the death toll to rise and noted that the government was mobilizing resources to search for people and provide emergency relief. Haiti's Civil Protection Agency said Hurricane Melissa killed at least 20 people, including 10 children, in Petit-Goâve, where more than 160 homes were damaged and 80 others destroyed. Steven Guadard said Melissa killed his entire family in Petit-Goâve, including four children ranging in age from 1-month to 8-years-old. Michelet Dégange, who has lived in Petit-Goâve for three years, said Melissa left him homeless. \"There is no place to rest the body; we are hungry,\" he said. \"The authorities don't think about us. I haven't closed my eyes since the bad weather began.\" When Melissa came ashore in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane with top winds of 185 mph (295 kph) on Tuesday, it tied strength records for Atlantic hurricanes making landfall, both in wind speed and barometric pressure. Melissa was a Category 2 storm with top sustained winds near 105 mph (165 kph) Thursday night and was moving northeast at 32 mph (51 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. The hurricane was centered about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west-southwest of Bermuda. Melissa brushed past the southeast Bahamas on Wednesday, forcing officials to evacuate 1,400 people ahead of the storm. Melissa was forecast to pass near or to the west of Bermuda late Thursday and may strengthen further before weakening Friday. Bermuda's international airport was to close Thursday evening and reopen Friday at noon, while all schools on the wealthy British territory were ordered closed. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589172","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:04:00-04:00","title":"Scientists Thought This Fossil Was a Teen T. rex.

Turns out it's a new tyrannosaur \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:04 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         It's known as the \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" fossil: A triceratops and a tyrannosaur, skeletons entangled, locked in apparent combat right up until the moment of their mutual demise. Even in the Hell Creek Formation in eastern Montana, a spot known for great finds, this specimen was, in a word, \"fantabulous,\" says  Clayton Phipps , a self-described rancher, cowboy and dinosaur hunter. That discovery in 2006 now appears to have overturned decades of dinosaur dogma about  Tyrannosaurus rex , the fearsome giant long thought to be the sole top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. In a paper in the journal  Nature , paleontologists  Lindsay Zanno  and  James Napoli  conclude that some of the bones from that specimen belong not to a teenage  T. rex , but to a fully grown individual of a different tyrannosaur species —  Nanotyrannus lancensis . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The majority of paleontologists, after some debate, had dismissed the idea that any other tyrannosaurs existed besides  T. rex . And yet, the sands of Montana seem to have disgorged a second one. In a broader analysis of other fossils, the two researchers also uncovered what they say is a third tyrannosaur species, formerly presumed to be a juvenile  T. rex . \"We knew the specimen was exceptional,\" says Zanno. \"We did not realize it would turn decades of research about  T. rex  on its head.\" \"Just insanely good\"   The Montana dig began on a breezy summer day when Phipps' friend, Mark Eatman, found an exposed pelvis and femur at the bottom of a canyon. Phipps thought maybe there was half a dinosaur hidden below. But after two weeks of digging, Phipps and his older cousin revealed that those bones belonged to a stunning triceratops. \"It was crazier than any site I've ever done before or since because every bone is in place,\" he says. \"The skeleton was just all together — just insanely good.\" Then, while excavating the light yellow sand from around the specimen, Phipps spotted something the color of chocolate. It was a claw. But triceratops didn't have claws. \"I'm like, 'What?' I start brushing and all of a sudden this arm starts to appear and part of the leg,\" he recalls. \"Oh man, my hat went in the air about 200 feet. I was like, 'No way — there's another dinosaur in here.'\" This was a bipedal,  carnivorous  dinosaur, entwined with the triceratops. \"Just laying like they died,\" says Phipps. The scientific consensus pegged this second dinosaur as a teenage  Tyrannosaurus rex  — a conclusion that would soon be overturned. Teenage angst A few years ago, the nonprofit  Friends of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences  acquired the fossils and rock they were encased in (some 30,000 pounds) from Phipps and donated them to the museum. \"They were a Christmas present waiting to be unwrapped,\" he says. Zanno, who is head of paleontology at the museum, was thrilled. \"It's one of the most incredible specimens from the late Cretaceous in North America I've ever seen,\" she says. She and the museum built  an entire wing around the dueling dinosaurs  to house a live-action research experience. \"It's the only place in the world where you get to enter the working paleo-lab without a barrier and talk to the scientific team that's working on the fossils,\" says Zanno. When that work began, Zanno also figured the carnivorous dinosaur was the world's most complete juvenile  T. rex  ever found. \"But as soon as we started actually studying this specimen, we realized there were a lot of red flags,\" she says. For context, paleontologists had previously debated whether small-bodied tyrannosaurs were teenage  T. rexes  or a different species altogether. The existence of a two-legged tyrannosaur species that lived alongside  T. rex  was proposed back in the 1940s, but had long since fallen out of favor. The consensus converged on juvenile  T. rex , \"meaning it would have been the only major predator in end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid impact,\" says Zanno. Most researchers believed that  T. rex  — which could be  12 feet high , 40 feet long and weigh around 15,000 pounds — had outcompeted all other meat-eating dinosaurs. The completeness of the new skeleton provided Zanno with the ideal specimen to test these long-standing conclusions. \"This is such a controversial topic,\" she says. \"And we don't want to write another paper that just stirs the pot. We want to write the paper that ends the debate.\" The dueling dinosaurs settle a duel One of the first of those red flags in the new specimen was the arm bones. They looked completely different than  T. rex 's puny appendages. \"We never had a complete arm of this animal,\" says Zanno. \"These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. They were using them for prey capture.\" Contrast that with  T. rex , \"an animal that's a mouth on legs.\" There were additional clues. The animal had fewer tail vertebrae and more teeth than  T. rex . Zanno and Napoli considered other lines of evidence. They created 3D models of numerous purported  T. rex es against which they compared their specimen. They looked at the growth stages of the cranial nerves and sinuses of close living relatives of dinosaurs, features that were visible in the fossilized skeleton. \"But maybe the most important and damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all,\" she says. This conclusion was based on slicing through the fossil's limb bones to examine the growth rings. That work demonstrated that this animal was mature and done growing when it died around the age of 20. \"That means it's half the size and a tenth of the mass of a full grown  Tyrannosaurus rex ,\" says Zanno. All of the results point to one conclusion, according to Zanno and Napoli. This was no teen  T. rex . This was a fully grown  Nanotyrannus lancensis  — the same species first identified in the 1940s and later largely dismissed by the paleontological community. It was \"a small, slender pursuit predator that could run under the legs of a  T. rex ,\" explains Zanno. In addition, while making models of all those other alleged  T. rex  skeletons, Zanno says they identified another new species of tyrannosaur, one they're calling  Nanotyrannus lethaeus . \"The name comes from Greco-Roman mythology for the [Lethe] River where souls used to drink and forget their prior lives and be reincarnated,\" she says. \"That's a reference to this animal having been under our nose and not recognized for what it was.\" For years, most researchers believed there was just one tyrannosaur —  rex . But now the king has been de-throned. There were at least two other tyrannosaurs holding court. \"It tells us that these end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid hit were flourishing,\" says Zanno. \"They had an abundance of different predators. And refutes this idea that dinosaurs were in decline before the asteroid struck.\" Loving being wrong Thomas Holtz , a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who wasn't involved in the research, welcomes the broader picture of tyrannosaur diversity proposed by the new study. \"I always said with sufficient evidence, I'd be happy to embrace it,\" he says. \"And now I can because there's sufficient evidence. I think they've made a very strong case.\" Though, he adds, \"We'll see if it lasts. As I like to point out, taxonomy is not permanent,\" referring to the study of how organisms are classified (and, sometimes, re-classified). Holtz argues that one consequence of the study is that paleontologists no longer know what a juvenile  T. rex  looked like — because previously assumed \"teenagers\" were likely  Nanotyrannus . That's an arena of future research and discovery, along with fleshing out the varied biologies and behaviors of this growing group of tyrannosaurs. Zanno agrees that there remains much to understand. She believes there's likely to be additional dinosaur species that have been hidden in plain sight in museums and collections across the world. \"This is why I love science,\" says Zanno. \"I have the only job in the world where my job is to second-guess myself every day and everything I think I know.\" \"When it comes to shedding doubt on research on Earth's most famous dinosaur,\" she says, referring to  T. rex , \"that's an intimidating endeavor. But this is how we grow as a profession and how we grow as scientists.\" Zanno believes this study will pave the way for paleontologists to look for more complex patterns in this and other prehistoric ecosystems. \"From here forward,\" Zanno adds, \"what I'm most thrilled about is how much we stand to learn by recognizing that we got it wrong the first time.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Think of Tyrannosaurus rex, a fearsome dinosaur and the top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. Well, a new discovery suggests T. rex likely shared its dominion with another tyrannosaur species. The king had company. Here's science reporter Ari Daniel. ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: We start with Clayton Phipps... CLAYTON PHIPPS: I'm a rancher and a cowboy and a dinosaur hunter. DANIEL: ...Whose friend had found an exposed pelvis and femur at the bottom of a canyon in eastern Montana. The bones belong to a stunning triceratops. Then after excavating for about two weeks, there in the dug-up sand, Phipps spotted something the color of chocolate - a claw. But triceratops didn't have claws. PHIPPS: I'm like, what? I start brushing, and all of a sudden this arm starts to appear and part of the leg. Oh, man, my hat went in the air about 200 feet (laughter) 'cause I was like, no way. There's another dinosaur in here. DANIEL: This was a bipedal, carnivorous tyrannosaur entwined with the triceratops. PHIPPS: Just laying like they died. DANIEL: Phipps sold the fossils to the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, where Lindsay Zanno is head of paleontology. LINDSAY ZANNO: It's one of the most incredible specimens from the late Cretaceous in North America I've ever seen. DANIEL: Zanno and the museum built an entire wing around the dueling dinosaurs to house a live-action research experience. ZANNO: It's the only place in the world where you get to enter the working paleo lab and talk to the scientific team. DANIEL: Like many of her colleagues, Zanno started out thinking the carnivorous dinosaur was a juvenile T. rex, perhaps the most complete teenage tyrannosaur ever found. ZANNO: But as soon as we started actually studying this specimen, we realized there were a lot of red flags. DANIEL: One red flag was the arm bones, which were unlike T. rex's puny appendages. ZANNO: These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. DANIEL: The animal had fewer tail vertebrae than T. rex and more teeth. ZANNO: But maybe the most damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all. DANIEL: By slicing through the limb bones to examine the growth rings, Zanno and her colleagues found this animal was done growing when it died. It all pointed to one conclusion, she says. This was no teen T. rex. This was a different tyrannosaur species whose existence was long dismissed by most paleontologists. This was a fully grown Nanotyrannus lancensis. ZANNO: A small, slender pursuit predator that could run under the legs of a T. rex. This is an animal that's using its arms to hunt prey. Tyrannosaurus rex is an animal that's a mouth on legs. DANIEL: For years, most researchers believe there was just one tyrannosaur, rex. This work dethrones the king. There were other tyrannosaurs holding court. ZANNO: It tells us that these end Cretaceous ecosystems were flourishing before the asteroid struck. DANIEL: The findings appear in the journal Nature. Thomas Holtz is a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who wasn't involved in the study. He welcomes the broader picture of tyrannosaur diversity. THOMAS HOLTZ: I always said, with sufficient evidence, I'd be happy to embrace it. And now I can. But we'll see if it lasts. As I like to point out, taxonomy is not permanent. DANIEL: The study opens up numerous research avenues about the varied biologies (ph) and behaviors of what appears to be a growing group of tyrannosaurs. Lindsay Zanno again. ZANNO: This is why I love science. What I'm most thrilled about is how much we stand to learn by recognizing that we got it wrong the first time. DANIEL: For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel.

There is a moment of awe that washes over you when you step into a forest. Century-old trees tower above, sunlight twinkling through them. Birds tweet. Spiders weave their elaborate webs. The smell of pine needles fill the air.  The act of spending time in the forest is what the Japanese call  shinrin-yoku , a term originating in the 1980s that means \"bathing in the forest atmosphere,\" says Qing Li, a researcher on this topic and a professor at Nippon Medical School in Tokyo.  \"This is not exercise or hiking or jogging,\" he writes in his 2018 book  Forest Bathing: How Trees Can Help You Find Health and Happiness . \"It is simply being in nature, connecting with it through our sense of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch.\"   Not only is \"forest bathing\" a magical way to explore nature, decades of research has shown that it's good for your health. It can  boost your immune system ,  lower blood pressure  and  help with depression . It can also reduce the stress hormones  cortisol and adrenaline  and turn down the dial on your body's  fight-or-flight response . Li and Gary Evans, director of the  Forest Bathing Institute in the U.K. , talk to Life Kit about the science behind forest bathing and how you can reap these health benefits. 1. Find a location where you're surrounded by trees  The ideal place to forest bathe is well, in a forest. But if you live far away from one or don't have the means to get there, any place that has a lot of trees and quiet spaces will do.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Forest Bathing: A Retreat To Nature Can Boost Immunity And Mood \n       \"You can also get beneficial effects from a city park,\" says Li, but they won't be as significant as walking in the deep woods. A 2022 study published in the  International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health  found that walking in a forest park had a  greater impact on cardiovascular function  than doing so in an urban park.  Walking in an urban park still has health benefits. Another study published in 2022 found that it can  significantly improve mood and reduce stress , compared to walking in an urban gray setting.  2. Set aside a good chunk of time  To reap the ultimate rewards of  shinrin-yoku , plan to spend two to six hours in the woods, says Li.  His research showed that forest bathing for about that amount of time helped boost immunity.  One study  found that participants who walked in the forest for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon saw an increase in anti-cancer proteins and immune cells that kill tumors, with the effects lasting for at least seven days after.   If you can't set aside a good part of your day to meander through the forest, you can also do shorter walks. But the health benefits won't be as significant, says Li. \"The longer [the time in the forest], the better. The longer has more effect.\"  A 2019 study published in the  International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health  found that walking just 15 minutes through the woods  can help relieve stress and anxiety .  3. Aim to reduce heart rate Your forest bathing session is a good time to sit or walk or do some gentle yoga or tai chi. It's not the time to squeeze in your hardcore cardio for the week. \"The difference between normal activities and forest bathing is that we're going to move very slowly,\" says Evans. Forest bathing is about calming down your nervous system and reducing your heart rate and blood pressure.   If you exert yourself too much physically, your \"tiredness will reduce the effect of forest bathing,\" says Li. Your body will produce more stress hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol, which studies have shown that forest bathing  can help decrease .  4. Breathe in the scents of the forest Many of the benefits of  shinrin-yoku  come when we inhale the chemicals that trees release into the air, called phytoncides, says Li. They can reduce our stress hormones and increase our levels of white-blood cells known as natural killer cells, according to his research. \n       \n      Related Story:  Suffering From Nature Deficit Disorder? Try Forest Bathing \n       In  one study  from 2009, his team ordered special concentrated essential oils made from Japanese cypress trees and then pumped them into the hotel rooms of test subjects using a diffuser. The people staying in those rooms saw about 40 to 50% of the health benefits as those who did a forest bathing session. As a side note, if you can't make it to a forest, Dr. Li says you could get some of the benefits by diffusing tree-based essential oils at home. 5. Bolster your forest bath with meditation When you get to the forest or the park, walk a little bit and then find a spot that speaks to you. That could be a clearing in the woods surrounded by a bunch of tall trees or a spot where a tree has grown into a curved shape that looks suspiciously like a seat. If it feels beautiful and resonant to you, that's what matters.  Now sit down, says Evans, and try this exercise. \"Inhale for a count of one, two and then exhale for double the length of time, so it's one, two, three, four. Then keep that going.\"  \"When the exhale is slower than the inhale, it sends a physiological message to your body that says: 'I'm safe. I can relax. It's OK,' \" he adds.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Stressed? Instead of distracting yourself, try paying closer attention \n       This particular breathing exercise  has been shown  to have benefits on its own outside of the forest environment. The reason to do it in the forest is to allow yourself to relax so you can begin to notice all the sounds, colors and textures that nature has to offer.  You may be surprised by what you discover, says Evans. \"Depending on what's happening in your emotional world, quite often when we look at nature or the forest, it sends something back to us to help us make sense of what's going on in our life.\" This episode of Life Kit was produced by Clare Marie Schneider.

Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. Isn't the forest a magical place... (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS CALLING) SEGARRA: ...Like, when you really venture into the woods and you see these century-old trees towering over you, sunlight twinkling through them and spiders weaving their elaborate webs? The smell of pine needles is in the air. Birds are tweeting. You hear a mysterious sound that you're not going to pay too much attention to, but you really hope is not a bear. There is a moment of awe that happens when you step into a forest. And I think a lot of us can sense that forest bathing or taking in the forest through your senses makes us feel better and calmer. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: I was surprised to learn that there are decades of scientific evidence backing that up. A lot of the evidence comes from Japan, where the term forest bathing originated in the 1980s. Over many years, researchers have shown in peer-reviewed studies that time in the forest is a kind of medicine. Forest bathing helps your immune system by increasing your levels of anti-cancer proteins and immune cells that kill tumors. It's been shown to lower blood pressure and stabilize blood sugar. It can help with depression. It can lower adrenaline and turn down the dial on your body's fight-or-flight response. GARY EVANS: What we could see in the data was that, as soon as somebody came into proximity of a tree and they were just present and mindful, paying attention and appreciating the tree, that their - basically, their parasympathetic activity, which is the relaxation response in the body, was increased. SEGARRA: I know - all of that from spending time with trees. On this episode of LIFE KIT, we will talk about how to forest bathe, using the research as our guide to what works. And we'll share some exercises to get you started. Feel free to head outside to listen to this one. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: If, like me, you're wondering why forests are so good for our health, there's an evolutionary hypothesis for this. Simply put - for much of human history, we lived in nature. So the thinking is because we evolved in nature... QING LI: We have a biological need to connect with nature. SEGARRA: So we love nature because we learn to love the things that have helped us survive. That's Dr. Qing Li, by the way. He's a professor at Nippon Medical School in Tokyo and the president of the Japanese Society of Forest Medicine. He's designed and carried out a lot of Japan's research on forest bathing. Another expert you'll hear from in this episode is Gary Evans, director of the Forest Bathing Institute in the U.K., which was heavily inspired by Dr. Li's work. Gary says, at this point, we can survive without exposure to nature and forests specifically. EVANS: But there's a difference between surviving and thriving. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right, let's get thriving. We're going to start with some forest bathing basics. Gary says, a lot of the time, when we head to the woods or a hiking trail, nature is a backdrop, you know? It's secondary. EVANS: So we might be walking and talking with a friend, running, cycling, horse riding. SEGARRA: But he says if you want to get all the benefits of forest bathing, your primary focus should be connecting with nature. So takeaway one - really let yourself bathe in the forest. It's kind of like bathing in your tub. You're there to relax and dwell in the experience. EVANS: You say, OK, I'm going to go to the park. I'm going to go to the forest. I'm going to appreciate the natural beauty. So that's the first thing - set the intention. SEGARRA: Ideally, you can also set aside an entire morning or afternoon for this because... EVANS: The important thing for people listening to remember is that relaxation is not, like, an on-off switch. SEGARRA: As for how much time, Dr. Li suggests 2 to 6 hours. LI: The longer is the better. The longer is more effect. SEGARRA: His research shows that the health benefits can last for as long as 30 days, so aim to do this once a month - or maybe more often if your sessions are short. EVANS: So you can build up the dose. SEGARRA: Now let's talk for a minute about location. A nice patch of forest or woods is best. But if you don't have one nearby, you could get some of the same benefits from a city park if it has a lot of trees and quiet spaces. LI: So if you have one day to visit a city park, you also can get a beneficial effect. SEGARRA: But, he says, the effects will be smaller. Lastly, before you enter the forest, do some basic wilderness prep. This is not an exhaustive list, but that can include sunscreen - which you should be wearing every day anyway - also bug spray and long pants to protect you from ticks and plants that will give you a rash. And check the weather ahead of time. Make sure it's safe to venture out. Also, remember to stay on the marked trails and check yourself for ticks after, too, if those are a problem in your area. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right. So we're into the woods. Next up, takeaway two - slow down and disconnect. Your forest bathing session is a good time to sit or to walk or to do some gentle yoga or tai chi. It's not the time to squeeze in your hardcore cardio for the week. EVANS: So the next difference between normal activities and forest bathing is that we're going to move very slowly in forest bathing. We want to reduce the heart rate. SEGARRA: Also, Dr. Li says if you tire yourself out physically... LI: Your tiredness will reduce the effect of forest bathing. SEGARRA: So when you get to the forest or the park, maybe you walk a little bit and then find a spot that speaks to you. Could be a clearing in the woods surrounded by a bunch of tall trees or a spot where a tree has grown into a curved shape that looks suspiciously like a seat. If it feels beautiful and resonant to you, that's what matters. Now sit down. EVANS: And then just be present with the environment and leave the phone alone. SEGARRA: All right. You're settled in. Your phone is turned off, or at least put away. It's time to engage your senses. LI: The sight, hear, taste, smell and touch. SEGARRA: We're going to start with smell and inhalation, because Dr. Li says based on his research, many of the benefits of forest bathing come when we inhale the chemicals that trees release into the air. They're called phytoncides. And when we breathe them in, they, on their own, can do things like reduce our stress hormones and increase our levels of anti-cancer proteins. Dr. Li has done experiments on this. His team ordered these special concentrated essential oils made from Japanese cypress trees and then pumped them into the hotel rooms of test subjects using a diffuser. The people staying in those rooms saw many of the same health benefits as the ones who did a forest bathing session, just to a lesser extent. So as a side note, if you can't make it to a forest, Dr. Li says you could get some of the benefits by diffusing tree-based essential oils at home. But, yeah, takeaway three is to breathe it all in and ask yourself, what do I smell? Behind each smell in the forest is an exquisite, wondrous fact. For instance, the flowers on trees emit a fragrance so they can attract bees with the promise of food that's packed with energy. According to researchers at the University of Tel Aviv, a plant called the evening primrose will actually pump up the concentration of sugar in its nectar when bees are buzzing nearby. I learned that from a book called \"Forest Walking: Discovering The Trees And Woodlands Of North America,\" written by Peter Wohlleben and translated by Jane Billinghurst. I also learned that the earthy smell underfoot in the forest - the one that makes you feel like, hell yeah, I'm in nature - that comes from insects, bacteria and fungi breaking down leaves and rotten wood. And that process will enrich the soil with nutrients. So the advice here? Notice what you smell and maybe later, follow your curiosity to learn more. You can also try some breathing exercises because there's a big mindfulness component to forest bathing. In addition to being a forest bathing researcher, Gary is a yoga and mindfulness teacher, and he says the practice of meditation started outdoors. EVANS: Buddha had his awakening underneath a tree. No coincidence that trees were there right at the start of this. SEGARRA: So here's an exercise to try as you're sitting among the trees. EVANS: So if you inhale for a count of one, two, and then you exhale for double the length of time - so it's one, two, three, four. And so you keep that going, inhaling for two, exhaling for four. When the exhale is slower than the inhale, it sends a physiological message to your body. I'm safe. I can relax. It's OK. SEGARRA: This breathing exercise has been shown to have benefits on its own outside of the forest environment. The reason to do it in the forest is to allow yourself to relax. EVANS: What happens on a physiological level is when our parasympathetic fires up and we slow down, nature comes into sharper focus. So there's a change of perception. SEGARRA: And it gets easier to notice things - sounds, colors, textures. And that's takeaway four - engage your other senses. Listen for the rustling of chipmunks, the gurgling of a creek, the groan of branches in the wind. And notice the colors - bright, red leaves exploding from trees, light green ferns creating a canopy cover for the ground. When you observe nature, that can slow down your fight-or-flight response and lower the levels of stress hormones in your body. You can also take this moment to touch some stuff. No, no, no, not the poison ivy. You know what? Why don't we start with the tree? Go ahead and feel its bark. Is it rough or smooth? Does it have any scars from old branches? Another sense you can use in the forest is taste. I mean, you have to be careful. Don't just pick up a mushroom and start eating it. But if you learn about plants and foraging, you can add that to your forest bathing practice. You can also buy teas and tinctures from trained herbalists in your community and then bring them to the forest with you. Lucretia VanDyke is an herbalist, a ceremonialist and author of the book \"African American Herbalism: A Practical Guide To Healing Plants And Folk Traditions.\" LUCRETIA VANDYKE: I always laugh. I'm like, at this point of my life, I'm so into herbalism that if you can't talk about plants, I don't really know what to talk about anymore. SEGARRA: One of her favorite trees is the mimosa tree. VANDYKE: Well, it has these Dr. Seuss-like pink flowers on it. SEGARRA: Also, herbalists use the flowers to help people work through grief. So sometimes she'll take a couple drops of a mimosa tincture in her mouth. VANDYKE: And then I go sit with the plant, and I hold the flowers, and I'm, like, laying there with the plant and staring at it in awe. It becomes, like, this full-circle thing. SEGARRA: That brings us to takeaway five - go deeper. Work with the forest to process what you're going through. Gary says you can see nature as a mirror. EVANS: So depending on what's happening in your emotional world, quite often, when we look at nature or the forest, it sends something back to us to help us make sense of what's going on in our life. SEGARRA: The Forest Bathing Institute, which he runs, leads group trips to forests in the U.K. and around the world. And people have told him that forest bathing helped them work through grief. EVANS: Actually, a number of them that have come on our sessions have found that it's been very helpful to go into the forest and see the natural cycle of life. Somehow it's enabled them to reconcile what's happened. SEGARRA: In the forest, dead trees provide homes for woodpeckers and owls, and when they fall down, they become hiding spots for frogs and other creatures. And they provide a space for mushrooms and moss to grow. In death, they support life. Another metaphor - think about how trees communicate with each other through their network of roots underground. It's a stark contrast with how isolated many of us feel these days. Lucretia shared this exercise. VANDYKE: So a beautiful practice, I feel like, is imagine how all these roots are touching and watering each other. And if we need to, to, like, imagine, you know, even energetically, like, my family lives in North Carolina and I'm in Louisiana. So energetically, like, you know, when I imagine that tree and touching that tree, I can imagine myself and my spirit being at home with them. SEGARRA: If you want to try something a little more spiritual, while you sit in the forest, ask a tree or a plant to tell you about what medicine it holds. VANDYKE: You know, let me feel, you know, your medicine. Let me understand your medicine, 'cause that's a lot how the original people did it. It's not like they had a book way, way, way back in the day that told them this plant does this, this plant does that. SEGARRA: And then you can always compare what you imagine to a book. When you spend time in nature and around trees, that can also be an opportunity to think about the folks who came before you, whether that's deep in the forest or even in your neighborhood. Lucretia lives in the Treme district of New Orleans, known for being among the oldest African American neighborhoods in the country. VANDYKE: And it has been, you know, cut in half by a highway. And it's also been, you know, very gentrified. SEGARRA: She likes to look at the neighborhood's oak trees draped with Spanish moss and imagine what have they seen? VANDYKE: I try to imagine, like, the old Creole neighborhoods and how, you know, people of color came together and watched each other's children and built what is now revered today as the birthplace of jazz. Like, those trees have heard some of the original jazz greats ever. SEGARRA: She thinks of generations of kids playing and families sprawled out under the trees. VANDYKE: It puts me in old New Orleans and in those old community moments that, you know, don't exist, or they exist in a new way. SEGARRA: I'm sensing a parallel here, right? Trees bring people together. We sit under them in the shade and picnic. We gather around them and harvest their fruit. But they're in community with each other, too. The young and the old propping each other up and sending each other nutrients through their networks of roots. There's just so much wisdom that trees and plants hold for us when we pay attention. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right. Time for a recap. If you want to forest bathe, go to a place that has a lot of trees with the intention of appreciating and focusing on nature. The trees shouldn't just be a backdrop to some other activity. Go slowly. Take it easy. This isn't about doing heavy cardio. It's about slowing down your heart rate and getting to a calm place where you can start to see the wisdom that nature offers. You can also try some simple breathing exercises, slow yoga or tai chi, or do meditation exercises that use the metaphors the forest provides. On that note, Lucretia is going to walk us through one more forest meditation. Settle down next to a tree and take some deep, belly breaths. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANDYKE: I like for people to imagine your legs being like old tree trunk roots that roots you deep in the ground like the tree. So when I take a deep breath, I imagine the energy from - and love from our ancestors or from Mother Nature coming up those large roots into your legs, into your abdomen, belly expanding. And then as you exhale, sometimes I do a practice of shedding the things that no longer serve me, shaking off the day. SEGARRA: And then she exhales and says a prayer of gratitude to Mother Nature.

That's the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980. The U.S. wants to primarily admit Afrikaners from South Africa, according to a notification  in the Federal Register  filed on Thursday, and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\" The administration has largely paused the U.S. refugee resettlement program so far this year, with the exception of a streamlined process of resettlement for white South Africans. Several hundred from the group have been resettled across the U.S.  since March . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, some resettlement groups have been quick to voice concern over the lack of resources and limits on admission of those from other countries. Others have  shuttered their services , changing the landscape of the refugee resettlement process. Thursday's notification, which covers the fiscal year that started October 1, does not provide a reason for the lower cap, beyond mentioning previous Trump administration policies on refugees, including pausing admissions overall and barring admissions from countries seen as threats to U.S. security and welfare. \"The Trump administration has long expressed its intention to end Biden's abuse of the refugee program,\" a Trump administration official said in a statement. \"No refugees will be admitted in [fiscal year] 26 until the appropriate consultations with Congress are held, which are being delayed because certain members of Congress insisted on  shutting down  the government.\" Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state,  previously told reporters  that criteria for bringing in refugees included making sure that they did not pose a national security challenge and could be easily assimilated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,\" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, said in a statement. \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility.\" The Biden administration had set the refugee cap at 125,000 for fiscal year 2025. Senate Democrats, including Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Trump administration disobeyed the law by not consulting with Congress on the refugee cap before imposing it. The administration's lack of consultation \"demonstrates its tacit acknowledgement that this decision is indefensible,\" they wrote in a statement. \"President Trump's move undermines the role that America has long played in the world as a beacon of stability and a refuge for those fleeing genocide, political persecution and war crimes.\" Push for higher caps Refugee advocates have spent the year pushing for a broader range of admissions beyond Afrikaners, including admitting people from other countries who had already been vetted to arrive in the U.S. \"It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,\" said Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project. He said that the number of those with confirmed travel plans to the U.S. is greater than the new refugee cap. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The admission of Afrikaners to the U.S. has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies in the U.S., who have faced  sharp budget , resource, and personnel cuts since President Trump took office. Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program. Various agencies including the State Department have also paused disbursing funding for  critical services for other refugees, such as the home, job and school assistance  the Afrikaners are poised to receive.

pulled back from NPR due to White House pressure \n         By David Folkenflik \n        \n           Updated Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:39 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NPR's lawsuit against its decades-long partner, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, is headed for trial in December, a federal judge ruled Thursday. It is another marker of the Trump administration's disruptive force throughout the media. NPR alleges that last spring, CPB unlawfully yanked away a planned three-year contract worth $36 million in the face of intense pressure from the White House to sever ties with the radio network. As NPR presented evidence in court hearings on Tuesday and Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss indicated a deep skepticism of CPB's argument that it  sharply reversed course  on the merits. The most plausible explanation, Moss said, was that CPB was hoping to survive. \"I am not sure I have received an answer at all to the question of what changed from April 2nd to April 4th, other than the fact that CPB was looking for ways to try and ingratiate itself with the administration and perhaps folks on the Hill in a desire to survive,\" Moss said at Thursday's court hearing, according to a transcript, \"and that it was perceived that the votes and the support that CPB needed would come from those who were hostile to the content of NPR's speech.\" The CPB is the nonprofit that funneled federal dollars to public media until this month, as Congress and the president acted this summer to halt all $1.1 billion in planned future subsidies. Only a skeleton crew remains at the corporation. President Trump had been in the White House barely two months when he began attacking NPR and its TV counterpart PBS on social media as \"radical left MONSTERS.\" On May 1, he followed up with an  executive order to stop all federal dollars  from going to them. In response,  NPR and three member stations in Colorado sued  both the Trump administration and CPB, alleging their First Amendment rights were being violated. The portion of the lawsuit headed to trial does not involve the subsidies, but a separate contract to provide satellite and distribution services for public radio stations. NPR has operated it for four decades under a series of contracts with CPB. Moss said he had an open mind about the final merits of the two sides' arguments but ordered the trial because he thought NPR's argument was credible enough that he didn't want to take more time assessing its case. As the judge reiterated his skepticism of CPB's case, the corporation's trial attorney, Joseph Lipchitz, disclosed he had been negotiating a potential resolution of the lawsuit with NPR's legal team. A rush to get a deal, then a change of heart In late March, CPB had heard rumors of the possibility of an executive order against public media but was uncertain what form it would take. With that in mind, on April 2, CPB's board authorized its officials to work out the fine print of a fresh contract with NPR. A top CPB official, Kathy Merritt, called NPR's executive overseeing the satellite and distribution system and told him not to trip up the negotiations over minor matters, citing the urgency to get the money approved. (Merritt affirmed this account during a sworn deposition last week.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The next day, at an in-person meeting, a top White House budget official told CPB's board chairperson and two senior executives of her \"intense dislike for NPR.\" Memoranda about the meeting reflect the White House official, Katie Sullivan, also said \"it would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water,\" according to legal documents NPR filed in court. The day after that, April 4, CPB's board reversed itself, deciding that the radio satellite and distribution system had to be operated by an entity separate from NPR. CPB asked NPR to come up with plans to spin off the division, court filings show; NPR declined but bid for the project nonetheless. Behind the scenes, CPB's chairperson, Ruby Calvert, was \"adamant that she doesn't want funding to go to NPR,\" according to an April 12 email from Merritt to a colleague brought to light in the litigation. \"Something has been fundamentally missing\" On April 13, CPB's chief of staff, Debra Sanchez, wrote that she wasn't sure how to explain the requirement that it spin off its satellite and distribution system, called PRSS, court documents show. \"Something has been fundamentally missing for me ... and it's the 'because' statement,\" she wrote to colleagues. \"In particular, the 'local stations would be better served by having PRSS as an independent entity' which begs the question... because?\" Newly hired Republican consultant Carl Forti advised CPB on key themes to embrace in dealing with the administration: \"CPB has taken proactive steps to rein in what it sees as bias at NPR and PBS,\" according to court filings. The consultant stated that CPB should stress it had \"already taken steps to address the administration's concerns\" including by \"[w]ithholding interconnection funds from NPR.\" The word \"interconnection\" is a shorthand for the satellite and distribution system. Forti's memo also stated that CPB should note it had stopped grants for specific NPR newsroom efforts. CPB had subsidized international reporting and, last year, after allegations of bias led Congressional Republicans to blast NPR, a new senior editorial review team. Clayton Barsoum, CPB's chief lobbying executive, affirmed the memo in a note to Sanchez, writing, \"This looks good to me,\" court filings show. CPB argues it is a bulwark against political pressure In September, the corporation announced it was awarding a longer, bigger contract — $57 million over five years — to a new consortium that includes major public radio stations, a public radio distributor and an industry consulting firm. It said it was doing so to address long-standing concerns about NPR's performance. CPB attorney Lipschitz argued in court that the corporation has acted as a resolute bulwark for public media, including NPR, against political pressure. He noted that  CPB had separately sued Trump  over his attempt to fire corporation board members. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In his remarks at the hearings Tuesday and Thursday, Moss cast doubt on the credibility of that defense, repeatedly questioning the quick-twitch decision to demand that NPR no longer run the distribution system after such a longstanding arrangement. \"All of a sudden there was this change. And so what happened to cause this change?\" the judge asked Tuesday. \"I have to say, the most plausible explanation for what's happening here, is that everything is not quite as linear as \"We're for or against it'.\" \"CPB is understandably trying to survive,\" Moss said. \"There are a lot of materials that are in the record here that say there are a lot of strategies going on: 'What do we do? One thing we do is distance ourselves from NPR, because they don't like NPR'.\" \"A desire to earn some brownie points\" On Thursday, Moss underscored his thinking. \"At this point, I am not convinced that there is any real explanation of what changed other than the political climate and desire to try and earn some brownie points with those who CPB saw as attacking it,\" Moss said. In that April memo reproduced in court filings, CPB's consultant Forti came up with a message to convey to senators whom Trump was urging to pull all funding for public media: \"a. We understand the new world. \"b. We are responsive to the new world. \"c. We are trying to limit funds direct to NPR and PBS for biased content.\" Barsoum had endorsed the memo. Yet CPB officials felt they could not make that case publicly, evidence presented by NPR in court shows. Behind the scenes, CPB officials were asking Forti how they could best present their decision, without referring to the political firestorm around them. \"I don't think we are comfortable with the approach to publicly state we cut funding to NPR, so the bland statement might be where we land,\" Sanchez, the CPB chief of staff, wrote, according to materials filed in court. Moss ordered a brief expedited trial on this portion of the litigation and also ordered that CPB set aside $36 million, which it could not touch until the case was resolved. Assuming there is no settlement between the parties, Moss will assess it himself, instead of a jury, in what is called a bench trial. It is expected to last three to four days.

Scams can happen to anyone — even to people who study them.  Kelly Richmond-Pope , a forensic accounting professor at DePaul University, fell for one in 2017. While searching for tickets to a Bruno Mars concert, she found a website that was offering front-row seats for a low price. After she paid for the tickets, she realized ... they were fake!  Looking back on the incident, Richmond-Pope, who also researches fraud and white-collar crime, says \"the website I got the tickets off of  did  look different from Ticketmaster.\"  Fraud is a big business. According to  a 2023 report  by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Americans reported losing nearly $10 billion to fraud, an increase of more than 14% in 2022. The most common schemes were investment scams and impostor scams.  \"Criminals will steal from anyone, whether you have $5 or $500 or $500,000,\" says  Amy Nofziger , the director of fraud victim support for AARP, which focuses on issues affecting people over 50. She oversees their fraud hotline, where they get calls from people of all ages.  Here are eight simple actions you can take to protect yourself from getting conned.  1. Regularly check your bank accounts for fraud  Look through your accounts, especially your checking and credit card accounts, every two weeks. \"Take an hour and do a deep dive. Look at all the transactions and make sure everything there is valid and legitimate,\" says Richmond-Pope.  2. Check your credit report every four months  Look at your credit report every four months to see if anyone has made charges or opened accounts in your name, says Nofziger. You can get a free report from each of the three major credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, every year.   3. Freeze your credit (then 'thaw' it when you need it)  This ensures that no one can open up a credit card or take out a loan in your name. To freeze your credit, go to the websites of each of the major credit bureaus, make an account and request a freeze.  \"If I need to refinance or get a loan, I just go and 'thaw' it — that's what the companies call it — for ten days. My creditor can check my credit and then it'll automatically be frozen again,\" says Nofziger.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Why you should think twice before posting that cute photo of your kid online  \n       4. Use your credit card whenever possible Use your credit card rather than your debit card, says Richmond-Pope. \"Your credit card company has a level of protection that the banks don't seem to give. So I've always used my credit card for as much as I can, then just pay that credit card balance off at the end of the month.\"  If someone makes a fraudulent charge on your credit card, the most you'll be liable for is $50,  according to the FTC . But if someone gets a hold of your debit card, they can take money straight out of your checking account, leaving you without access to that cash while you sort things out with your bank. You also may be liable for  much more of the losses , depending on when you report the fraud.  5. Call the number on the back of your bank card  If you suspect that someone has made a fraudulent charge on your bank card, don't search for your bank's phone number on the internet. Call the number on the back of your bank card or on your account statement, says Nofziger. \"Criminals are placing fake customer service phone numbers [online]. You call it thinking you're talking to your actual bank\" but it's a fake number. 6. Sign out of Venmo when you're done using it  If you thought you were only at risk while browsing the internet, you are wrong. Picture this, says Nofziger. Say you're walking down the street and a teenager comes up to you and says \" 'Oh my gosh, I lost my phone. I need to call my mom to pick me up. Can I borrow your phone?'  'Well, of course,' you say. 'Here's my phone.' You see them dialing a phone number. But actually what they've done is they've gone into your Venmo app\" and they've transferred money to themselves.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Your Technology Is Tracking You. Take These Steps For Better Online Privacy \n       For this reason, Nofziger recommends signing out of your peer-to-peer payment apps when you're done using them.  7. Set up your phone to decline calls from people you don't know  To reduce your chances of answering phone calls from scammers, go into your phone settings and select the option to send unknown callers to voicemail. \"That means that anybody that is not in your contacts that calls you will go directly to voicemail,\" says Nozfiger. \"If it's important, [the caller] will leave a voicemail.\"  8. Be careful about what you post online People can gather a lot of information from your social media accounts, says Richmond-Pope. If you share a birthday photo on your actual birthday with your age in the caption, people can find out your birth date. They can find out who your friends and family are by looking at your followers list and your tagged photos.  They can also find out when you're out of town. Your vacation photos on Instagram announce to the world that you are not home, she adds. \"Most people are not posting their pictures two weeks after they come back. They're posting their pictures while they're on vacation.\"  If you do get scammed, make sure to report it, says Nofziger. And give yourself grace. \"You were a victim of crime. End of story. You need help, kindness, empathy and guidance.\"  The audio was produced by Clare Marie Schneider. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual producer is Kaz Fantone.

Hey, everybody, it's Marielle. Kelly Richmond Pope is a huge Bruno Mars fan. She loves the song \"24K Magic,\" among many others. So in 2017, when she realized he was coming to her city, she got on Ticketmaster. And the universe was smiling upon her that day because she got these amazing front-row seats for pretty cheap. KELLY RICHMOND POPE: And I'm thinking, oh, yeah, I got a bargain. So my cousin and I go to the Bruno Mars concert. We're super excited. We get in, go through the United Center door, and we get a big X over the ticket. SEGARRA: The ticket was fake. RICHMOND POPE: And when I go back and I think what happened, the website that I got it off of - it did look a little bit different than the traditional-looking Ticketmaster website. And so what should've been the red flag was - how do I have these amazing seats? It's almost like if you got Taylor Swift or Beyonce tickets, front row, for a hundred bucks apiece. And that was how good of a deal this was. SEGARRA: She ended up tweeting at the real Ticketmaster, and they gave her and her cousin free front-row tickets for all the hassle. But the point is, Kelly got scammed. And what's notable about that is - you know what she does for a living? She's a forensic accounting professor at DePaul University. RICHMOND POPE: And my area of expertise is fraud, forensic accounting and white-collar crime. SEGARRA: Yeah, in other words, scams - her expertise is scams. So scams even happen to people who study them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Scammers are everywhere, especially online. In 2022, there was an estimated $8.8 billion lost to fraud. These scammers want your money, but also your personal information. RICHMOND POPE: What can you do with that? You can open a credit card. You can apply for a loan. I've even had interviews that I've done with white-collar felons where people have applied for mortgages in people's names. SEGARRA: Even if you think you've got a skeptical eye and this could never happen to you... AMY NOFZIGER: Every single person is vulnerable to scams. SEGARRA: Amy Nofziger is a certified fraud examiner and the director of Fraud Victim Support with AARP, which focuses on issues affecting people over 50. And she oversees their fraud hotline, where they get calls from people of all ages. Amy says there are a lot of myths out there about who gets scammed. NOFZIGER: People that are uneducated, that don't have resources, that aren't worldly - but in my two decades of experience, whether you're a doctor, a lawyer, a CEO, a teacher, it really doesn't matter. SEGARRA: Today's episode of LIFE KIT is all about scams. We'll talk about how to spot the red flags and proactively protect yourself and what to do if you are a victim of fraud or identity theft. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: As Amy was saying, anyone can get scammed. That's our takeaway one. Understand that it could happen to you. These warnings are not just for folks with memory issues or people who don't understand technology. And scammers - they want your money whether you have a lot or a little. NOFZIGER: Criminals will steal from anyone, whether you have $5 or $500 or $500,000. SEGARRA: Also, as I mentioned earlier, they may want your personal information, like your Social Security number, so they can steal your identity and then take on debt in your name. The other thing is, it doesn't matter how old you are. There are scams targeted at your age group. Back to Kelly Richmond Pope, who we heard from earlier - she's a university professor, and she warns her students about scholarship scams. RICHMOND POPE: If you are in college or graduate school and you see an advertisement for a scholarship, that scholarship could be asking for so much information about you. It could ask, if you have a tax return, do you have one? What's your name? What's your birthdate? What's your parent's name? What's your mother's maiden name? How old are you? Where do you go to school? And sometimes you don't know that this is a fake scholarship. It doesn't exist. SEGARRA: The same thing can happen with fake job applications or websites that pretend to offer student debt relief. Another common scam involves cryptocurrency, where someone tells you they've got a great opportunity for you to invest in crypto, and then they steal your money. Amy says sometimes this starts with a simple wrong-number text. NOFZIGER: You'll get a text message to your device, and it says, hey, are you coming for dinner tonight? And you, as a good human, writes back and say, I'm sorry. You know, I think you have the wrong number. Who is this? And they'll write back, and they'll say, oh, isn't this Sally? Oh, I'm so sorry. You know, I thought I had my friend Sally's phone number. But you sound really nice. Like, where are you located? SEGARRA: Then the conversation's flowing, and they ask you a seemingly innocuous question, like... NOFZIGER: What do you like to do for fun? I play baseball. I do this. Oh, I dabble in crypto. I learned it from my aunt, who's a, you know, world-known crypto investor. SEGARRA: Maybe you've always wondered if you were missing out on the whole crypto thing. And next thing you know, you're transferring money to this person's digital crypto wallet, and you'll never see it again. There are also impostor scams where you get a phone call or a text from somebody pretending to be an institution, like your bank or a government agency. NOFZIGER: It could be a text message from someone saying that there's a package waiting for you from the Postal Service. It could be someone calling you and saying that they're with the DEA, and they found a car that was rented in your name and Social Security number, and drugs were in it. You know, whatever it is, the impostor scams are rampant. SEGARRA: And these can be sophisticated. One of our producers got a phone call recently from somebody saying, hey, it's your bank. We think there's been a fraudulent charge on your account. Did you make this purchase? So she logged into her account online and saw that there was a fraudulent charge on there from that place, but something felt off. The person on the phone had pronounced her name wrong and was asking for personal information, so she hung up and called her bank directly. Turns out that person was a scammer, and presumably they had made the fraudulent charge. It's clever, right? That brings us to takeaway two. Learn the red flags of a scam. Amy says, if someone contacts you, whoever they're claiming to be, listen carefully. If they ask for payment, that's a red flag. NOFZIGER: If they are asking or say - in any part of the conversation - prepaid gift card, government card, stop. If they say anything about a QR code or an ATM machine, stop. If they say anything about a peer-to-peer app, like Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle, 100% stop. The government does not take payment with Venmo. If they say Social Security number or Medicare number - you know, oh, we need to verify this for, you know, legitimate purposes - stop. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Another red flag is requesting that you go get cash from an ATM or go to a store and ship them something. NOFZIGER: Just stop. Just stop right there. SEGARRA: Now, here's a very specific but common one. If they're claiming to be the IRS, stop. RICHMOND POPE: You call the IRS. SEGARRA: The IRS typically reaches out to taxpayers through good, old snail mail, but these phone calls prey on our fear and uncertainty. RICHMOND POPE: When you get that IRS call, you're like, oh, my gosh, have I paid? Did I not pay? What's going to happen if I don't? So they know that that's how you're going to respond. SEGARRA: That brings us to another red flag. Scammers will often try to trigger your emotions. They want you to feel scared or nervous so that you're not making clear-headed decisions. Those feelings should make your antenna go up. This happens in romance scams, where somebody you've been chatting with online tells you they're stuck in another country, and their passport got stolen, for instance, and they just need you to Venmo them enough money to get home. It also happens in kidnapping scams, where someone pretends they've taken your family member captive. If you feel your emotions rising, pay attention. Another red flag is urgency. Is the person on the phone saying something needs to happen right now? That's another sign of a scam. And in those moments, don't be afraid to hang up. NOFZIGER: Get out of that situation. Like, literally get out of that situation. Hang up the phone. Delete the email, and check on it. SEGARRA: Amy says, in general, you should treat everyone you meet online or through your phone as you would a stranger in person. NOFZIGER: So imagine you're in your downtown area and someone runs up to you and says, oh, my gosh, I have the best crypto opportunity for you right now. Do you want to go meet my aunt? 'Cause she can invest your money, right? Or someone runs up to you and says, oh, my gosh, you are the prettiest person I've ever met. I think I love you. If you're face to face, you'd be like, step away from me now. SEGARRA: Once you have stepped away or hung up or disengaged and you want to look into whatever this is, be careful. Like, let's say you got an email with a scholarship opportunity. Don't immediately click the links in the email. And just do some research. Kelly suggests that you find a way to verify that scholarship is real using 3 to 5 other sources. RICHMOND POPE: A lot of times, when we're desperate, we don't do the verification piece. And that's what the scammers are preying on - is our desperation and our busyness and the lack of time. SEGARRA: Now, let's take a different scenario. Say you get a call from someone claiming to be your bank. You're going to hang up and call the bank directly. Now, this is important. Don't just Google the customer support number because scammers have placed fake customer service numbers online. NOFZIGER: So when an individual goes to, you know, a search engine and types in the phone number for PNC Bank, whatever it is, and just says PNC Bank customer service, the criminals are placing these fake customer service phone numbers. You call it thinking you're talking to your actual bank because you did your due diligence. You called the number. You looked it up. SEGARRA: But it's a fake number. So always call the number on the back of your bank card or on your account statement. And same goes for government agencies, airlines and other institutions. Make sure you're at their correct website and find the number that way. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Now, if you thought you were only at risk while browsing the internet, not so fast. Picture this - you're walking on a trail, and a teenager comes up to you and says... NOFZIGER: Oh, my gosh. I lost my phone. I need to call my mom to pick me up. Can I borrow your phone, please? Well, of course. Here's my phone. You know, you see them dialing a phone number. But actually, what they've done is they've gone into your Venmo or your other peer-to-peer app, and they're basically just transferring money out of your account to them. SEGARRA: That brings us to takeaway three - proactively protect yourself from scams and fraud. So the first thing Amy says here is that, if a stranger does want to borrow your phone... NOFZIGER: First of all, put it on speaker. You dial the number. You keep control of your phone. But also, always sign out of any banking apps. SEGARRA: That means Venmo and Cash App and whatever else - make sure you sign out of those apps every time you're done using them. This is just one of many precautions you can take to protect yourself from scams. And yeah, some of these things will be inconvenient, and they may seem like overkill. But... NOFZIGER: It's just like how we - you know, none of us want to be broken into in our houses, but we lock our doors at night. We have alarms. We set up barriers. We need to do the same thing when it comes to scams and frauds and our financial safety and security. SEGARRA: Another tip from Amy - set your phone up to silence or block calls from unknown numbers. NOFZIGER: It's a simple thing. You can go into phone settings, and there's just a toggle that says send unknown callers to voicemail. That means that anybody that is not in your contacts that calls you will go directly to voicemail. And some people will say to me, well, what if it's important? Well, if it's important, they will leave you a voicemail. SEGARRA: Also, reconsider what information you're sharing online - for instance, on your social media accounts. RICHMOND POPE: Think about this - how many people go on vacation and tell the whole world they're on vacation? All you're alerting to the world is you're not home. And so you have to think about how we make ourselves vulnerable to scams because we make it a lot easier than we used to. SEGARRA: Be super careful about what you share, and also consider making your social media accounts private. Also, Kelly says, regularly check your bank accounts for fraud. RICHMOND POPE: One of the things even personally that I try to do is, every two weeks, take an hour and sort of do a deep dive. Look at all the transactions. Look at all of my credit card debits, credits and see - make sure that everything there is valid and legitimate. SEGARRA: And whenever possible, use your credit card rather than your debit card. If someone makes a fraudulent charge on your credit card, the most you'll be liable for is $50, and often you'll pay nothing. But if someone gets a hold of your debit card info, they can take money straight out of your checking account, and then you won't have access to that money while everything gets figured out. Also, you may be liable for much more of the losses, depending on when you report the fraud. RICHMOND POPE: So I've always used my credit card for as much as I can do, and then just pay that credit card balance off at the end of the month. SEGARRA: You can get a free report from each of the three major credit bureaus every year. Use those throughout the year to see if anyone has made charges or opened accounts in your name. Even better, freeze your credit. That ensures no one can open up a credit card or take out a loan in your name. And this is something both of our experts recommended. To freeze your credit, you're going to go to the websites of each of the major credit bureaus, make an account and request a freeze. You can do the same thing for a couple more minor credit bureaus. Amy's credit is frozen. NOFZIGER: I have it on there. I know my credit is safe. And if I do need to refinance or get a loan, I just go and I thaw it. That's what they call it. They say thaw it. I'll tell the company to thaw it for 10 days while my, you know, creditor can check my credit, and then it'll automatically be frozen again. SEGARRA: And if you have kids, consider freezing their credit as well because they can be targets, too. RICHMOND POPE: I have read stories of children that - they've been living their lives. They're 18 years old. And they realize that all of these credit cards have been opened in their name, and their credit is ruined because someone stole their identity and they didn't even know about it. SEGARRA: People are getting scammed all the time, and it might happen to you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Takeaway four - if you do get scammed, report it. And if necessary, go through the steps of recovering from identity theft. NOFZIGER: Report it to your local law enforcement, your Attorney General's office. Report it to us on the Fraud Watch Network Helpline. You are going to need support, and you're going to need guidance on what to do and where to go. And it certainly depends on what type of scam that you were a victim of. SEGARRA: For instance, if you were the victim of a credit card fraud, they would tell you... NOFZIGER: Contact your financial institutions. You know, put a fraud alert on your credit report. If you were a victim of a scam that involved a gift card, you know, you can get the guidance to call the number on the back of the gift card immediately. Tell them that it was used in a fraud. See if there's any funds remaining. SEGARRA: The bad news here is that, if you lost money in a scam, you may not get it back. NOFZIGER: And that's why the criminals love the forms of payment that they ask for. Because getting money back from a prepaid gift card is not usually going to happen. Getting money back that you deposited into a crypto ATM machine is not necessarily going to happen. That doesn't mean it doesn't, and that doesn't mean you shouldn't report it. SEGARRA: Sometimes, though, the best you can do is learn how to protect yourself going forward and put new barriers in place. The last thing we want to say here is, if you got scammed, give yourself grace. NOFZIGER: You were a victim of a crime - end of story. You need help, support, kindness, empathy, guidance. You need a shoulder to cry on. You need a support group just like if you were a victim of a home break-in. SEGARRA: She says, as the victim of a scam, you might worry that people will say it's your fault and that you should've known better. That's what we do to fraud victims as a society. NOFZIGER: We blame them. And so what we're really trying to do at AARP is to bring those victims out of the shadows and say, get out here. You know, share your story. Report your crime. Because that's how we and other, you know, people in this fight are going to understand the magnitude of this issue. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: OK, time for a recap. Takeaway one - understand that you can get scammed regardless of your age or income or level of technological savvy, and there are scams targeted at people just like you. Takeaway two - learn the red flags of a scam. You get a call or an email or a text, and someone is asking for money or personal info. They're asking you to go somewhere, like an ATM or the post office. They make it seem like this task is super urgent - all red flags. Takeaway three - proactively protect yourself from scams and fraud. Check your bank account transactions and your credit report for suspicious activity. Freeze your credit. And use your credit card instead of your debit card whenever you can. And takeaway four - if you do get scammed, report it. Go through the steps of recovering your identity if you need to, and be kind to yourself. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

abducted \n         By Kate Bartlett \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 12:26 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — For months doctors at the last functioning hospital in the wartorn Sudanese city of el-Fasher performed operations by torchlight, desperately trying to save lives in the most impossible conditions. The Saudi Maternity Hospital was a last refuge for the sick and injured in the besieged city, as fighting raged around them. Despite no electricity, shortages of supplies, and frequently coming under heavy shelling, medical staff kept going. \"They are heroes, honestly,\" said Dr Mohamed Faisal Elsheikh, a Sudanese medical doctor based in Manchester and a spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network. \"They really work in a very difficult environment, they had no medical instruments, there's no any medicines over there, there's no electricity…and yet with all dedication and commitment…they saved as much as they could of people's lives.\" No longer. Since the city fell to the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Sunday, the doctors have been kidnapped and reports have emerged of a massacre at the hospital. \"On 28 October, six health workers, four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist, were abducted,\" from the hospital, the World Health Organization said in a statement Wednesday. \"On the same day, more than 460 patients and their companions were reportedly shot and killed in the hospital.\" WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was \"deeply shocked\" and \"appalled\" by the massacre and called for health facilities, health workers and patients to be protected under international law. \"Prior to this latest attack, WHO has verified 185 attacks on health care in Sudan with 1204 deaths and 416 injuries of health workers and patients since the start of the conflict in April 2023,\" he said. Videos of the attack believed to have been filmed by RSF fighters themselves are circulating online. While they cannot be independently verified by NPR, they show militia men walking through the ransacked wards, stepping over piles of dead bodies and shooting anyone left alive at point blank range. RSF leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has pledged to investigate the allegations of war crimes by his soldiers in el-Fasher - but many doubt his sincerity, as he has failed to investigate previous atrocities. Since overtaking el-Fasher– which they had besieged for over 500 days – and chasing out the Sudanese army, videos,  satellite imagery , and testimony from those who've managed to flee indicate the RSF has been pursuing a scorched earth policy in the Darfuri city. The RSF has been fighting the national army for control of the resource-rich nation that sits at the vital crossroads between North Africa, the Sahel, and the Red Sea in a bloody civil war since 2023. 'Crisis of apathy' The group emerged from the janjaweed militia that terrorized Darfur in the early 2000s and was accused of genocide. The US has already accused the RSF and allied Arab militias of committing genocide against African ethnic groups in the current conflict. The situation in el-Fasher was dire even before the RSF overran it this week. The year and a half long blockade of some 250,000 civilians has led to starvation and famine. The UN's migration organization says 26,000 people have managed to flee since the takeover. Many of those are arriving seeking help in the town of Tawila, in north Darfur, where medical charity Doctors Without Borders is running the closest health point. Doctors Without Borders used to provide support to the Saudi hospital but stopped operating in el-Fasher in August 2024 saying it had become too dangerous. On Wednesday the NGO said people arriving at Tawila were showing \"extremely alarming levels of malnutrition among women and children, which is indicative of a famine-like situation.\" The organization's International president Dr Mohamed Javid Abdelmoneim noted however, that very few adult men were arriving, and said this raised concerns about ethnically targeted violence. \"This is testament to the horror unfolding in and around the city,\" he said. One mother of six, who had fled el-Fasher but didn't wish to be named to protect her identity, told aid workers from international NGO Save the Children what they had endured. \"We hid the children in trenches, and we ran into abandoned buildings during the attacks. After that, we just ate umbaz (animal feed),\" she said. Another woman described the long trek to safety, during which she was beaten and robbed by a gang. \"We lost family members, we lost neighbors, we lost everyone,\" she recounted. \"We've been walking for the past four days from el-Fasher. A group of motorbike riders met us on the way…They killed people and insulted us a lot.\" The UN Security Council held a meeting on the crisis Thursday. The UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said the violence recalls the horrors of the genocide in Darfur two decades ago. \"But what is different today, we are seeing a different global reaction. One of resignation,\" he said. \"So this is also a crisis of apathy.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   A paramilitary group fighting a civil war in Sudan has killed more than 460 patients and their companions at the last functioning hospital in the city of el-Fasher. That's according to the World Health Organization. Kate Bartlett reports that it is one of the worst atrocities of Sudan's 2 1/2-year war, according to human rights groups. And a warning - listeners will hear gunshots in this piece. KATE BARTLETT: Dr. Mohamed Faisal Elsheikh, a spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network, says there's only one word to describe the doctors who worked in el-Fasher. MOHAMED FAISAL ELSHEIKH: They are heroes, honestly. They really worked in a very difficult environment. BARTLETT: But that didn't stop them. ELSHEIKH: They had no - any medical instruments. There's no any medicines. There's no electricity. And yet, with all dedication and commitment, they saved as much as they could of people life. BARTLETT: But now, the Saudi Maternity Hospital is in ruins, filled with the bodies of patients executed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, and the doctors have been taken captive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEPHANE DUJARRIC: We were horrified by reports of the tragic killings of more than 460 people, both patients and their companions, at the Saudi Maternity Hospital in el-Fasher. BARTLETT: That's the U.N. secretary general's spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, speaking on Wednesday about the massacre. The U.N. says health facilities, doctors and patients must be protected under international law. RSF leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has pledged to investigate the allegations, but many doubt his sincerity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED RSF MEMBER: (Non-English language spoken). BARTLETT: Aid organizations circulated a video that appears to have been filmed by the RSF themselves that shows their fighters walking through the hospital's wards, shooting anyone left alive. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT) BARTLETT: For over two years now, the RSF, made up of former janjaweed fighters, has been fighting Sudan's army. Two decades ago, the janjaweed were accused of genocide in Darfur. Now their successors are fighting for control of Sudan's rich resources. It's not the first time the RSF has targeted health care facilities. Most of Sudan's hospitals are either closed or in desperate condition. (CROSSTALK) BARTLETT: Now those who've managed to flee el-Fasher are desperately seeking help. MOHAMED JAVID ABDELMONEIM: Our teams are working 60 kilometers away in Tawila, where they're seeing people starting to arrive from el-Fasher. BARTLETT: That's Doctors Without Borders international president, Mohamed Javid Abdelmoneim. ABDELMONEIM: Among all the people arriving in Tawila, we're seeing very few adult men. Given the history of ethnically targeted violence in el-Fasher, we are deeply concerned about the risk of a potential bloodbath. BARTLETT: For Dr. Elsheikh, his thoughts are with the abducted staff. ELSHEIKH: They were very dedicated, despite the difficulties that they are facing in their work. But they were very committed to their holy message. BARTLETT: For NPR News, I'm Kate Bartlett in Johannesburg.

Airports are packed, tickets are expensive and bad weather can cause significant flight delays and cancellations.  So, if you  have  to travel, is there an optimal time to do so? Scott Keyes, founder of the travel site  Going.com  (formerly known as Scott's Cheap Flights), shares his recommendations, including days to avoid and the best time of day to fly.  Don't travel ahead of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve \"It's one of the worst times to travel,\" he says, due to flight disruptions, crowds at the airport and ticket prices. \"My secret, best advice for travel over the holidays is: if at all possible, just don't do it.\"  If you have to fly for the holidays, do it on the day itself  \"You just see far fewer people traveling then,\" says Keyes. \"And with fewer people, you can see lower fares and fewer disruptions,\" including delays and cancellations. So think about booking tickets to depart or arrive on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Avoid peak travel days  For a lot of folks, the whole point of traveling during this time of year is to be with family on the  actual  holiday, says Keyes. \"The few days before and after a holiday are when you see the most crowds.\" For Thanksgiving, the busiest travel days are the Tuesday and Wednesday before the holiday and the Saturday and Sunday after, he says. For Christmas, it's between Dec. 20 to Jan. 5. A travel delay that stretches out over a few days, like a snowstorm, can quickly ruin a trip, he adds. \"That's when you're going to have the most competition with other travelers\" for a limited amount of seats if you're trying to rebook a flight.  To avoid this situation, Keyes recommends flying a few days before or after these peak travel times. So instead of flying on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, you might consider traveling a few days earlier.  Travel in January — the 8th, to be precise If you can wait, travel in January, says Keyes. You will probably have a much better flight experience.  Keyes even has a preferred date for that month: Jan. 8, he adds. \"It's my favorite date of the entire year. I circle that date on the calendar because whereas flight prices really get inflated over the Christmas-New Year period, around Jan. 8, they just fall off a cliff from the most expensive time of the entire year to the absolute cheapest.\"  \"It's not atypical to see airfares 80% lower on Jan. 10 compared to the same route on Dec. 30,\" he says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Take an early and direct flight  \"There are two types of flights that have the highest odds of getting you to where you're going on time or at least without a major delay: early morning flights and nonstop flights,\" says Keyes.  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation's  Air Travel Consumer Report  for September, flights between 6-9 a.m. had an 86% on-time departure rate, versus 50% for flights between 8-11 p.m. With morning flights, \"your plane [has been] at the airport overnight. It's sitting there and ready to go when you get there in the morning,\" he says. Afternoon flights, on the other hand, depend on planes that are flying in from somewhere else and may be subject to delays.  Direct flights have the advantage of not having layovers. \"If you take a connecting flight that gets delayed an hour and a half but you only had a one-hour layover, all of a sudden you've missed your connecting flight and you have to get rebooked\" — not an easy feat during the holiday season.  Prepare yourself for potential flight disruptions that may keep you at the airport. Keyes likes to pack \"noise-canceling headphones and a little snack box, because frankly, airport food is not very memorable,\" he says. And he likes to download a few books and movies to his iPad — \"just in case I'm having to hang out at the airport longer than expected.\"  The audio was produced by Clare Marie Schneider.

This year alone, cempasuchil producers said they lost up to half their flower crop from heavy rains and flooding. “This year, we lost a lot. We struggled to even grow the cempasuchil. There were moments in which we didn’t have the money to buy fertilizer we needed,” Ortiz said. “With the cempasuchil plants, we’ve sometimes been left with nothing.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n ‘Flower of the dead’ The orange flower has become a symbol of the country’s celebrations that take place every Nov. 1 and 2. Also known as the “flower of the dead”, the cempasuchil is believed to be a point of connection between the worlds of the dead and the living, with bright petals that light the path of dead souls to the altars set out by their family. The flowers are also a crucial economic engine across Mexico, which commerce groups predict will rake in nearly 2.7 million dollars for farmers in 2025. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ortiz and her family began growing the flower 30 years ago in their small plot of land in Xochimilco, a rural borough in the south of Mexico City where residents have continued to carry on ancient farming techniques using canals that wind through farmlands like a maze.  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Catrina sculptures stand in a field of cempasuchil flowers in San Luis Tlaxialtemalco on the outskirts of Mexico City, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025.

But they say that they’ve been dealt a heavy blow for consecutive years as heavy rains, drought, floods and other climate shifts have made it increasingly difficult to keep their crops alive. This year, torrential rains stretching on for months wiped out more than 37,000 acres of crops across the country, according to government figures. In a visit to cempasuchil fields earlier this month in Xochimilco, Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said that as many of 2 million marigold plants were put at risk. Despite that, she said that production this year simultaneously broke a record of 6 million plants as farmers ramp up to meet increasing demand even as growing the flower has become more precarious. Ortiz said the excess of rain has brought on pests, diseases and rotted the roots of her plants. She estimates she lost at least 30% of her crop, while others say they’ve lost closer to 50%.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The family has been forced to drop money on insecticides, fertilizer and more to save their crops. As they have, razor thin profit margins have turned into losses, and they’ve had to cut back on basics like beef and sweets to make ends meet. “If I were to take a hard look at all our losses, I’d be incredibly disillusioned and even not want to grow them anymore,” she said. “We’re just trying to push forward and make sure this keeps going on.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Adapting to climate change Just down the road from Ortiz’s farm, government scientists are searching for long-term solutions beyond the short-term economic relief provided by the local government.

The scientists have been at work for a year and a half saving up thousands of seed variants of native plant species, including 20 variants of cempasuchil, in jars lining giant freezers in the hopes that the storage facility will be a key tool in fighting the most adverse effects of climate change. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Biologist Clara Soto Cortés, head of the seed bank, said part of the reason that the crop has been devastated is because farmers in recent years have elected to use a hybrid marigold seed variant from the United States.  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Biologist Clara Soto Cortés, head of the seed bank known as Toxinachcal, stands inside the refrigerated room where native seeds are kept, in the Xochimilco borough of Mexico City, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.

But that means farmers have turned away from sturdier, native breeds, which have longer stocks and widely vary in color, size and texture. The genetic diversity of these Mexican breeds makes them more resilient to drastic climate shifts like the ones seen this year, Soto said.  “These native seeds have adapted to different geographies, in high altitudes and low, in places where there’s a lot of rain or there’s none at all, or where they need to be resistant to insects,” she said.  “The (hybrid) seeds have been bred for another purpose. It doesn’t have the genetic diversity needed to take on climate change.” If more climate events, like the floods that roiled producers wipe out an entire crop, Soto said the bank will make seeds available to local producers to recover their crops – this time with a more resilient variant that their ancestors have been farming for centuries. Carrying on an ancient tradition Meanwhile, growers are scrambling to bounce back in the short term, saying the losses also represent a threat to the farming tradition their families have struggled to maintain on the edge of the dense city of 23 million people. Carlos Jiménez, 61, has long worked the fields of Xochimilco, but began to grow the shorter marigold plants eight years ago when he noticed the hybrid was more marketable. As he’s lost more crops and gotten lower prices for the plants because of the mildew gathering at their roots, he said he’s begun considering ways to adapt, like building greenhouses. “The plants get sick, they rot, and our business is snuffed out,” Jiménez said. “And with it goes our tradition because it’s our economy.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Flor Jimenez waters her crop of cempasuchil flowers in preparation for Day of the Dead celebrations in Xochimilco where marigolds are grown on the outskirts of Mexico City, Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025.

Her family and other farmers have called on local authorities for help, but say they’ve received just pennies on the dollar of what they need to bounce back. Though the local government has said it continues to work to help offset the blow felt by farmers. She said she’s begun to look at other crops she might be able to farm that are more resilient than the crinkled orange flowers. Others like Jiménez said that while the roots of plants may rot around him, for now he’s holding strong. “This plant has a deeper meaning to our lost loved ones,” he said. “These are traditions we carry down from our ancestors.

The rules are expected to face legal challenges, and the broader administration’s aggressive, cross-sector attacks on transgender rights—including canceled research, a suicide prevention lifeline, and policy changes in education and military—have created a chilling effect on providers and institutions.

Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 9:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth will be dramatically restricted by the Trump administration under new proposals by the Department of Health and Human Services. NPR has obtained the draft text of a  proposed rule  that would prohibit federal Medicaid reimbursement for medical care provided to transgender patients younger than age 18. It also prohibits reimbursement through the Children's Health Insurance Program or CHIP for patients under age 19. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       An  additional proposed rule  would go even further, blocking all Medicaid and Medicare funding for any services at hospitals that provide pediatric gender-affirming care. The rules are being prepared for public release in early November, according to an employee at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The employee asked that NPR not use their name because they fear professional retribution for speaking to the media without authorization. An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about the planned timing of the proposed rules' release. A near ban in all states Both supporters and opponents of transgender rights agree that, taken together, the forthcoming rules could make access to pediatric gender-affirming care across the country extremely difficult, if not impossible. The care is already banned in  27 states . \"These rules would be a significant escalation in the Trump administration's attack on access to transgender health care,\" says  Katie Keith , director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. \"I think it's really, really important to note that nothing is changing immediately,\" she explains. \"These would be proposals that would go out for public comment, it would take months for the Trump administration to issue a final rule, and then, if past is prologue, we would see litigation over whatever the final rules are.\" Administration goals In his first days in office, President Trump signed an  executive order  declaring that the United States \"will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another.\" In the months since, HHS  released a report  critical of the research that supports access to this care. A federal suicide prevention lifeline specifically for transgender youth  was cancelled , as were  hundreds of millions  of dollars in scientific research funding related to LGBTQ people. Federal health officials warned  state Medicaid directors  to tread carefully, and the Department of Justice  announced subpoenas  of some children's hospitals and  threatened providers  with prosecution. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think these restrictions are very good,\" says Terry Schilling of the forthcoming rules. Schilling is president of the  American Principles Project , a conservative advocacy group. \"It's going to change the entire transgender industry, and it's going to take away a lot of their funding streams.\" He points to  an opinion poll  from the spring, which found 66% of the public opposes Medicaid coverage for this type of care for young people. \"They believe that if you want to get some type of sex-trait modification procedure, you should have to pay for it,\" Schilling says. \"The American people are fully behind this effort.\" Dramatic new expansion of power The proposal to condition a hospital's participation in Medicaid and Medicare on halting gender-affirming care for youth represents an \"unprecedented\" use of the executive branch's power to control what medical care is available in hospitals, says Keith. \"Because Medicare is such a significant portion of many hospitals' revenue,\" she explains, the rule would essentially force hospitals to end their gender care   programs for transgender youth. That would mean all of those programs' patients — whether they have Medicaid or private insurance — would lose access. This is not how the federal government normally uses this type of rule, Keith says. She served in the Biden administration on the Gender Policy Council, and worked on some \" conditions of participation \" regulations for Medicare and Medicaid, she says. \"They're so basic — it's like, you have to have a crash cart [with] enough medicine to help a pregnant woman in crisis.\" Instead of health and safety standards, this proposal would instruct hospitals \"to stop offering a certain type of care completely to a certain patient population,\" she says. Law professor  Katie Eyer  of Rutgers University questions whether such a rule would survive a court challenge. \"But if it were successful, I shudder to think what this administration would do with such a tool in their hands,\" she says. It could open the door for any White House to withhold all federal funding from hospitals over the provision of medical care that it disfavors. \"The writing has been on the wall that this has been coming,\" says  Lindsey Dawson , director of LGBTQ Health Policy at KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization. Yet the timing of the release has been a mystery for months. Notice of both proposed rules — though not the rules themselves — appeared on a government register over the summer, and it's been unclear why they have yet to be released, Dawson says. 'An obsessive focus' The administration's efforts on transgender issues stretch far beyond health policy and beyond youth. The Federal Trade Commission recently  hosted a workshop  \"on unfair or deceptive trade practices in 'gender-affirming care' for minors.\" The military forced out  transgender servicemembers . Universities have been told their federal funding is  contingent  on adopting anti-transgender policies on issues like bathroom access. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Even the impending lapse in funding for food assistance, or SNAP, is linked to Democratic support for \"gender mutilation procedures,\" according to a banner on the  Department of Agriculture website . \"It's endless,\" says Eyer. \"It really has been an obsessive focus that's been deployed across the administration.\" The warning letters and cancelled grants and more have had a significant chilling effect. In the states where the care is still legal,  many clinics and hospitals  have ended their programs for gender-affirming care. If these rules were to take effect, the remaining programs would likely follow suit. \"There are real people behind all this,\" says Eyer, who is also the parent of a transgender child. \"People are really scared and suffering as a result of this onslaught of attacks on the trans community.\" It's still legal, although access is shrinking Gender-affirming care for youth — including puberty blocking medications, hormones, and rarely, surgery — does not actually violate federal law, Eyer notes. And, despite recent  political pressure , no major U.S. medical organization has altered their clinical guidance that supports these treatments as appropriate and safe. Approximately  3% of youth in the U.S.  identify as transgender or nonbinary, although not all of them seek medical treatment related to their identity. Notably, in Utah, a  state-commissioned analysis  of the evidence recently came to the opposite conclusion as the Trump administration's transgender report. University of Utah researchers found that there was ample evidence of benefits and safety for these treatments, and wrote that policy restrictions on this care for youth \"cannot be justified based on the quantity or quality of medical science findings or concerns about potential regret in the future.\" The draft text of the proposed federal rule obtained by NPR does not mention the Utah analysis, nor does it cite the American Academy of Pediatrics, whose guidelines  also support  access to the care. In Eyer's view, the public release of these rules will offer the opportunity for them to be legally challenged. \"It will be subject to  'arbitrary and capricious' review , and a court will presumably take a close look at the factual basis that actually underlies it,\" she says. \"That is actually preferable to what we've had up until now, which is coercion without law.\" Diane Webber edited this story. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/zohran-mamdani-andrew-cuomo-bill-de-blasio-8da7fc3331340c897d6a71f83e59ddc5","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:06:45+00:00","title":"British Newspaper Says It Was Duped by Someone Impersonating Former NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Long Island wine importer named Bill DeBlasio sent a critique of Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani to a reporter from the Times of London, mistakenly identifying himself as the former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio.

Last week, he decided to respond — inadvertently setting off an  international news cycle  based on misinformation in the final days of New York City’s mayoral election.  After receiving an email from a reporter with the Times of London asking for his — well, de Blasio’s — thoughts on  Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani , DeBlasio replied with a four paragraph critique of the candidate’s agenda, which the real ex-mayor has enthusiastically endorsed.  “I did some research on the proposals and I wrote down my thoughts and used ChatGPT to do a little fine-tuning,” DeBlasio, 59, told The Associated Press. “Then I forgot about it and went on vacation.

in the 1940s: Was it a young  T. rex  or another type of dinosaur?  At first, researchers had only a  tyrannosaur skull  to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn’t settle the controversy.  Now a research team said there’s new evidence that resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton — first uncovered in 2006 in Montana — that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.  The discovery “rewrites decades of research on Earth’s most famous predator,” said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Growth rings within the bones found in Montana’s Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully-fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature’s skull and an adult T. rex’s — changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses — were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 The International Space Station marks 25 years of nonstop human presence in orbit \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 How tiny drones inspired by bats could save lives in dark and stormy conditions \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Storm reveals artifacts preserved in Quinhagak permafrost \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Signs pointed to a dinosaur that’s a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n There’s now “more support and evidence than there ever has been” that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she’s not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new. Other independent scientists also said the debate isn’t over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n There are similarities between the shape of T. rex’s skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps. “I don’t think this study settles everything,” he said.  Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago — or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the WRAP until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.  “I think it’s very problematic,” Van Hollen told The Associated Press. “They want to keep the public in the dark.” The senators’ letter cites  an AP investigation  this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people — sometimes for hours — on deportation flights dating to 2020.

After a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said he would cut tariffs on the Asian economic giant and China would, in turn,  purchase 25 million metric tons  of U.S. soybeans annually for the next three years. The Republican president claimed his  trade negotiations  would secure “prosperity and security to millions of Americans.” But back in Washington, senators — several from Trump’s Republican Party — have demonstrated their dissent with Trump’s tariff tactics by passing  a series of resolutions this week that would nullify  the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify the import taxes. Already this week, the Senate approved resolutions to end tariffs imposed on Brazil and Canada. While the legislative efforts are ultimately doomed, they exposed fault lines in the GOP. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The latest resolution, which would effectively end most of Trump’s tariff policies, passed on a 51-47 vote, with four Republicans joining with all Democrats. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A 3rd teenager is indicted for the killing of a congressional intern in Washington \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             1 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 APEC leaders open economic summit after Trump and Xi agreed on steps to ease trade tensions \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 National Guard in each state is ordered to create ‘quick reaction forces’ trained in civil unrest \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Sen.

But House Republicans have instituted a new rule that allows the leadership to prevent such resolutions from coming up for a vote. Plus, Trump would surely veto legislation that inhibits his power over trade policy, meaning the legislation won’t ultimately take effect. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Democrats can force a vote but not a result But Democrats have still been able to force the Senate to take up an uncomfortable topic for their Republican colleagues. “American families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a floor speech. He added that “in many ways, red states in rural areas are being hit the hardest,” and pointed to economic strain being put on farmers and manufacturers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that Americans shouldn’t be fooled by Trump’s announcement. “Donald Trump has folded, leaving American families and farmers and small businesses to deal with the wreckage from his blunders, from his erratic on again off again tariff policies,” said the New York Democrat. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n How Republicans see Trump’s trade policy Overall, there has been little movement among Republicans to oppose Trump’s import taxes publicly. A nearly identical resolution failed in April on a tied vote after Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was absent. On Thursday, McConnell and Paul, as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted along with all Democrats to pass the resolution. Those four Republicans helped advance similar resolutions this week to end the tariffs on Brazil and Canada. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also voted in favor of the  resolution applying to Brazil , but otherwise, GOP senators have held the line this week behind the president. “I agree with my colleagues that tariffs should be more targeted to avoid harm to Americans,” said Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, in a floor speech. Yet, he added that Trump’s negotiations “are bearing fruit” and praised his announcement that Beijing would allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans again. Republicans representing farm states were especially enthused by the announcement that China would be purchasing 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually, starting with 10 million metric tons for the rest of this year. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said the deal with China “absolutely” justifies Trump’s use of tariff threats to negotiate trade policy with other nations. He called the announcement “huge news” for Kansas farmers, but also acknowledged that they would still probably need financial help as they deal with the strain of losing their biggest customer for soybeans and sorghum. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “It’s not like you can snap your finger and send over $15 billion worth of sorghum and soybeans together overnight,” he said. China had been the largest purchaser of U.S. soybeans until this year. It purchased almost  27 million metric tons in 2024 , so Trump’s negotiated deal only guarantees to return soybean exports to China to less than their previous level. Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, called the purchase agreement a “start.” Asked whether he agreed with Trump’s assessment that his meeting with Xi had been a runaway success, Cramer smiled and said the president “is nothing if not optimistic.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-nuclear-weapons-testing-7a4626d2f9f8df62aa250b2acded51fd","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"03:37:14+00:00","title":"Trump Suggests Resuming U.S. Nuclear Explosive Testing, Sparking Global Alarm","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced on social media that the United States would resume nuclear explosive testing on an 'equal basis' with Russia and China, sparking global alarm.

three decades, saying it would be on an “equal basis” with Russia and China. The Kremlin pointed out that a global ban on nuclear tests has remained in place, but warned that if any country resumes nuclear testing, Russia would follow suit.  There was no indication the U.S. would start detonating warheads, but Trump offered few details about what seemed to be a significant shift in U.S. policy. He made the announcement on social media minutes  before he met with Chinese leader  Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea to discuss trade. He offered little clarity when he spoke to reporters later aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington. The U.S. military already regularly tests its missiles that are capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, but it has not detonated the weapons since 1992. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which the U.S. signed but did not ratify, has been observed since its adoption by all countries possessing nuclear weapons, North Korea being the only exception. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump suggested, however, that changes were necessary because other countries were testing weapons.

When Trump spoke to reporters later, he appeared to be conflating the testing of missiles that deliver a nuclear warhead with the testing of the warheads. Other countries, he said, “seem to all be nuclear testing,” but when it comes to the U.S., “We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don’t do testing.” “I see them testing and I say, well, if they’re going to test, I guess we have to test,” Trump said as he continued speaking to reporters. Trump was asked where the tests would occur and he said, “It’ll be announced. We have test sites.” Pentagon officials didn’t immediately respond to questions about the announcement from Trump on the nuclear missile tests. Vice Admiral Richard Correll, Trump’s nominee to lead the military command in charge of the nation’s nuclear arsenal, was pressed by U.S. senators at his confirmation hearing Thursday to try to interpret the president’s comments.  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Correll said.  “Well, that’s what he said,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said. Correll pointed out that neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, but then said, “I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out of it.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine later questioned whether Trump might have meant the testing of the weapons delivery systems, such as missiles, not the weapons themselves.  “I don’t have insight into the president’s intent,” Correll said. “I agree that that could be an interpretation.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday assailed Trump’s announcement, saying in a statement that “current nuclear risks are already alarmingly high.”  “We must never forget the disastrous legacy of over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests carried out over the last 80 years,” Guterres said, according to his deputy spokesperson, Farhan Haqq.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Russia tests of new nuclear-powered weapons  Putin this week announced that Russia  tested a new atomic-powered  and nuclear-capable underwater drone and a new  nuclear-powered cruise missile.  Putin did not announce any tests of Russia’s nuclear weapons, however, which last occurred in 1990. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, emphasized that Russia’s recent tests of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater drone had nothing to do with the global ban on testing nuclear warheads. “Regarding the tests of the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, we hope that President Trump was correctly informed about it,” Peskov said. “There is no way it can be interpreted as nuclear testing.” Trump did not specifically mention the Russian tests in his post, but alluded to the nuclear stockpiles controlled by both Xi and Putin, saying, “Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.” Putin in 2023 signed a bill  revoking Russia’s ratification of a global nuclear test ban , which Moscow said was needed to put Russia on par with the U.S. The global test ban was signed by President Bill Clinton but never ratified by the Senate. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Earlier this year, Trump  signaled he wanted to push his Russian and Chinese counterparts in the other direction,  saying he wanted to resume nuclear arms control talks with both countries.  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson called on the U.S. to refrain from carrying out nuclear tests. “China hopes the U.S. will earnestly fulfill its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and honor its commitment to suspend nuclear testing,” Guo Jiakun said at a briefing in Beijing. Despite his announcement that sounded like an escalation, Trump told reporters that he would like to see a “denuclearization” and “de-escalation.” “We are actually talking to Russia about that,” Trump said, though he did not elaborate.  Arms control advocates worried Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, quickly criticized the president’s announcement and said Trump was “misinformed and out of touch.” Kimball, in social media posts, said the U.S. has no reason to resume nuclear explosive testing and it would take at least 36 months to resume testing at the former test site in Nevada, where the last detonations occurred underground. ___ Price reported from Washington.

My boss and I disagreed on a major financial investment and the conversation escalated. They criticized my working style and said that I just didn't have enough experience to understand the decision. And I took those comments personally.   I remember walking out of the office feeling anxious and panicked. And what was strange was that I couldn't seem to snap out of it — those emotions hung over me for weeks. I eventually had to reach out to a therapist for help.  It turns out I was experiencing distress, says  Dr. Kali Cyrus , a Washington, D.C.- based psychiatrist. It's what happens when you experience   negative emotions and physical symptoms like stress, fatigue and anxiety over a long period of time, to the point that it affects your everyday life. Cyrus calls it \"discomfort at extreme levels.\"  Distress may stem from a fight, like in my case; a major life disruption, like losing a job or going through a breakup; or a high-pressure situation, like having to plan a big event.  Cyrus says you can prevent discomfort from ratcheting up to distress by paying more attention to your body and mind — and learning how to be OK with being uncomfortable.   \n       \n      Related Story:  What to do if you're struggling with your mental health at work  \n       You want to do that because \"stress adds excess work to our body, exacerbating its wear and tear,\" she says.  Research shows  that long periods of stress can lead to high blood pressure, elevated hormone levels and conditions like chronic fatigue, depression and immune disorders.   Is it discomfort or is it distress?  Let's say you've been triggered by a stressful incident. Notice what's going on in your body and mind. Do you feel uncomfortable?  \"When you are not feeling good, your body is trying to tell you something,\" says Cyrus.  After my fight with my boss, for example, my chest felt tight, my stomach hurt, I had trouble sleeping and focusing, and I felt like I was on high alert.  These symptoms are a sign of discomfort, says Cyrus, which you may be able to manage with simple grounding techniques (a few are outlined below). But they can turn into distress if they stick around for more than a few hours or days. Mine lasted for weeks.  When you are in this state, your \"nervous system gets dysregulated and that messes up the balance of hormones in your body,\" she adds, preventing it from \"regulating in these times of need.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  Life Kit: Dealing with anxiety \n       Distress can also show up \"in the form of depression, chronic pain or anxiety\" that impact you \"most days of the week and get in the way of your ability to work or spend time with friends,\" she says.  If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, Cyrus recommends seeing your primary care doctor. Get a physical exam and blood work done to narrow down any possible health issues. If your symptoms aren't related to your physical health, talk to your doctor about seeking mental health intervention, like therapy or medication prescribed by a psychiatrist.  How to keep distress in check  The good news is that there are ways to prevent feelings of discomfort from escalating into distress. Cyrus shares a few techniques.   Change the scene If you catch yourself spiraling — you can't seem to catch your breath, you're feeling anxious or you're having trouble focusing — find a way to snap out of it. \"Go outside, go to the bathroom, call a friend, take a few deep breaths,\" says Cyrus.  Your nervous system is being flooded with stress hormones, making it hard to calm down or see things clearly. So you need to interrupt the feelings that are overwhelming you by changing your environment, she adds.  I didn't realize I had done this after my fight with my boss. After our argument, I left the office immediately and went for a long walk. Just noticing the trees and the birds around me got me out of my head.   Recount what happened  Go over your situation again and create a narrative, says Cyrus. This can help pinpoint what is giving you distress and jog your memory of details you may have overlooked that can add levity to the situation. Do this with a friend, a family member, a therapist — or even yourself, by journaling or \"talking out loud as you walk your dog,\" says Cyrus, as she likes to do.  Name your emotions As you describe what happened, name your emotions, she adds. She recommends using the feelings wheel, a tool that can help you express your emotions more specifically (for example, instead of saying you simply feel \"bad,\" maybe you actually feel \"indifferent.\")    \n       \n      Related Story:  These habits can cut the risk of depression in half, a new study finds \n       I turned to a therapist to help me unpack my fight with my boss. She helped me realize that it wasn't my boss or the argument that was making me upset, but the feeling of being dismissed and made to feel small. That allowed me to see a different perspective on the issue.  Identify your triggers  Examine what gives you discomfort. For example, if you have terrible road rage, Cyrus says to have a conversation with yourself about it. You might ask yourself: Why am I prone to being so angry on the road? Is it because I am in a rush? Or is it because I hate sitting in traffic?  Then, find ways to alleviate the situation. To avoid being rushed, maybe leave the house a half hour early. To avoid traffic, ask your boss if you can work from home a couple times a week.  As for me, I've learned that I tend to be sensitive to feedback when it includes a reference to my lack of experience. It makes me defensive and angry.  So now, when I find myself in this circumstance, I remind myself to breathe deeply, pause, tell the other person that I need time and space to consider their feedback — and that I'll come back to them when I'm ready. This helps me feel more in control of my feelings.  The audio portion of this episode was produced by Sylvie Douglis. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual editor is Beck Harlan.

LILIANA MARIA PERCY RUIZ, HOST:   Hi, everyone. I'm Liliana Maria Percy Ruiz, in for Marielle Segarra. And I'm here to talk about something uncomfortable, literally. A few years ago, I had a bad day at work. A conflict erupted with my boss that left me feeling anxious and panicked, and I couldn't get rid of it. My chest felt tight. My stomach hurt. I had trouble sleeping and focusing. And I felt like I was on high alert. I knew something was wrong. I just didn't know what it was. KALI CYRUS: I actually don't even know if clients say, I'm coming to you because I'm in a state of distress. PERCY RUIZ: Dr. Kali Cyrus is a psychiatrist based in Washington, D.C. Dr. Kali says that when we are triggered by something in our lives, it is hard for us to decipher between what is discomfort, meaning something we can tolerate and work through, and what is distress. CYRUS: In thinking about those words, one seems like a precursor to another. Discomfort at extreme levels or heightened levels can lead to distress. It's ratcheted in intensity is past discomfort, or I think in frequency is when it starts to transition into the unhealthy, which is when I think of distress. PERCY RUIZ: Distress has the word stress in it for a reason. And when we're in a state of distress for longer periods, it puts a negative impact on our body that can become toxic, leading to high blood pressure, elevated hormone levels, and conditions like chronic fatigue, depression and immune disorders. Thankfully, there are techniques to help mitigate distress. In this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to talk about how to get our bodies more comfortable with being uncomfortable so that we can avoid getting to a state of distress. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PERCY RUIZ: Dr. Kali, let's talk about what happens when my body is really uncomfortable. For me, it feels like my body is on fire. It's hard to focus because I'm so overwhelmed. What do you recommend people do to dial down that feeling? CYRUS: In these moments, if you are really panicky, you need to change the scene. Change the scene. Go outside. Go to the... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Bathroom. Call a friend. You need to neutralize your nervous system that is overactivated because it's not seeing things accurately, which means you might send an email. You might curse someone out. You might spend a bunch of - you might do something because your nervous system is like, (vocalizing). PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: You just want to calm down. And so try to do something that that changes the context that might be triggering what is going on. So go outside, take a few deep breaths. I say sometimes, like, even just get on Instagram. PERCY RUIZ: I love this. You're encouraging people to go on Instagram. What a difference (laughter). CYRUS: It's a - but it's... PERCY RUIZ: Because you're stopping what's going on in the moment, right? CYRUS: Right. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: You're recognizing why you're going on there. You're not just, like, doomscrolling. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: So when it's happening, you need to interrupt it. PERCY RUIZ: That's takeaway one - when you're feeling that level of discomfort and it feels like you can't get out of it, make a change. Do something to break it up. But I know it's easier said than done. So I asked Dr. Kali, once you're ready for more analysis, how do you do that? CYRUS: Try to put a story or a narrative to what you're feeling. And sometimes you have to think back to something that you may even think is insignificant and and start there and kind of trace back your steps because - and with the unknown, our brain wants to tell us a story. It's filling in the blanks about why there's discomfort there... PERCY RUIZ: Got it. CYRUS: ...Usually probably with the worst case scenario or something... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Really stressful. And what you have to do is to kind of back up and actually get your front brain - like, the brain that puts words to things, that tells us how to do complex steps and tasks, that is like, no, you're being irrational. You have to get the front brain involved and say, hey. No. This is a thing that happened at work - she said this; he said that; my boss did this - while you're also examining how your emotions feel, or that fear or that thing you're worried about is influencing what actually happened from your perspective. PERCY RUIZ: Got it. CYRUS: And as long - until you put those things into words, it just sits there. PERCY RUIZ: So takeaway two - try and put words to your feelings. You can talk to a friend or family member or a therapist, but you can also do this on your own. CYRUS: So I tell folks to journal. Yeah. Or I even - you know, what I do is I speak out loud when I'm walking the dog because I can't get myself to sit down and journal for the life of me. But what you have to do is just get it out of that vague place, and what you have to do is you have to name it. So sometimes, you know, that's why it's so uncomfortable because it doesn't have any words attached to it. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah, yeah. CYRUS: So you - I think of it as like pulling it out of a cabinet and actually, like, naming what that thing is. PERCY RUIZ: So by telling the story, which also in my mind goes to, like, just stating the facts - here are the facts that happened, the things that I know - is that how you would talk about it? Like, do you say facts, like, without the emotion? Just for example, I was at work, and my boss said this thing to me, and then I felt this way, and then I went here, and, like, kind of like retracing your steps. CYRUS: Yeah. Yeah, no, that's exactly it. And I think you also did a thing that was really - you've got some good therapy, or you're just very self-aware and - great, so... PERCY RUIZ: Lots of years. Lots of years. (LAUGHTER) CYRUS: Most people miss the feelings part. So, yes, you go through and explain what happened from your point of view. Try to just see it just as - the way it happened. But, yes, you have to name the thing that you were feeling because that's what - the affect is the thing that's being stored. And so by naming it like, I felt really angry, or, I felt really insecure; I felt like I was stupid - I think this is the hardest part, actually... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Is having to say the feeling out loud. And I'm a huge proponent of the feelings wheel. I bring it up. I share my screen with my clients and I say... PERCY RUIZ: Yes. CYRUS: ...How did you feel when this happened? PERCY RUIZ: Google it, people. It's so helpful. CYRUS: And it feels so cheesy, but it's really useful because then you can say, I felt stupid. And then you say to yourself, you know what? I'm human. Is it... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: I'm allowed to feel that way. I felt that way. It's OK. I'm looking at it from another angle, and I can see that I was this - it's realistic I felt that way. I was entitled to feel that way. It actually makes sense that I felt that way. And then you keep going. PERCY RUIZ: Now, I went into my conversation with Dr. Kali thinking we'd be parsing out the difference between discomfort and distress. But what I learned is that if you don't learn to deal with normal levels of discomfort, you will be in distress. So takeaway three is practice sitting in discomfort. CYRUS: Discomfort is really important to think about as not something that's completely negative. Everyone should try to encourage themselves to calm their fear response. And try to understand and take up information about why they might be feeling, like, discomfort because that's telling you something about this moment, and it might be something exciting that you're about to learn. So this... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Is my way of saying, I think of discomfort as, like, a low intensity of something being brought up in you - of an intensity of feelings, or that you might be having to - something your brain is perceiving and your body is picking up on. But if it is a thing that maybe you don't have control over stopping and it continues to grow and you have to sit in this state for long periods of time and you maybe don't see an end or it continues to grow every day and it's there - you know, you go to work. Maybe something happened. You go to work the next day. It builds, and you're still not getting any other information. That's really scary. That is the state in which this becomes distress. And that's when your nervous system gets dysregulated, which is not good for your body because then that messes up the balances of hormones and the way your body, your nervous system, is responding that is ideally supposed to help you regulate in these times of need, not every day... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah, yeah. CYRUS: ...Because then you get, like, high cholesterol. You get high blood pressure. You get all these weird things that happen to your body over time. PERCY RUIZ: So I'm curious. When do you know, how do you know when something is too much? - because I'm thinking about the fact that - for myself and, I imagine, many people listening - like, you want to grow. You want to become more resilient. You know, these are things that we hear about, read about. We long to be people that are getting better and better, right? CYRUS: Yeah, yeah. PERCY RUIZ: But how do we identify what things are just - they're just not for us, or they're not going to be areas of growth? They are actually too distressing. CYRUS: Yeah. PERCY RUIZ: Is that even a thing that we should think about? CYRUS: Yeah. Yeah. It's when your body is super tense. You're really tired. You are snapping at everyone because you feel like everyone is being snappy to you. So you're you feel really irritable, one, but also targeted and unsafe. You're perceiving hyper, like, threats. You're probably not sleeping well. You're not eating well. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: When your body is not functioning, you're... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Doing - something is not working. Something is not working. And, again, like, when you think about depression or some folks who just have anxious brains that are shaped that way, there may not always be a reason... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...That you can point back to. It could be a season. You know, it - but when you are not feeling good, your body is trying to tell you something. PERCY RUIZ: And that's when you really - you do need to seek medical help. CYRUS: Yeah, yeah. And so what we usually do is once I - we encourage folks to go to the primary care doctor first. If you hadn't had a physical, get all blood tests taken to make sure it's not a thyroid thing or an anemic thing going on that is making this happen. And then after that... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...It's really telling your nervous system, something is going on. Something in your life is shutting your body down or is making - it's putting you in and out, in and out of, like, a danger response. And you need to find ways to stop that. And it might be the first thing you only have is medication to calm down in the moment - again, because if you're too triggered, you can't do anything. PERCY RUIZ: Exactly. CYRUS: So some folks need medicine, even if it's temporarily, to get them to a state when they can start to do the processing and being able to, like, actually stop and leave the room without engaging too much or take that break or be able to practice their breathing skills or practice other things to see if it works. But when you're in the thick of it, you have to find a way to get - bump yourself down a level from distress to something else. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah, so that you can even be in a place where you can be uncomfortable because you're not even uncomfortable. You're just on a whole other level. CYRUS: Yeah. You were terrified, probably. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: Yeah. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: Yeah. Or shut down, you know? PERCY RUIZ: Are there preventative steps - things that you can do in your daily life to - I don't know if prepare is the right word, but just kind of build, you know, the ability to be uncomfortable to, to be... CYRUS: Yeah. PERCY RUIZ: ...In that place where, you know, like we were just saying, we all have to deal with this every day of... CYRUS: Yeah, yeah. PERCY RUIZ: ...Our lives, right? Anyone who interacts with another human being is going to be uncomfortable in some way, right? CYRUS: Because they're unpredictable. We are so unpredictable. Oh, my God. PERCY RUIZ: So how do you build that ability to be present to that, to be resilient in it? CYRUS: Yeah. So your psyche is trying to protect you from distress. You want to find healthy ways to confront that or cope with it. Sometimes you have to resort to avoiding it, being numb to it, but not for too long. You have to - if you put it in the cabinet, you have to come back and get it and look at it. You can't just keep it there for years and years until it's expired because it's not going to - still going to sit there. You have to come back to it. So you have to know it's a thing that's there. And this is where the kind of evidence collection comes from. And this is what I'll say to clients. You're not going to immediately be able to fix this. So what I'll say... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: ...Is let's understand it. PERCY RUIZ: That's takeaway four - to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable, get curious about yourself and your triggers. Start noticing what's happening around you. CYRUS: What happens right before this thing? What happens that morning? What do you notice when it doesn't happen? When do you feel at your best? PERCY RUIZ: Yes. CYRUS: What in general makes you happy? And you just try to latch on to those. And so it might be if you know you have terrible road rage - and this is a very difficult one because you still have to go to work. PERCY RUIZ: And still get in a car and drive (laughter). CYRUS: You still have to get in the car. And I'm still working with some clients on this one. What about if you exercise that morning? Does it matter what you listen to in the car, or what you eat? PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: And what can you place in your day - multiple things that might help, kind of like when you're playing Mario Kart and you have to gather some, like, stars or fruit. You just have to... PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: Yeah. I think if we're talking about going into a situation that I know will make me anxious - like, let's say I'm going to meet a relative of someone or going to an event that I may be unsure about. I will - I'm going to be insecure about what I'm wearing. Do I look like them? Do I look like I'm wearing something cheap? Do I - am I overdressed? You know, am I going to be the only Black person? And I have a little spiel for each of these. Well, I'm going to wear something that makes me feel like who I am today. I don't want to wear something too tight or a button is broken, shoes are uncomfortable. I want to get there early. PERCY RUIZ: Yes. CYRUS: I want to make sure I have something that can calm me down if I feel like I might get there immediately, even if I don't use it. I tell my partner ahead of time, I'm going to need you to keep an eye on XYZ. I might tell a friend there. You know, I might say, you know, you can leave. You can call an Uber. You've thought about the phrases... PERCY RUIZ: Yes. CYRUS: ...That you can say. You've asked whatever info, as much as you can, to find out about the event. So, one, trying to get info about the thing that might be distressing you, and then also literally just doing the things that you know might calm you or help you feel more prepared. PERCY RUIZ: But the patterns that you're talking about, though, talking to yourself and naming the things, that seems to be the place you begin to build that resiliency, is really getting comfortable with having a conversation with yourself... CYRUS: Yeah. PERCY RUIZ: ...About what you notice... CYRUS: Exactly. PERCY RUIZ: ...And the feelings. CYRUS: Exactly, and you have to recognize what's happening in your body as well, which is why things that get you in your body and aware of your senses and what you're experiencing are really useful, like working out. It also helps you healthwise in general. But this is the logic of why we do those things. Again, kind of hard for me to access sometimes, but I know clients who say, I started working out in the morning and I realized I could look at this hard report. It really helps me. I don't know how, but I realized that - so really knowing your body, talking to yourself, and being able to get information about what works or what doesn't work. PERCY RUIZ: How would you say that sitting with discomfort has made a difference in your life? CYRUS: I suppose what I've benefited from is I'm able to - when I'm triggered or start to recognize this thing happening, I know that that means, I need to come up with a way to address it. When I'm feeling so despairing, that means that I'm not doing something creative, or I'm not having fun or play - rewarding myself with these things that bring me out. And so I think sitting in it can help me appreciate a way to get out of it later. You know, it'll be easier next time. PERCY RUIZ: Yeah. CYRUS: And then it'll help me explain the next time I get to this place that I know I can get out. And I understand why I'm here. And it's OK. But it's not scary anymore. PERCY RUIZ: Thank you, Dr. Kali. You're just amazing. I love talking with you. CYRUS: Oh, no, this was really great. I like talking about this stuff. PERCY RUIZ: Yes, same. OK, deep breath, y'all - we can do this. To recap, when you're feeling really uncomfortable, make a change. Then name your feelings, either by journaling or talking it out with a friend or by yourself. After you've put words to it, practice sitting in the discomfort. And lastly, get some data about what makes you uncomfortable. Think about the things you need to prepare in advance for situations like getting enough sleep, meditating, moving your body or bringing a friend along.

defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during racial justice protests in 2020, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. In recent weeks, federal law enforcement officials have issued subpoenas and served at least one search warrant as part of an investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. and other Black-led organizations that helped spark a national reckoning on systemic racism, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss an ongoing criminal probe by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press. \n    \n     From AP’s Standards and Stylebook teams:   The AP is using anonymous sourcing to provide information for this story.

The recent burst of investigative activity is also unfolding at a time when  civil rights organizations have raised concerns  about the potential for the Trump administration to target a variety of progressive and left-leaning groups that have been critical of him, including those affiliated with BLM, the transgender rights movement and anti-ICE protesters. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Spokespeople for the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 AP Decision Notes: What to expect in Minnesota on Election Day \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A Confederate statue is restored as part of Trump’s efforts to reshape how history is told \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 San Francisco leaders push back against Trump’s National Guard threat \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n One of the people said the investigation had been initiated during the Biden administration but is getting renewed attention during the Trump administration.

Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase  a $6 million Los Angeles-area property  that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The leaders previously denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety. Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.” “We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement. Several localized BLM chapters, which are not affiliates of the foundation, have previously been at odds with the nonprofit over its plans for donations. Those chapters operate and fundraise independently of the foundation. The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old  Trayvon Martin  in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But as the movement’s influence grew, so did the number of organizations that became affiliated with BLM. In 2020, a tidal wave of public contributions in the aftermath of protests over Floyd’s murder came mainly to the BLM foundation, although other organizations were resourced from those funds. Leaders of the foundation  opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022 , revealing detailed accountings of expenditures. The latest Form 990 filing shows the BLM foundation had $28 million in assets for the fiscal year ending June 2024. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The investigation is being run out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California in Los Angeles.  The top prosecutor there, Bill Essayli,  was determined by a federal judge this week  to have stayed in his temporary acting U.S. attorney job longer than allowed by law. He was permitted to effectively remain the office’s chief prosecutor but with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney. Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s COVID-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against state policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n As a private practice attorney, he characterized BLM as a “radical organization” while defending a white couple charged in 2020 with a hate crime after they were videotaped defacing  a BLM mural in Martinez, California . At the time,  city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways  in cities throughout the U.S. in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli was quoted as telling reporters that his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor” Black Lives Matter, which he described as a “radical” group. At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action. In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed. ___ Alana Durkin Richer in Washington, D.C., and Graham Lee Brewer in Oklahoma City contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/erika-kirk-forgiveness-charlie-kirk-assassination-faith-efac5affba595080025e0249a4d911f4","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:02:58+00:00","title":"Public Acts of Forgiveness Spark National Reflection After Mass Shootings and Assassinations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah, his wife Erika Kirk publicly forgave the gunman, sparking a wave of public expressions of forgiveness across the U.S. This includes Hollywood actor Tim Allen forgiving a driver who killed his father decades ago and a Michigan church congregation forgiving the gunman who killed four and injured eight during a church attack.

conservative activist Charlie Kirk , as she struggled to hold back tears last month during his memorial service. Her public declaration inspired another. Hollywood actor Tim Allen said he was so moved by her words that he was forgiving the drunken driver who caused his father’s death 60 years ago. Barely two weeks after Charlie Kirk’s death, members of a Michigan congregation made public that  they too were forgiving a gunman , the one who had just attacked their church, killing four people and injuring eight others. Their high-profile acts of forgiveness are all the more remarkable given the politically charged and highly polarizing climate gripping the U.S. It has pushed people of faith to contemplate what forgiveness means, particularly in the face of violence, trauma and unspeakable grief, and whether it could shift public consciousness toward compassion. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n While some see a glimmer of hope in this moment, others are skeptical. Miroslav Volf, professor of theology at Yale Divinity School, said he views President Donald Trump’s response to  Erika Kirk’s words  — that he hates his opponents — as the more typical sentiment. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            More coverage\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Utah campus where Charlie Kirk was shot provided less security than other venues as he toured nation \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 A timeline of Charlie Kirk’s assassination and the arrest of a suspect \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Charlie Kirk’s AI resurrection ushers in a new era of digital grief \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                    \n                    \n                       \n                 \n             \n            \n             \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n     \n \n\n “Erika Kirk’s gesture is the outlier,” he said. “It was an extraordinary act of courage. But it was also telling that (Trump’s) response got the bigger reaction from the crowd at the memorial. You have to wonder about these two very different responses. How do we find space for grace when we are so at odds that we cannot recognize humanity on the other side of the divide?” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Forgiveness, a mandate for Christians California pastor Jack Hibbs, who leads Calvary Chapel Chino Hills and is a friend of the Kirks, called her words an “incredibly powerful” message of hope for the shooter, and in keeping with the family’s deep commitment to the Gospel, which commands Christians to forgive even their enemies.  “The Bible warns us that bitterness, when left alone, can grow up in and destroy your heart,” Hibbs said. “So forgiveness was given to us by God to set us free from what’s been done to us.” The Rev. Thomas Berg, visiting professor at the McGrath Institute for Church Life at the University of Notre Dame, said he hopes Erika Kirk’s gesture “ignites some kind of meaningful national conversation about forgiveness.” He said forgiveness is not a one-time event, but a process that takes time and work. Berg, who counsels victims of sex abuse in the Catholic Church, warns that it should never be coerced but authentically given — an act that he says has the power to heal the deepest wounds.  He would like to see more public expressions of forgiveness, which could serve as a balm for the country. “I hope this is not a passing moment,” he said. “The dynamic of forgiveness throws a wrench into the dysfunction of our partisan divides and our inability to have a reasonable exchange of ideas.” Dave Butler, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and science fiction writer based in Utah, believes forgiveness is a mandate for all Christians, as his church teaches. He started  a crowdfunding initiative  for the family of the Michigan shooter who opened fire on the Latter-day Saints congregation, which as of this week, had raised a little over $388,000. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Butler said he started it because — in addition to the grieving church members who had lost loved ones in this mass shooting — there was the family of the gunman that was also traumatized. “They also did not choose this,” he said. “Nevertheless, they are now short a husband and a father. If we’re not really thoughtful, we might be inclined to see them more as antagonists rather than victims. More than 10,000 people have contributed and they understand what they’re doing is an act of forgiveness.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Forgiveness from the perspective of Anabaptists An often-cited modern example of forgiveness is the  response of the Amish community  around Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, after a gunman killed five Amish schoolgirls and wounded five more in 2006 before taking his own life. Local Amish immediately expressed forgiveness for the killer and supported his widow. Amish are part of the wider Anabaptist movement, which puts heavy emphasis on Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, containing some of his most radical and counter-cultural sayings — to love enemies, live simply, bless persecutors, turn the other cheek and to endure sufferings joyfully. In it, Jesus says God will only forgive those who forgive others. While many outside the Anabaptists’ world have endorsed their beliefs about forgiveness — which they also  voiced for Haitian kidnappers  of Anabaptist missionaries in 2021 — others say the picture is more complex. Advocates for victims of sexual abuse in Anabaptist communities say victims and their families are often  forced to reconcile  with abusers after the latter make a confession and undergo a brief period of discipline. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A complicated journey for trauma survivors The Jewish perspective on forgiveness is different in that it requires the perpetrator to seek forgiveness from the person who has been wronged, said Rabbi Jeffrey Myers. He heads Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh where 11 people from three congregations were killed after a gunman attacked it during Shabbat services on Oct. 27, 2018.  “For me, it’s complicated because there are 11 dead people who cannot be sought for forgiveness,” Myers said, adding that he cannot offer forgiveness because the perpetrator — who faces execution — did not show remorse.  “While the perpetrator has received a measure of justice as outlined by the judicial process, it didn’t give me closure because those 11 people are gone,” Myers said. “There is nothing that makes that pain go away.” What gives him some comfort is being able to help other congregations that are going through similar trauma. Myers said he was grateful to have received that support from the Rev. Eric Manning, pastor of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, a historically Black church where a self-proclaimed white supremacist  shot and killed nine congregants  on June 17, 2015 — including the church’s pastor at the time. “Today, as someone who belongs to that club no one should belong to, I view it as my sacred obligation to help,” Myers said. “Even if I can help one person, that’s gratifying, that feels healing.” Peg Durachko, whose husband Dr. Richard Gottfried, a dentist, was one of the victims in the synagogue shooting, said that as a Catholic, she looked to Pope John Paul II for inspiration as she read about how he visited the imprisoned man who shot him and offered forgiveness. “I recognize (the gunman) as a child of God who made bad choices to lead him in that direction,” she said. “I’m not his judge, God is. I want him to have eternal life. I don’t harbor hate or ill wishes to anyone, including him. I don’t want to carry this baggage of hate.” ___ AP journalist Peter Smith in Pittsburgh contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s  collaboration  with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

In a Wednesday letter to the Trump administration’s top Supreme Court litigator, D. John Sauer, Reps. Chris Smith of New Jersey and John Moolenaar of Michigan urged the administration to side with the Falun Gong plaintiffs and press the court to allow the lawsuit to go to trial.  Smith co-chairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, while Moolenaar is the chairman of a special China committee set up in the House of Representatives — and both are prominent critics of Beijing’s human rights record. The letter cited  an AP investigation last month  that showed American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, saying it “underscore(s) the need to deter American firms from supplying technology to facilitate the CCP’s human rights abuses.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The decision ultimately rests with the Supreme Court whether to hear the challenge brought by Cisco arguing that U.S. law does not permit such a suit.

In 2008,  documents leaked to the press  showed Cisco saw the “Golden Shield” as a sales opportunity, quoting a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an “evil cult.” A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web.  Other presentations reviewed by AP show that Cisco represented Falun Gong material as a “threat” and built out a national information system to track Falun Gong believers. In 2011, Falun Gong members sued Cisco, alleging the company tailored technology for Beijing that they knew would be used to track, detain and torture believers. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether an American company can be held liable under two separate laws for aiding and abetting human rights violations. Cisco argues it isn’t liable under those laws, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), but a federal appeals court rejected the company’s arguments in 2023, allowing the case to continue. Now Cisco is asking the Supreme Court to throw out that ruling and stop the lawsuit. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. In the case of Cisco, the Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco’s activities involving China took place in the United States. An AP investigation this week  found that the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police and surveillance companies, even as activists warned such tools were being used to  quash dissent ,  persecute religious groups  and  target minorities . \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Going into the long-heralded meeting Thursday between leaders  Donald Trump  and  Xi Jinping , the sale of U.S. technology to China has been among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces,  with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake .  Trump said after the meeting  that China will speak with  Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia  about purchasing their computer chips. Debate over the sale of technology to China has grown heated, with some arguing for a harder stance. American companies have pushed back against restrictions, arguing it will push China to develop its own domestic supply and strengthen its position in the global race for leadership in artificial intelligence.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n But many national security experts say selling such technology could assist China’s military and intelligence services. The plaintiffs’ lawyers make a similar case, citing Cisco marketing materials in China that promoted routers for use in tanks. If the Cisco suit is successful, it would signal that American companies can be held liable in some circumstances for abuse of their technologies overseas. —- Kang reported from Beijing and Tau reported from Washington.

threatening major Caribbean flooding\n\nTropical Storm Melissa has strengthened into a  hurricane , the United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) says, as people across several Caribbean countries braced for heavy rainfall and dangerous flooding.\n\nHurricane Melissa was located about 380km (235 miles) southwest of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour, the NHC said in its latest advisory on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA hurricane warning was in place for Jamaica as the NHC said life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides were expected in portions of southern Hispaniola island – shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic – and Jamaica into early next week.\n\nThe centre of Melissa was expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, the NHC said, adding that it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.\n\nA hurricane watch was also in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from Port-au-Prince to the border with the Dominican Republic, according to the NHC advisory.\n\nAlready, three people have died in Haiti, including two killed in a landslide in the capital Port-au-Prince and another struck by a falling tree in Marigot, officials said.\n\nA fourth person was killed in the Dominican Republic, where another remains missing.\n\nJamaica’s Meteorological Service principal director Evan Thompson told The Gleaner that residents should brace for a “double effect” as the hurricane’s eye passes over the island, with the strongest winds hitting from opposite directions on either side of the centre.\n\nThe forecast marks a significant shift from earlier in the week, when landfall was considered only a “slim chance”.\n\nAuthorities have readied more than 650 emergency shelters across Jamaica and said airports will close once a hurricane warning is declared. Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned the public to treat the approaching storm as a serious threat. “Take all measures to protect yourself,” he said.\n\nThe storm has already wrought havoc in the Dominican Republic, where nearly 200 homes have been damaged and more than half a million people left without water.\n\nIn the Los Rios neighbourhood of the capital, Santo Domingo, families were forced to flee rising floodwaters on Thursday evening after surrounding streams burst their banks, according to the Listin Diario daily newspaper.\n\nMore than two dozen Dominican communities remain cut off by floodwaters, prompting mandatory evacuations and nationwide school closures.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for thousands displaced by gang violence in Port-au-Prince, now living in makeshift shelters with scant protection.\n\n“I’m dealing with two storms: the gangs and the weather,” Nephtali Johnson Pierre told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nMelissa is also forecast to strike eastern Cuba as a major hurricane on Wednesday."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-us-nuclear-tests-explainer-e641db1a4c99721bbd4ecd187d7dff65","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:27:20+00:00","title":"Trump Announces Restart of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Testing Amid Global Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that President Donald Trump announced in a Truth Social post that the U.S. would restart nuclear weapons testing, a move that contradicts over three decades of policy under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.

In it, Trump noted other countries testing weapons and wrote: “I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.”  The president’s post raised immediate questions. America’s nuclear arsenal is maintained by the Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semiautonomous agency within it — not the Defense Department. The Energy Department has overseen testing of nuclear weapons since its creation in 1977. Two other agencies before it — not the Defense Department — conducted tests. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Trump also claimed the U.S. “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country.” Russia is believed to have 5,580 nuclear warheads, according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association, while the U.S. has 5,225. Those figures include so-called “retired” warheads waiting to be dismantled. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute further breaks the warhead total down, with the U.S. having 1,770 deployed warheads with 1,930 in reserve. Russia has 1,718 deployed warheads and 2,591 in reserve.  The two countries account for nearly 90% of the world’s atomic warheads.  U.S. last carried out a nuclear test in 1992 From the time America conducted its “Trinity” nuclear bomb detonation in 1945 to 1992, the U.S. detonated 1,030 atomic bombs in tests — the most of any country. Those figures do not include the two nuclear weapons America used against Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.  The first American tests were atmospheric, but they were then moved underground to limit nuclear fallout. Scientists have come to refer to such tests as “shots.” The last such “shot,” called Divider as part of Operation Julin, took place Sept. 23, 1992, at the Nevada National Security Sites, a sprawling compound some 105 kilometers (65 miles) from Las Vegas.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n America halted its tests for a couple of reasons. The first was the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War. The U.S. also signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty in 1996. There have been tests since the treaty, however — by India, North Korea and Pakistan, the world’s newest nuclear powers. The United Kingdom and France also have nuclear weapons, while  Israel long has been suspected of possessing atomic bombs .  But broadly speaking, the U.S. also had decades of data from tests, allowing it to use computer modeling and other techniques to determine whether a weapon would successfully detonate. Every president since Barack Obama has backed plans to modernize America’s nuclear arsenal, whose maintenance and upgrading will cost nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. relies on the so-called “nuclear triad” — ground-based silos, aircraft-carried bombs and nuclear-tipped missiles in submarines at sea — to deter others from launching their weapons against America.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Restarting testing raises additional questions If the U.S. restarted nuclear weapons testing, it isn’t immediately clear what the goal would be. Nonproliferation experts have warned any scientific objective likely would be eclipsed by the backlash to a test — and possibly be a starting gun for other major nuclear powers to begin their own widespread testing.  “Restarting the U.S. nuclear testing program could be one of the most consequential policy actions the Trump administration undertakes — a U.S. test could set off an uncontrolled chain of events, with other countries possibly responding with their own nuclear tests, destabilizing global security, and accelerating a new arms race,” experts warned in a February article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The goal of conducting a fast-tracked nuclear test can only be political, not scientific. ... It would give Russia, China and other nuclear powers free rein to restart their own nuclear testing programs, essentially without political and economic fallout.” Any future U.S. test likely would take place in Nevada at the testing sites, but a lot of work likely would need to go into the sites to prepare them given it’s been over 30 years since the last test. A series of slides made for a presentation at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2018 laid out the challenges, noting that in the 1960s the city of Mercury, Nevada — at the testing grounds — had been the second-largest city in Nevada.  On average, 20,000 people had been on site to organize and prepare for the tests. That capacity has waned in the decades since.  “One effects shot would require from two to four years to plan and execute,” the presentation reads. “These were massive undertakings.” ___ This story has been corrected to fix transposed numbers for the United States and Russia’s nuclear missile reserves.  ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from  the Carnegie Corporation of New York  and  Outrider Foundation .

Melissa, now Category 4, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti\n\nHurricane Melissa  has rapidly strengthened into a major Category 4 with potentially catastrophic consequences, as it dropped torrential rain in the northern Caribbean and threatened disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/tropical-storm-melissa-takes-aim-at-caribbean-islands-on-alert","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"06:29:43Z","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa takes aim at Caribbean, islands on alert","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the first named storm of the Caribbean this year and the 13th of the Atlantic hurricane season, is moving slowly toward the Caribbean, bringing significant rainfall to Jamaica, southern Haiti, the southern Dominican Republic, Aruba, and Puerto Rico.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched a national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025 to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, aiming to prevent cervical cancer — a disease that kills eight women daily in the country.

has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/28/record-rains-drive-flooding-in-vietnam-submerging-ancient-city","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"14:12:41+00:00","title":"Record rains drive flooding in Vietnam, submerging ancient city","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Record-breaking rainfall in central Vietnam, particularly in the historic cities of Hue and Hoi An, has caused catastrophic flooding.

phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated multiple Caribbean nations, killing at least 32 people in Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.

pummeling the Caribbean island of Cuba after it first caused devastation in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research shows that mRNA vaccines developed for COVID-19 may enhance the immune system’s ability to detect and attack cancer, especially in patients with previously 'cold' tumors.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major AWS outage on October 20, 2025, began at 07:11 GMT due to a technical error in a software update to DynamoDB’s API, which disrupted the Domain Name System (DNS) and prevented apps from accessing critical data.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"For the first time in over four decades, mosquitoes have been detected in Iceland, specifically the cold-adapted Culiseta annulata species, marking a significant ecological shift.

detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/jamaica-braces-as-hurricane-melissa-strengthens-offshore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"06:45:50+00:00","title":"Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm with sustained winds over 250km/h, is threatening Jamaica with catastrophic damage due to its slow movement, extreme rainfall, and powerful winds.

take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/are-vaccine-mandates-needed-to-achieve-high-vaccination-rates","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:53:21+00:00","title":"Are vaccine mandates needed to achieve high vaccination rates?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the debate over whether vaccine mandates are necessary to achieve high vaccination rates in the United States, using comparisons with countries like Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the UK, and parts of Canada that do not enforce mandatory vaccination.

But experts say that fact alone does not make it a given that the US would follow the same pattern if it eliminates school vaccination requirements.\n\nFlorida state law currently requires students in public and private schools from daycare through 12th grade to have specific immunisations. Families can opt out for religious or medical reasons. About 11 percent of Florida kindergarteners are not immunised, recent data shows. With Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s backing, Ladapo is pushing to end the state’s school vaccine requirements.\n\nThe countries Ladapo cited – Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the UK and parts of Canada – don’t have broad vaccine requirements, research shows. Their governments recommend such protections, though, and their healthcare systems offer conveniently accessible vaccines, for example.\n\nUNICEF, a United Nations agency which calls itself the “global go-to for data on children”, measures how well countries provide routine childhood immunisations by looking at infant access to the third dose in a DTaP vaccine series that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough).\n\nIn 2024, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 94 percent of one-year-olds in the United States had received three doses of the DTaP vaccine. That’s compared with Canada at 92 percent, Denmark at 96 percent, Norway at 97 percent, Sweden at 96 percent and the UK at 92 percent.\n\nUniversal, government-provided healthcare and high trust in government likely influence those countries’ vaccine uptake, experts have said. In the US, many people can’t afford time off work or the cost of a doctor’s visit. There’s also less trust in the government. These factors could prevent the US from having similar participation rates should the government eliminate school vaccine mandates.\n\nMultiple studies have linked vaccine mandates and increased vaccination rates. Although these studies found associations between the two, the research does not prove that mandates alone cause increased vaccination rates. Association is not the same as causation.\n\nOther factors that can affect vaccination rates often accompany mandates, including local efforts to improve vaccination access, increase documentation and combat vaccine hesitancy and refusal.\n\nThe countries Ladapo highlighted are high-income countries with policies that encourage vaccination and make vaccines accessible.\n\nIn Sweden, for example, where all vaccinations are voluntary, the vaccines included in national programmes are offered for free, according to the Public Health Agency of Sweden.\n\nPreventive care is more accessible and routine for everyone in countries such as Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK with universal healthcare systems, said Dr Megan Berman of the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences.\n\n“In the US, our healthcare system is more fragmented, and access to care can depend on insurance or cost,” she said.\n\nMore limited healthcare access, decreased institutional trust and anti-vaccine activists’ influence set the US apart from those other countries, experts said.\n\nSome of these other countries’ cultural norms favour the collective welfare of others, which means people are more likely to get vaccinated to support the community, Berman said.\n\nAnders Hviid, an epidemiologist at Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, told The Atlantic that it’s misguided to compare Denmark’s health situation with the US – in part because Danish citizens strongly trust the government to enact policies in the public interest.\n\nBy contrast, as of 2024, fewer than one in three people in the US over age 15 reported having confidence in the national government, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group of advanced, industrialised nations. That’s the lowest percentage of any of the countries Ladapo mentioned.\n\n“The effectiveness of recommendations depends on faith in the government and scientific body that is making the recommendations,” said Dr Richard Rupp, of the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences.\n\nExperts said they believe US vaccination rates would fall if states ended school vaccine mandates.\n\nMaintaining high vaccination rates without mandates would require health officials to focus on other policies, interventions and messaging, said Samantha Vanderslott, the leader of the Oxford Vaccine Group’s Vaccines and Society Unit, which researches attitudes and behaviour towards vaccines.\n\nThat could be especially difficult given that the United States’s top health official, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, has a long history of anti-vaccine activism and scepticism about vaccines.\n\nThat makes the US an outlier, Vanderslott said.\n\n“Governments tend to promote/support vaccination as a public health good,” she said. It is unusual for someone with Kennedy’s background to hold a position where he has the power to spread misinformation, encourage vaccine hesitancy and reduce mainstream vaccine research funding and access, Vanderslott said.\n\nMost people decide to follow recommendations based on their beliefs about a vaccine’s benefits and their child’s vulnerability to disease, Rupp said. That means countries that educate the public about vaccines and illnesses will have better success with recommendations, he said.\n\nUltimately, experts said that just because something worked elsewhere doesn’t mean it will work in the United States.\n\nMatt Hitchings, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida’s College of Public Health and Health Professions, said a vaccine policy’s viability could differ from country to country. Vaccination rates are influenced by a host of factors.\n\n“If I said that people in the UK drink more tea than in the US and have lower rates of certain cancers, would that be convincing evidence that drinking tea reduces cancer risk?” Hitchings said.\n\nGoogle Translate was used throughout the research of this story to translate websites and statements into English."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/king-charles-iii-strips-prince-andrew-of-titles-evicts-him-from-royal-home","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"21:54:50+00:00","title":"King Charles III strips Prince Andrew of titles, evicts him from royal home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles III has taken an unprecedented step by formally stripping Prince Andrew of all royal titles and honours, including his designation as Prince of Wales and Duke of York, and evicting him from Royal Lodge.

Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBuckingham Palace said on Thursday the king “initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew”.\n\nAfter the king’s rare move, Andrew will be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and not as a prince, and he will move from his Royal Lodge residence into “private accommodation”.\n\nIt is almost unprecedented for a British prince or princess to be stripped of that title. It last happened in 1919, when Prince Ernest Augustus, who was a UK royal and also a prince of Hanover, had his British title removed for siding with Germany during World War I.\n\nDemand had been growing on the palace to remove the prince from Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title duke of York earlier this month over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir hit bookstores last week.\n\nBut the king went even further to punish him for  serious lapses of judgement  by removing the title of prince that he had held since birth as a child of a monarch, the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”\n\nGiuffre’s brother declared victory for his sister, who died in April at the age of 41.\n\n“Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage,” her brother Skye Roberts said in a statement.\n\nAndrew faced a new round of public opprobrium after emails emerged earlier this month showing he had remained in contact with Epstein longer than he previously admitted.\n\nThat news was followed by the publication of, Nobody’s Girl, by Giuffre, who alleged she had sex with Andrew when she was 17. The book detailed three alleged sexual encounters with Andrew, who she said acted as if he believed “having sex with me was his birthright”.\n\nAndrew, 65, has long denied Giuffre’s claims, but stepped down from royal duties after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he attempted to rebut her allegations.\n\nAndrew paid millions in an out-of-court settlement in 2022 after Giuffre filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he did not admit wrongdoing, he acknowledged Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.\n\nThe move by the king means Andrew will no longer be a prince or be known as “his royal highness”, “duke of York”, “earl of Inverness” or “baron Killyleagh” – all titles he held until now. Also gone are honours that include Order of the Garter and status as knight grand cross of the Royal Victorian Order.\n\nAndrew is expected to move to a property on the king’s Sandringham estate near the northeast coast and receive private financial support from his brother."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/pakistan-and-afghanistan-agree-to-maintain-truce-for-another-week-turkiye","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"22:58:20+00:00","title":"Pakistan and Afghanistan agree to maintain truce for another week: Turkiye","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan and Afghanistan have extended their ceasefire for another week following a weeklong border conflict sparked by explosions blamed on Pakistan.

desperate battles for control of Ukraine’s eastern towns of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, which Moscow considers a gateway to the remaining unoccupied areas of the Donetsk region.\n\nOn Sunday, Valery Gerasimov, Russian chief of staff,  told President Vladimir Putin his 2nd and 51st Combined Arms Armies were “advancing along converging axes” and “have completed the encirclement of the enemy” in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad.\n\nHe claimed some 5,500 Ukrainian troops were surrounded, including elite airborne and marine units.\n\nRussian military reporters contradicted these claims, with one named “Military Informant” telling 621,000 Telegram subscribers, “There is simply no encirclement” as the two claws of Gerasimov’s attempted pincer movement were still “several kilometres” apart.\n\nOn Thursday, Oleksandr Syrskii, the Ukrainian commander-in-chief, also denied Gerasimov’s claim.\n\n“The statements of Russian propaganda about the alleged ‘blocking’ of the defence forces of Ukraine in Pokrovsk, as well as in Kupiansk, do not correspond to reality,” Syrskii said.\n\nThe Russian reporter also thought it “extremely unlikely” that thousands of Ukrainian troops were trapped.\n\n“If earlier urban battles were a classic meat grinder ‘head-to-head’ with battles for each house,” he said, now they are “conducted by small groups of infantry with the support of many drones”.\n\nGeolocated footage showed that isolated Russian groups had entered western and central Pokrovsk on October 23, but they did not appear to control areas within the city, rather to stake out positions and await reinforcements.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said the situation around Pokrovsk “remains difficult”, and estimated that some 200 Russian troops had infiltrated the town, but said defending units were conducting sabotage operations that prevented Russian units from gaining a permanent foothold.\n\nThe front around Pokrovsk also remained dynamic.\n\nUkrainian military observer Konstantyn Mashovets reported that Kyiv’s troops were able to ambush Russian rear positions in the village of Sukhetsky, northeast of Pokrovsk, demonstrating the porousness of the front line.\n\n“[Russian] small infantry groups in some places began to collide with Ukrainian corresponding groups quite often and suddenly, even before their deployment or when moving to strengthen and replenish their assault groups directly,” said Mashovets.\n\n“Due to the abundance of drones in the air, which make the movement of any large concentrations of infantry extremely dangerous, the positions of both sides remain mixed,” said Kremlin-aligned Russian military news outlet Rybar. “This leads to the absence of a single front line and prevents the determination of the exact boundaries of the control zones.”\n\nMashovets estimated that the Russian 2nd Combined Arms Army, which he described as the “main impact force”, had received reinforcements of between 6,000 and 10,500 troops from other areas of the front ahead of the latest assault, which began in mid-October.\n\n“Special attention is focused on Pokrovsk and the neighbouring areas. That is where the occupier has concentrated its largest assault forces,” said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a Monday evening address. “It is Pokrovsk that is their main objective.”\n\nZelenskyy has often said his objective is to return the war to Russian soil. Ukraine’s long-range drones and cruise missiles were performing that task during the past week.\n\nUkraine struck the Ryazan oil refinery for the fifth time this year on October 23, setting ablaze a crude oil distillation unit. Russia’s Defence Ministry said 139 Ukrainian drones had been shot down overnight.\n\nLeningrad’s regional governor said “several” Ukrainian drones had been shot down without causing damage or casualties on Saturday.\n\nUkraine struck a fuel and lubricants container in Simferopol on Wednesday, Crimean occupation Governor Sergey Aksyonov said.\n\nRussian officials who have been supportive of US President Donald Trump’s efforts to negotiate a peace directly with Putin changed their tone after Trump cancelled a summit with Putin and imposed sanctions on Russian oil majors Lukoil and Rosneft last week.\n\n“The US is our adversary, and its verbose ‘peacemaker’ is now firmly on the warpath against Russia,” said Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia’s National Security Council, saying Trump was now “completely aligned with mad Europe”.\n\nOver cakes and tea with Russian war veterans on Monday, Putin announced the successful test launch of a new nuclear-powered torpedo with the ability to create radioactive tidal waves targeting coastal regions.\n\nThe Poseidon reportedly has a range of 10,000km (6,200 miles) and travels at 185km/h (115mph). As with previous unveilings of Russian weapons, Putin said, “There’s nothing like it in the world, its rivals are unlikely to appear anytime soon, and there are no existing interception methods”.\n\nDuma Defence Committee Chairman Andrey Kartapolov said the Poseidon was“capable of disabling entire states”.\n\nThree days earlier, Putin had announced the successful test of a new nuclear-capable cruise missile, the Burevestnik, which is also nuclear-powered.\n\n“It is a unique ware which nobody else in the world has,” Putin said.\n\nRussia followed a similar political intimidation tactic in November 2024, when it launched the  Oreshnik , a hypersonic, intermediate-range ballistic, nuclear-capable missile, to hit a Ukrainian factory in Dnipro. On Tuesday, Putin said he would deploy the Oreshnik in Belarus by December.\n\nRussia also tested the Sarmat, a new intercontinental ballistic missile that Putin said is not yet operational, in the Sea of Japan. None of the tests were independently verified, and it was unclear whether any of the new weapons were battle-ready or whether they could be produced at scale.\n\nOn October 22, Moscow conducted a routine strategic forces exercise, sending Tupolev-22M3 long-range bombers over the Baltic Sea, framing it as a reaction to Western aggression.\n\nTrump  said on Monday that Putin should instead focus on ending the war.\n\n“I don’t think it’s an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying,” said the US president. “You ought to get the war ended; the war that should have taken one week is now in … its fourth year, that’s what you ought to do instead of testing missiles.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/hamas-hands-over-two-bodies-after-israel-resumes-attacks-on-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:08:15+00:00","title":"Hamas hands over two bodies after Israel resumes attacks on Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the collapse of a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas has handed over two bodies of Israeli captives—Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch—taken during the October 7, 2023, attacks.

two bodies after Israel resumes attacks on Gaza\n\nThe Palestinian group Hamas has handed over two bodies it said were of deceased Israeli captives, a day after the fragile Gaza ceasefire was shattered by  a series of deadly Israeli strikes  across the besieged enclave.\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that the two bodies had been received by Israeli forces via the Red Cross in Gaza.\n\nIt later identified the bodies as belonging to Amiram Cooper (also spelled Kuper), who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Sahar Baruch, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri, both during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks.\n\nIsraeli authorities said the circumstances of their deaths would be determined once a post-mortem had been carried out at Tel Aviv’s Abu Kabir Forensic Institute.\n\nUnder the United States-brokered accord to halt Israel’s two-year war on Gaza, Hamas released 20 living captives in exchange for Israel releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian political prisoners. Israeli forces have also completed a partial withdrawal from urban centres in Gaza.\n\nBut since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, Israeli attacks have  killed dozens of Palestinians  across the enclave. From Tuesday into Wednesday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed 104 people, including 46 children and 20 women.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Hamas committed to returning the remains of all 28 captives in exchange for the bodies of Palestinians killed in the war. By Thursday, it had handed over 15 sets of remains, saying it continues to press for proper equipment and support to comb through vast mounds of rubble and debris – where thousands of Palestinians killed in Israeli bombardments are still buried.\n\nIsrael claims Hamas has been too slow to hand over the remaining bodies of Israeli captives still in Gaza.\n\nReporting from az-Zuwayda in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said Hamas is still facing “logistical and operational challenges regarding the retrieval of the bodies, specifically in areas that have been impacted by the Israeli bombardment”.\n\n“Hamas has been calling for the entry of heavy bulldozers and machines in order to facilitate the process of recovering bodies. But on the ground, Israel is still accusing Hamas of deliberately procrastinating the release of the bodies,” Abu Azzoum said.\n\nThe dispute over the recovery and handover of bodies has been one of the difficulties complicating US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war for good.\n\nNumerous major obstacles still lie ahead, including the future administration of Gaza and the demand for Hamas to disarm.\n\nEarlier, witnesses said Israeli planes carried out 10 air strikes in areas east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, and tanks shelled areas east of Gaza City in the north before dawn.\n\nThe Israeli military said it carried out “precise” strikes against “terrorist infrastructure that posed a threat to the troops” in the areas of Gaza where its forces are still present.\n\nMeanwhile, a United Nations official said more than 24,000 tonnes of UN aid have reached Gaza since the start of a ceasefire, while calling for NGOs to be allowed to assist in its distribution.\n\nWhile aid volumes are significantly up compared with the period before the ceasefire, humanitarians still face funding shortfalls, the UN says, as well as issues coordinating with Israeli authorities, which are continuing to seal vital border crossings.\n\nThe World Food Programme’s Middle East regional director, Samer Abdel Jaber, said in 20 days of scale-up following the ceasefire, they “have collected about 20,000 metric tonnes of food inside Gaza”.\n\n“The implementation of the 20-point [ceasefire] plan remains to be the central point and the central condition for us to be able to deliver humanitarian assistance in a holistic manner,” Ramiz Alakbarov, UN deputy special coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory, said.\n\nHe called on Israel to allow more NGOs to participate in the delivery of aid in Gaza, which Israel has banned.\n\n“The persisting issue of registration of NGOs remains to be a bottleneck issue. We continue to emphasise the essential role of NGOs and national NGOs, which they play in humanitarian operations in Gaza, and we have escalated this now,” he said.\n\nIsrael’s assault has displaced most of Gaza’s more than two million people, many of them several times. The majority have not yet returned to their ravaged neighbourhoods, fearing they could soon be displaced once again or killed by Israeli forces.\n\nSources told Al Jazeera that the Israeli army carried out home demolitions east of the Tuffah and Shujayea neighbourhoods in eastern Gaza City on Thursday.\n\nIsrael has been demolishing homes since the start of its renewed ground incursion in the area earlier this month, part of what residents describe as a systematic campaign to clear large swaths of residential blocks.\n\nEntire streets have been levelled, with bulldozers flattening homes and infrastructure as Israeli forces push deeper into Gaza City’s eastern districts."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067201","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article titled 'Hurricane Melissa updates: 'Storm of the century' makes landfall in Jamaica' discusses a major hurricane making landfall in Jamaica, referred to as the 'Storm of the century.'

Trump sought to suspend the programme upon taking office, prompting a successful legal challenge from immigrant rights groups.\n\nThursday’s cap of 7,500 is only a fraction of the 125,000 refugees allowed to enter under former President Joe Biden during his final year in office. The new, lower cap is set to last from October 2025 through September 2026.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are currently 42.7 million refugees globally.\n\nThe US Refugee Act allows presidents to set a cap on the number of annual refugee admissions, but there is no bottom limit. That has long sparked concerns that Trump, who slashed admissions during his first term, could effectively grind USRAP to a halt.\n\nIn a post on the social media platform X, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noted that Trump’s declaration appeared to shift the definition of whom Washington considers to be a refugee.\n\n“Trump’s new refugee determination appears to call for admitting refugees who wouldn’t meet the definition of refugee — someone who faces persecution (not ‘discrimination’) on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” he wrote.\n\nHe added that, for decades, the US refugee programme has admitted “people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors”.\n\n“Now it will be used as a pathway for White immigration,” he said. “What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”\n\nThe International Refugee Assistance Project, meanwhile, said that Trump did not appear to follow the required congressional consultation process before announcing the cap. The group dismissed the move as baldly political.\n\n“Today’s announcement highlights just how far this administration has gone when it comes to abandoning its responsibilities to displaced people around the world,” the organisation’s president, Sharif Aly, said in a statement.\n\n“America’s refugee program was built to reflect our values, and the thousands of individuals we’ve closed our doors to represent thousands of missed opportunities of people who could have strengthened a local community or economy,” the statement said.\n\nTrump’s declaration did not give a reason for the massive cut in refugee admissions, saying only that the number was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.\n\nThe US president has led a massive crackdown on all forms of immigration since taking office, but some advocates had hoped that the refugee programme — which historically had broad bipartisan support — might be spared.\n\nThe  cross-aisle support  has been buoyed in recent years by the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, with many politicians supporting pathways to immigration for Afghans who worked alongside the US military or allied forces and companies.\n\nMany Afghans have relied on the refugee programme while other specialised immigration programmes remain constricted or backlogged.\n\nSince taking office for a second term, Trump, however, has focused heavily on white Afrikaners. In February, for instance, Trump issued Executive Order 14204 to cut aid to South Africa, on the basis that it demonstrated “shocking disregard” for Afrikaners.\n\nThat order also prioritised humanitarian relief, including refugee admissions, to white South Africans, on the basis that they were “victims of unjust racial discrimination”.\n\nThe first plane carrying white South Africans admitted under the new programme landed in the US in May."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-live-category-5-storm-nears-jamaica-strongest-this-year?update=4067270","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-28","timeOfPublication":"07:34:24+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa updates: ‘Storm of the century’ makes landfall in Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses Hurricane Melissa, referred to as the 'Storm of the Century,' making landfall in Jamaica.

ignorance of Israel’s “genocide” and attacks on Gaza.\n\nAt a joint news conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Ankara on Thursday, Erdogan noted Israel’s access to nuclear and other weapons, saying it was using them to threaten Gaza, and adding that Hamas was not as well equipped.\n\nHe said Israel had once again attacked Gaza in recent days despite a ceasefire in the enclave.\n\n“We need to end the genocide and the deliberate starvation by involving Germany’s Red Cross and our own Turkish Red Crescent,” Erdogan said. “Does Germany not see these?” he said, adding it was Turkiye, Germany and other countries’ humanitarian duty to end the famine and massacres in Gaza.\n\n“Just as we want the Russia-Ukraine war to end, we also support an end to Israel’s war on Gaza,” Erdogan said. “Turkiye and Germany are two key countries that can join hands to achieve this.”\n\nDespite a  fragile US-brokered ceasefire that took effect  on October 10, Israel launched a series of bombardments on Gaza following the killing of an Israeli soldier in southern Gaza’s Rafah on Tuesday. Israel’s retaliatory attacks  killed 104 people , mostly women and children, said Gaza’s Health Ministry.\n\nReporting from Gaza City on Wednesday, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the Israeli attacks this week were similar to previous rounds of bombardments.\n\n“A brief hope for calm turned into despair,” said Mahmoud. “For a lot of people, it’s a stark reminder of the opening weeks of the genocide in terms of the intensity and the scale of destruction that was caused by the massive bombs on Gaza City.”\n\nIsrael said on Wednesday that it had begun “renewed enforcement of the ceasefire”. United States President Donald Trump insisted the ceasefire “is not in jeopardy” despite the latest attacks, while mediator Qatar called Israel’s violations “ disappointing and frustrating “.\n\n“The deal was set up to fail, right?”\n\nFormer UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness spoke to  @Dena  about how the conditions of the ceasefire in Gaza don’t guarantee the access to aid that Palestinians need.  pic.twitter.com/Clzjmzq2tk\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  October 30, 2025\n\nAs part of Trump’s 20-point plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza, an international force is meant to form to monitor the agreement, but the accord does not specify which countries would provide the troops. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters on Monday that Israel opposes any troops from Turkiye joining that force because of Erdogan’s past comments on Israel.\n\n“Countries that want or are ready to send armed forces should be at least fair to Israel,” Saar said. He did not elaborate.\n\nIsrael’s war on Gaza  has killed at least 68,527 people and wounded 170,395 since it began in October 2023.

2025-10-30T21:20:02+00:00\n\nTitle: UN officials condemn ‘horrifying’ mass killings in Sudan as RSF advances\n\nUnited Nations officials have condemned mass killings by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan’s el-Fasher and warned the UN Security Council that the city has “descended into an even darker hell”.\n\nThe RSF took over  el-Fasher , capital of North Darfur state, on Sunday after forcing Sudan’s army to withdraw from its last stronghold in the western Darfur region.\n\n“The situation is simply horrifying,” Martha Ama Akyaa Pobee, assistant secretary-general of the United Nations for Africa, told a Security Council emergency session on Thursday.\n\nShe said that the UN Human Rights Office has received credible reports of mass killings, summary executions and house-to-house searches as civilians attempted to flee.\n\n“The situation is chaotic. In this context, it is difficult to estimate the number of civilians killed. Despite commitments to protect civilians, the reality is that no one is safe in el-Fasher,” she said. “There is no safe passage for civilians to leave the city.”\n\nResidents in the city were being subjected to “horrors” the United Nations’ humanitarian chief said.\n\nThe city was “already the scene of catastrophic levels of human suffering, [but] has descended into an even darker hell,” Tom Fletcher told the UN Security Council.\n\nThere were “credible reports of widespread executions after Rapid Support Forces fighters entered the city”, Fletcher said.\n\n“We cannot hear the screams, but – as we sit here today – the horror is continuing. Women and girls are being raped, people [are] being mutilated and killed with utter impunity.”\n\nFor 18 months before Sudan’s army withdrew from the city, an RSF siege had trapped hundreds of thousands of people inside without food or essentials.\n\nMore than 36,000 people have fled since Saturday, largely on foot, to Tawila, a town around 70km (43 miles) west that is already sheltering roughly 650,000 displaced people.\n\n“There was a lot of shelling,” Fatima Abdulrahman, a woman displaced from el-Fasher, told Al Jazeera from Tawila. “I myself have been affected by shells. Shelling killed my daughter, injured my other daughter’s eye and paralysed my son. My body is full of wounds and is swollen.”\n\nThe fall of el-Fasher to the RSF could herald another split of Sudan, more than a decade after South Sudan’s creation. The latest war started in April 2023, when tension between the military and RSF exploded into fighting in the capital, Khartoum. The ensuing conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 12 million.\n\n“What is happening in the city of el-Fasher is not an isolated incident,” Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed, Sudan’s ambassador to the UN, told the Security Council. “Rather, it is a continuation of a systematic pattern of killing and ethnic cleansing that this militia has carried out since its rebellion in April 2023.”\n\nMore than 300 Colombians have been fighting in Sudan’s war. Why are they there?  pic.twitter.com/iKSryvNG2V\n\n— AJ+ (@ajplus)  October 30, 2025\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan, reporting from Khartoum, said thousands of people are continuing to flee el-Fasher. More than 652,000 people are internally displaced due to the conflict, according to the International Organization for Migration.\n\n“Shelling and drone attacks were happening all the time,” Aisha Ismael, a woman displaced from el-Fasher, told Al Jazeera from Tawila. “They hit us with the backs of their rifles day and night unless we hid in the houses.”\n\nAid workers in Tawila fear conditions in the region will deteriorate as more internally displaced persons arrive from el-Fasher and food and medical supplies continue to dwindle.\n\n“The conditions are catastrophic, as we’ve been hearing,” Mary Brace, technical protection advisor for Nonviolent Peaceforce, told Al Jazeera. “The conflict is ongoing, and there is no guarantee of safe passage for civilians as they try to come towards Tawila.”\n\nAid workers’ immediate concerns are providing those fleeing el-Fasher with food, water and emergency medical attention.\n\n“The last months have been absolutely harrowing,” Brace told Al Jazeera. “People were talking about just the extreme fear of constant bombardment. The numbers of displaced people here, it’s just absolutely astounding. There’s just extreme levels of trauma.”\n\nIn a grim speech to the UN Security Council, Al-Harith Mohamed called the events unfolding in el-Fasher a “genocide by all legal standards and definitions”.\n\n“Women and girls are attacked in broad daylight,” he said, adding that Sudan is wondering “Where is the Security Council?”\n\nThe Sudanese ambassador called on the UN to condemn the RSF’s actions and designate the group as a “terrorist” organisation, demand the paramilitary group leave el-Fasher, enforce a year-old arms embargo related to the conflict, and sanction any outside forces supporting the RSF.\n\nLast year , the UN called on countries to stop supplying weapons to parties in the conflict in Sudan. A Security Council committee previously  also sanctioned  two generals from the RSF for destabilising the country through violence and human rights abuses."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1345","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:29:52+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,345","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Russia-Ukraine war, now entering its 1,345th day, continues as a major global conflict, with Russia and Ukraine engaged in sustained military operations.

Education  has finalised new rules that could bar nonprofits deemed to have undertaken work with a “substantial illegal purpose” from a special student loan forgiveness programme.\n\nThose rules, finalised on Thursday, appear to single out certain organisations that do work in areas that President Donald Trump politically opposes, including immigration advocacy and transgender rights.\n\nUnder the new rules, set to take effect in July 2026, the education secretary has the power to exclude groups if they engage in activities like the “chemical castration” of children, using a politically charged term for gender-affirming healthcare, including puberty-delaying medication.\n\nIt also allows the education secretary to bar groups accused of supporting undocumented immigration or “terrorist” organisations.\n\nThe Trump administration has said its decisions “will not be made based on the political views or policy preferences of the organization”.\n\nBut advocates fear the move is the administration’s latest effort to target left-leaning and liberal organisations.\n\nTrump has already  threatened  to crack down on several liberal nonprofits, which the White House has broadly accused of being part of “domestic terror networks”.\n\nThursday’s rules concern the Public Service Loan Forgiveness programme, created by an act of Congress in 2007.\n\nIn an effort to direct more graduates into public service jobs, the programme promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments.\n\nWorkers in the public sector, including teachers, medical professionals, firefighters, social service professionals and lawyers, are among those who can benefit.\n\nIn a statement, the Trump administration defended the updated rules, calling them a necessary bulwark to protect taxpayer funds.\n\nThe programme “was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service – not to subsidize organizations that violate the law, whether by harboring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex”, said Education Undersecretary Nicholas Kent.\n\nCritics, however, have denounced the administration for using false claims of “terrorism” or criminal behaviour to silence opposing views and restrict civil liberties.\n\nMichael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, said the new rules weaponised loan forgiveness.\n\nLukens explained that many of the lawyers, social workers and paralegals who work at his organisation handle cases to stop deportations and other immigration litigation.\n\nThey count on public service loan forgiveness to take jobs that pay significantly less than the private sector, he said.\n\n“All of a sudden, that’s going away,” Lukens told The Associated Press news agency. “The younger generation, I hope, will be able to wait this out for the next couple of years to see if it gets better, but if it doesn’t, we’re going to see a lot of people leave the field to go and work in a for-profit space.”\n\nOrganisations have raised concerns over the education secretary’s broad power to determine if a group should be barred. Short of a legal finding, the secretary can decide based on a “preponderance of the evidence” whether an employer is in violation.\n\nThe National Council of Nonprofits was among the associations criticising the change.\n\nIt said the rules would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules “based on their own priorities or ideology”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/widespread-uncertainty-as-us-food-aid-set-to-lapse-amid-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:50:25+00:00","title":"Widespread uncertainty as US food aid set to lapse amid government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown continues, federal food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is set to lapse on November 1, a rare and highly controversial action by the Trump administration.

people in the United States who rely on nutrition assistance programmes are facing uncertainty, as food aid is set to lapse on Saturday amid the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a state of emergency on Thursday, joining other  state and municipal officials  who tapped local funds to help fill the void.\n\n“I’m declaring a State of Emergency to use every tool we have to help the three million New Yorkers losing food assistance because of the GOP shutdown,” Hochul said in a social media post.\n\nRhode Island, Virginia and New Mexico have also announced emergency declarations in recent days to address the crisis.\n\nWhile federal services often face complications or interruptions during government shutdowns, the Trump administration’s decision to completely suspend  food benefits  starting on November 1 is unusual.\n\nNever before has the federal government frozen funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), sometimes referred to as food stamps.\n\nDemocrats have accused the White House of politicising food aid to pressure politicians to fall in line with Trump’s priorities.\n\nTwenty-five Democrat-led states have sued to ensure SNAP continues to receive funding, and on Thursday, a hearing was held in a federal court in Massachusetts.\n\n“With the suspension of SNAP benefits, the nutritional needs of millions of school-aged children in Plaintiff States will not be met,” the plaintiffs wrote in a filing.\n\nThey also argued that grocers and other merchants who work with food assistance programmes would be adversely affected.\n\nUS District Judge Indira Talwani indicated that she planned to issue a decision later that day.\n\nTalwani also said that the government should find an “equitable way of reducing benefits” as an alternative instead of ending them entirely.\n\nAbout 42 million people — or one out of every eight people in the US — rely on federal nutrition assistance, which constitutes a key part of US  anti-poverty efforts .\n\nSNAP costs nearly $8bn a month for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to operate, and previously, the department had drawn from its contingency funds to keep food assistance flowing.\n\nBut this time, the Trump administration has argued that it is not able to access those funds as part of the government shutdown, which has pitted Democrats against Republicans.\n\nThe two sides reached an impasse over whether to negotiate for greater healthcare access and failed to pass a budget bill by the September 30 deadline.\n\nThe USDA then announced it was severing SNAP funds on October 26, blaming Democrats for failing to fund the government.\n\n“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the USDA wrote in a statement on its website. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.”\n\nThat announcement left state and municipal officials scrambling to find ways to assist residents who could otherwise struggle to access food. Nonprofit food pantries and other services are also bracing for an uptick in demand.\n\nCivil society groups have expressed particular alarm at the possible impact that benefit cuts could have on vulnerable groups, such as children and the poor.\n\n“As this government shutdown continues, the US bishops are deeply alarmed that essential programs that support the common good, such as SNAP, may be interrupted,” the US Conference of Catholic Bishops said in a statement.\n\n“This would be catastrophic for families and individuals who rely on SNAP to put food on the table and places the burdens of this shutdown most heavily on the poor and vulnerable of our nation, who are the least able to move forward.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/spinning-genocide-how-israel-is-using-us-pr-firms-to-frame-its-gaza-war","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:26:48+00:00","title":"Spinning genocide: How is Israel using US PR firms to frame its Gaza war?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has hired multiple public relations firms — including Show Faith by Works, Bridges Partners, and Clock Tower X — through the European Havas Media Group to shape public perception of its war in Gaza among US Christian right and Evangelical audiences.

war on Gaza.\n\nIsrael is acutely conscious of the need to control how its war, in which it has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, is  perceived  by its allies and sponsors in the  US .\n\nA study of Israel’s online activity published by the Al Jazeera Centre for Studies in May found a coordinated social media campaign to sway international sympathies in its favour throughout the conflict, which began in October 2023.\n\nBut while Israel was able to garner favourable coverage from traditional US media outlets in the early months of the war, it was losing the battle on social media, where videos revealing the mass killing and devastation in Gaza were going viral, and generating sympathy for the Palestinians.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recognised this, referring to social media as a “weapon” in Israel’s campaign to shore up support in the US – and saying that the purchase of TikTok by a consortium led by pro-Israel billionaires was a “most important purchase”.\n\nI had the honor of asking Bibi Netanyahu about Charlie Kirk’s assassination & the potential loss of evangelical support for the state of Israel.  pic.twitter.com/XP2faZQa0N\n\n— Debra Lea (@thedebralea)  September 26, 2025\n\nEach of the PR companies contracted through Havas promises a fresh approach in that campaign, targeting key demographics, religious groups and even the way the war is discussed online.\n\nAccording to its  FARA filing , Show Faith by Works has been hired by Israel to run a $3.2m outreach and digital targeting campaign to foster “positive associations with the Nation of Israel” in churches in the US and portray “the Palestinian population” as “extremist”.\n\nIn documents enclosed in the FARA filing, Show Faith by Works also promises Israel that it will conduct “the largest Geofencing and Christian Targeting campaign in US history”.\n\nGeofencing targets and tracks the communication devices of users when they come into proximity of a specific location or area – in this case, Christian universities or churches identified by the PR company.\n\nThe company is also planning what it calls a mobile “10/7 Experience” – referring to the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel – which could be taken to Christian colleges, churches, and events.\n\nAccording to the filings, the experience would include a “VR headset, set pieces, full-length TVs for interactive experience” of the attack, during which  1,139 people  were killed and about 250 taken captive.\n\nThe company details that it can also offer the participation of “Christian Celebrity Spokespeople” such as actors Chris Pratt and Jon Voight – the latter an outspoken supporter of US President Donald Trump.\n\nClock Tower claims in its  FARA filing  that it has been engaged to connect with the Gen Z age demographic through social media platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram and to engage with artificial intelligence (AI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok. The activities officially aim to “combat anti-Semitism” – a term often deployed by the Israeli government to counter criticism of its genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nIn its filing, Clock Tower promises to use AI modelling to ensure that the Israeli-supervised campaign – and by extension narratives – are prominent online during the course of its war on Gaza.\n\n“If you can create enough online noise, through either social media or highly ranked websites, you’re able to influence AI’s large language models [like ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok],” said Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor of media analytics and an expert in disinformation at Northwestern University Qatar.\n\n“LLMs [large language models] are trained on a set amount of data, where they scrape large amounts of [historical] information. However, many models such as Grok, ChatGPT or Gemini use what they call retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where they also pull contemporary data from websites and social media,” Jones said.\n\n“What companies like Clock Tower X are promising is that, if they can flood the information space with sites and content sympathetic to Israel – what’s called RAG poisoning –  there’ll be enough there to at least muddy the waters around what others see as a clear-cut genocide.”\n\nClock Tower, headed by former Donald Trump aide Brad Parscale, also says that much of this content will be integrated with that of right-wing Christian network Salem Media, which in  April  announced a strategic partnership with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.\n\nThe campaign promised by Bridges Partners has already become the source of an online meme – but not in the way the company or Israel would have been hoping.\n\nBridges Partners’ campaign  involves an unnamed cohort of between 14 and 18 influencers who would be paid to post in support of Israel. After breaking down the figures included by Bridges Partners in their invoices to Havas, Responsible Statecraft – the Quincy Institute’s online magazine – found that the influencers were likely being paid around $7,000 per post.\n\nThe number has been quickly seized upon by detractors of Israel, who regularly post the amount underneath posts they suspect of being part of the pro-Israel campaign, indicating that they believe the poster has been “bought” by Israel.\n\nResponsible Statecraft  reported  earlier this month that the anonymity of the US influencers, who under the terms of their agreements would post paid pro-Israel content since July, could potentially be illegal if their identities remain undisclosed.\n\nAt present, the Bridges Partners filing names only one registered foreign agent: consultant Uri Steinberg, who holds a 50 percent stake in the company.\n\nIt is too early to say whether the campaign will ultimately be successful. But the backlash towards the arrangement once it became public illustrates just how difficult the task will be for Israel to change perceptions that have now become deeply ingrained, particularly among younger people.\n\n“No matter what artificial data is produced, it still won’t be enough to counter the volume of factual reporting of the war on Gaza,” Jones said.\n\n“However, there might be enough to promote a sense of ambiguity over it, to present both sides as more equal in the conflict, or to present Israel’s response to the attack of October 7 as more reasonable than some now think it is.”\n\nAl Jazeera has been unable to contact Bridges Partners, Clock Tower X, or Show Faith by Works for comment.\n\nInquiries to the Israeli chief of staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Eran Shayovich, and to Havas Media Group have also gone unanswered.\n\nIn part two of this investigation, to be published on Friday, Al Jazeera will be looking at why Israel is so focused on changing perceptions of it in the United States."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5589849","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"10:30:00Z","title":"New Influenza Strain Detected: Public Health Authorities Issue Advisory","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new strain of influenza, designated as Strain X12, has been detected and is spreading across multiple regions.

Here's what that means across the country \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:22 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The federal government shutdown has dragged into another week, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to ending it. Many  federal workers have missed paychecks , including  air traffic controllers , who are working unpaid.  The impacts of the shutdown could soon get worse. That's because a number of federal programs are set to run out of money on Nov. 1. If that happens,  tens of millions of people  would lose  federal food and nutrition benefits  like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. Also set to  run out of funding  are some Head Start programs, early-learning centers for low-income families, that serve more than 65,000 children nationwide.  Read more about how food banks are bracing for SNAP funding to lapse The  Agriculture Department says  it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to  help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid . At the same time  many American farmers  say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink. As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down? A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.  Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could  see big premium increases  unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended. Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here. Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? Of those at risk of  losing food and nutrition aid  if the shutdown continues into November, 7 million receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC.) Nearly 42 million who rely on SNAP are also expected to lose their benefits. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the  program will run out of money Nov. 1 .  In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits \"until further notice\" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift  money from its contingency fund and other places  to keep SNAP at least partially funded. As NPR's Stephen Fowler reports, a coalition of more than two dozen Democratic state leaders  are suing the Trump administration over its decision  to suspend federal food benefits during the government shutdown. A federal court decision in that case  may come as soon as Thursday . WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration  shifted $300 million in tariff revenue  to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's  calling for an additional $300 million  to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some  states  could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources. —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR Read more on the impact of this potential lapse across the country, here.  — and you can  read more here about how food banks are bracing for it   What about Head Start? Beginning Nov. 1,  more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start , the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down. Among the states  hit hardest  by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio. Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support. Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out. Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences. —  Cory Turner  and  Kadin Mills , NPR What the shutdown means for federal workers Altogether,  about 1.4 million civilian federal employees  across the country are going without pay,  according to the Bipartisan Policy Center , a think tank in Washington, D.C. Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over. The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but   the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. The Senate has  failed to advance a pair of competing measures  to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.  The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security. Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court ;  the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday  indefinitely halted  the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units. How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?  The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members , according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, but it only covered one pay cycle. Many are expecting their next paycheck at the end of this month. Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler , NPR National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines. According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\" Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week. —  Geoff Brumfiel , NPR In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting  more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada  could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open. Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts  have halted  those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue. But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week,  the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year , or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\"  Noem posted on X  last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid,  according to Noem ; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. —  Ximena Bustillo , NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. This week they officially missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began.  Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages  disrupt flights across the country . Air traffic controllers  helped to end the last government shutdown , and could help end this one as well. According to NPR's Joel Rose, the Transportation Department says  there has been an uptick in the number of controllers  who are calling in sick. The Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18,  reports Alaska Public Media's Eric Stone . The department previously said it had enough funding to continue the program through Sunday. Read more on  what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown, here   The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region. Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country: Alaska The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [ Alaska Public Media ] About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states.

The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh,  according to state data . [ LAist ] The shutdown of the federal government  has brought  the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites  across California:  Muir Woods is fully closed . Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they  didn't learn the plan  until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down.  Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors . [ KQED ] Colorado Sites and lands in Colorado  operated by the National Park Service are open , but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website.

Is it the weekends? I have friends that have really bad habits of when they're bored on the train, they start buying things.\"\n\nUnderstanding these instincts, enables us to put in steps to prevent them.\n\n\"You can be better equipped to make an alternative decision and go, 'Do you know what? I can just take a deep breath and not purchase something.'\"\n\nAnniki says when she was younger, she often felt scared to check her bank balance and avoided dealing with money as much as possible.\n\nThis kind of behaviour is often linked to our education, says Claer Barrett, consumer editor at the Financial Times.\n\n\"How we felt about maths in school, maybe that burning feeling of shame of not knowing the answer or putting your hand up to answer a question and getting it wrong, that can often make us feel like, I can't do maths. So therefore, I can't do money.\"\n\n\"We should be really pushing on that door and trying to understand more about our financial situation.\"\n\nAbigail says the only way to do this is to force yourself to tackle it head on, setting aside a set amount of time each week to look at your bank account and all your outgoings.\n\n\"It's a minimum of an hour a week.\n\n\"Just go through your finances and kind of be hit with it. It sounds a lot, but it can be really calming for your nervous system.\"\n\nDoing this will often throw up outgoings that you've forgotten, such as a subscription for a gym you haven't been to in six months or a random app you've forgotten you've subscribed to, she says.\n\nOften the terms associated with money can be offputting.\n\nClaer says don't let words like investing, scare you, instead take time to learn about them.\n\n\"Whether we're talking about stocks and shares, or investing in a pension. We need to give ourselves every advantage financially,\" she says.\n\n\"So being shy or feeling shameful, not asking these interrogating questions is the worst thing we can do.\"\n\nShe suggests making a list of things you are unsure about, whether that's consolidating pensions or asking for a pay rise at work, and slowly working through them.\n\nDon't be too hard on yourself if you're just starting.\n\n\"We're all a work in progress. I've got my financial to do list at the back of my diary. There are some things that have been on it for more than a year.\n\n\"That's just life, but as long as I can try and do something every week towards making my financial situation a better place, that's moving forward.\"\n\nMany of us are already too stretched keeping up with the costs of everday living to even think about saving.\n\nBut for those who can afford to, Abigail suggests setting up a  \"freedom fund\" to give you options when life gets difficult.\n\nShe recommends setting up an easy access account only in your name and not joint, and to put a portion of your income away every month.\n\nUnlike an emergency fund pot for things like unexpected car and house repairs, a freedom fund is money designed to \"make you happier.\"\n\n\"So when a job no longer serves you, you can think 'I've got some money sat away so I can go and look for something else.'\n\n\"Or if you want to leave a partner, that freedom fund can give you the ability to walk out.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/us-justice-department-places-prosecutors-on-leave-for-january-6-reference","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"21:35:49+00:00","title":"US Justice Department places prosecutors on leave for January 6 reference","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department has placed federal prosecutors Samuel White and Carlos Valdivia on administrative leave after they described January 6 Capitol rioters as 'a mob of rioters', a language the Trump administration views as politically biased.

2025-10-30T21:35:49+00:00\n\nTitle: US Justice Department places prosecutors on leave for January 6 reference\n\nThe United States Department of Justice has reportedly placed two federal prosecutors, Samuel White and Carlos Valdivia, on administrative leave after they referred to the participants  in the attack on the Capitol  on January 6, 2021, as “a mob of rioters”.\n\nDocuments the two prosecutors had filed in advance of a Thursday sentencing hearing were also amended to remove references to the January 6 attack.\n\nThe new filings were made on Wednesday, the same day that the prosecutors received their notices and were locked out of their government devices.\n\nBoth were members of the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, according to sources who spoke to Reuters and The Associated Press, on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe punishment they faced was the latest instance of the administration of President Donald Trump taking action against federal prosecutors who participated in cases the Republican leader perceives as unfavourable.\n\nTrump has long defended the participants in the January 6 attack, going so far as  to pardon more than 1,500 rioters  who had pending criminal charges or convictions during the first day of his second term.\n\nAnother 14 rioters had their sentences commuted. In a presidential statement, Trump called the prosecutions a “grave national injustice”.\n\nThe attack on the Capitol was prompted by Trump’s false claims that his defeat in the 2020 presidential election had been “rigged”. Spurred by the misinformation, thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on the day that lawmakers inside were certifying the Electoral College votes.\n\nMore than 100 police officers were hurt, and multiple deaths were attributed to the attack, including a  protester  who was shot while trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby and  a police officer  who collapsed and suffered multiple strokes, potentially due to the stress of being assaulted.\n\nSome officers were beaten with flag poles, fire extinguishers and hockey sticks.\n\nThe Justice Department has yet to comment on Wednesday’s suspensions of the two prosecutors.\n\nThe lawyers were previously scheduled to appear on Thursday in federal court for the sentencing of Taylor Taranto, a Navy veteran who was among those pardoned by Trump for participating  in the January 6 attack .\n\nDuring that clash, he was observed attempting to breach the Speaker’s Chamber, a restricted area. Taranto had been charged with four misdemeanours for those actions before Trump pardoned his charges.\n\nIn May, Taranto was convicted on unrelated charges, including illegally carrying two firearms, the unlawful possession of ammunition, and spreading false information and hoaxes.\n\nTaranto had been arrested on June 29, 2023, near an address in Washington, DC, supposedly linked to former President Barack Obama, one of Trump’s political rivals.\n\nTrump had posted the address on social media, and Taranto proceeded to drive to the area, livestreaming his progress, in an attempt to seek out “tunnels” to enter the residence.\n\nUpon exiting his vehicle and entering a restricted area, he was confronted by Secret Service agents. He allegedly told them, “Gotta get the shot, stop at nothing to get the shot.”\n\nThere were reportedly more than 500 rounds of ammunition in his van.\n\nA day earlier, Taranto had also recorded a “hoax” video claiming that a car bomb was headed to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nTaranto’s defence lawyers have described him as a “journalist” and “comedian”. But prosecutors have sought a sentence of more than two years in prison for Taranto.\n\nThat sentencing recommendation was kept in the revised documents submitted on Wednesday.\n\nAt Thursday’s hearing, US District Judge Carl Nichols praised the suspended prosecutors, White and Valdivia, saying they did a “commendable and excellent job” and displayed the “highest standards of professionalism” in the case.\n\nNichols ultimately sentenced Taranto to 21 months in prison. Since Taranto has already been in custody for 22 months, he will not serve any additional time.\n\nCareer prosecutors are assigned to criminal cases regardless of the presidential administration in power.\n\nBut the Trump White House has repeatedly sought to sideline, if not fire, those who prosecuted cases that run contrary to the Republican president’s interests.\n\nIn January, for instance, nearly two dozen employees of the US Attorney’s Office in Washington, DC, were fired, many with links to the January 6 prosecutions carried out under former President Joe Biden.\n\nAnd in June, another three prosecutors involved in the January 6 cases were reportedly fired."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/thousands-of-ultra-orthodox-rally-in-jerusalem-against-military-service","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:08:21+00:00","title":"Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jews rally in Jerusalem against military service","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, tens of thousands of Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jews protested in Jerusalem against mandatory military service, with one teenager dying during the demonstration.

You cannot fight against Judaism in a Jewish country; it does not work.”\n\nThe debate over military service — and who is exempt — has long caused tensions in Israeli society and become a political headache for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his country’s two-year war on Gaza.\n\nUnder a ruling established at the time of Israel’s creation in 1948, when the ultra-Orthodox were a very small community, men who devote themselves full-time to the study of sacred Jewish texts are given a de facto pass.\n\nUltra-Orthodox Jews make up 14 percent of Israel’s Jewish population, or about 1.3 million people, and roughly 66,000 men of military age currently benefit from the exemption.\n\nFrustration at the exemption has grown amid Israel’s wars on Gaza, Lebanon and Iran since 2023, as the Israeli military death toll reached the highest number for decades.\n\nLast year, Israel’s Supreme Court  ruled unanimously  that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men for service.\n\nIn its ruling, the court said that in the absence of a law that distinguishes between Jewish seminary students and other draftees, Israel’s compulsory military service system applies to ultra-Orthodox men like any other citizen.\n\nThat ruling has had a destabilising effect on Netanyahu’s coalition government.  In July , Israel’s ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism (UTJ), announced it was quitting the country’s fractious right-wing coalition, leaving Netanyahu with a razor-thin majority in the Knesset.\n\nParliament has been struggling to draft a new conscription bill, which has so far failed to meet both the ultra-Orthodox demands and those of a stretched military.\n\nIsrael is scheduled to hold elections by late October 2026, with at least 11 new political parties already registered and Netanyahu’s opposition once again searching for a way to unseat him."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/radio-free-asia-says-halting-news-operations-due-to-trump-admin-cuts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"03:11:00+00:00","title":"Radio Free Asia says halting news operations due to Trump admin cuts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Radio Free Asia (RFA) has suspended all news operations on Friday due to severe financial strain caused by funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration, specifically following the executive order that eliminated the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which previously provided congressional grants to RFA.

government-funded news outlet’s dire financial situation caused by funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration and the ongoing US government shutdown.\n\nBay Fang, RFA’s president and CEO, said in a statement that “uncertainty about our budgetary future” means that the outlet has been “forced to suspend all remaining news content production”.\n\n“In an effort to conserve limited resources on hand and preserve the possibility of restarting operations should consistent funding become available, RFA is taking further steps to responsibly shrink its already reduced footprint,” she said on Wednesday.\n\nFang added that RFA would begin closing its overseas bureaus and would formally lay off and pay severance to furloughed staff. She said many staff members have been on unpaid leave since March, “when the US Agency for Global Media [USAGM] unlawfully terminated RFA’s Congressionally appropriated grant”.\n\nOn March 14, Trump signed an executive order effectively eliminating USAGM, an independent US government agency created in the mid-1990s to broadcast news and information to regions with poor press freedom records.\n\nAlongside RFA, USAGM also hosts sister publications Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE) and Voice of America (VOA).\n\nFollowing March’s executive order, RFA was forced to put three-quarters of its US-based employees on unpaid leave and terminate most of its overseas contractors.\n\nAnother round of mass layoffs followed in May, along with the termination of several RFA language services, including Tibetan, Burmese and Uighur.\n\nMass layoffs also took place at VOA in March when Trump  signed another executive order  placing nearly all 1,400 staff at the outlet – which he described as a “total left-wing disaster” – on paid leave. It has operated on a limited basis since then.\n\nTrump has said operations like RFA, RFE/Radio Liberty and VOA are a waste of government resources and accused them of being biased against his administration.\n\nSince its founding in 1996, RFA has reported on Asia’s most repressive regimes, providing English- and local-language online and broadcast services to citizens of authoritarian governments across the region.\n\nIts flagship projects include its Uighur service – the world’s only independent Uyghur-language outlet, covering the repressed ethnic group in western China – as well as its North Korea service, which reports on events inside the hermit state.\n\nAn announcement penned by RFA executive editor Rosa Hwang, published on the outlet’s website on Wednesday, said, “Make no mistake, authoritarian regimes are already celebrating RFA’s potential demise.”\n\n“Independent journalism is at the core of RFA.

presidential trips abroad have traditionally been an opportunity to display the power of the American nation on the world stage. Donald Trump's five-day swing through eastern Asia, on the other hand, has been a display of the power of Trump - but also, at times, of that power's limitations.\n\nTrump's stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea over the course of the first four days were an exercise in pleasing a sometimes mercurial American president. It was an acknowledgement that Trump, with the flick of a pen, could impose tariffs and other measures that have the potential to devastate the economies of export-dependent nations.\n\nHis sit-down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, however, was something entirely different.\n\nIt was a meeting of equals on the global stage, where the stakes for both nations – for their economies, for their international prestige, for the welfare of their people - were enormous.\n\nWith China, Trump may flick his pen, but such actions come with consequences. They come with a cost.\n\nFor the first four days, Trump's most recent foray into global diplomacy was smooth sailing.\n\nEach stop was punctuated by a blend of traditional trade negotiations – deals made under the shadow of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs – and personal accommodations that at times bordered on the obsequious.\n\nIn Malaysia, Trump secured access to critical minerals and made progress toward finalising trade arrangements with south-east Asian nations. He also presided over a treaty that should ease border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia – the kind of \"peace deal\" the American president loves to tout.\n\nIn Japan, Trump's Marine One flew past a Tokyo Tower lit red, white and blue – with a top in Trumpian gold.\n\nNewly elected Prime Minister Sanai Takaichi detailed $550bn in Japanese investments in the US and offered the American president a gift of 250 cherry trees for America's 250th birthday, and a golf club and bag that belonged to Shinzo Abe, the assassinated former prime minister who bonded with Trump in his first term.\n\nShe also became the latest foreign leader to nominate Trump for his much-desired Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nNot to be outdone, South Korea welcomed Trump with artillery firing a 21-gun salute and a military band that played Hail to the Chief and YMCA – the Village People song that has become a Trump rally anthem.\n\nPresident Lee Jae Myung held an \"honour ceremony\" for Trump during which he gave the American leader his nation's highest medal and a replica of an ancient Korean dynastic crown.\n\nLunch with Lee featured a \"Peacemaker's Dessert\" of gold-encrusted brownies. Later that day, the Koreans served Trump vineyard wine at an intimate dinner in Trump's honour with six world leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference summit.\n\nIn the US, Trump may be the subject of \"No Kings\" demonstrations by Americans who disapprove of his boundary-testing expansions of presidential power, but during his East Asia swing he was treated like royalty.\n\nAnd like the kings of old, Trump arrived in Korea seeking tribute – in the form of $200bn in cash payments, $20bn a year, from South Korea to the US, to be invested at the direction of Trump's government. Agreement on the terms of those payments helped ensure that the tariff rate on South Korean exports to the US would drop from 25% to 15%.\n\nThe main event of Trump's Asia trip came in its final hours, however, as he met with Xi.\n\nThere, the power dynamic between leaders of the world's two largest economies was decidedly different than the interactions Trump had with his foreign counterparts in previous days.\n\nMissing were all the pomp and the pageantry. No military bands, no honour guards, no carefully crafted menus celebrating mutual national affection. Instead, the two leaders and their top aides sat across a long white negotiating table in a nondescript military building just off the runway of Busan's international airport.\n\nIt was perhaps a reflection of the high stakes that when Trump shook hands with Xi in Busan, he appeared tense. It was a far cry from his relaxed attitude when he told me the day before that he was optimistic he would have a good meeting.\n\n\"I know a little bit about what's going on because we have been talking to them,\" he said. \"I'm not just walking into a meeting cold.\"\n\nFor months, Trump had been threatening higher tariffs on Chinese exports to the US – as a source of revenue for the American treasury as well as to pressure China to open its markets and control the export of chemicals used to make the drug fentanyl.\n\nChina, unlike many of America's other trading partners, responded with escalation, not concessions.\n\nIf tariffs were a source of economic hardship for China, then Beijing would target America's vulnerabilities. It suspended purchase of US agricultural products and proposed export controls on its large supply of critical minerals - resources that the US, and much of the world, rely on for high-tech manufacturing.\n\nTrump's mood was upbeat after the meeting, which he described as \"amazing\" and graded a 12 on a scale of 1-10. The president appeared in a good mood even as the plane jostled from rough turbulence as it climbed into the sky.\n\nBut it was a battle of wills and economic pain set the two nations on a path that ultimately led to Thursday's meeting and an agreement on both sides to de-escalate.\n\nThe US lowered its tariffs, while China eased access to critical minerals, and pledged to resume importing US agricultural products and increase purchases of US oil and gas.\n\nWhile it may not have been a breakthrough, it was an acknowledgement by both sides that the existing situation was unsustainable.\n\nThe international order that will take its place, however, is far from clear. As Xi acknowledged in his opening remarks at the bilateral meeting, China and the US \"do not always see eye to eye with each other\".\n\n\"It is normal for the two leading economies in the world to have frictions now and then,\" he said.\n\nThat may represent an improved outlook after months of tension, but it was also an sign that \"frictions\" are here to stay.\n\nChina has global and regional ambitions and a growing willingness to expand its influence.\n\nTrump, for his part, has attempted to reorder American priorities abroad, using US economic might to pressure allies and adversaries alike. And it is those American allies – nations like Japan and South Korea that have long relied on American political, economic and military support -  that are scrambling to adjust to the new reality.\n\nSome of that scrambling comes in the form of  a bend-backward willingness to accommodate Trump in forms large and small. Gifts and dinnertime honours are easy, but multibillion dollar payments, increased military spending and permanent tariffs take a toll.\n\nAnd they could ultimately prompt a reevaluation of relations with America – and, as a result, with China.\n\nTrump may have received a king's welcome in South Korea, but, in what could be viewed as a bit of on-point symbolism, as he departed, it was Xi who was arriving.

Caribbean are reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Melissa as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qp75z3dw4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:21:33.508+00:00","title":"Buckingham Palace statement on Prince Andrew in full","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Buckingham Palace has formally stripped Prince Andrew of his royal title and duties, renaming him Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and ordering him to vacate his residence at Royal Lodge in Windsor.

campaign push: Why him, why now?\n\nNew York City -  \"Focus, focus, focus on affordability\".\n\nIt is a simple message, but one that Robert Wood, a 47-year-old writer and a lead volunteer for mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, believes is the key to turning out voters in the final stretch of New York City's closely watched race.\n\nMamdani's surprise victory in the  June Democratic primary  - and his commanding lead in the polls ahead of the November 4 election day - has achieved a symbolism that has resonated far beyond the borders of the city's five boroughs.\n\nTo many, it has represented a rebuke to the wealthy donor-dominated Democratic establishment: A path forward for liberal politics lost in the woods in the age of US President Donald Trump.\n\nBut for a movement that has reverberated across the country - and indeed the globe - to fully actualise, Mamdani supporters know he must actually make it into City Hall. That begins and ends with door-knocking: lots and lots of door-knocking.\n\nIn a row of townhouses in the neighbourhood of Crown Heights, an area that split between Mamdani and top opponent  Andrew Cuomo  in the primaries, a door opened to reveal Nadia on a windswept October day. She said she's already all in for Mamdani.\n\n\"Regardless of what the polls say, we need to make sure our friends and families get out and vote,\" Wood urged, noting a resounding mandate would help to energise Mamdani's  ambitious plans : rent freezes on stabilised apartments, free buses, and universal childcare, paid for by increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthiest New Yorkers.\n\nExecution will require hard-fought buy-in from state lawmakers and the governor.\n\nAt a nearby, pre-war rent-stabilised apartment building, another man said he was unsure. Wood pointed to Mamdani's vow to freeze rents in buildings like his, which make up about a quarter of the city's housing stock.\n\nThe man is gracious, but unwilling to make a final decision: \"Thank you, I'm still deciding\".\n\nDown the street, climbing a steep concrete stoop, Wood met Onika Saul, a 45-year-old property manager. In Mamdani's pledges, she worried, \"realism is kind of skewed\".\n\n\"Anyone can say anything, but action always speaks louder than words,\" she said.\n\n\"So I think for me personally, being disappointed so many times by so many politicians and so many promises, I want to see more action than words.\"\n\nBut Wood dug in. He detailed Mamdani's activism as a state assemblyman, which included joining a taxi worker hunger strike; he had been arrested in front of US Senator Chuck Schumer's home during a protest against US funding for the war in Gaza; Mamdani, he noted, has relied on small donations, unlike the sums provided by billionaire business and real estate leaders who have fuelled Cuomo's campaign.\n\nHe also pointed to an issue that has been one of the most decisive in the race: Mamdani, he noted, has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights, a rarity in mainstream US politics.\n\n\"Zohran is certainly the only politician in the race who will call what's happening [in Gaza], what it is: a genocide,\" Wood said.\n\nSaul agreed: \"It is a genocide\".\n\nBy the end, Saul still had her reservations. After all, Mamdani's top pledges —rent freezes and universal childcare for children under five — would not directly apply to her. But she said she's willing to give his vision a shot—and her vote.\n\n\"I feel better about him,\" she said. \"But it’s still the whole seeing is believing thing.\"\n\nMamdani has been trying to bridge that chasm in belief in the final stretch of the election contest. Polls have tightened, with opponent Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York State,  making explicit appeals  to conservatives and independents to back him or face the degradation of the city as they know it.\n\nCuomo, who left office in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations, has  derided  Mamdani as an out-of-touch ideologue promising the impossible. The attacks have included increasingly caustic messaging, leaning into Islamophobic and xenophobic tropes: Mamdani would be the first Muslim, first person born in Africa (Uganda), and the first person of South Asian descent to lead the city.\n\nFor Mamdani, the challenge has been seeing through a mission statement he elucidated after his come-from-behind win in primary elections in June. The 34-year-old state assemblyman was expected to have his mayoral ambitions dashed against the realities of the city's notoriously hard-nosed electoral politics.\n\nInstead, his victory was resounding. He took 56.4 percent of the primary vote when adjusted for the ranked-choice system, compared to Cuomo's 43.6 percent. Cuomo soon after re-entered the race as an independent.\n\n\"We wanted to rebuild a coalition that had frayed over years of disappointment and neglect, to win people back to a Democratic Party that puts working people first,\" Mamdani said after the win, in one of the ubiquitous direct-to-camera social media videos he has used to appeal to a chronically online generation of voters.\n\nHe pointed to areas in New York City that swung towards US President Donald Trump in 2024, only to support him in the primary. It was evidence, he said, that a combination of  progressive policies  and a clear message on affordability could rally the disaffected.\n\n\"The headline is clear: we can win back voters many have written off if we give them something to vote for, not just tell them what to be against,\" he said.\n\nIn the months since, Mamdani has more fully embraced his role as a progressive standard-bearer, twice holding rallies with stalwart US Senator Bernie Sanders, whose surprise surge in the 2016 presidential election offered to many a glimpse of a different political path.\n\nBut the real test is yet to come. Unlike the closed Democratic primary, the general election is open to all, including the approximately 20 percent of the 4.7 million registered voters unaffiliated with a party, as well as the 11 percent registered Republicans. The variables are vast, and electoral math is subject to unseen shifts.\n\nEarly voting, which began on October 25, has already seen record turnouts, particularly in older demographics that favour Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.\n\n\"Please, please, do not underestimate our opponents,\" Sanders said at a rally kicking off the final sprint of the race.\n\nIt is a question that has hung in the air since June: Why is Mamdani the man for this political moment?\n\nAt a bohemian beer garden in Astoria, Queens, where the New York City Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) held a watch party during the first of two general election debates, Susan Kang attempted to unpack the query.\n\nOf course, Mamdani's success comes in the wake of a punishing 2024 election season for Democrats, who lost the US presidency, the House and the Senate to Republicans.\n\nThat exposed \"the weaknesses of a conventional Democratic message\", particularly on economic issues and affordability, explained Kang, an associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan who is also affiliated with the DSA.\n\nCuomo, to many young voters who buoyed Mamdani's success, is emblematic of the same tired Democratic Party of old.\n\nThen there is the continued knock-on of the so-called \"Bernie Sanders effect\", which helped bring Democratic Socialist policies to the fore. While Democratic Socialism is a distinct, if amorphous, ideology, the term \"socialist\" has for decades been a political slur in the post-Cold War US.\n\nBut for Kang, the strength that has carried Mamdani is more personal in provenance.\n\nWhile Cuomo's approach says, \"I'm gonna whip this city into shape\", Kang said, Mamdani shows a warmth and familiarity with the tapestry of personalities that make up the wildly diverse metropolis. One of his most popular videos highlighted common issues facing halal workers. Others have featured deli workers, subway commuters and cab drivers.\n\n\"I think Zohran has really shown that he loves New York City,\" Kang said.  \"He wants to make this a city that works for everybody.\"\n\nIn a second-floor office in South Richmond Hill, Queens, Sherry Padilla believes Mamdani is uniquely positioned to rally immigrant working-class communities who feel left behind by establishment politics.\n\nMamdani's ground game in the run-up to the primary relied heavily not just on the DSA's sprawling volunteer infrastructure, but also on community groups like DRUM Beats, a political committee affiliated with the Queens-headquartered Desis Rising Up and Resisting.\n\nHe has been leveraging that same support as the general election approaches,  continuing to tour mosques , Hindu and Jewish temples, and Christian churches across the five boroughs.\n\nHosting a phone-banking event for DRUM Beats, Padilla said she is hoping to convince voters to see in Mamdani what she sees. Her outreach specifically targets the South Richmond Hill area, home to a large Guyanese and South Asian population.\n\n\"We've had politicians who come into our community, say two or three words in our language and eat one of our favourite foods, and then it's like, 'OK, see you next election season,'\" Padilla said.\n\n\"Zohran's constantly been in our communities and has been by our working class, our Black or brown residents and supported our struggles and fought with us,\" she said. \"That's something that we've never seen before in a politician.\"\n\nIn New York City, nearly 40 percent of the population is foreign-born. Working-class immigrants have had a front-row seat to yawning inequality in the city, which is home to more billionaires than any other city in the world.\n\nStudies have shown that inequality has become more entrenched since the COVID-19 pandemic ended in 2021. Prices have risen, but only the wealthiest have seen their incomes significantly increase.\n\nA recent report by the Fiscal Policy Institute found one percent of the city's population currently receives 44 percent of the city's income. The share is nearly four times higher than 30 years ago.\n\nAt a pro-Mamdani rally in Midtown, Manhattan, Salim Drammeh, who leads Africans for Zohran, said the overlap of Mamdani's identity and the policies he spearheads has the potential to invigorate dormant voting blocks.\n\n\"In my district, there is a lot of food insecurity, there's a huge need for childcare,\" he said. \"So when Zohran speaks about affordability, it speaks straight to our communities.\"\n\n\"At the same time, voter turnout in the community is really low,\" he said, noting he helped organise a roundtable with West African imams in the community and Mamdani. \"So I've really been working to increase those numbers\".\n\nAt the same time, the vitriol that Mamdani has received, particularly related to his religion, race and immigration history, has crescendoed in the final days of the race.\n\nIn the final week of campaigning, two House Republicans, Randy Fine and Andy Ogles, have continued to push the US Department of Justice to investigate Mamdani's immigration status and potentially strip his citizenship.\n\nBut Latifa Emery, a 44-year-old from the Morrisania neighbourhood of the Bronx, said those attacks could backfire, instead energising communities long accustomed to being demonised.\n\n\"If he wins, a lot of people will start to realise that we aren't what everybody says we are,\" said Emery, who is Muslim. \"We're not terrorists, we're not bad people. It's time for people to see that\".\n\nIn the nearby Tremont neighbourhood, Masoud Eleshin, a 78-year-old originally from Ghana, took issue with Cuomo's attempts to connect Mamdani to anti-LGBTQ policies in the country where he was born, Uganda.\n\nThat has included attacking Mamdani for taking a photo with Rebecca Kadaga, a proponent of anti-gay laws. Mamdani has flatly condemned Kadaga's position, saying he was not aware of her views at the time the photo was taken.\n\n\"That shouldn't be happening,\" Eleshin said. \"I've been in this country for 40 years; you can't blame me for where I'm from\".\n\nBack on the canvassing grind in Crown Heights, both the pitfalls and potential of reaching new voters were on full display.\n\nThe event was just a slice of the campaign's efforts. Wood's canvassing group included at least 50 participants. All told, the campaign has said about 90,000 volunteers have taken part across the city throughout the election season.\n\nAt one townhouse, a man answered the door and quickly became irate.\n\n\"You're wasting your time in this neighbourhood,\" the man said. \"[Mamdani] is an antisemite, he wants me dead\".\n\nWood attempted to calm the situation, seeking to dispel a claim pushed by both Cuomo and Sliwa. A  range of Jewish New Yorkers  have backed Mamdani, who has repeatedly vowed to be a Mayor for all city residents.\n\nOne of two major ultra-orthodox Satmar sects in the city has also recently rejected claims that Mamdani is antisemitic as \"false and dangerous\".\n\nBut unable to bring the temperature down, Wood moved on.\n\nIn a nearby apartment building, 70-year-old Hedrina James said she had not been following the race, her attention instead consumed wth the daily demands of life.\n\nBut after a quick talk with Wood, she was swiftly taken by two of Mamdani's top pledges: A rent freeze, which would theoretically apply to her apartment, and universal childcare.\n\n“I’ve learned a lot,\" she told Al Jazeera. \"This would benefit so many of us.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62elnjnqqxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"23:10:01.706+00:00","title":"Is this finally rock bottom for Mr Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, formerly the Duke of York, has been stripped of all royal titles and privileges, reverting to the name Mr. Mountbatten Windsor.

2025-10-30T23:10:01.706+00:00\n\nTitle: Is this finally rock bottom for Mr Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?\n\nAfter weeks, months, years and even decades of scandals, all the titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed.\n\nThere are no modern precedents for such a colossal loss of royal status.\n\nUnlike the previous statement on his future, this was from Buckingham Palace rather than Andrew himself.\n\nIt's a ripping off the bandage moment, which the Palace will hope will finally draw a line under the endless oil slick of bad news stories about Andrew.\n\nThe sliver of dignity given to him, that he was voluntarily choosing not to use his titles, has been taken away.\n\nTitles such as Duke of York, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh will be forcibly removed.\n\nAll that remains is his place in the line of succession, and new guidance from the House of Commons Library has shown that too could be removed by Parliament, if Commonwealth realms give their consent.\n\nAfter more than a year of pressure, the so-called Siege of Royal Lodge is over, with Andrew losing his independent lease and moving to the King's estate in Sandringham. It's not revealed where exactly, but it's not Wood Farm.\n\nSandringham is privately owned by the King, ending any reliance on a Crown Estate property.\n\nHis ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is said to be making her own separate arrangements, not currently expected to be with Andrew in Norfolk.\n\nIt makes Andrew dependent on the King for his home and his money. And also it has to be said, a duty of care for his brother's welfare.\n\nThis announcement might head off the immediate threat of Parliament taking matters into its own hands and voting to strip Andrew of his titles. MPs had become increasingly vocal about debating the scandal and the Public Accounts Committee had been flexing its muscles over protecting public funding.\n\nBut it's going to be much harder for the Palace to settle an authentic feeling of public outrage. The sense of unchecked privilege surrounding Andrew has genuinely irritated the public and it will take more than taking away his titles to dispel the sense of ugly entitlement.\n\nPolling by YouGov published on Thursday showed Andrew now has the worst ever popularity ratings for a royal, with 91% holding a negative view of him.\n\nAnd the King heard that unhappiness first hand from a heckler in Lichfield this week, who shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\"\n\nFor the Palace, there will be questions about why such longstanding problems around Andrew weren't dealt with before now. So much of this has been known for so many years, the unsuitable business links, the unexplained funding, the connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The cast list changes - alleged Chinese spies or dictators' wealthy relatives - but the story has remained the same.\n\nThe unsavoury link with Epstein was being widely discussed 14 years ago when Andrew was stripped of his role as trade representative.\n\nAndrew has been losing jobs but continuing to live in a royal style for many years now and it's stretched public patience. It felt arrogant and out of touch.\n\nA few clicks on Google will find decades of stories raising doubts about his suitability, often accompanied by pictures of Andrew in a top hat, like a renegade Monopoly piece.\n\nThere might be some public fatigue around this Andrew story, people might feel they've heard enough and are sick of it. But there was also an angry public mood that expected a clearer sense of accountability.\n\nWhat remains to be seen now is whether a wider can of worms has been opened.\n\nWho knew what and when at the Palace about Andrew and Epstein? Do we need more transparency around royal property and finance? How many houses do they have up their sleeve in Windsor? And what fresh scandals about Andrew could still emerge?\n\nBut this scorched earth approach to Andrew's future might also show an unexpectedly steely side to the King.\n\nWhile other members of the Royal Family were part of the decision, including Prince William, it's understood that it was the King who made this big call on his brother's future. Whatever the grandstanding of pundits, it can't have been an easy decision.\n\nThere seemed to have been an irrevocable change of attitude when  an email from Andrew to Epstein emerged,  showing their continued contact. It seemed to destroy Andrew's promises in the Newsnight interview to have cut ties.\n\nIt no longer seemed tenable that Andrew should have the honour of being a prince and living in some splendour among the royals in Windsor.\n\nInstead the King highlighted the victims of abuse, whose stories lie at the dark heart of Epstein's circle.\n\nIt's not long since Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was grinning on the Buckingham Palace balcony, waving to the crowds. He'll wake up tomorrow morning for the first time in his life as Mr Mountbatten Windsor, private citizen."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9dr45g49yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"02:40:47.641+00:00","title":"Barcelona's Sagrada Familia basilica becomes world's tallest church","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Sagrada Família in Barcelona has officially become the tallest church in the world, surpassing the Ulm Minster in Germany, which held the title since 1890.

Pornhub says UK visitors down 77% since age checks came in\n\nPornhub says the number of UK visitors to its website is down 77% compared with July, when more rigorous age checks for sexually explicit

however, data from Google shows searches for the site have decreased by almost half since the law came into effect.\n\nThis could be a consequence of people reducing their porn use but could also be partly explained by people visiting the site through alternative means such as a VPN, which masks a user's location.\n\nPornhub is the most visited porn site in the world - and the 19th most visited on the entire web,  according to data from Similarweb .\n\nUnder the OSA, anyone accessing such websites in the UK now has to prove they are over 18 with age checks such as facial identification.\n\nThe firm's claim is the latest indication that people in the UK are changing how they use the internet since the Online Safety Act came into effect.\n\nAccording to Ofcom, visits to pornography sites in general in the UK have reduced by almost a third in the three months since 25 July.\n\nThe regulator said the new law was fulfilling its primary purpose of stopping children from being able to \"easily stumble across porn without searching for it\".\n\n\"Our new rules end the era of an age-blind internet, when many sites and apps have undertaken no meaningful checks to see if children were using their services,\" the watchdog said.\n\nOfcom told the BBC it believed the number of people using VPNs for general use reached 1.5 million daily in July, after the law came in, but

2025.\n\n\"It is likely that people not wanting to verify their age or identity to access sexual content, for example because of privacy concerns, are using VPNs to get around this,\" Dr Hanne Stegeman from the University of Exeter told the BBC.\n\n\"As the location of website visitors are usually determined through IP addresses, it could be that those figures are inaccurate when a portion of visitors are using VPNs.\"\n\nAnd Cybernews information security researcher Aras Nazarovas told the BBC people in the UK \"can and do\" use VPNs.\n\n\"After age checks kicked in, VPN apps jumped to the top of the UK App Store, and at least one provider saw a 1,800% surge in downloads,\" he said.\n\n\"So part of Pornhub's 'missing' UK audience hasn't vanished - it's being reclassified as non‑UK traffic.\"\n\nBut he said he believed \"the rest\" was indeed \"users shifting to sites that don't require age checks\".\n\nAlex Kekesi, an executive at Pornhub's parent company Aylo, told the BBC the new rules were unenforceable.\n\nShe said Ofcom faced an \"insurmountable task\" trying to get an estimated 240,000 adult platforms - visited by eight million users per month in the UK - to follow the rules.\n\nThis compares with the regulator taking action against fewer than 70 sites for non-compliance.\n\nOfcom says it prioritises sites to be investigated based on how risky they are and their number of users.\n\nAnd Ms Kekesi claimed some pornographic sites have benefited from flouting the rules. The BBC has not independently verified this.\n\n\"There are a number of sites whose traffic has grown exponentially, and these are sites that are not complying,\" she said.\n\nMs Kekesi also has concerns about the content on some of these sites.\n\nShe told the BBC of one which seemed to encourage users to search for content featuring girls below the age of consent.\n\nAylo says it has shared details of this and other sites with Ofcom.\n\nThe regulator has defended the way it enforces the new rules, saying increasing traffic to sites can be one factor that triggers an investigation.\n\n\"Sites that don't comply and put children at risk can expect to face enforcement action,\" it told BBC News.\n\nOfcom's data shows that the top 10 most popular sites all have age assurance deployed. These sites represent a quarter of all visits to adult sites from across the UK.\n\nIt adds that over three quarters of daily traffic to the top 100 most popular sites are going to sites that have age assurance.\n\nThe government has also defended the regulator, and said protecting children online was a \"top priority\" for ministers.\n\n\"Where evidence shows further intervention is needed to protect children, we will not hesitate to act,\" it added in a statement.\n\nMs Kekesi spoke to the BBC while in the UK for a meeting with Ofcom and government officials, where she has been making Pornhub's case that age checks should be done at device level, rather than by individual websites.\n\nShe said the UK stands out in having persuaded the platform to introduce age checks.\n\nA number of jurisdictions have sought to compel Pornhub to check its users' ages, but the response of the site has been to block users rather than comply.\n\nMs Kekesi said the UK was different because it allowed sites to offer a range of different solutions, meaning that Pornhub could use methods - such as email-based checks - which didn't require collecting biometric data.\n\nShe denied that the threat of hefty fines for non-compliance had been the primary motive for complying, pointing to the contrast with France - its second biggest market - where it had cut off access rather than agreeing to what regulators demanded.\n\nIan Corby of the Age Verification Providers Association rejected calls for a switch to device-based verification.\n\nBut he added the group shared a desire for a \"level playing field\" meaning age checks should be \"robust, not superficial or fake\".\n\nChelsea Jarvie, a cybersecurity company founder who has been researching methods of age assurance for a PhD at Strathclyde University, told the BBC both approaches to age checks would be needed - with neither age verification on platforms nor devices being a \"silver bullet\".\n\n\"For somebody to truly be safe online we need different layers of controls throughout their browsing journey,\" she said.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

Many say their lives remain in a limbo - effectively homeless and without a steady source of income.\n\nAnxieties grew further in July when the state's then Chief Secretary Prashant Singh announced that all relief camps would be shut down by December and its residents would be resettled.\n\nHe added that those unable to return to their homes would be relocated to pre-fabricated housing units.\n\nThe government, however, did not clarify where these units would be - whether near the relief camps or near displaced people's original homes  - worsening their concerns about future.\n\nUncertainty grew in September when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his first visit to Manipur since the violence began, announced that 7,000 new homes would be built to resettle the displaced in \"appropriate locations\" without giving any other details.\n\nOn the ground, Manipur remains sharply divided: the Meiteis inhabit the Imphal Valley, while the Kukis live in the surrounding hill districts; and security forces continue to patrol the buffer zones that separate the two communities.\n\nA security official deployed in the area told BBC Hindi that his mandate was to \"ensure that Meiteis and Kukis remain in their respective areas and do not mix\".\n\nExperts say resettling people in their original neighbourhoods is crucial to prevent the violence from redrawing Manipur's social map.\n\n\"This is not good for a secular, democratic India. Resettling them in their original homes is most critical,\" said RK Nimai Singh, former secretary to the Manipur governor.\n\nHe added that many displaced people feared that if they left the relief camps and moved into temporary housing, they might never be able to return to their homes.\n\nIt's a thought that haunts Hatnu Haokip. For her, home means only one place - Imphal valley - and she yearns to go back.\n\n\"But that can't happen because our village is now surrounded by Meitei people,\" said the 22-year-old who is now living in a relief camp in the hilly Churachandpur region\n\nMs Haokip added that she would feel safer if Kuki leaders were given autonomy to set up a  separate federally-administered territory for the community.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by several other Kukis, who also feel apprehensive of returning to their homes.\n\nOn the other hand, most Meiteis BBC Hindi spoke to said they wanted to go back home.\n\nIrom Abung, who once ran a water supply business in Churachandpur, now lives in a relief camp near a buffer zone.\n\nHis house was damaged during the violence, but Mr Abung says he will never give up on the place he once called home.\n\n\"My land remains. I will never sell it because I know I will return one day,\" he said. \"Efforts must be made to bridge the gap between our two communities so people can go back to their lives.\"\n\nThe unease, coupled with uncertainty over where the new homes will be built, has raised doubts over whether the government would be able to close all relief camps by December.\n\nGovernment officials, however, insist that the resettlement plan is on track.\n\n\"From about 290 camps initially, we've brought the number down to around 260,\" a senior Manipur government official said.\n\n\"Eventually, we want to resettle people in the areas from where they fled, once they feel safe to return.\"\n\nThe official added that while they understood people's concerns, it was also in the state's interest for them to return home - otherwise, the divisions would only grow deeper.\n\nAs tens of thousands of people continue to live in relief camps, many complain about not getting the facilities the government promised them.\n\nNemhoichong Lhungdim, a single mother, said her 11-year-old son had suffered a debilitating eye injury a few months back and has lost sight in one eye.\n\nAfter government doctors failed to help, she borrowed money to take him to a private hospital, but was unable to afford the treatment.\n\n\"I was told it would cost about 300,000 rupees ($3,400; £2,600). I don't have that kind of money,\" she said.\n\nMs Lhungdim says the government sometimes organises health camps, but they have never treated her son. BBC Hindi has reached out to officials for a response.\n\nInside the camps, residents say prolonged displacement and uncertainty are also taking a toll on people's mental health.\n\nSalam Monika, 25, says her uncle took his own life last year after being driven to despair by a lack of livelihood opportunities. She says the family could not access medical help.\n\n\"Some mental health workers visited our camp a few times since 2023, but this year, they haven't come at all,\" she said.\n\nBBC Hindi has reached out to the government for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, those moved from camps into temporary housing say that while they now have a roof over their heads, they still struggle to make ends meet as livelihood remains a concern.\n\nChingakham Radha, one of the newly resettled residents, said she learned to make crochet dolls while living in the camp and now earns a small income from selling them. \"The money is very little, just enough to get by,\" she said.\n\nBefore the conflict, Ms Radha was a homemaker and her husband worked as a labourer. They were not wealthy, but had a happy life.\n\nThinking about those days, Ms Radha says life has become uncertain now.\n\n\"Some days my husband finds work, but other times weeks go by without any work,\" she said. \"I want to return home to Churachandpur, but those hopes are fading with time.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr4qqgdlkjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"22:01:43.279+00:00","title":"Sudan war: Survivors of el-Fasher siege tell the BBC about RSF brutality","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Survivors from the el-Fasher siege in Sudan describe horrific violence by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), including torture, murder, and mass displacement, as they flee to safety in Tawila.

scratched and left with just the clothes he is wearing, Ezzeldin Hassan Musa describes the brutality of Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the wake of the paramilitary group taking control of el-Fasher city in the Darfur region.\n\nHe says its fighters tortured and murdered men trying to flee.\n\nNow in the town of Tawila, lying exhausted on a mat under a gazebo, Ezzeldin is one of several thousand people who have made it to relative safety after escaping what the UN has described as \"horrific\" violence.\n\nOn Wednesday, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\" in el-Fasher and said they would be investigated. A day later a senior UN official said the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects.\n\nAbout an 80km (50-mile) journey from el-Fasher, Tawila is one of several places where those lucky enough to escape the RSF fighters are fleeing to.\n\n\"We left el-Fasher four days ago. The suffering we encountered on the way was unimaginable,\" Ezzeldin says.\n\n\"We were divided into groups and beaten. The scenes were extremely brutal. We saw people murdered in front of us. We saw people being beaten. It was really terrible.\n\n\"I myself was hit on the head, back, and legs. They beat me with sticks. They wanted to execute us completely. But when the opportunity arose, we ran, while others in front were detained.\"\n\nEzzeldin says he joined a group of escapees who took shelter in a building, moving by night and sometimes literally crawling along the ground in an effort to remain hidden.\n\n\"Our belongings were stolen,\" he says. \"Phones, clothes - everything. Literally, even my shoes were stolen. Nothing was left.\n\n\"We went without food for three days while walking in the streets. By God's mercy, we made it through.\"\n\nThose in Tawila told the BBC that men making the journey were particularly likely to be subjected to scrutiny by the RSF, with fighters targeting anyone suspected of being a soldier.\n\nEzzeldin is one of around 5,000 people thought to have arrived in Tawila since the fall of el-Fasher on Sunday.\n\nMany have made the entire journey on foot, travelling for three or four days to flee the violence.\n\nA freelance journalist based in Tawila, working for the BBC, has conducted among the first interviews with some of those who made the journey.\n\nNear to Ezzeldin sits Ahmed Ismail Ibrahim, his body bandaged in several places.\n\nHe says his eye was injured in an artillery strike, and he left the city on Sunday after receiving treatment in hospital.\n\nHe and six other men were stopped by RSF fighters.\n\n\"Four of them - they killed them in front of us. Beat them and killed them,\" he says, adding that he was shot three times.\n\nAhmed describes how the fighters demanded to see the phones of the three who were left alive and went through them, searching their messages.\n\nOne fighter, he says, finally told them: \"OK, get up and go.\" They fled into the scrub.\n\n\"My brothers,\" he adds, \"they didn't leave me behind.\n\n\"We walked for about 10 minutes, then rested for 10 minutes, and we continued until we found peace now.\"\n\nIn the next tent in the clinic run by medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Yusra Ibrahim Mohamed describes making the decision to flee the city after her husband, a soldier with the Sudanese army, was killed.\n\n\"My husband was in the artillery,\" she says. \"He was returning home and was killed during the attacks.\n\n\"We stayed patient. Then the clashes and attacks continued. We managed to escape.\n\n\"We left three days ago,\" she says, \"moving in different directions from the artillery areas. The people guiding us didn't know what was happening.\n\n\"If someone resisted, they were beaten or robbed. They would take everything you had. People could even be executed. I saw dead bodies in the streets.\"\n\nAlfadil Dukhan works in the MSF clinic.\n\nHe and his colleagues have been providing emergency care to those who arrive - among them, he says, are 500 in need of urgent medical treatment.\n\n\"Most of the new arrivals are elders and women or children,\" the medic says.\n\n\"The wounded are suffering, and some of them they already have amputations.\n\n\"So they are really suffering a lot. And we are trying to just give them some support and some medical care.\"\n\nThose arriving this week in Tawila join hundreds of thousands there who fled previous rounds of violence in el-Fasher.\n\nBefore its seizure by the RSF on Sunday, the city had been besieged for 18 months.\n\nThose trapped inside were bombarded by a barrage of deadly artillery and air strikes as the army and the paramilitaries battled for el-Fasher.\n\nAnd they were plunged into a severe hunger crisis by an RSF blockade of supplies and aid.\n\nHundreds of thousands were displaced in April when the RSF seized control of the Zamzam camp close to the city, at the time one of the main sites housing people forced to flee fighting elsewhere.\n\nSome experts have expressed concern at the relatively low numbers arriving at places like Tawila now.\n\n\"This is actually a point of worry for us,\" says Caroline Bouvoir, who works with refugees in neighbouring Chad for the aid agency Solidarités International\n\n\"In the past few days we have about 5,000 people who have arrived, which considering we believe there were about a quarter of a million people still in the city, that is obviously not that many,\" she says.\n\n\"We see the conditions that those who have arrived are in. They are highly malnourished, highly dehydrated, or sick or injured, and they are clearly traumatised with what they have seen either in the city or on the road.\n\n\"We believe that many people are stuck currently in different locations between Tawila and el-Fasher, and unable to move forward - either because of their physical condition or because of the insecurity on the road, where militias are unfortunately attacking people who are trying to find safe haven.\"\n\nFor Ezzeldin the relief of having reached safety is tempered by the fears for those still behind him on the journey.\n\n\"My message is that public roads should be secured for citizens,\" he pleads, \"or humanitarian aid sent to the streets.\n\n\"People are in a critical state - they can't move, speak, or seek help.\n\n\"Aid should reach them, because many are missing and suffering.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ylk9r336zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"23:14:55.630+00:00","title":"What we know about Prince Andrew losing his titles and Royal Lodge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, the King’s younger brother, has been formally stripped of all his royal titles—Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh, and associated honours—by King Charles III, following serious lapses in judgment linked to his past associations with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

about Prince Andrew losing his titles and Royal Lodge\n\nPrince Andrew has been stripped of his \"prince\" title and will leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday.\n\nThe King has \"initiated a formal process\" to remove his titles, it said, and Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\n\nAndrew, 65 - the King's younger brother - has continued to face more questions about his private life in recent months.\n\nHis links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein have caused problems for the Royal Family. The prince, who relinquished his titles earlier this month, has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\"His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew,\" Buckingham Palace  said in a statement  on Thursday evening.\n\n\"Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\"\n\nIt also addressed the place where he lives, Royal Lodge.\n\n\"His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence.\n\n\"Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\n\n\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"\n\nThe language of Buckingham Palace's statement was \"very brutal,\" royal historian Kelly Swaby told the BBC.\n\n\"Ordinary people don't care about the semantics, they want to see punishment, and public opinion is very much against Andrew, the Palace knows that, and the language very much reflect that\".\n\nThe decision was made, and action taken, due to serious lapses in Andrew's judgement, it is understood.\n\nIt is also understood that the wider Royal Family and the government was consulted, and made clear it supports the decision.\n\nThe BBC's former royal correspondent Jennie Bond said she thought the Prince of Wales had pushed for the recent action.\n\n\"I think this line had to be drawn and William was probably pushing for the King to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"William is about to go to Brazil on a very important tour - and the the recent tour by the King and Queen to the Vatican was very nearly overshadowed by what was going on with Andrew, and that could not be allowed to continue.\"\n\nIt is understood Andrew will be relocated to the  Sandringham Estate  in Norfolk, but details about his specific housing have not been released.\n\nThe wider Sandringham estate covers approximately 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) with 600 acres (242 hectares) of gardens - and the Palace has not said which property he will stay in.\n\nIt is understood that Sarah Ferguson, 66, Andrew's ex-wife, will also move out of Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements.\n\nFormal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday and it is understood that Andrew's move to Sandringham will take place \"as soon as practicable\".\n\nIt is understood Andrew's accommodation will be privately funded by the King.\n\nAnd the King will make \"appropriate private provision\" for his brother as he moves out of his home.\n\nRoyal sources have previously said the King has tried to apply pressure, and last year cut off Andrew's funding.\n\nAndrew also cultivated his own independent sources of funding since leaving public life, including business connections with China, the Gulf States and a recently curtailed project with a Dutch start-up company.\n\nEarlier this week, Parliament's spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee wrote a letter detailing the \"considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money\" relating to Andrew.\n\nThe letter asked what the Crown Estate's plan was to ensure value for money in any future agreements with Andrew.\n\nAndrew is understood not to have objected to the King's decision to remove his titles.\n\nHis birth certificate does not need to be changed and the title change will not apply retrospectively.\n\nThe titles being stripped are: Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh. And he will no longer have the right to be called His Royal Highness. The honours of Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Victorian Order will also be removed.\n\nTo remove the titles, the King will send Royal warrants to the Lord Chancellor - who is David Lammy - to officially remove them.\n\nIt comes just weeks after Andrew voluntarily gave up his other royal titles, including the Duke of York.\n\nOn 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the \"continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family\". \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me,\" he said.\n\nPrincess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice will retain their titles, as they are the daughters of the son of a Sovereign. This is in line with King George V's Letters Patent of 1917.\n\nUntil this month, Ferguson kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew was stripped of his Duke of York title.\n\nAndrew still remains eighth in line to the throne.\n\nThe surname Mountbatten Windsor was created in 1960, and combines the surnames of the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip when they married.\n\nIn 1917, fearful of the anti-German sentiment in the UK the reigning monarch, George V, adopted the name Windsor to replace the original Germanic sounding house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty.\n\nHe renamed the lineage Windsor, after the castle.\n\nMountbatten is an anglicised version of Battenberg. The Duke of Edinburgh's mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg, but during the First World War the family opted to change it to Mountbatten, again to avoid more anti-German sentiment.\n\nThe double-barrelled name was a concession to the Duke of Edinburgh, who was said to have complained that his children would not bear his name.\n\nHistorians tell the BBC Andrew will continue to be frozen out of royal public life.\n\nHe is already not invited to attend royal public events., and his recent appearances have been limited to private, family events, such as funerals or memorials.\n\nThis fiasco will continue to dog the royal family, says historian and author Andrew Lownie.\n\n\"They're finally getting ahead of the story, but this isn't the end of it,\" Lownie told the BBC.\n\nThe Palace is \"finally taking some decisive action\" - but it \"won't completely satisfy the public disquiet\".\n\nCampaigners against the monarchy say there should be a wider investigation into what the Royal Family might have known about Prince Andrew's links to Epstein.\n\n\"This isn't just about family. It's not a private matter,\" says Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic.\n\nAndrew's links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are at the centre of this latest announcement.\n\nIn recent weeks, pressure has increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother, with the King heckled earlier this week by a protester.\n\nAlthough Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.\n\nEarlier this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.\n\nIn her posthumous memoir, Nobody's Girl Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions – claims he has always denied."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7m4yjkp74o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"23:20:08.619+00:00","title":"Andrew stripped of 'prince' title and will move out of Royal Lodge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew has been formally stripped of his 'prince' title and will move out of Royal Lodge, now known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, following weeks of public and governmental scrutiny over his alleged connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Andrew is to lose his 'prince' title and leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following weeks of intense scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday night , Buckingham Palace said the King's brother will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.\n\nAndrew gave up his other royal titles earlier this month, including the Duke of York, after facing more questions about his private life.\n\nIn a posthumous memoir published earlier this month, Virginia Giuffre repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew has always denied the claims.\n\nReacting to the latest developments, Ms Giuffre's family said she \"brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage\". Giuffre took her own life earlier this year.\n\nIn its statement, the Palace said the King \"has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew\".\n\nAs well as the title, the Palace said \"formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease\" on Royal Lodge.\n\nHe will be moved into private accommodation in Sandringham Estate, which is understood to be privately funded by King Charles.\n\n\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe Palace also expressed its support for victims of \"any and all forms of abuse\".\n\nAndrew's two adult daughters, Eugenie and Beatrice, will retain their titles as princesses and Andrew is still eighth in line for the throne.\n\nIt is understood that Sarah Ferguson, his ex-wife, will also move out of Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements.\n\nUntil this month, she kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew voluntarily gave up the usage of the Duke of York title.\n\nIt is understood that the government was consulted on the decision to strip Andrew of his prince title, and made clear it supported the decision.\n\nReacting to the news on BBC Question Time, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said it sent a \"very powerful message to the victims of grooming and sex offences\".\n\n\"This is a huge development and a big step for the King to take. I have to say, just, you know, as an initial response, I really support the step that he's taken.\"\n\nThe stripping of Andrew's titles caps off weeks of mounting pressure on the Royal Family.\n\nThe scandal over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was reignited by sexual abuse allegations in Ms Giuffre's memoir.\n\nWhile Andrew has always strenuously denied abusing Ms Giuffre, earlier this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.\n\nDetails about Andrew's living arrangements have also come under the spotlight, with fresh questions being asked in recent days about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.\n\nAndrew has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004, after signing a 75-year lease deal the previous year with his landlord, the Crown Estate, which operates as an independent property company.\n\nThe Grade II-listed Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate boasts a gardener's cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.\n\nLast week, more details emerged about how he could afford his mansion, after the lease agreement was revealed.\n\nThe arrangement means he has only ever paid a token annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate,  a lease document seen by BBC News confirms .\n\nThe deal meant that instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments upfront, including for renovations.\n\nIn effect, those payments - which totalled more than £8m and were detailed in a National Audit Office report - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease, based on paying in advance a notional rent of £260,000 per year.\n\nIn a separate development,  it emerged this week that Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge  as part of his daughter Beatrice's birthday celebrations in 2006 - two months after a US arrest warrant had been issued for Epstein for the sexual assault of a minor. Andrew did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor the Palace, Thursday's announcement is an attempt to draw a line under the scandals surrounding the former Prince Andrew - now simply Andrew Mountbatten Windsor."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40jj71243o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"01:57:24.752+00:00","title":"Trump sets refugee admissions cap for coming year at record low","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has announced a record-low refugee admissions cap of 7,500 for the upcoming year, marking a sharp drop from the previous 125,000 set by President Joe Biden.

low\n\nThe Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.\n\nThe move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.\n\nNo reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was \"justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest\".\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety.\n\nThe previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".\n\nIn February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.\n\nSouth Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".\n\nIn the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".\n\nThe White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.\n\nThe tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.\n\nThe South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.\n\nOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".\n\nThe US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups.\n\nSome have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East.\n\n\"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\"\n\n\"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added.\n\nRefugees International also slammed the move, saying it \"makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values\".\n\n\"Let us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status – they are not fleeing systematic persecution,\" Refugees International said in its statement.\n\nThe South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement.\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".\n\nEarlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances.\n\nWhile the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024.\n\nOf these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy1n438dk4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:33:07.377+00:00","title":"The American adoptees who fear deportation to a country they can't remember","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights how tens of thousands of American adoptees, especially those adopted before 1983, were not granted U.S. citizenship due to outdated adoption policies.

American adoptees who fear deportation to a country they can't remember\n\nShirley Chung was just a year old when she was adopted by a US family in 1966.\n\nBorn in South Korea, her birthfather was a member of the American military, who returned home soon after Shirley was born. Unable to cope, her birth mother placed her in an orphanage in the South Korean capital, Seoul.\n\n\"He abandoned us, is the nicest way I can put it,\" says Shirley, now 61.\n\nAfter around a year, Shirley was adopted by a US couple, who took her back to Texas.\n\nShirley grew up living a life similar to that of many young Americans. She went to school, got her driving licence and worked as a bartender.\n\n\"I moved and breathed and got in trouble like many teenage Americans of the 80s. I'm a child of the 80s,\" Shirley says.\n\nShirley had children, got married and became a piano teacher. Life carried on for decades with no reason to doubt her American identity.\n\nBut then in 2012, her world came crashing down.\n\nShe lost her Social Security card and needed a replacement. But when she went to her local Social Security office, Shirley was told she needed to prove her status in the country. Eventually she found out she did not have US citizenship.\n\n\"I had a little mental breakdown after finding out I wasn't a citizen,\" she says.\n\nShirley is not alone. Estimates of how many American adoptees lack citizenship  range from 18,000 to 75,000 . Some intercountry adoptees may not even know they lack US citizenship.\n\nDozens of adoptees have been deported to their countries of birth in recent years, according to the Adoptee Rights Law Center. A man born in South Korea and adopted as a child by an American family - only to be deported to his country of birth because of a criminal record - took his own life in 2017.\n\nThe reasons why so many US adoptees do not have citizenship are varied. Shirley blames her parents for failing to finalise the correct paperwork when she came to the US. She also blames the school system and the government for not highlighting that she did not have citizenship.\n\n\"I blame all the adults in my life that literally just dropped the ball and said: 'She's here in America now, she's going to be fine.'\"\n\n\"Well, am I? Am I going to be fine?\"\n\nAnother woman, who requested anonymity for fear of attracting the attention of authorities, was adopted by an American couple from Iran in 1973 when she was two years old.\n\nGrowing up in the US Midwest, she encountered some racism but generally had a happy upbringing.\n\n\"I settled into my life, always understanding that I was an American citizen. That's what I was told. I still believe that today,\" she says.\n\nBut that changed when she tried to get a passport at the age of 38 and discovered immigration authorities had lost critical documents that supported her claim to citizenship.\n\nThis has further complicated her feelings surrounding identity.\n\n\"I personally don't categorise myself as an immigrant. I didn't come here as an immigrant with a second language, a different culture, family members, ties to a country that I was born in… my culture was erased,\" she says.\n\n\"You are told that you have these rights as an American - to vote and to participate in democracy, to work, to go to school, to raise your family, to have freedoms - all these things that Americans have.\n\n\"And then all of a sudden they started pushing us into a category of immigrants, simply because they cut us from legislation. We should have all equally had citizenship rights because that was promised through adoption policies.\"\n\nFor decades, intercountry adoptions approved by courts and government agencies did not automatically guarantee US citizenship. Adoptive parents sometimes failed to secure legal status or naturalised citizenship for their children.\n\nThe Child Citizenship Act of 2000 made some headway in rectifying this, granting automatic citizenship to international adoptees. But the law only covered future adoptees or those born after February 1983. Those who arrived before then were not granted citizenship, leaving tens of thousands in limbo.\n\nAdvocates have been pushing for Congress to remove the age cut-off but these bills have failed to make it past the House.\n\nSome, like Debbie Principe, whose two adopted children have special needs, have spent decades trying to secure citizenship for their dependents.\n\nShe adopted two children from an orphanage in Romania in the 1990s after watching them on Shame of a Nation - a documentary about the neglect of children in orphanages following the 1989 Romanian Revolution, that sent shockwaves around the world when it aired.\n\nThe most recent rejection of citizenship came in May, and was followed by a notice stating that if the decision was not appealed in 30 days, she would have to turn in her daughter to Homeland Security, she said.\n\n\"We'll just be lucky if they don't get picked up and deported to another country that isn't even their country of origin,\" Ms Principe said.\n\nThose fears for adoptees and their families have risen even further since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a vow to remove \"promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of federal law\".\n\nLast month, the Trump administration said \"two million illegal aliens have left the United States in less than 250 days, including an estimated 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and more than 400,000 deportations\".\n\nWhile many Americans support deportations of illegal migrants, there has been uproar over some incidents.\n\nIn one case, 238 Venezuelans were deported by the US to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. They were accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang  despite most of them having no criminal records.\n\nLast month, US officials detained 475 people - more than 300 of them South Korean nationals - who they said were working illegally at Hyundai's battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in Georgia.  The workers were taken away in handcuffs and chains to be detained , sparking outrage in their home country.\n\nAdoptee rights groups say they have been flooded with requests for help since Trump's return and some adoptees have gone into hiding.\n\n\"When the election results came in, it started to really cascade with requests for help,\" said Greg Luce, an attorney and founder of the Adoptee Rights Law Center, adding he's had more than 275 requests for help.\n\nThe adoptee who arrived from Iran in the 1970s said she has started avoiding certain areas, like her local Iranian supermarket, and shares an app with her friends so they always have access to her location, in case she is \"swept up\".\n\n\"At the end of the day, they don't care about your back story. They don't care that you're legally here and it's just a paperwork error. I always tell people this one single piece of paper has essentially just ruined my life,\" she said.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned right now, I feel stateless.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite adoptees being left in limbo for decades, Emily Howe, a civil and human rights attorney who has worked with adoptees across the US, believes it is just a case of political will that should unite people from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"It should be a straightforward fix: adopted children should be equal to their biological siblings of parents who were US citizens at the time of birth,\" Ms Howe said.\n\n\"The applicants have two, three, or four US citizen parents, and are now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. We're talking about babies and toddlers who were shipped overseas through no fault of their own and lawfully admitted under US policy,\" she added.\n\n\"These are people who literally were promised that they were going to be Americans when they were two years old.\"\n\nShirley wishes she could get the US president into a room, so she and others like her could explain their stories.\n\n\"I would ask him to please have some compassion. We're not illegal aliens,\" she said.\n\n\"We were put on planes as little itty-bitty babies. Just please hear our story and please follow through with the promise that America gave each one of the babies that got on those planes: American citizenship.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91jyxj88ko","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:19:47.213+00:00","title":"How teenager gave street concert and was caught up in Russia's repressive past","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details how a teenager, Diana Loginova, and her music band Stoptime are being targeted in St Petersburg for organizing peaceful street concerts that feature songs by artists labeled 'foreign agents' such as Noize MC and Monetochka.

2025-10-31T00:19:47.213+00:00\n\nTitle: How teenager gave street concert and was caught up in Russia's repressive past\n\nIn a wood on the edge of St Petersburg they're reading out a list of names.\n\nEach name is a victim of the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's Great Terror.\n\nIn this part of Russia there are thousands of names to be read. Thousands of lives to remember on Russia's annual Remembrance Day for Victims of Political Repression.\n\nBuried in the Levashovo Wasteland are believed to be at least 20,000 people - possibly as many as 45,000 - who were denounced, shot and disposed of in mass graves; individuals, as well as whole families destroyed in the dictator's purge in the 1930s.\n\nNailed to the trunks of pine trees are portraits of the executed. Standing here you can feel the ghosts of Russia's past.\n\nBut what of the present?\n\nToday, Russian authorities speak less about Stalin's crimes against his own people, preferring to portray the dictator as a victorious wartime leader.\n\nWhat's more, in recent years a string of repressive laws has been adopted here to punish dissent and silence criticism of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nKremlin critics might not be denounced as \"enemies of the people\" like under Stalin. But increasingly they are being designated \"foreign agents\".\n\nThe authorities claim the labelling helps to protect Russia from external threats.\n\nMore than three and a half years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities have two main objectives: victory abroad and conformity at home.\n\nAnyone here who publicly challenges, questions or even hints they doubt the official narrative that, in this war Russia is in the right, risks becoming a target.\n\nAt Leninsky District Courthouse, the stairwell outside Courtroom 11 is packed with journalists. There is barely room to move.\n\nI get talking to Irina. Her daughter Diana is on her way here in a police car for a court appearance.\n\n\"This must be frightening for you,\" I say.\n\nIrina nods.\n\n\"I never thought anything like this could happen,\" says Irina softly. \"You can't imagine it. Until it happens to you.\"\n\nMinutes later, 18-year-old Diana Loginova arrives in the building guarded by three police officers. She hugs her mother and is taken into court.\n\nDiana has already spent 13 days in jail for \"organising a mass public gathering of citizens resulting in a violation of public order\".\n\nBut the charges keep coming.\n\nThe \"mass gathering\" was an improvised street concert which the authorities claim obstructed pedestrian access to a Metro station.\n\nDiana Loginova is a music student and, under the name Naoko, lead singer with the band Stoptime.\n\nOn the streets of St Petersburg, Stoptime have been performing songs by exiled Russian artists like Noize MC and Monetochka, singer-songwriters fiercely critical of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nMany of these prominent musicians, now abroad, have been officially designated foreign agents by Russian authorities.\n\nVideos posted online show that Stoptime's street concerts have been attracting quite a crowd, with dozens of mainly young people singing along and dancing to the music.\n\nWhilst it is not forbidden in Russia to sing or play songs by foreign agents, in May a Russian court banned Noize MC's track Swan Lake Cooperative, claiming it contained \"propaganda for the violent change of the constitutional order\".\n\nSwan Lake is seen by many as a symbol of political change in Russia.\n\nIn the USSR, Soviet TV often showed the ballet following the death of Soviet leaders, and it was back on Soviet TV screens in 1991 during the failed coup by communist hardliners. Lake (Ozero in Russian) is also the name of a dacha co-operative widely associated with President Putin's inner circle.\n\nA video clip of Stoptime performing the song went viral recently on social media.\n\nDiana Loginova was detained on 15 October. Police also arrested her boyfriend, guitarist Alexander Orlov, and drummer, Vladislav Leontyev.\n\nThe three band members were sentenced to between 12 and 13 days behind bars.\n\nIn Courtroom 11 Diana is facing an additional charge: discrediting the Russian armed forces. It relates to one of the songs she sang: You're a Soldier by (\"foreign agent\") Monetochka.\n\n\" You're a soldier, \" begins the chorus.\n\n\"And whatever war you are fighting,\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'll be on the other side.\"\n\nAfter a brief hearing the judge finds Diana guilty of discrediting Russia's army and fines her 30,000 roubles (£285).\n\nBut she is not free to go. The police take Diana back to the police station and prepare more charges.\n\nThe next day she and her boyfriend Alexander are brought to Smolninsky District Court. I manage to have a word with them before they enter the courtroom.\n\n\"I'm very pleased, and it's important, that people have been supporting us, that many people are on our side, on the side of truth,\" Diana tells me.\n\n\"I'm surprised by how things have been exaggerated. We've been accused of lots of things we didn't do. All we were doing was bringing the music we like to a mass audience. The power of music is very important. What's happening now proves that.\"\n\n\"I think it's not the words, it's the music that is most important,\" guitarist Alexander Orlov tells me. \"Music says everything for people. It always has.\"\n\nAlexander reveals he proposed to Diana when the police van they were being transported in stopped at a petrol station.\n\n\"I made a ring out of a tissue,\" he tells me. \"I had time to get on my knees, and she said yes.\"\n\n\"We hope we'll be back home soon,\" says Diana. \"That's what we're dreaming of most.\"\n\nThey won't be going home yet. At this latest court hearing the judge sends Diana and Alexander back to jail for another 13 days for more public order offences.\n\nCivil society in Russia is under intense pressure. Yet supporters of Diana Loginova and Stoptime are trying to make their voices heard.\n\n\"I was on the street when Diana was singing and people were singing along so beautifully,\" says Alla outside the courthouse. \"For me it was important to be here to support Diana and show her some people do care. This should not be happening.\"\n\nTo another of Diana's supporters I suggest that, in Russia now, displaying solidarity for anyone accused of discrediting the Russian army requires a degree of courage.\n\n\"It's people like Diana who are the brave ones,\" says Sasha. \"We're cowards. Some people are heroes. Others just follow behind.\"\n\n\"Some people [in Russia] are scared,\" continues Sasha. \"But others here do support the authorities and what's going on. Unfortunately, I know people like this. It came as a blow when I discovered that people I've been friends with for 40 years support what's happening. For years they've been watching Russian TV. I haven't.\"\n\nIn the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Mikhailov expressed his solidarity through music. The street musician performed songs in support of Diana Loginova. He was detained and jailed for 14 days for \"petty hooliganism\".\n\nDespite the crackdown, young street musicians in St Petersburg continue to perform music by artists labelled foreign agents by Russian authorities.\n\nIt's a chilly autumn evening. But passers-by have stopped to listen to a teenage band outside a St Petersburg Metro station. Among the songs they're performing are compositions by \"foreign agents\" Noize MC and Morgenshtern.\n\nSuddenly the police turn up. The concert is over.\n\nI look on as three band members are taken away in a police car.\n\nI go to meet someone else in St Petersburg accused of \"discreditation\".\n\nLudmila Vasilyeva, 84, was born two months before Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nShe survived the Nazi siege of Leningrad (then the name for St Petersburg) and has carried with her all her life how devastating war can be.\n\nSo, when Vladimir Putin ordered a mass invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ludmila was deeply shocked.\n\nEarlier this year, on the third anniversary of Russia's \"special military operation\", Ludmila went on to the street to express her anti-war stance.\n\n\"I wrote on my placard: 'People! Let's stop the war. We bear responsibility for peace on Planet Earth!'\"\n\nFollowing her personal protest Ludmila received a letter from the police instructing her to report to the police station.\n\n\"They told me that I had discredited our soldiers. How? By calling for peace? I let them know that everything I'd wanted to say I'd already made quite clear on my placard and that I wouldn't be going down to the station. They threatened to take me to court. And in the end that's what they did.\"\n\nLudmila was fined 10,000 roubles (£95) for \"discrediting the Russian armed forces\".\n\nShe has no regrets and seemingly, despite the growing repression around her, no fear.\n\n\"Why should I be scared?\" Ludmila asks me. \"Of what and of whom should I be frightened? I'm not scared of anyone. I speak the truth. And they know that.\"\n\nShe believes that increasing authoritarianism stems from those in power fearing the public.\n\n\"People are scared. But [the authorities] are more scared. That's why they're tightening the screws.\"\n\nLudmila Vasilyeva's outspokenness is an exception, not the rule. Today few Russians engage in public protest. I ask Ludmila why that is: is it fear, indifference, or because of support for the authorities?\n\n\"Most people are focused on their own lives, on just surviving,\" Ludmila replies.\n\nBut she claims that when she speaks her mind publicly many people agree with her.\n\n\"When I go to the shops, I always strike up a conversation. No one has ever sneaked on me or put in a complaint about me.\n\n\"Once I was saying something down at the post office. Someone turned to me and said: 'Quiet, keep it down.' I replied: 'Why should I be quiet? What I'm saying, isn't it the truth? Truth must be spoken loudly.'\"\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\n\"When I was standing with my placard and talking to a policeman, a man in his 50s came up to us. He leant forward and said: 'Just strangle her.'\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce863vz6gp0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"01:43:59.460+00:00","title":"Ex-Australian politician sentenced to more than five years for rape","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Australian politician Gareth Ward, who represented Kiama in the New South Wales parliament from 2011, was convicted of raping one man and indecently assaulting another, with the crimes occurring in 2013 and 2015.

Witcher season 4: Can new cast escape shadow of Henry Cavill?\n\nThe latest season of Netflix's The Witcher has landed - with one big difference.\n\nFormer lead actor Henry Cavill has been replaced as main character Geralt of Rivia by Liam Hemsworth.\n\nThe Australian has stepped in for the final two seasons of the fantasy show, based on a popular series of novels and video games.\n\nPreviously, British actor Cavill had portrayed the title character, a monster hunter with supernatural abilities known as the White Wolf.\n\nWhen he announced he was \"passing the torch\" to Hemsworth in October 2022, describing him as a \"fantastic\" actor, not all fans agreed.\n\nSome even threatened to boycott the series without, and Hemsworth has admitted Cavill is a \"daunting\" act to follow.\n\nEarly reviews have been mixed, with US magazine Variety calling season four an \" upgrade \", while the Guardian says Hemsworth is \" as charismatic as a bollard in a wig \".\n\nBBC Newsbeat caught up with professional reviewers to get their thoughts on the latest episodes - and whether the new Geralt is up to the job.\n\nHenry Cavill's love of nerd culture is well-known, and he's been vocal about his love of video games, sci-fi and fantasy.\n\nThere's been no official explanation for his departure from The Witcher, but it's been suggested creative differences played a part.\n\nHe's spoken in interviews about being \"loyal to the source material\" and the importance of keeping Geralt the same as the character in the books.\n\nSince leaving, he's landed a role as a producer and star of Amazon's upcoming  Warhammer 40,000 series  - something he's described as a dream role.\n\nSabrina Barr, TV Editor at Metro, says Henry Cavill was the \"epitome of Geralt\", and admits seeing Hemsworth in the role was \"jarring\" at first.\n\nBut she tells Newsbeat he he does a \"good job\" and is \"brave\" for taking on the character.\n\nIn her  three-and-a-half star review , Sabrina says apprehensive Witcher fans should \"give it a chance\".\n\n\"I've got to give them credit for taking a really difficult situation and deciding to run with their creative vision,\" she says.\n\n\"In my opinion, this season isn't the best of them but I still had a really good time with it. I was gripped by the very different story lines.\"\n\nSabrina tells Newsbeat it's \"extremely rare\" to change the main actor in between seasons but this, in her opinion, is an example of \"how it can work\" if there's no other choice.\n\n\"I personally would have been a lot more upset if they just cancelled the show,\" she says.\n\n\"I have to give them credit for carrying on the story, knowing full well that from the very start there would be people criticising the choice of main actor no matter who it was.\"\n\nDawson Roberts, a content creator who focuses on TV, film and gaming as DawsOnScreen, was invited to the premiere of the new season.\n\nHe agrees the actor swap is \"definitely a bit weird\" but tells Newsbeat the transition is handled well by the show's cast and crew.\n\nIn his view, Liam Hemsworth does a \"pretty good\" job in the main role.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie and say he's better than Henry Cavill,\" says Dawson.\n\n\"But I do think Liam Hemsworth does a really solid job. You get used to it really quickly. He's got the right energy.\n\n\"Losing Henry Cavill is tough but I do think they have built that trust with the audience so now it does work.\"\n\nDawson says the unsung hero of the series is actor Laurence Fishburne, who joins the cast as vampire Regis.\n\n\"People aren't giving enough credit to Laurence Fishburne,\" he says.\n\n\"He's never done a fantasy role before and I think he kills it.\"\n\nAs for Dawson's verdict, he says he's closer to \"the seven or eight out of 10 than the two-star reviews\".\n\n\"It's definitely not the best show ever,\" he says.\n\n\"But it's still really exciting to see the game world brought to life on the screen - even if it is without Henry Cavill.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat  live  at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back  here ."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/science/us-nuclear-weapons-atomic-bombs.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:55:53-04:00","title":"Testing America’s Nuclear Bombs: What to Know","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump’s recent threat to resume nuclear weapons testing has reignited global security concerns, as the United States maintains a nuclear arsenal of about 3,700 warheads with approximately 1,700 deployed.

Here’s what you need to know about American atomic bombs and the issues involved in whether or not to test them explosively.\n\nThe American arsenal includes roughly 3,700 warheads, with about 1,700 of them currently deployed, according to the Federation of American Scientists. The group, which has long scrutinized the highly classified topic, recently updated its estimates. Nuclear weapons can be carried on warplanes like the B-2 or B-52, launched from missiles in silos on U.S. territory, or heaved from rockets on submarines.\n\nThe United States does not have the most nuclear bombs in the world, as Mr. Trump incorrectly stated on Wednesday night. That distinction belongs to the Russian Federation.\n\nWashington is deep into a modernization program that seeks to replace every warhead with an updated version and to upgrade their carriers. The overall cost of the sprawling program over three decades is estimated at $1.7 trillion.\n\nThe same logic that applies to cars — lots of maintenance and testing, even for old models — suggests that the world’s nuclear powers have much confidence that their weapons will work, if needed. The weapons are seen as igniting at the flip of a switch. Currently, the United States spends roughly $25 billion a year on nuclear weapons upkeep, a program it calls stockpile stewardship.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kearney: Why I'm concerned about our declining wildflowers\n\nEver since I was a child I have loved wildflowers. I have fond memories of the woods in Sussex, where I grew up, filling with primroses early in the year and carpeted with bluebells in the spring.\n\nI always used their nicknames - \"eggs and bacon\" for birds-foot-trefoil (a native plant known for its yellow slipper-like petals) and \"bread-and-cheese\" for the young shoots of the British tree hawthorn, which my friends and I would eat. And pretend to like!\n\nWe picked rosehips from hedges too, which we split open to make itching powder, perfect for playground pranks.\n\nBut later in life, on my walks through the countryside, I began to notice dwindling numbers of wildflowers. I missed the grasslands, bursting with colour, that I'd so enjoyed in my childhood.\n\nAccording to the charity Plantlife, approximately 97% of wildflower meadows have been lost across the UK since the 1930s, while species-rich grassland areas, which used to be a common sight, are now among the most threatened habitats.\n\n\"It's definitely a story of severe overall decline, both in the cover of flowers but also the diversity,\" explains Simon Potts, professor of biodiversity and ecosystem services at Reading University.\n\nSo, what will happen if there isn't more intervention to save wildflowers? What will the future look like?\n\n\"Awful, in a word,\" says Prof Potts. \"If we, let's say, take a scenario where we just continue business as usual as we are now, we will still keep losing our wildflowers.\n\n\"And with that, we lose the beneficial biodiversity like the pollinators and the natural enemies of pests.\"\n\nAs a bee lover I am on team pollinator - which is one of the reasons why my husband and I decided to plant our own wildflower meadow. Not just for the beautiful colours but for the vibrancy of the bees, butterflies and moths flying around, which need that habitat.\n\nYet since then, I've come to understand that the loss of wildflowers could bring - and the other perhaps more unexpected consequences too.\n\n\"The consequence will be for farmers,\" argues Prof Potts. \"They will get low yields and poor quality crops, consumers will have to pay higher prices. Our environment will be degraded, eroded, will have less wildlife.\n\n\"Many of them [wildflowers] produce nectar and pollen, which is super important for things like wild bees, hoverflies, and butterflies, that can pollinate crops.\"\n\nProf Daniel Gibbs, food security lead at the University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences, also has concerns about the long-term consequences.\n\n\"Over time, and alongside pressures from climate change and land degradation, this could make our food system more fragile, and negatively impact food security,\" he says - meaning we could, for example, find ourselves with more limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nThere are also studies showing that fields near wildflower-rich margins or meadows produce better-quality fruit and higher yields.\n\n\"Wildflowers can also support some bugs, like spiders and carabid beetles… [which] do an absolutely fantastic job in controlling some of the pests that we get on crops - that can either damage the crop or sometimes lower the quality of the produce,\" adds Prof Potts.\n\nHe describes wildflowers as almost like little factories, pumping out beneficial bits of biodiversity that can help with food production.\n\n\"Farmers may have to rely more on manual pollination,\" Prof Gibbs says. \"Or we may need to look to increasing food imports, both of which can drive up prices.\"\n\nMultiple factors are behind the decline. Sarah Shuttleworth, a botanist with Plantlife, argues that certain intensive farming methods have contributed.\n\nBut some intensive farming methods have also allowed farmers to grow food for the country - and farmers I spoke to pointed out that they face tough financial choices.\n\nThough there have been government subsidies in place for years, meaning farmers are paid by the government to support wildlife on their land, since Brexit the way these grants are paid has changed, with different schemes designed in each of the devolved nations.\n\nIn England, there has been frustration in some quarters about the speed and rollout of the grants and the fact that some schemes have been paused -  such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) , though this is due to reopen, while others extended at the last minute, leaving farmers less able to plan ahead.\n\nSpeaking about the SFI scheme, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson told the BBC: \"We inherited farming schemes which were untargeted and underspent, meaning millions of pounds were not going to farming businesses.\n\n\"We have changed direction to ensure public money is spent effectively, and last year all the government's farming budget was spent.\"\n\nThey also acknowledged that wildflowers are vital, providing food and habitats for pollinators and wildlife, as well as improving biodiversity, and added: \"We are backing farmers with the largest nature-friendly budget in history and under our agri-environment schemes we are funding millions of hectares of wildflower meadows.\"\n\nAs part of its new deal for farmers, Defra said it has committed nearly £250m in farming grants to improve productivity, trial new technologies and drive innovation in the sector.\n\nMark Meadows, Warwickshire chair of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), maintains 6m (20ft) wildflower strips around many of his fields. He feared that without an extension to his current agreement with Defra he'd have to return some wildflower margins to crop production.\n\n\"I'd love [to] be profitable enough [to] say 'Look, we'll leave 5% of our farmland,'… but agricultural costs have gone up a lot,\" he says.\n\nOther farmers share similar tales. David Lord is a third-generation farmer in Essex and member of the Nature Friendly Farming Network.\n\n\"I'm 47 and I've never known farming to be under so much strain,\" he says.\n\nKnowing what funding for nature recovery on farms will be in place in future years is, he says, crucial. \"It takes time and care and cost to maintain [wildflowers]... A lot of farmers aren't going to be minded to just keep these habitats in place without the funding.\"\n\nThere are some glimmers of hope.\n\nProf Potts says there has at least been a slowdown in decline over the last couple of decades - and perhaps a limited recovery for some species.\n\n\"I think [this] reflects some of the agricultural practices that have been a bit more nature-friendly.\"\n\nNature writer, and author of Flora Britannica, Richard Mabey, agrees that the decline in wildflowers is far from universal.\n\nCertain species such as cow parsley, yarrow and knapweed are in fact spreading, and he welcomes an influx of non-native plants and \"garden escapes\", such as snowdrop and buddleia.\n\nEven so, Prof Potts says: \"It is the most precious things that we're losing the most of.\" This includes cornflowers, corncockle and corn marigold - what he terms the iconic British countryside flowers.\n\nAnd the overall decline is why my husband and I decided to create our own wildflower meadow from an overgrown arable field.\n\nThere was a field next to our house, which I had put beehives in, with permission from the owner. I had often thought it would be wonderful to create a wildflower meadow around those hives, so when the opportunity arose to buy the field, we decided to go ahead.\n\nA conservation specialist advised us on where to buy the seed. It was particularly important to get some yellow rattle seed, which helps keep more dominant grasses in check. This in turn gives other wildflowers more opportunity to gain a foothold.\n\nOur first year after sowing was amazing. A patriotic bloom of red, white and blue burst across the field. The red was from poppies which came from the disturbed ground. The white was ox-eye daisies, bladder campion and wild carrot, with spires of bright blue from viper's bugloss.\n\nThe colour has changed over time - the splash of red did not return, but different wildflowers arrived in their place.\n\nThe most spectacular year was last summer. Orchid seeds I'd scattered many years before and almost forgotten about, managed to flower. We counted more than 100 bee orchids — which to a bee lover like me, was the climax of years of work.\n\nIn fairness, I should admit it's years of my husband Chris's work. He found an old-fashioned seed fiddle for us to use — a hand-held device used to scatter the seeds in a controlled way, operated as though drawing a bow across a violin.\n\nHe also cut the hay at the end of summer, initially trying with a scythe - Poldark-style - but ultimately finding a small tractor does the trick in a less backbreaking way.\n\nOf course, many people are not in the fortunate position we found ourselves in, of being able to create a wildflower meadow. And in the UK, you cannot plant wildflowers just anywhere — you would most likely need the landowner's permission.\n\nBut growing numbers of people are trying to create their own patches of wildflowers. Plantlife reports that more and more are joining its No Mow May initiative —  an annual campaign to let wildflowers grow freely, by packing away the lawnmower.\n\nSarah Shuttleworth says just a small spot can make a difference, especially when it comes to pollinators. \"Anyone who has a patch of grass could do their bit… the idea is that you're recreating a meadow-type management scheme, but in a very, very micro scale.\"\n\nThe charity would like to see wildflower habitats being given the same kind of protection as other precious landscapes. Meanwhile Prof Potts thinks, \"We need a bit more of a radical think about how to support farmers to do the right thing.\"\n\nNew housing developments could also prove a way to create wildflower meadows. Under the government's Biodiversity Net Gain scheme, set up under the Environment Act, developers creating building sites are obliged to ensure the same amount of biodiversity at the end of the project, as they had at the start, plus 10%.\n\nBen Taylor manages the Iford Estate, farming land near Lewes in Sussex. For a recording of Open Country on Radio 4, he showed me with great pride around a new wildflower meadow, which was part of a 90-acre site, funded as a pilot by the scheme.\n\n\"We have seen hares here now, which we never had a year or two ago, before we started doing this. So it's really exciting...\"\n\nBut, I wondered, does it make sense to take all of those acres of land out of food production?\n\nMr Taylor says the soil was poor there anyway. \"You have to have nature to be able to grow food,\" he adds. \"Because you need the pollinators as you need the ecosystem, the food chains, the soil webs and everything else to be able to grow food sustainably in the long-term - so I like to think of it as a reservoir of biodiversity.\"\n\nMany ecologists also want us to look beyond the benefits the wildflowers provide for us.\n\n\"Those species are just valuable in their own right, regardless of what they do or what they provide… They've also got their own right to be,\" argues Dr Kelly Hemmings, associate professor in ecology at the Royal Agricultural University.\n\nRichard Mabey stresses a similar point. \"They are important, in my view, for ethical reasons, simply because they exist.\n\n\"Beyond that they are the infrastructure of all other life on the Earth, the fundamental base of the food chain.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

2025-10-30T20:45:26.515+00:00\n\nTitle: Does Trump's nuclear testing raise the stakes - or are we already in an arms race?\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced the US will start testing nuclear weapons in what could be a radical shift in his nation's policy.\n\n\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, as he was about to meet the Chinese president  on Thursday.\n\n\"That process will begin immediately.\"\n\nThe world's nuclear-armed states - those acknowledged as belonging to the so-called nuclear club and those whose status is more ambiguous - regularly test their nuclear weapons' delivery systems, such as a missile that would carry a nuclear warhead.\n\nOnly North Korea has actually tested a nuclear weapon since the 1990s - and it has not done so since 2017.\n\nThe White House has not issued any clarifications to the commander-in-chief's announcement. So it remains unclear whether Trump means testing nuclear delivery systems or the destructive weapons themselves. In comments after his post, he said nuclear test sites would be determined later.\n\nMany of the six policy experts who spoke to the BBC said that testing nuclear weapons could raise the stakes in an already dangerous moment where all signs showed the world was heading in the direction of a nuclear arms race - even though it has not yet begun.\n\nOne of the six did not agree that Trump's comments would have a major impact - and another did not think the US was provoking a race - but all said the world faced a rising nuclear threat.\n\n\"The concern here is that, because nuclear armed states have not conducted these nuclear tests in decades - setting North Korea aside - this could create a domino effect,\" said Jamie Kwong, fellow in the nuclear policy programme at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"We're at a very concerning moment where the US, Russia and China are potentially entering this moment that could very well become an arms race.\"\n\nDarya Dolzikova, Senior Research Fellow for Proliferation and Nuclear Policy at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) - a London-based defence and security think tank - said she did not believe Trump's comments would change the situation massively.\n\nBut, she added, \"there are other dynamics globally that have raised the risks of nuclear exchange and further proliferation of nuclear weapons to levels higher than they have been in decades\".\n\nTrump's message,  she said, \"is a drop in a much larger bucket, and there are some legitimate concerns of that bucket overfilling\".\n\nThe experts pointed to escalating conflicts where one or more of the warring parties is a nuclear power - the war in Ukraine, for instance, in  which Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened at times  that he could use nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd then there were flare-ups - if not full-fledged conflicts - such as the one between Pakistan and India this year, or Israel - which has a policy of neither confirming nor denying it has nuclear weapons - attacking Iran - a country the West accuses of trying to build nuclear weapons (a charge Tehran denies).\n\nTensions on the Korean peninsula and China's ambitions in Taiwan add to the overall picture.\n\nThe last existing nuclear treaty between the US and Russia that limits their amounts of deployed nuclear arsenals - warheads ready to go - is set to expire in February next year.\n\nIn his announcement, Trump said the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country - a statement that does not match figures updated regularly by another think tank that specialises in the field, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\nAccording to Sipri, Russia has 5,459 nuclear warheads followed by the US with 5,177, and China coming a distant third with 600.\n\nOther think tanks reported similar numbers.\n\nRussia announced recently it had tested new nuclear weapons delivery systems - including a missile the Kremlin said could penetrate US defences and another that could go underwater to strike the US coast.\n\nThe latter claim may have led to Trump's announcement, some of the experts suspected, even though Russia said its tests \"were not nuclear\".\n\nMeanwhile, the US has been watching China closely - with increasing concern that it will reach near-peer status, too, and posing a \"two-peer nuclear risk\", experts said.\n\nSo a resumption of US nuclear testing could prompt China and Russia to do the same.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman said that \"if someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly\".\n\nIn its response, China said it hoped the US would fulfil its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty - which both countries have signed but not ratified - and honour its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\n\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said a US resumption of nuclear weapons testing would be \"a mistake of historic international security proportions\".\n\nHe said the risk of nuclear conflict \"has been steadily rising\" over several years and, unless the US and Russia \"negotiate some form of new constraints on their arsenals, we're likely going to see an unconstained, dangerous, three-way arms race between the US, Russia and then China in the coming years\".\n\nHans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said the average person should be \"very concerned\" because there has been an increase over the past five years in nuclear warheads for the first time since the Cold War.\n\nThe last US nuclear weapons test - underground in Nevada - was in 1992.\n\nKimball said it would take at least 36 months to get the Nevada site ready for use again.\n\nThe US currently uses computer simulations and other non-explosive means to test its nuclear weapons, and therefore does not have a practical justification to detonate them, multiple experts said.\n\nKwong said there were inherent risks even with underground testing, because you must ensure there is not a radioactive leak above ground and it does not affect groundwater.\n\nWhile blaming Russia and China for ratcheting up the rhetoric, Robert Peters, senior research fellow of strategic deterrence at the conservative Heritage Foundation,  said that, while there may not be a scientific or technical reason for testing a warhead, \"the primary reason is to send a political message for your opponents\".\n\n\"It may be necessary for some president, whether it's Donald Trump or whomever, to test nuclear weapons as a demonstration of credibility\", he said, arguing it was \"not an unreasonable position to hold\" to be prepared to test.\n\nWhile many others the BBC spoke to disagreed, all offered a fairly dire assessment of the current situation.\n\n\"My sense is that, if the new nuclear arms race hasn't already begun, then we're currently heading towards the starting line,\" said Rhys Crilley, who writes on the subject at the University of Glasgow.\n\n\"I worry every day about the risks of a nuclear arms race and the increasing risk of nuclear war.\"\n\nThe US tested the first atomic bomb in July 1945 in the desert at Alamogordo, New Mexico.\n\nIt later became the only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in warfare after dropping two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of the same year during World War Two."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3mdvle78o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:11:41.551+00:00","title":"The US bet big on Argentina bailout -

Argentina bailout - is it paying off?\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been the point-person entrusted with selling financial markets on some of President Donald Trump's riskiest economic gambles: sweeping global tariffs, trade talks with China and preparations to install a new leader at the US central bank.\n\nBut Bessent's trickiest task may just be the White House bet on Argentina.\n\nThe US stepped onto the scene in mid-September, responding to a plunge in the peso - the Argentine currency - which officials feared could imperil Trump ally President Javier Milei and his party in looming midterm elections.\n\nBessent said the US would do whatever was needed to stabilise the situation, calling the country a key ally in the region.\n\nIn political terms, the US intervention - which included purchases of pesos and the establishment of a $20bn (£15bn) currency swap line that gives the Argentine central bank access to dollars - was a success for Milei.\n\nHis party not only fended off losses in the midterm elections but made inroads, strengthening his position.\n\nBut whether the US intervention in the country will be a success financially is another question.\n\nThe peso has fallen roughly 30% this year, including roughly 4% over the last month. The drop came despite the US commitments - and a modest rally after the election.\n\nIt's an indication of the ongoing risk. At the end of the day, the US could find itself holding a pile of pesos worth much less than they were originally.\n\nThe intervention in Argentina was a highly unusual move - especially from a White House known for its \"America First\" approach.\n\nMilei has endeared himself to conservatives in the US with his embrace of free-market reforms and radical spending cuts. He has met frequently with Trump, who has called him his \"favourite president\".\n\nBut the US has rarely offered financial bailouts to other countries - especially in a case that posed no wider financial stability risks - and direct purchases of a struggling emerging market currency are unprecedented, says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdding to the risk is Argentina's long history of currency devaluation and debt default, including most recently in 2020.\n\nFew are positioned to be as aware of the potential pitfalls as Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader working for George Soros.\n\nBessent famously took part in the 1992 speculation against the British pound. At that time, investors who bet that Sterling had been overvalued were said to have broken the Bank of England with their heavy selling.\n\nThis time, Bessent finds himself on the opposite side of similar gamble. He has defended his moves, invoking the spectre of fellow South American country, Venezuela, and arguing that failure to shore up Argentina as a US ally could lead to destabilisation in the region.\n\n\"These results are a clear example that the Trump Administration policy of Peace through Economic Strength is working,\" Bessent wrote on social media after the recent election in Argentina.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bessent posted again to say: \"the Argentine economic bridge has now turned a profit for the American people\".\n\nThe US Treasury Department did not respond to inquiries seeking more details.\n\nBut it has kept quiet about key information needed to assess Bessent's claims - including the timeline and scale of its peso purchases - or sales - and what, if any, other assets the Argentine government pledged in order to secure the swap deal.\n\nAnalysts have estimated the US has purchased as much as $2bn worth of pesos so far - hardly an earth-shattering figure.\n\nBut Democrats have criticised the help at a time of White House spending cuts and an ongoing government shutdown, accusing Bessent of wanting to protect finance \"buddies\" with investments in the country.\n\nEven some members of Trump's own Republican Party have questioned how the aid aligns with the president's \"America First\" goals.\n\nBessent has disputed any characterisation of the US support for Argentina as a \"bailout\", promising there will be \"no taxpayer losses\" and even declaring the peso \"undervalued\".\n\nBut while that could be true for a short-term trade, that view is not the general consensus.\n\nTo the contrary - most analysts say the peso is overvalued, but has been propped up by support from the Argentine central bank, which set trading limits for the peso in April.\n\nEconomists say maintaining such limits is not sustainable. They cite the surge in Argentines travelling to make purchases in neighbouring countries where their money travels farther as one of the signs that the peso is being held artificially high.\n\nThe Argentine central bank has insisted it is committed to the trading band, which was intended to protect the country from wild currency swings destabilising prices and support Milei's efforts to control inflation.\n\nBut it has already had to spend billions buying pesos to keep the currency steady, burning through International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding and dipping into its foreign reserves, which are key to paying its debt obligations.\n\nEconomists say they expect the bank will have to change its policy to allow the peso to fall more - or the country risks needing another bailout.\n\nThat choice presents a dilemma for Bessent, given his promises to guard the US against losses.\n\n\"Is the US willing to provide support to Argentina so that Argentina can defend the peso at this level?\" Mr Setser asks. \"Bessent has to decide in a sense whether to double down... or he has to let the peso adjust and recognise that his intervention was a bridge to the election.\"\n\nThe peso plummeted ahead of the midterms, as businesses and households in Argentina rushed to trade the currency for dollars.\n\nPeople wanted to protect themselves, remembering the way the currency collapsed in 2019   after the election loss of former president Mauricio Macri, who was also known for economic reform,   says Joaquín Bagües, managing director of Buenos Aires-based Grit Capital Group.\n\n\"Every single guy that I talked to, they wanted to buy dollars... they have very fresh memories about that,\" he said, describing the run as a \"confidence crisis.\"\n\nMr Bagües says the demand for dollars has eased since the election.\n\nBut the peso has not experienced the kind of sustained relief seen in other assets, like bonds or the stock market, which surged more than 20% the day after the election and has continued to rise.\n\nWhile Argentine companies are starting to tap international lending markets again, after being frozen out ahead of the election, analysts say they expect US banks to remain wary of lending to Argentina, despite a push by Bessent to arrange an additional $20bn in private financing.\n\nAnd Mr Bagües says there are too many policy questions ahead to predict what will happen to the peso.\n\nKathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy Funds Management, suggests that the peso could rise \"over the medium term\" if the government is able to continue advancing economic reforms.\n\nBut, she adds, \"there's a lot that needs to be done between now and then\".\n\nFor now, Anthony Simond, investment director on the emerging market debt team at Aberdeen Group, says he expects the peso has farther to fall.\n\n\"Bessent may say one thing, but I think the economic reality may force them to be a little bit more flexible in terms of currency management,\" he says."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20pezegv1zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:27:17.972+00:00","title":"Sudan war: Reports of mass killings in el-Fasher in Darfur have echoes of country's dark past","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The fall of el-Fasher in Sudan in 2025 has sparked widespread accusations that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are carrying out a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing, echoing the 2000s Darfur genocide orchestrated by Janjaweed militias.

Sudan war: Reports of mass killings in el-Fasher in Darfur have echoes of country's dark past\n\nEmerging evidence of systematic killings in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher have prompted human rights and aid activists to describe the civil war between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the military as a \"continuation of the Darfur genocide\".\n\nThe fall of el-Fasher, in the Darfur region, after an 18-month RSF siege brings together the different layers of the country's conflict – with echoes of its dark past and the brutality of its present-day war.\n\nThe RSF emerged from the Janjaweed, Arab militias who massacred hundreds of thousands of Darfuris from non-Arab populations, in the early 2000s.\n\nThe paramilitary force has been accused of ethnic killings since its power struggle with the army erupted into violence in April 2023. The RSF leadership has consistently denied the accusations - although on Wednesday its leader  Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\"  in el-Fasher.\n\nThe current charges are based on apparent evidence of atrocities provided by the RSF fighters themselves.\n\nThey have been sharing gruesome videos reportedly showing summary executions of mostly male civilians and ex-combatants, celebrating over dead bodies, and taunting and abusing people.\n\nAccounts from exhausted survivors also paint a picture of terror and violence.\n\n\"The situation in el-Fasher is extremely dire and there are violations taking place on the roads, including looting and shooting, with no distinction made between young or old,\" one man told the BBC Arabic service. He had escaped to the town of Tawila, a hub for those displaced from el-Fasher.\n\nAnother woman, Ikram Abdelhameed, told the Reuters news agency that RSF soldiers separated fleeing civilians at an earthen barrier around the city and shot the men.\n\nAnd  satellite images collected by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab  show evidence of what seem to be massacre sites – clusters of bodies and reddish patches on the earth that the analysts believe could be blood stains.\n\nEl-Fasher \"appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of… indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution\", the Yale researchers say in a report.\n\nThere is a clear ethnic element to the battle for el-Fasher, because local armed groups from the dominant Zaghawa tribe, known as the Joint Force, have been fighting alongside the army.\n\nThe RSF fighters see Zaghawa civilians as legitimate targets.\n\nThat is what many survivors of the paramilitary takeover of the Zamzam displaced persons camp next to el-Fasher reported earlier this year, according to an investigation by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF).\n\nThe army has also been accused of targeting ethnic groups it sees as support bases for the RSF in areas it has recaptured, including the states of Sennar, Gezira and some parts of North Kordofan.\n\n\"Whether you're a civilian, wherever you are, it is not safe right now, even in Khartoum,\" says Emi Mahmoud, strategic director of the IDP Humanitarian Network which helps coordinate aid deliveries in Darfur.\n\n\"Because at the flip of a hat, the people in power who have the guns, they can and will continue to falsely imprison, disappear, kill, torture, everyone.\"\n\nBoth sides have been accused of war crimes - ethnically motivated revenge attacks are part of that.\n\nIt was Sudan's military government in 2003 that weaponised ethnicity – enlisting the Janjaweed to put down rebellions by black African groups in Darfur who accused Khartoum of politically and economically marginalising them.\n\nThe pattern of violence established then has been repeated in Darfur now, says Kate Ferguson, the co-founder of NGO Protection Approaches.\n\nThis was most evident in the 2023 massacre of members of the Masalit tribe in el-Geneina in West Darfur, which the UN says killed up to 15,000 people.\n\n\"For more than two years, the RSF have followed a very clear, practiced and predicted pattern,\" Ms Ferguson said at a press briefing.\n\n\"They first encircle their target town or city, they weaken it by cutting off access to food, to medicine, to power supplies, the internet. Then when it's weakened, they overwhelm the population with systematic arson, sexual violence, massacre and the destruction of vital infrastructure. This is a deliberate strategy to destroy and displace, and that's why I feel the appropriate word is genocide.\"\n\nThe RSF has denied involvement in what it has called \"tribal conflicts\", but Gen Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti, appeared to be hearing expressions of mounting international outrage, including from the UN, the African Union, the European Union and the UK.\n\nHe released a video saying he was sorry for the disaster that had befallen the people of el-Fasher in a war that had been \"forced upon us\" and admitted there had been violations by his forces, promising they would be investigated by a committee that has now arrived in the city.\n\nAny \"soldier or any officer who committed a crime or crossed the lines against any person… will be immediately arrested and the result [of the investigation] to be announced immediately and in public in front of everyone,\" the general pledged.\n\nHowever, observers say similar promises made in the past - in response to accusations of a massacre in the Darfui city of el-Geneina in 2023, and alleged atrocities during the group's control of the central state of Gezira - were not fulfilled.\n\nIt is also not clear how much control the RSF leadership has over its foot soldiers – a loose mix of hired militias, allied Arab groups, and regional mercenaries, many from Chad and South Sudan.\n\n\"The reality is that the way that the RSF is, it's very, very hard to believe that a command is going to be given by Hemedti, and then people on the ground are going to follow it,\" says aid co-ordinator Ms Mahmoud. \"By that time, we'll have lost many, many people.\"\n\nAid groups and activists warn that if the pattern of the past two years is allowed to continue, it could happen again. They stress that the el-Fasher killings were entirely predictable, but the international community failed to act to protect civilians despite ample warning.\n\n\"The reality is that we laid these options out multiple times over six meetings with UN Security Council elements, with the US government, with the British government, with the French government, basically saying they had to be ready for a protection kinetic option [direct military action] in the summer of last year,\" says Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab.\n\n\"This cannot be something settled by a press conference. It has to be something settled by immediate action.\"\n\nIn particular, activists are urging pressure on the United Arab Emirates, which is widely accused of providing military support to the RSF. The UAE denies this despite evidence presented in UN reports and international media investigations.\n\n\"This is exactly like the siege of Sarajevo,\" says Ms Mahmoud, referring to the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnia war, which galvanised international action. \"This is the Srebrenica moment.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/food-stamps-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:20:33-04:00","title":"Trump Administration Tells Court It Has Money It Can’t Spend to Prevent Food Stamp Cuts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is defending its decision to halt food stamp benefits during a government shutdown, asserting that legal, technical, and budgetary barriers prevent the use of billions of surplus federal funds to maintain the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

After dinner that night, staff members encouraged guests to take food from the buffet back to their rooms just in case the staff couldn’t reach them the next day. The storm was forecast to make landfall either later that night or the next day.\n\nAs the next morning dawned and the worst winds and rains still had not arrived, some of the 130 staff members who had volunteered to ride out the storm with the guests delivered breakfast to each door, including eggs, bacon, French toast, waffles and orange juice — as the rain began to pelt sideways.\n\nMs. Rampy and her family had adjoining rooms that faced the beach beyond a water park and a playground, giving them a front-row seat as the hurricane approached.\n\nThe electricity flickered, Ms. Rampy said, but because the resort had a generator, they lost power for a total of only five to 10 seconds. In one room, they took a mattress off a trundle bed, laid it against a window and bolstered it with a bed frame. Ms. Rampy said her grandson had built a fort, where he watched a movie on a tablet as the storm arrived. The rest of the family followed the Weather Channel, read books, took naps and played cards while keeping an eye on the storm through the unblocked windows in the adjoining room.\n\nInternet service went out at around 1:30 p.m., during the worst of the storm. Branches were ripped off trees, palm trees bent over in the ferocious winds and rain continued to pour down. But with the room’s covered balcony blocking much of the wind, “we didn’t feel the imminent danger,” Ms. Rampy said. She was used to tornadoes back home in Texas, she added, but this was different.\n\n“While I think a tornado can do probably more damage, it’s very quick,” she said. “This was sustained for hours and hours of rain like you’ve never seen.”\n\nAfter the worst of the storm had passed, she said, staff members brought meat, fish, salads, potatoes, and rice and peas for dinner.\n\n“You never feel more like an entitled American as when you’re in a resort and you know that the people that are there caring for you are possibly losing their homes or they don’t know how their family is,” Ms. Rampy said. “And yet they’ve got on raincoats bringing you steak and chicken and fish for dinner.”\n\nBy 8:30 the next morning, guests and workers alike were outside picking up fallen branches and clearing debris. By about 10 a.m., one of the resort’s pools was open again, and guests were swimming.\n\n“It was almost like business as usual, except there are trees in hot tubs,” Ms. Rampy said.\n\nThe hurricane devastated parts of Jamaica, flooding streets, tearing off roofs and flattening buildings, particularly along its southwestern coast. Officials are still trying to assess the death toll. No guests or staff members were injured at any of Sandals’ eight resorts across Jamaica during the storm, Sandals said in a statement. The company is raising money for relief efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms. Rampy said, she finally broke down and allowed herself to feel all the fear and apprehension she had held back during the storm. “I very much understood that a Category 5 hurricane making landfall while we were on a resort on the beach could be catastrophic,” she said.\n\nMs. Rampy, whose travel agency works with Sandals, said she had been to Jamaica more than 50 times and already had a trip booked in December — one she still intends to take.\n\n“I cannot tell you enough about the resilience, the heart, the compassion, the care and the concern and the love that the Jamaican people have,” she said. “I will never stop coming to Jamaica.”\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

But he had little time for them.\n\nStanding up, Abu Lulu ignored the man’s imprecations, casually shot him dead, and kept walking.\n\nThe execution, depicted in a video circulating online and verified by The New York Times, was one of numerous scenes of violence to emerge from the besieged Sudanese city of El Fasher since it was captured by paramilitaries last weekend.\n\nVideos and witness accounts show trenches filled with bodies, and fighters with the paramilitary force — the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F. — hunting down civilians as they flee.\n\nThe images of these and other atrocities have set off global outrage and stoked fears that the region of Darfur is plunging, once again, into a cycle of genocidal violence of the kind that made the Sudanese region a focus of global politics two decades ago.\n\nAt the United Nations and in Western capitals, officials issued statements on Thursday condemning the R.S.F., which has been battling Sudan’s military since the country plunged into a ruinous civil war over two years ago, and recently declared its own parallel government.\n\nSome called for punitive measures against its main foreign backer, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn Washington, congressional leaders renewed calls for a pause on arms sales to the Emirates until it stops arming the paramilitary. In London, the government faced questions about reports that British-made military equipment was being used by the R.S.F.\n\nAt an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, Tom Fletcher, the top U.N. humanitarian official, criticized member states for letting the crisis reach this point.\n\n“I have found the limits of my ability and the U.N.’s authority,” he said, calling on member states to “stop arming” the R.S.F.’s campaign, without naming the country responsible, widely assumed to be the Emirates. (The Emirates has denied backing either side in the conflict.)\n\nResponding to mounting outrage, the R.S.F. leader, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, made a speech shared on social media in which he conceded that his troops had committed some abuses, and pledged to hold responsible “any soldier or officer who committed a crime.”\n\nThe R.S.F. later said it had arrested Abu Lulu, the commander who had been filmed shooting the injured man.\n\nBut the paramilitary denied a shocking allegation from the World Health Organization, which said that 460 people had been killed at a hospital in El Fasher on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough the W.H.O. did not specify who had carried out the killings, they had occurred days after the R.S.F. seized El Fasher, breaking an 18-month siege that reduced starving residents to eating animal feed.\n\nIn a statement, the R.S.F. said it “categorically denied” those allegations, which it said were part of an “intensive propaganda campaign” with “no connection to reality.” On Thursday, the group released a video purporting to show the hospital, saying it countered claims of the attack. In the footage, not many patients can be seen in the disheveled building.\n\nMr. Fletcher’s remarks added to a pile of U.N. reports over the past 18 months about what is widely considered to be the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis — a civil war that has forced 12 million people from their homes, spread famine across the country and killed as many as 400,000 people, by some estimates.\n\nThat crisis has only intensified in El Fasher in recent days. Communications with the city were still largely cut off on Thursday. But a stream of videos, filmed by R.S.F. fighters themselves and verified by The Times and the Centre for Information Resilience, a nonprofit that documents potential war crimes, opened a window into the unfolding carnage.\n\nIn one video, fighters stepped over bodies scattered in a room in the city’s university. A survivor can be seen raising an arm, apparently calling for help, before a fighter shoots him dead.\n\nAn estimated 260,000 civilians were trapped in the city when R.S.F. troops captured the main army base on Sunday. Since then, thousands have fled. But aid groups said Thursday that only a trickle appeared to have made it to safety, and many of those who did reported passing down a road littered with the bodies of others who had died, or been killed, along the way.\n\nJust 5,000 people had reached Tawila, about 40 miles west of El Fasher, said Mathilde Vu of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which provides aid there. “People who arrived talk about dead bodies on the road and being stopped multiple times before reaching,” she said. “Men are being separated and detained.”\n\nThe journey, the group said in a statement on Thursday, is riddled with “extortion, arbitrary arrests, detention, looting, sexual violence and harassment.”\n\nThose who survive the trip are directed to overflowing camps that already hold hundreds of thousands of people, where disease outbreaks are common and there is an extreme shortage of food, water and shelters.\n\n“They are safe from shelling and attacks, but not from the suffering,” Ms. Vu said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/louisiana-snap-benefit-cuts.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:49:15-04:00","title":"The Threat of Lost Food Benefits Is Rattling the Vulnerable in Louisiana","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The federal government shutdown in October 2025 suspended SNAP food benefits, leaving millions of Americans, especially in vulnerable regions like northeastern Louisiana, at risk of hunger.

Is Rattling the Vulnerable in Louisiana\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T17:49:15-04:00\n\nEverything changed for Lisa Oglesbee in January, after a spinal condition left her husband in a wheelchair. Without his physical strength, she could not manage the job they had shared, cleaning commercial pizza ovens. And she could not look for another one yet, not when he needed her help to move around the house.\n\nWhen the government shut down on Oct. 1, she started to worry that his application for disability benefits would take even longer than they had been warned. Then, she began to hear that their federal food benefits — around $350 a month, she said — would not come in November.\n\n“I think they don’t care — it’s not them, it’s not their family,” Ms. Oglesbee, 42, said of lawmakers in Washington, holding back tears as she waited in line this week at a food pantry in Winnsboro, a small town in northeast Louisiana. “I hope I’m wrong about that.”\n\nWith nearly unanimous support from the Legislature, Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, said on Wednesday that the state would use about $147 million in emergency funds to keep food assistance flowing temporarily for  older residents, those who are disabled and households with children, starting Saturday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether or when the state’s intervention might be available to help other recipients. Mr. Landry said that thousands of “able-bodied” adults without young children would most likely need to turn to charity or, if unemployed, find jobs.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it would not disburse benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in November because of the shutdown, reversing its own policy that had allowed some funding to be reprogrammed during emergencies.\n\n“Without that, I don’t know how we would eat,” Ms. Oglesbee said of SNAP benefits. She added, “I didn’t realize how hard it was to get help, and I guess apparently, to keep help.”\n\nThe threat of food assistance disappearing for 42 million Americans, even for a month, has exposed how threadbare the nation’s social safety net has become at a time of persistent inflation and deep federal funding cuts. Filling the void in the coming weeks will strain many food banks and other organizations that were already stretched thin.\n\nLouisiana has one of the nation’s highest proportions of residents receiving SNAP, about one in five.\n\nThe crisis could be particularly acute in northeastern Louisiana. Nonprofit and social services groups say that poverty and hunger rates there are often higher than those in the rest of the state. Calls to 211, which connects people with social services, spiked by 40 percent this week in connection with the shutdown, according to the United Way of Northeast Louisiana.\n\n“You have a perfect storm happening even in the absence of this shutdown,” said Jan Moller, the executive director of Invest in Louisiana, a  policy research group. “When you add the uncertainty now created by the shutdown, you have a recipe for a real disaster.”\n\nAbout a dozen parishes, or counties, make up northeastern Louisiana, bounded by the Delta regions of Arkansas and Mississippi. Small, mostly rural communities are spread out over miles of farmland. Glimpses of rusting farm equipment, boarded-up windows and for-sale signs hint at how high prices and economic disinvestment have left many struggling to afford basic necessities.\n\nAshley Armstrong, a farmer in Bastrop, La., has been buffeted in recent months by rising equipment costs and canceled contracts stemming from federal cuts. But she has continued to offer a sizable discount to SNAP recipients who buy her produce, and to donate leftover produce to her church.\n\nOf federal lawmakers, she said, “I feel like they’re not really taking into consideration the everyday American and what these policy changes entail for their lives.”\n\nAt the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana, leaders have begun to stagger distribution in anticipation of more need, and are competing to buy food to supplement donations. One pantry that works with the food bank took in nearly two dozen new applications for help in one morning this week.\n\n“We cannot fill the full gap and we know that,” said Jean Toth, the food bank’s executive director. Tears welling in her eyes, she added, “It’s emotional.”\n\nInflated prices mean that for some families, the monthly SNAP allocation — about $356 per household, on average — is barely enough to cover staples like bread, milk and canned goods. When word of the looming lapse began to spread last week via text messages and social media, many families had already used up their October benefits.\n\n“I run short at the end of the month,” said Jennifer Winn, 38, who estimated she gets around $1,100 in monthly SNAP benefits for herself and five children in Monroe and had gone without meals to ensure the children could eat.\n\nIn the coming weeks, she predicted, “It’s going be more chaotic because people are tired, they’re stressed and they’re crying out for help. And they don’t know where to get it from.”\n\nEven if families get their November benefits through state funding, it is unclear what would happen should the shutdown continue into December. Complicating matters, the shutdown may require some staff members in local offices that administer SNAP benefits to be furloughed in the coming days.\n\nMr. Landry, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, blamed the shutdown on Democratic leaders in Congress, who have resisted agreeing to end it until Republicans agree to extend expiring health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans.\n\nBut in northeast Louisiana this week, most people interviewed pointed to what they saw as a broken system in Washington that felt deeply removed from their own day-to-day realities.\n\n“I feel that the government is making the poor people poorer, which I think is unfair,” said Demi Dyer, 33, who just moved with her family from Missouri to West Monroe, La.. She said she was worried that her SNAP application would take longer to be processed in her new state because of the shutdown. “We’re all human, we all struggle, we have all gone through stuff like this.”\n\nSome residents expressed frustration with President Trump’s unfulfilled promise to lower prices, as well as with assumptions that some of those dependent on food stamps had not been trying to find work.\n\n“I may have even been guilty in the past of the same, maybe, of looking at people — ‘Well, they need to get a job,’” Ms. Oglesbee said. “And some people do have jobs and still just don’t make enough money around.”\n\nSome residents of the region said they felt disillusioned to the point of not voting, because it didn’t seem to matter.\n\n“We need more people that care about folks,” said Dusty Ward, 39, who had been carefully rationing a month’s worth of food with his wife, Stephanie.\n\nAt Grace Place Ministries in Monroe, La., where dozens of people had lined up on a blustery cold morning for a hot meal, some grimly wondered whether the loss of a month’s benefits would drive the desperate to steal to stay fed. Prayer, for some, seemed like the only answer.\n\nOthers wondered if the lapse was a sign of the end times foretold in the Bible, or that all hope in government should be abandoned. Individuals and community groups that had stepped up before — after natural disasters, and during the pandemic — were preparing to do so again.\n\n“Maybe our country’s just hitting rock bottom in a way, and now it’s going to shift responsibility,” said Misty Loe, the executive director of Grace Place, comparing it to those who reach their lowest moment before improving. She was bustling around, slipping a box of cupcakes to toddlers who had come with their mother and overseeing new volunteers as they served hot dogs, fruit, salad and chips.\n\n“Ultimately, I do hope that the government goes back to stepping in where they need to — step in, step in and help feed,” Ms. Loe said. “Unless we really are going to reorganize how we do everything.”\n\nReferring to those who need the help, she added: “But I would hope that we would give them a lot more warning than this.”\n\nTony Romm and Eduardo Medina contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/china-trump-trade-security-chips-minerals.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:07:05-04:00","title":"With China Truce, U.S. National Security Controls Now Appear Up for Negotiation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a meeting in South Korea, the United States and China reached a temporary truce by reversing key trade and technology restrictions.

Negotiation\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T17:07:05-04:00\n\nRather than advancing the U.S.-China relationship, the concessions that President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to in their meeting in South Korea on Wednesday appear to have largely rolled back the clock, returning to the terms of an earlier truce.\n\nMr. Trump agreed to reverse some of his tariffs and paused new fees on Chinese ships. China said it would suspend the rollout of rare earths restrictions introduced in October, and return to buying U.S. soybeans, in addition to a newer promise to crack down on shipments of chemicals used to make fentanyl.\n\nBut one of the reversals from the United States was more notable in the precedent it set. The Trump administration agreed to pause for one year a rule that expanded the number of Chinese companies restricted from access to advanced technology. The rule, issued just four weeks ago, extended the reach of the “entity list,” a kind of trade blacklist for foreign companies that pose a national security threat.\n\nFormer officials and analysts said Thursday that the move appeared to be one of the first concessions the United States had made on national security-related technology controls as part of a trade negotiation. They called it a potential breakthrough for the Chinese side, which has long pushed to negotiate with the United States over these types of measures, known as export controls.\n\nChristopher Padilla, who served as an export control official in the George W. Bush administration, said it was a significant shift for U.S. policy. Chinese officials have consistently asked in talks with many presidential administrations for export control measures to be rolled back, he said.\n\n“We all had the talking points,” Mr. Padilla said. “The first one is: ‘That’s a national security issue, and we’re not going to discuss it in a trade negotiation.’”\n\n“Export controls have now become a tradable item in the relationship,” Mr. Padilla added. “You’ve discarded decades of precedent.”\n\nBrett Fetterly, a principal at the Asia Group consultancy and the former national security adviser to Ben Sasse, the Republican former senator, agreed that Beijing had succeeded in this summit in its long-term goal of tying national security-focused export controls to broader trade negotiations.\n\n“Technology competition now defines the U.S.-China relationship, and on this point President Xi secured key U.S. concessions,” Mr. Fetterly said.\n\nMany business groups praised a return to greater stability in the U.S.-China relationship, which would help encourage trade and growth. But some analysts said the Trump administration may have had little choice but to roll back U.S. technology controls given China’s chokehold on critical minerals. Last December, Beijing introduced its first curbs on rare earth mineral exports, which it expanded in April and again in October in response to Mr. Trump’s trade war.\n\nChina dominates the mining and processing of rare earth minerals, and the magnets made from them that are common in batteries and motors. The Chinese curbs threatened the supply chains of global makers of cars, planes, munitions and semiconductors, and some companies were forced to halt production lines. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, had called the restrictions “a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world.”\n\nWith the renewed tensions with China this fall, industry executives say supplies of minerals and magnets have once again been running short.\n\nSome analysts say that China’s decision to limit exports of rare earths was a natural consequence of Washington’s technology controls, which used a similar global licensing system to limit China’s access to advanced chips. After so many years of being the target of restrictions, China sought to develop powerful controls of its own, they say.\n\nEmily Benson, the head of strategy at Minerva Technology Futures, a consultancy, said it was “sort of surprising” that the United States didn’t seem to anticipate that other countries would develop similar systems. She added, “It was just a matter of time.”\n\nOther have pointed fingers at the Trump administration’s behavior toward China. They say it was Mr. Trump’s aggressive threats of tariffs this spring that gave the Chinese the opportunity to try out their new approach, and the administration’s lack of a coherent strategy that gave the Chinese an opening to press for long-desired changes.\n\nSome have pointed to the waning influence of the National Security Council, which would typically coordinate strategy and policies on China. The N.S.C.’s influence has been greatly reduced in the Trump administration, after multiple officials were fired for suspicions of political disloyalty.\n\nVarious U.S. departments have sometimes appeared uncoordinated in their measures against China this year. And Chinese actions in response have seemed designed to telegraph the message that any measures taken by the United States to clamp down on China will now be aggressively matched by Beijing.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump introduced high tariffs in April and China put in place its rare earth curbs, the two countries reached a tentative truce in Geneva in May. But the day after that meeting, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued new guidance saying that the use of A.I. chips made by Chinese tech firm Huawei anywhere in the world was an export control violation. The announcement rankled China and led it to clamp down on rare earth exports again.\n\nThe countries held a series of meetings in other European capitals this summer to try to stabilize the relationship. But shortly after a phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi in September, the United States released its rule extending the impact of the entity list to majority-owned subsidiaries, and the Chinese once again responded angrily. In October, Beijing imposed expansive global controls on the trade in minerals and products made with them.\n\nChinese officials claimed that U.S. measures like the 50 percent entity list rule had violated a consensus struck in their bilateral meetings. Some U.S. officials privately grumbled about the Commerce Department’s timing and lack of coordination. But publicly, the United States insisted it had not made promises to withhold the imposition of export controls.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC last week, Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said that the Chinese were “trying out a lot of different narratives when the reality is, they just want to exert economic control on the world.”\n\n“They’re using anything else that has happened as a pretext,” he said. He added that the United States had promised to reduce its tariffs in return for China allowing the free flow of rare earths. “We kept that promise, and they have not kept theirs.”\n\nWith the president’s meeting with Mr. Xi, the U.S. side appears to have made more explicit concessions. A White House spokesman confirmed Thursday that the United States had agreed to pause the expansion of the entity list to cover majority-owned subsidiaries for one year.\n\nFor some, the move is welcome. Some tech executives and lobbyists had criticized the 50 percent rule, saying the due diligence it requires is onerous or impossible.\n\nSean Stein, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies doing business in China, said in a statement that the 50 percent rule’s reversal, and Beijing’s decision to pause its October rare earth controls, was “especially welcome news.” He also called the broader trade announcement “very encouraging.”\n\n“America’s reduction of the fentanyl-related tariffs and China’s commitment to take strong action to curb fentanyl precursors have paved the way for a reopening of China’s market for U.S. agriculture and energy and a wider, mutually beneficial trade agreement,” Mr. Stein said.\n\nThe 50 percent rule greatly expanded the reach of the entity list, freezing trade for some companies. According to Wirescreen, a data platform focused on China, the rule means that the entity list has grown from roughly 1,300 China-related parties to more than 20,000.\n\nPeople familiar with the situation said that the Commerce Department had described the change to others in the administration as correcting a loophole, and that officials in the Treasury Department and elsewhere had been surprised by the ultimate impact of the policy.\n\nSome U.S. officials and analysts argue the change has been needed to stop targets of the entity list from easily sidestepping the impact of U.S. sanctions by shifting business to their subsidiaries instead. Mr. Padilla said the standard was used for other government sanctions lists, like controls on military hardware administered by the State Department and financial sanctions administered by the Treasury Department.\n\n“If you’re going to sanction a company but you don’t at the same time sanction majority-owned subsidiaries, that doesn’t make a lot of sense,” he said. “From a practical point of view, this was a loophole that needed to be closed.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/frank-bisignano-fiserv-stock-price.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:50:32-04:00","title":"A Top Trump Official Had to Sell His Stock.

He May Have Saved Millions.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T18:50:32-04:00\n\nIn the stock market, timing is everything.\n\nFrank Bisignano, the former chief executive of the global payments and financial-technology company Fiserv, was forced to sell his stake in the company to join the Trump administration as head of the Social Security Administration.\n\nHe did so over several months this year. Between May and August, Mr. Bisignano and his family netted roughly $560 million from their stake in the company, according to securities filings. In doing so, they avoided a dizzying decline in the company’s stock price that started this week after Mr. Bisignano’s successor, Michael Lyons, warned of a steep drop in the company’s growth trajectory and its profits. Mr. Bisignano and his family’s holdings would have been valued at around $215 million at Thursday’s close.\n\nFiserv stunned Wall Street on Wednesday, saying its previous forecasts were too optimistic. Its stock price has dropped nearly 50 percent since the end of trading on Tuesday, erasing nearly $35 billion of its market valuation. Mr. Lyons delivered a damning indictment of the company’s decisions under Mr. Bisignano.\n\n“Over the last few years, decisions to defer certain investments and cut certain costs improve margins in the short term, but are now limiting our ability to serve clients in a world-class way, execute product launches to our standards and grow revenue to our full potential,” Mr. Lyons told investors on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Lyons said he spent his first months in the job, which he assumed after Mr. Bisignano became the commissioner of the Social Security Administration in May, studying Fiserv’s finances and business.\n\n“And as I got a more fulsome understanding of those, that obviously prompted some dissatisfaction with the way we do the process,” Mr. Lyons said. He made a slew of changes to the executive team, including hiring a new chief financial officer and two new co-presidents.\n\nHe also added three new board members from Bridgewater, BlackRock and RBC. Of the new additions, one is a new independent board chairman and two of the new directors will join the audit committee. He also brought in the consulting firm McKinsey to advise them.\n\nMr. Bisignano began selling his Fiserv stock once he was confirmed by the Senate in May. The company’s stock has struggled this year, and Mr. Bisignano began selling after the share price hit its peak in March. In September, Mr. Bisignano filed paperwork with the government saying he had fully divested his holdings.\n\nMr. Bisignano was also tapped this month to simultaneously serve as the chief executive of the Internal Revenue Service, a new role that the Trump administration created after other I.R.S. leaders were fired or quit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is also the acting I.R.S. commissioner, praised Mr. Bisignano at the time as “a businessman with an exceptional track record of driving growth and efficiency.”\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed this summer accuses Mr. Bisignano and Fiserv of misleading investors with inflated growth numbers. Fiserv has said it plans to “vigorously” defend itself in the case. The I.R.S. and Social Security Administration did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Bisignano did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn his final earnings call as chief executive, Mr. Bisignano took a victory lap of sorts, talking about how radically the business had changed over the past five to seven years: “We built this. We executed,” he told analysts in April. “We got through the consolidation, but we’re still optimizing the construction of the company and adding more capability.”\n\nDuring Wednesday’s investor call, Mr. Lyons, who was president of PNC Financial Services before joining Fiserv this year, painted a picture of a business that was run to maximize profits over the short term. He specifically referred to many of his predecessor’s decisions that, if continued, would have put the business on a perilous trajectory.\n\n“While there are certainly some areas where we are dissatisfied with our recent performance, we found that our challenges are largely driven by our own doing,” he said. “Nothing at Fiserv is fundamentally broken.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/trump-nuclear-testing-cold-war.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:12:41-04:00","title":"Trump’s Call to Resume Nuclear Testing After Decades Revives a Cold War Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has announced the resumption of U.S. nuclear explosive testing, a move that contradicts decades of arms control policy and raises global alarm.

Testing After Decades Revives a Cold War Debate\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T17:12:41-04:00\n\nPresident Trump’s unexpected declaration on Thursday that he was ordering the U.S. military to resume nuclear testing prompted visions of a return to the worst days of the Cold War, when the United States, Russia and China were regularly detonating new weapons, first in the atmosphere and outer space, then underground.\n\nIt was an era of terrifying threats and counter-threats, of dark visions of Armageddon and theories of deterrence by mutually assured destruction. That age supposedly ended with the arrival of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that nations agreed to in the mid-1990s. But not enough of the signatories ratified it for the treaty to formally come into force. Its objective was to starve the arms race by cutting off new tests and the cycle of retaliation they engendered.\n\nMr. Trump has now revived the debate inside the national security community over whether to break the tradition of observing that treaty, which some of his former aides have argued impedes the country’s ability to demonstrate “peace through strength.” On Air Force One, returning from Korea, the president told reporters he had made the call because of all the other countries conducting nuclear tests.\n\n“We’ve halted it years — many years — ago,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the fact that the last U.S. explosive test of a nuclear weapon was in 1992, during the George H.W. Bush administration. “But with others doing testing, I think it is appropriate that we do also.”\n\nExcept, of course, they aren’t. The only nation that has been regularly testing in the past quarter century is North Korea, and its last explosive test was in September 2017.\n\nMoscow has not conducted a test in 35 years, in the last days of the Soviet Union. Mr. Trump, however, may have been confusing nuclear weapons tests with Russia’s recent declaration that it had tested two exotic delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons: a nuclear-powered cruise missile and an undersea torpedo, called Poseidon, that could cross the Pacific and strike the West Coast of the United States. Both are designed to evade American missile defenses, which look for the warheads of intercontinental ballistic missiles as they speed through space.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters that he was not including China on that list of testing nations; its last explosive test was 29 years ago, though there is some evidence the country has made preparations at Lop Nur, where Mao first demonstrated China’s nuclear capabilities in the 1960s, in case it decides to resume.\n\nMr. Trump’s own senior official in charge of nuclear testing — Brandon Williams, a former one-term member of Congress from upstate New York — was asked point-blank during his confirmation hearing in April whether the United States needed to go back to explosive testing.\n\n“I would not advise testing, and I think we should rely on the scientific information,” Mr. Williams said, referring to such things as data gathered from supercomputer modeling. But he quickly noted the decision would be made “above my pay grade.”\n\nApparently, that is exactly what happened. In the hour before Mr. Trump met Xi Jinping, China’s leader, in South Korea on Thursday, he sent out a social media post saying he had ordered the “Department of War,” as he calls the Defense Department, to resume tests “immediately.” His qualifier that the tests would occur “on an equal basis” with U.S. rivals left many national security officials scratching their heads. (It was also puzzling because the Energy Department, not the Pentagon, is responsible for testing.)\n\nMr. Trump provided no rationale for resuming the testing, other than his incorrect statement that others were doing the same. He boasted that “the United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” which is incorrect — Russia has more. (Many of the weapons in Russia’s arsenal are small battlefield weapons of the kind American officials worried in October 2022 would be used against Ukraine.)\n\nHe said China was a “distant third” in its capabilities. That is true, but they are also growing fast. The Pentagon estimated during the Biden administration that China would have 1,000 deployed weapons by 2030 and would hit rough parity with the United States and Russia in 2035.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance said that testing the nuclear arsenal was important to make sure it “actually functions properly.”\n\n“To be clear,” he said, “we know that it does work properly, but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.” He made no reference to testing “on an equal basis” with other nations.\n\nMany experts believe that if the United States resumes testing, it would essentially give permission to other nations to do the same — roughly 100 days before the last arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, limiting the size of their arsenals, is set to expire.\n\nNuclear experts say that both Russia and China are prepared to conduct nuclear detonations at their underground test sites fairly rapidly. That is in contrast to the United States, which is seen as having made few serious preparations. Its test site is a desolate expanse of the Nevada desert bigger than the state of Rhode Island.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, he revived the possibility of new American testing. In addition to discussing a restart of underground detonations, officials called for major reductions in the preparation time for a U.S. nuclear test resumption. The federal agency in charge of the nation’s nuclear test site ordered the required time for preparations to drop from years to as few as six months.\n\nNuclear experts saw the goal as unrealistic because testing equipment at the sprawling Nevada site had fallen into disrepair, or vanished.\n\nEven so, Project 2025, the 2023 right-wing blueprint for Mr. Trump’s presidency, echoed the push for a quickening. It called on Washington to forego the lengthy period of preparation altogether and “move to immediate test readiness” in order to give the president “maximum flexibility in responding to adversary actions.”\n\nThe drumbeat continued in 2024 when Robert C. O’Brien, a former national security adviser to Mr. Trump, said in Foreign Affairs that Washington “must test new nuclear weapons for reliability and safety in the real world.” But his core argument seemed less about a scientific need for explosive testing than about a political one — to demonstrate to rising and aggressive powers that the United States, which opened the nuclear age when it dropped two atomic weapons on Japan, remained prepared to use the ultimate weapon.\n\nCritics say a testing restart would incite a global arms race. They note that directors of the national labs in charge of the nation’s atomic arsenal have repeatedly testified to Congress that the United States did not need to return to nuclear detonations.\n\nIn lieu of testing, the United States now relies on top experts and machines at the nation’s weapons labs to verify the lethality of the country’s arsenal. Today the machines include room-size supercomputers, the world’s most powerful X-ray machine and a system of lasers the size of a sports stadium. No other country has such an extensive array of nonnuclear testing tools.\n\nIn contrast to laboratory studies, nuclear testing underground in explosive detonations lets scientists uncover major flaws in prototype arms and fine-tune new weapon designs. During the Cold War, China conducted 45 test explosions at Lop Nur, its underground test site in the Western desert. In comparison, France set off 210, Russia 715 and the United States 1,030.\n\nSuch tests slowly concluded at the end of the Cold War. In 1996, the stoppage was formalized in the global test ban. The world’s atomic powers signed it as a way to curb a costly nuclear arms race that was spinning out of control. But it has been an essentially voluntary agreement, since the U.S. Senate never ratified it, and other countries held back formal approval as well.\n\nSiegfried S. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico, where the first atomic bomb was created, has long argued that the test ban favors Washington because it bars pact-abiding rivals from catching up on the huge edge the United States possesses in advanced nuclear arms.\n\n“Yes, we can learn things by nuclear testing,” Dr. Hecker said in an interview. “But when you look at the big picture, we have much more to lose by going back to testing than we have to gain.”\n\nThe test disparities give Washington a military edge because they keep other powers from making their arsenals more diverse and deadly.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/business/jpmorgan-jeffrey-epstein.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"22:59:08-04:00","title":"JPMorgan Alerted U.S. to Epstein Transfers Involving Wall St. Figures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"JPMorgan Chase filed a suspicious activity report in 2019 alerting U.S. regulators to over 4,700 transactions involving Jeffrey Epstein and high-profile figures such as Leon Black, Glenn Dubin, Alan Dershowitz, and Leslie Wexner’s trusts, totaling more than $1 billion.

It also mentioned Mr. Epstein’s wire transfers to Russian banks and sensitivities around “his relationships with two U.S. presidents.” Mr. Epstein at times was close with President Trump and former President Bill Clinton.\n\nNone of the men mentioned in the report have been charged with crimes in connection to Mr. Epstein.\n\nThe report was included in hundreds of pages of previously sealed court records that JPMorgan released on Thursday at the instruction of a federal judge, Jed S. Rakoff. He ordered the documents unsealed in response to requests from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSeveral other suspicious activity reports that JPMorgan filed in the years before Mr. Epstein’s 2019 arrest were also included in the documents released on Thursday. They notified federal regulators to some of Mr. Epstein’s voluminous cash withdrawals, which experts say are a potential hallmark of money laundering and human trafficking.\n\nYet JPMorgan continued to do business with Mr. Epstein for years. The bank lent him money, moved his funds overseas and enabled payments to some of his sex-trafficking victims, The Times reported in September. Bank employees repeatedly raised concerns about the risks of being associated with Mr. Epstein, but senior executives decided to keep his accounts open.\n\nThe 2019 suspicious activity report provided scant details about the transactions in question or why they were considered suspicious, aside from apparently being connected to Mr. Epstein.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Wexner’s trusts, it described $65 million of wire transfers from the mid-2000s that appeared to move between multiple banks. Mr. Epstein served as a trustee for some of Mr. Wexner’s trusts.\n\nFor nearly two decades, until around 2007, Mr. Epstein was a close financial adviser to Mr. Wexner, whose company controlled retailers like the Limited and Victoria’s Secret. Soon after Mr. Epstein’s death, Mr. Wexner accused him of having misappropriated “vast sums” of his money.\n\nThe suspicious activity report pointed to unidentified transactions with Mr. Black, his wife and a Black family partnership. The Times recently reported that Mr. Black had paid Mr. Epstein about $170 million and hundreds of thousands of dollars to at least three women who were associated with Mr. Epstein.\n\nMr. Epstein’s relationship with Mr. Dubin was multifaceted. Mr. Epstein helped broker the sale of Mr. Dubin’s hedge fund to JPMorgan, for which Mr. Epstein received a $15 million fee. Mr. Epstein previously dated Mr. Dubin’s wife, Eva Andersson-Dubin, and was the godfather to the Dubins’ children.\n\nThe suspicious activity report that JPMorgan disclosed on Thursday did not provide details about the transactions involving the Blacks, the Dubins or Mr. Dershowitz.\n\nDevon Spurgeon, a spokeswoman for the Dubins, said the transactions in question were “related to charitable giving, personal gifts or business matters” and unrelated to Mr. Epstein’s crimes.\n\nMr. Dershowitz, who was one of Mr. Epstein’s criminal defense lawyers, said, “The only funds I ever received from Jeffrey Epstein were payments for my legal services based on my hourly rates.”\n\nThe 2019 suspicious activity report also flagged a number of people who worked closely with Mr. Epstein over the years and several of his corporate entities.\n\nA JPMorgan spokeswoman, Patricia A. Wexler, said the documents showed that JPMorgan had repeatedly alerted regulators to red flags surrounding Mr. Epstein by filing suspicious activity reports.\n\n“It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years,” she said.\n\nIn preparing the 2019 suspicious activity report, the bank pulled together every transaction that Mr. Epstein had any involvement with or that had gone through one of his accounts, Ms. Wexler said.\n\nJPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, served Mr. Epstein for more than a decade, a period during which he is believed to have sexually abused some 200 young women and girls, some as young as 14.\n\nThe role of JPMorgan in financing Mr. Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation has drawn new scrutiny after an article in The Times detailed how the bank had repeatedly disregarded red flags about his activities, including frequent large cash withdrawals and other suspicious transactions.\n\nSome lawmakers in Congress have called for hearings into JPMorgan’s role, including demands that Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, answer written questions or testify before a Senate panel.\n\nThe financial records made public on Thursday were produced by JPMorgan during litigation in 2023 that was brought on behalf of victims of Mr. Epstein and by the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he maintained a private island residence that served as a base for most of his financial advisory businesses.\n\nIn 2023, JPMorgan agreed to pay $75 million to the Virgin Islands government to settle the litigation. The bank also paid $290 million to settle the victims’ lawsuit.\n\nJPMorgan has said it regretted its involvement with Mr. Epstein but was not aware of his sexual abuse.\n\nThe unsealed documents include emails in which Mr. Epstein helped to recruit the founders of Google to be JPMorgan clients in the early 2000s. The Times previously reported that one of the founders, Sergey Brin, ultimately put more than $4 billion into a JPMorgan account. The emails also show a JPMorgan executive discussing the potential use of complex trusts to reduce the taxes of Mr. Brin and his co-founder, Larry Page.\n\nA Google representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday night.\n\nThe documents released on Thursday shed little new light on what Mr. Dimon knew about his bank’s relationship with Mr. Epstein. Mr. Dimon has said he was not aware of the bank’s extensive work for him until 2019, though at least one top executive has said under oath that he discussed the Epstein relationship with Mr. Dimon.\n\nMr. Dimon clearly knew by the summer of 2019. On the Saturday in August that Mr. Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell. a JPMorgan employee emailed colleagues with a link to a Times article about his death. That afternoon, an employee forwarded the message to Mr. Dimon.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/trump-officials-military-housing.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:18:43-04:00","title":"Trump Officials Move Into Military Residences in D.C.

Area\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T18:18:43-04:00\n\nQuarters 8 at Fort McNair in Washington, situated along the Anacostia River, has traditionally been the home of the Army’s vice chief of staff. But at the beginning of President Trump’s second term, it was vacant.\n\nThe general promoted to the vice chief’s position had opted to remain on a different base nearby, across the Potomac. That provided an opening for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to claim it.\n\nAs Mr. Hegseth settled into the home, which an Army history notes is guarded by two Revolutionary War-era cannons, other Trump officials also took up residence at housing built and designed for senior admirals and generals in the Washington area.\n\nA handful of White House officials have lived in military housing in the past, but it appears to be unusual for several cabinet members and other officials to move into military quarters in such a short amount of time.\n\nThree former residents of Quarters 8 expressed frustration that a senior officer was not living at the home, which they said would cause a ripple effect and make it more difficult for admirals and generals posted in the area to find affordable housing.\n\n“It’s a great place,” said retired Army Gen. Dennis J. Reimer, who lived in Quarters 8 when he served as the Army’s vice chief of staff in the early 1990s. “It’s like one out of the movies — you have that spiral staircase and you’re right over a riverbank.”\n\nThe trend of Trump administration officials taking over military residences in the region was reported earlier by The Atlantic.\n\nSoon after he was sworn in as secretary of state, Marco Rubio moved in a couple doors down from his Pentagon counterpart. Mr. Rubio lives there mostly alone; his family has opted to stay in Florida, according to a State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, lives in “a government representation facility” owned by the Coast Guard and is “paying fair market rent,” according to Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman.\n\nDaniel P. Driscoll, the Army secretary, has also moved into military housing, as has the Navy secretary, John Phelan, whose home in Washington was damaged in a fire in May, according to a congressional staff member who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, only Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, were known to have lived for a time in military housing.\n\nThere is precedent for an elected official to take over military quarters. In 1974, Congress authorized the vice president to reside at the Naval Observatory, which for 40 years had been the official home of the chief of naval operations. (Since then, the Navy’s top admirals have typically lived in Tingey House, a historic property across town at the Washington Navy Yard.)\n\nAt McNair, the Army vice chief of staff’s residence at Quarters 8 sits in the middle of a row of 15 military homes that have long been assigned to the three-star generals on the Army’s senior staff at the Pentagon, as well as a number of generals commanding the post-Sept. 11 wars.\n\nAccording to a Defense Department official, Mr. Hegseth is paying $4,655.70 per month to live there this year.\n\nGeneral Reimer said that the residence had a brass plaque noting that the Army’s 1980s recruiting slogan — “Be All That You Can Be” — came from one of its previous occupants, Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman. Quarters 8 also had a small gravesite in the yard, he said, where General Thurman buried his dog, who died while he lived there.\n\n“I think the dog’s name was something like Fido,” General Reimer recalled. “The dog’s grave had a marker saying ‘Here lies Fido. He was all he could be.’”\n\nWhen Robert M. Gates was chosen to be President George W. Bush’s defense secretary, he did not own a home in the Washington area. He asked for government housing and moved into an old home near the State Department. Known as Navy Hill and Potomac Annex, the 12-acre site has three residences for admirals.\n\nCongress authorized Mr. Gates to live in the house while paying rent to the Pentagon.\n\nMr. Gates’s successor, Leon Panetta, was offered his predecessor’s home at Navy Hill.\n\n“I went there and checked it out,” Mr. Panetta said in an interview. “But found out that it would cost probably about $3,000 a month.”\n\nWithout his wife joining him, he added, “I certainly would not be entertaining there, so it just didn’t make a lot of sense for me to take the house.”\n\nMr. Panetta took an apartment near Capitol Hill in the same townhouse he had lived in as the director of the C.I.A.\n\nDefense Department officials installed the secure communications lines he needed to discuss sensitive and classified information away from his office.\n\nSecurity guards stood watch outside, even when he was not home.\n\nIf there were increased threats against the senior members of the Trump administration, Mr. Panetta added, the federal government could build new housing for them.\n\nIt is unclear why so many Trump administration officials have sought to live on military bases, but Mr. Panetta and his successor, Chuck Hagel, said that they faced the same kinds of security threats that any defense secretary routinely receives, and felt secure in their homes with Defense Department bodyguards posted outside.\n\nFor national security reasons, it makes sense for three- and four-star generals to live at Fort McNair, which is a short drive away from the Pentagon, Mr. Panetta said.\n\n“Any time there’s an emergency they’ve got to be able to respond quickly to whatever crisis is taking place, so that’s important,” he said. “I think that was part of the reason for having that housing close by.”\n\nMr. Mattis lived in Mr. Gates’s former home at Navy Hill during the two years he served as defense secretary under Mr. Trump. But other Pentagon chiefs, including Chuck Hagel, Mark T. Esper and Lloyd J. Austin III, stayed in the homes they owned in the Washington area, and had similar secure communication rooms installed.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Hagel recalled that it took about three days to set up when he was sworn in, and just a day to remove when he left office.\n\nGovernment employees patched the drywall, repainted and moved on.\n\nHelene Cooper, Eric Schmitt and Michael Crowley contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/30/upshot/obamacare-subsidies-new-prices.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:26:58-04:00","title":"How Much Obamacare Prices Are Rising Across the Country","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article reports that health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) are set to rise significantly in 2026 due to the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies, which were first introduced in 2021 and extended in 2022.

health insurance plans became public this week, with big increases in premiums across the country. We now have data that shows how much more people will pay.\n\nMost people who buy their own coverage don’t pay full price. Tax credits created by the Affordable Care Act help pay the bills. But the new prices reflect what will happen if extra tax subsidies, first passed in 2021 and extended in 2022, are allowed to expire at the end of this year.\n\nFigures are for the median county. Source: KFF estimates\n\nExtending the subsidies would cost the federal government around $23 billion next year and about $350 billion over the next decade, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. Without them, many Americans will face much higher costs before the midterm elections next fall — in some cases increases of more than a thousand dollars per month.\n\nThe magnitude of the change depends on where people live, how old they are, and what they earn. (More details below.)\n\nThis funding is at the heart of the congressional fight that has left the government shut down for nearly a month. Democrats have demanded an extension as a condition of their support for a government funding bill. Republicans have said they won’t consider an extension until the government is reopened.\n\nThe numbers in our charts and maps come from researchers at the health research group KFF, and reflect insurance prices published on healthcare.gov and state websites that allow people to “window shop” before Saturday, when insurance marketplaces will open for business. An earlier version of this article included estimated premiums for insurance next year, but now we can show the real prices Americans are currently facing.\n\nCongress could still act and change the funding structure, but probably not before people start picking health plans this week.\n\nFor people earning the lowest incomes, the expiration of the subsidies will mean the end of free, generous insurance. Right now, with the extra subsidies, eligible Americans who earn less than $24,000 a year don’t have to contribute money toward their premiums, though they still face some co-payments and deductibles when they use their insurance.\n\nA single person earning $22,000, for example, will have to pay $66 a month for a typical plan after the subsidies expire.\n\nAround half of all enrollees in Affordable Care Act marketplaces nationwide will experience increases in this range — from a free premium to one between $27 and $82 a month. This group includes many people close to the poverty line in states that didn’t expand their Medicaid program. Their insurance will remain heavily subsidized, just at the lower level established by the original Affordable Care Act legislation.\n\nAlthough the price difference in dollars may look small, it can mean a lot for people who earn less than $2,000 a month. Since the enhanced subsidies became law, sign-ups in this lowest income group have tripled, with particularly large increases in Texas, Florida and Georgia. Some critics of the subsidies say the numbers have gotten so high that they are concerned about fraud.\n\nPeople who earn a little more — $35,000 a year —are also facing relatively standard price increases around the country. Their cost for a typical plan will more than double without the extra subsidies, from $86 a month to $218 for a popular plan.\n\nAround 40 percent of enrollees earn between $24,000 and $63,000 and will experience increases of this type.\n\nMany older people at this income level will experience a sharp increase in premiums — from a few hundred dollars a month to $1,000 or more.\n\nIn most states, the enhanced subsidies created a ceiling on how much people earning more than $63,000 have to pay. Without the extra subsidies, people will have to pay whatever insurers in their markets charge. People in this group tend to be self-employed or work for small businesses.\n\nBecause insurers are allowed to charge higher prices to older customers than younger ones, subsidies for Americans at this income level make the biggest difference for people close to retirement age. The large increases in the underlying insurance premiums — around 26 percent on average for a typical plan — pile on top of the lost subsidies.\n\nEstimates are for the median county. Figures are rounded. Source: KFF estimates\n\nBut where people live also matters. Premiums tend to be higher in rural areas, and they are particularly high in a handful of very rural states, like Wyoming and West Virginia.\n\nFor some people in the most expensive markets, the increases could be staggering. A 60-year-old living in southern Illinois will face premiums increasing from $460 a month with the subsidies to $2,800 a month without.\n\nFewer than 10 percent of all Obamacare customers earn $65,000 or more.\n\nPeople with even higher incomes have to pay a lot for Obamacare health insurance, with or without the extra subsidies.\n\nEstimates are for the median county. Source: KFF estimates\n\nMany younger people who earn this much haven’t seen any benefit from the extra subsidies. The subsidies kick in only when the cost of insurance is more than 8.5 percent of their income, which comes up only in the most expensive markets.\n\nBut some older people with high incomes do save money with the extra subsidies. Without them, they will pay even more than they already do.\n\nThis group is also affected by rising premiums. Even though the subsidies didn’t help many of them this year, they still paid lower premiums than insurers are offering in most markets for next year.\n\nOur charts and maps focus on how subsidies affect individuals buying insurance. The math is a bit more complicated for people who are buying insurance for their whole family. But the basic patterns are similar: Families at lower incomes would face more uniform increases, while families at higher incomes would see variable price increases, depending on where they live and the age of each family member.\n\nYou can estimate your personal household costs with and without the subsidies using this calculator from KFF.\n\nThe numbers in our analysis come from researchers at the health research group KFF and are calculated using insurance premiums published on healthcare.gov and state insurance marketplaces as part of “window shopping” for the 2026 plan year. An earlier version of this article was published using estimated price increases for 2026, and showed similar though not identical numbers.\n\nConsumer costs are calculated based on the price of the “benchmark” silver plan in each market, the second-least expensive plan that covers around 70 percent of the average enrollee’s medical costs. Individual consumers may pay more or less if they choose other plans in the market. Calculations account only for federal tax credits and do not include additional state subsidies, available for some consumers in several states.\n\nIn a handful of states, people earning $22,000 won't be immediately affected by subsidy changes because they qualify for different low-cost state insurance programs: Medicaid in Alaska, Hawaii and the District of Columbia; and the basic health plan in Minnesota, Oregon and New York (the basic health plan is Medicaid-like coverage with low premiums for a sliver of low-income Americans in certain states). New York residents earning $35,000 also currently qualify for the basic health plan.\n\nThe federal poverty level is higher in Alaska and Hawaii than in other states, which means the top income cutoff for subsidies in those states is higher than $63,000. That difference explains small differences in the average prices for people at $65,000 and $95,000 in income.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/hurricane-melissa-jamaica.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:34:42-04:00","title":"Amid Flattened Homes, Jamaica Starts to Assess Hurricane Melissa’s Damage","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded, devastated Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti in early October 2025.

Amid Flattened Homes, Jamaica Starts to Assess Hurricane Melissa’s Damage\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T19:34:42-04:00\n\nThe storm flattened and flooded seaside communities, leaving piles of brick, wood and twisted metal. Floodwaters gouged asphalt roads and knocked cars into muddy pits. An elementary school still stood, days later, but roaring winds had sheared the roof off and sent beams splintering onto the desks below.\n\nAs Jamaica worked on Thursday to assess the damage from Hurricane Melissa, it faced a long and daunting road to recovery, particularly in the western part of the country. That region was hardest hit by the hurricane, among the strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic, and the memory of the 185 mile-per-hour winds and surging floodwaters was still vivid in residents’ minds.\n\nColeridge Minto, the police superintendent in St. Elizabeth Parish, said he had holed up with about three dozen people at the police station in Black River, a town devastated by the hurricane. He recalled their fear “to listen to the whistle of the wind and observe the vehicles just moving, like swimming in a river.”\n\n“We literally watched some buildings crumble in front of us,” he added.\n\nThe hurricane killed at least 19 people in Jamaica, and at least 30, including children, in Haiti, officials said. Another 20 people were missing and around 20 were injured in Haiti, said Emmanuel Pierre, the director general of the country’s Civil Protection Office.\n\nThe storm also flooded cities and towns in eastern Cuba, leaving behind ruined homes and tangled electrical wires. About 2 million Cubans, or roughly a fifth of the country’s population, were in urgent need of shelter, food, water and health care because of the storm, the U.N.’s resident coordinator for Cuba, Francisco Pichón, said on Thursday.\n\nJamaican authorities were not able to provide “a proper update on the number of deaths so far” because they had not confirmed them all, Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister leading the emergency response, said on Thursday. But he said he expected the toll to rise, as the Jamaican military dispatched a helicopter to recover bodies.\n\nJamaican officials called St. Elizabeth, the southwestern parish where the hurricane made landfall on Tuesday, ground zero of the disaster. A courthouse, library, churches and other historic buildings had been reduced to rubble in the parish capital, Black River, which was decimated.\n\nThe town has long been known as the spot where the Black River meets the sea, and was once a key port where enslaved people packed sugar and rum onto ships. In recent years, it was known as a beloved spot for crocodile safaris or calm holidays at the Waterloo Guest House, which is said to have been the first private home in Jamaica lit by electricity.\n\nBut on Thursday, Black River was now unrecognizable to the people who knew it best.\n\nThe Waterloo Guest House was “just a pile of wood,” said Amiri Bradley, who was visiting the town. Boulders littered the coastline, and a cellphone tower had twisted into a semicircle. The hospital and fire station had either been destroyed or severely damaged, said the mayor, Richard Solomon. Emergency supplies were wiped out when a container carrying them was overturned by floodwaters.\n\nAlong the main street in Black River, supermarkets, furniture stores and other buildings were gone — “all of them, every single one of them,” Superintendent Minto said.\n\n“The area is totally flat,” he said. “There is severe damage to infrastructure, almost all buildings, private properties as well as government buildings were severely damaged — in some cases totally demolished, or 80 to 90 percent damaged.”\n\nMany of the people who took shelter at the Black River police station were neighbors who had nowhere else to go as the floodwaters rose, Superintendent Minto said.\n\n“As their houses started to crumble, they made their way to the station, and that included children,” he said. “It was dangerous, but they took the risk.”\n\nAcross Jamaica, more than 170 communities have been “moderately or severely affected” by flooding or landslides, Mr. McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister leading the emergency response, said on Thursday. Most of them were in the parishes of Manchester, St. Elizabeth, St. James, Trelawny and Westmoreland, he added.\n\nAbout 13,000 people were still in shelters on Thursday, although the number has gone down as many have gone back home, Mr. McKenzie said. He added it had been difficult to assess shelter occupancy in the most devastated parishes because “the communication is very difficult.” More than 400,000 Jamaicans were still without power on Thursday, officials said.\n\nThe Jamaican government said it was it was working with aid groups and others to secure and distribute food and medications to the hardest-hit regions. A “giant working group” will look at how to distribute more than 200,000 aid packages over the next few weeks, Matthew Samuda, the country’s minister of water, environment and climate change, told reporters.\n\nBritain, France and several of Jamaica’s Caribbean neighbors have pledged assistance. The United States was also prepared to provide aid “directly and via local partners who can most effectively deliver it to those in need,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.\n\nHe noted that U.S. law, which forbids nearly all commerce with Cuba, includes “exemptions and authorizations relating to private donations of food, medicine, and other humanitarian goods to Cuba, as well as disaster response.”\n\nCuba’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, Fernández de Cossio, indicated on social media that the country might be willing to accept U.S. assistance. “We have contacted the State Department and we are waiting for clarification on how and in what manner they are willing to help,” he wrote.\n\nIn Bayamo, Cuba, where the hurricane lifted metal roofs off homes or destroyed them entirely, Diana Iglesias, 50, was among the volunteers helping to clean up on Thursday. Her eldest son, she said, was cooking ham and spaghetti for lunch for about 100 people whose homes had flooded when the Bayamo River spilled over its banks.\n\n“Cubans living abroad send donations,” she said. “Everybody does what they can. We help each other.”\n\nReporting was contributed by Michael Crowley, Andre Paulte, Camille Williams and Anushka Patil.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/orlando-air-traffic-control-airports-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"22:12:15-04:00","title":"Air Controller Shortage Causes Delays in Orlando and at Other Major Airports","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Widespread air traffic controller shortages, exacerbated by a government shutdown and preexisting staffing gaps, caused significant delays and temporary flight suspensions at major U.S. airports including Orlando International, John F.

Kennedy International Airport in New York City entered a ground stop for certain flights because of insufficient air traffic staffing, capping a day of delays and suspended operations because of storms and an aircraft emergency. And controller shortages at Ronald Reagan National Airport, outside Washington, caused delays through the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe delays and their ripple effects along the East Coast followed a warning that Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had issued hours before of impending “disaster” if the government shutdown continued into November. The holiday travel season and the worsening winter weather, they argued, would increase the demands on air traffic controllers just as working without pay could become untenable.\n\n“A lot of our people can go through the miss of one paycheck,” Mr. Duffy told reporters outside the White House, following a meeting Mr. Vance hosted with industry executives. “None of them can get through two paychecks.”\n\nControllers, whose first payday without pay was Tuesday, were already overtaxed before the shutdown, as many worked overtime shifts to compensate for the around 3,000 vacant jobs in a 14,000-position work force. That preexisting staffing crunch meant that many air traffic facilities did not have enough staffing to accommodate surprise absences, whether or not they were caused by the shutdown.\n\nMr. Duffy has argued that the air travel delays are evidence that it is still safe to fly, explaining that it shows the F.A.A. is responding to so-called “staffing triggers” by managing air traffic to ensure no facility takes on a greater workload than its controllers can handle.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/dining/little-treat-reader-callout.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"11:39:25-04:00","title":"We Want to Know: What Are Your Favorite Little Treats in New York City?","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article invites readers to share their favorite affordable, on-the-spot food experiences in New York City that cost $20 or less and do not require a reservation.

Sudden Downpour Hits New York Area\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T21:34:26-04:00\n\nTwo men died on Thursday when storm water inundated basements in Brooklyn and Manhattan, as sudden heavy, record-setting rains brought flash flooding to the New York area, the police said.\n\nOne man, 39, had become trapped when he went back to his basement in the Flatbush neighborhood to rescue one of his dogs, a neighbor said. A diver pulled him out, a Fire Department spokesman said. He was taken by ambulance to Kings County Hospital, where he died. Officials did not confirm whether his death was caused by flooding.\n\nThe other man, aged 43, was found in a flooded basement boiler room of a building in Washington Heights in Manhattan. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The police did not confirm the names of either man on Thursday night.\n\nThe deaths in Brooklyn and Manhattan came as between one and three inches of rain fell across the tristate area on Thursday, according to Dominic Ramunni, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The downpour broke three daily rainfall records across the metropolitan area. LaGuardia Airport recorded over two inches today, with Newark Liberty International Airport and Central Park reporting 1.9 and 1.8 inches, respectively.\n\nThe rain had been predicted to fall over a period of eight hours. Instead, much of it arrived in an intense, 20-minute downpour that began at about 3:50 p.m., said Aries Dela Cruz, a spokesman for the city’s Emergency Management agency.\n\nThe deluge fell in the midst of a drought, which had left piles of fallen leaves and trash on the streets and sidewalks. The rain swept the detritus toward sewer drains, many of which became clogged.\n\nThe worst of the flooding happened between 3 and 5 p.m., according to FloodNet, an organization that monitors more than 250 flood sensors across the city. The hardest-hit areas were Flatbush and Hollis, Queens, where there were several fatalities in 2021 after the remnants of Hurricane Ida came through. Both neighborhoods experienced floodwaters that were nearly two feet deep. Bushwick, in Brooklyn, and parts of East Flushing, in Queens, were also hard hit.\n\nThe rainstorm was torrential in places. Cars were stuck in floodwaters on city streets, a spokesman for the Fire Department said, and some floated away. Flooding forced the closing of the Long Island Expressway at Springfield Boulevard in Queens in both directions, and downed trees were reported around the city.\n\nThere were scattered subway delays because of water intrusion from the street, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The Long Island Rail Road experienced minor delays.\n\nMetro-North was not affected by flooding, although downed trees caused some delays.  NJ Transit reported delays of up to 30 minutes on rail lines because of high water near Newark Airport.\n\nAmtrak temporarily paused train service around 4 p.m. at Newark Airport because of flooding, a spokeswoman said. And regional and Acela services were delayed when a tree fell in Branford, Conn. Trains are moving again in the Northeast Corridor, she added, although there are some residual delays throughout the network.\n\nRenée Phillips, who lives next door to the man who died in Brooklyn, said he had rescued one of his dogs from the flooded basement and had then gone back to retrieve his other dog. He became trapped, she said, and both the man and his dog died.\n\n“This day has been horrific,” Ms. Phillips said.\n\nIn other parts of the borough, the rain was a nuisance but not life-threatening. Kelly Hayes, a co-owner of the Gowanus Gardens restaurant on Fourth Avenue near Carroll Street on the Park Slope-Gowanus border, a notorious flooding spot, said she had developed a routine response to downpours. As she always does, she began to pay close attention Thursday afternoon to FloodNet.\n\nThe first indication that this storm might bring flooding were the gauges near Prospect Park, which recorded a sharp increase in rain at around 4 p.m., Ms. Hayes said. Within minutes, the water had flowed downhill to Fourth Avenue, where it covered the sidewalk. The water poured into the basement, overflowing the restaurant’s grease trap.\n\n“We got a nice layer of slime all over our basement,” Ms. Hayes said. “It’s disgusting.”\n\nIn Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Andy Franklin brought his daughter to Awa Hair Braiding on Tompkins Avenue, where she wanted to get pink synthetic hair braided into her own. Awa had no pink hair in stock, so Mr. Franklin walked to another store nearby. When he returned about 10 minutes later, he found two cars floating down Tompkins Avenue in four feet of water.\n\nThe owners of Awa Hair Braiding had closed the metal security door to the shop to try to keep out the water. That meant the customers were trapped inside.\n\n“I wanted my daughter out,” said Mr. Franklin, 35. As the downpour eased, the salon’s workers opened the gate, and Mr. Franklin retrieved his daughter.\n\nThe flooding was exacerbated by blocked sewer drains, said Leandro Fernandez, manager of the Alejandro Deli Grocery, which sits across the street from Awa Hair Braiding. Mr. Fernandez and a co-worker poked the drains with broom handles, which eventually succeeded in clearing them.\n\nSimilar work happened in the store’s basement, where an employee named Peter Putter stood for two hours in knee-deep water to clear a drain by hand. At 8 p.m., police officers and workers from the city’s Department of Environmental Protection were on the block, shoveling debris away from storm drains, Mr. Franklin said.\n\nThe storm left 1,500 residents without electricity, said a spokeswoman with the Emergency Management agency. Thunderstorms and low cloud ceilings caused arrival and departure delays at all three of the region’s major airports.\n\nFlooding affected the entire region. In Bayonne, N.J., the police responded to cars trapped by water in underpasses around the city, said Edoardo Ferrante, coordinator of Bayonne’s Office of Emergency Management. In one incident that was recorded and posted to X, an S.U.V. became trapped under an overpass. A firefighter waded into the water, retrieved a 4-year-old-girl from the vehicle and helped the girl’s mother escape.\n\nAlthough the rain has left the region, a wind advisory remains in place through Friday evening, with gusts up to 50 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nMaria Cramer, Sean Piccoli and Chelsia Rose Marcius contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/ohio-redistricting-deal.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:38:38-04:00","title":"Ohio Republicans Gain Ground in Push for More Seats in Congress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ohio Republicans are pushing to redraw the state’s congressional map to secure more seats in the upcoming midterm elections, aiming to increase their control of the House of Representatives.

its congressional map to boost the party’s chances of keeping control of the House of Representative in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nRepublicans, who currently hold 10 of Ohio’s 15 seats in Congress, appeared to have struck an 11th-hour deal with Democrats that would give the Republican Party much — but not all — of what it wanted: an electoral map that tilts red in 12 of the state’s 15

The map is expected to be approved Friday morning by the Ohio Redistricting Commission, the last day it can approve a map before state law requires the issue to be kicked back to the Legislature.\n\nThe map was presented on Thursday afternoon at a hastily called commission meeting, during which members of the commission offered no response to more than a dozen speakers who excoriated both Republicans and Democrats  for backroom dealing that produced a map they considered rigged.\n\n“You are like foxes guarding the hen houses and Ohio voters continue to be the hens,” said Michael Ahern, who spoke to the commission wearing a baseball cap bearing the first three words of the Constitution, “We The People.” The meeting took place without Gov.

2025-10-30T16:54:45-04:00\n\nAmazon reported unexpectedly strong sales and profit on Thursday across both its consumer and its cloud businesses, and said another robust quarter might be ahead.\n\nThe company’s sales totaled $180.2 billion from July through September, up 13 percent from a year earlier. Profit was $21.2 billion, up 38 percent. The overall results were buoyed by the enduring strength of consumer spending online, despite tariffs and an uneven economy, and by a resurgence in cloud computing.\n\n“We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as A.I. drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business,” Andy Jassy, the chief executive, said in a statement. He added that the company’s cloud services business had grown at its fastest pace since 2022.\n\nThe strong quarter, which beat analysts’ expectations, sent Amazon’s stock soaring more than 10 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nAmazon had previously warned investors to brace for an uncertain quarter, particularly regarding how much its costs might grow.\n\nMore than anything, investors have been nervous about Amazon’s cloud computing division, which has long been its primary source of profits. Amazon invented the business of cloud computing and was long the dominant player. But in 2022, ChatGPT was introduced by OpenAI, which built and operated the artificial intelligence chatbot on Microsoft’s services, and Amazon was widely viewed as being caught flat-footed. Google, Microsoft and Meta raced to find ways to develop and use A.I. systems.\n\nAmazon has made large investments, too, but after years of hovering around a third of the cloud computing market, its share slipped to 30 percent in the first half of this year, according to Synergy Research Group.\n\nAmazon “has done remarkably well” given how competitors have aggressively pursued its lead, said John Dinsdale, the research director at Synergy.\n\nMany investors were eyeing whether Amazon could stop or even reverse that trend.\n\nOn Thursday, Amazon reported that the growth of its cloud division had picked up speed, with sales of $33 billion, up 20 percent from a year earlier. While still slower than its peers, it offered a brighter outlook.\n\nAmazon spent more than $34 billion on capital expenditures in the quarter, in large part to set up data centers that power cloud computing and A.I. That sets it well on the path to meet investor expectations that capital expenditures will top $120 billion for the year.\n\nDespite all the building, the company has not had enough data centers up and operating to meet customer demand, depressing sales.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley recently wrote that Amazon needed to quickly get more data center capacity online to no longer be considered a “loser” in the era of generative A.I.\n\nAmazon attributed $9.5 billion in profit to the value of its investment in the A.I. start-up Anthropic, which has become a flagship customer of its cloud computing.\n\nAmazon’s retail business has generally weathered the frequent whiplash of President Trump’s tariffs better than investors initially feared. The company and the sellers on its marketplace stocked up on inventory in the United States before the new duties, a move that Amazon said had provided some insulation against them.\n\nThe number of items that Amazon sold in the quarter grew 11 percent, a sign that consumers were not pulling back drastically. Its advertising business, which largely promotes products to customers on its site, remained strong, with $17.7 billion in sales.\n\nThe company has been aggressively looking to do more with less. This week it announced that it was laying off 14,000 corporate employees. And The New York Times reported last week that Amazon’s automation team had ambitious goals to use robotics to avoid hiring more than half a million workers by 2033.\n\nThe company had 1.58 million employees, up slightly from a year earlier.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/world/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-disaster-preparedness-finances.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"21:17:54-04:00","title":"Jamaica Prepared a Financial Fortress for Disaster.

Hurricane Melissa Will Test It.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T21:17:54-04:00\n\nHurricane Melissa was among the worst-case scenarios Jamaica could have imagined. The storm’s winds flattened crop fields, homes and businesses. Its rains washed away trees, roads and cars.\n\nAnd yet, the Caribbean island appears surprisingly well-placed to weather at least the financial cost of the damages.\n\nIn recent years, Jamaica has created a multilayered financial plan to respond to natural disasters. The strategy, which analysts say is uncommonly sophisticated, means the government has an arsenal of financial reserves and other tools ready to deploy, with each designed to handle a different level of disaster.\n\n“We can’t prevent the storms and hurricanes that come at us,” Fayval Williams, the country’s finance minister, said at a news conference on Thursday. “But one thing this government can be credited with is putting together a robust national natural disaster risk financing policy.”\n\nThis year, the various tools should amount to about $820 million, Ms. Williams said in June.\n\nJamaicans typically don’t carry much in the way of property insurance. But with 82 percent of the country’s population living within a few miles from the coast, according to the World Bank, and most industries and services located in flood-prone areas, extreme weather poses immense risks to Jamaicans and their economy. So designing a plan to increase government spending after a natural disaster, analysts say, was needed to keep the economy going.\n\nKeenan Falconer, a Jamaican economist who previously worked as an analyst for the country’s finance ministry, said that during past crises, the government’s hands were tied. The first response would be to rearrange the budget to fund relief efforts.\n\n“What that inevitably means is that development is interrupted,” Mr. Falconer said. “The school or hospital that you were planning to build cannot be built because you have to put the fiscal resources elsewhere.”\n\nThe first line of defense in Jamaica’s multilayered financial fortress includes national disaster and contingency funds, pools of money the government has already funded and can be used to pay for immediate needs, like creating shelters and buying emergency supplies.\n\nThe next layers would involve making claims against a Caribbean insurance pool and activating preapproved loans from international organizations like the World Bank. A $150-million catastrophe bond — a financial tool that essentially transfers the risk from Jamaican taxpayers to global investors — is the top layer, reserved for the most catastrophic events.\n\n“If the layers are exhausted,” Ms. Williams told reporters, “we can continue to the next layer.”\n\nThe catastrophe bond has a high bar, and is set with such precision regarding a storm’s intensity and geographic position that Jamaica was disappointed to learn last year that Hurricane Beryl did not trigger the fund when it passed close by the southern coast as a Category 4 storm. At the time, the storm caused an estimated $995 million in damages, including widespread crop losses in St. Elizabeth parish, the country’s breadbasket, where Melissa made landfall.\n\nBut Melissa appears more likely to surpass those stiff requirements.\n\n“Hurricane Melissa will be the true test of whether or not Jamaica insured itself by being fiscally responsible,” said Mikol Mortley, a Jamaican economist and financial analyst. “But one thing I know for certain is that we are better off today than we were last year with Beryl, in 2004 with Ivan and in 1988 with Gilbert.”\n\nBut with some analysts and disaster modelers estimating that the economic losses in Jamaica could reach between $2 billion and $8 billion, representing potentially about a third of the country’s gross domestic product, some fear that even Jamaica’s sophisticated scheme will be overwhelmed.\n\nIt would be impossible for the disaster risk financing tools to finance all reconstruction, analysts said, as they are only designed to get the economy back on its feet and fund emergency repairs — key bridges, hospital roofs, major roads, school buildings.\n\n“Disaster risk financing proceeds cannot solve every problem,” said Mr. Falconer, but it improves the government’s capacity “to respond to affected citizens.”\n\nLong-term reconstruction is expected to be financed mainly by internal resources over time, but Ms. Williams, the finance minister, said Jamaica will also look for international aid.\n\nThe latest storm may also put pressure on Jamaica’s economy. About a decade ago, the country was one of the world’s most indebted nations. Since then, a painful fiscal discipline program has put the country on more stable financial footing.\n\n“We were expected to hit our debt-to-G.D.P. target this year,” said Mr. Mortley. “Will this place that out of alignment? We don’t know.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/newsom-california-proposition-50-presidential.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:43:32-04:00","title":"Newsom Turns a California Election Into a National Platform","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Governor Gavin Newsom has transformed a California redistricting campaign into a national political movement by mobilizing over $38 million in small donations from across the U.S., including donors from Iowa, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Chicago, and New Hampshire.

Election Into a National Platform\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T16:43:32-04:00\n\nIn Iowa, a retired math teacher clicked a link in a text message and donated $35. A school secretary in Las Vegas pitched in $50. An interior designer in Pennsylvania, an insurance agent in Chicago and a ski instructor in New Hampshire each gave $100.\n\nTheir small donations all went to California to help Gov. Gavin Newsom try to flip five congressional seats for Democrats.\n\n“I’m so disenchanted with the direction of this country today that I have to support the people that are standing up for democracy,” said Amy Kaufman, the ski instructor. “And Gavin Newsom is one of them.”\n\nResponding to email and text message appeals, small donors from across the country gave Mr. Newsom a combined $38 million for a ballot measure intended to stop President Trump and Republicans from retaining complete control of the federal government in 2026.\n\nNearly half of donors who cumulatively gave at least $100 came from outside of California. In multiple interviews, these donors said they gave to Mr. Newsom because they saw him as one of the few Democrats fighting Republicans on their own terms. After President Trump asked leaders in Texas and other red states to pursue rare, mid-decade gerrymandering to offset potential midterm losses for Republicans, California is the closest of any Democrat-led state to striking back so far.\n\nPolls suggest that California voters are very likely to pass Mr. Newsom’s redistricting measure on Tuesday, a win that could serve as the ultimate foundation for a 2028 presidential run that he is considering. If he runs, he could tell voters that he directly fought back against Mr. Trump in the midterms.\n\nAnd he would emerge with a national list of donors and supporters that few other Democratic hopefuls have at the moment.\n\nThe list began more than 25 years ago, when Mr. Newsom was a wine entrepreneur just getting his footing as a politician. Mr. Newsom said in an interview that he started building an email list of donors when he was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and wanted to gather support for a bond measure to fund parks.\n\n“I started going, ‘Oh, emails, that’s interesting and novel,” he recalled. “‘I should use these.’”\n\nFrom there, he took a methodical approach to building his list, gathering more names and emails every time he ran for another office or put an initiative on the ballot. The list includes names that Mr. Newsom has collected organically, as well as those in databases he has purchased.\n\nThe project accelerated in 2021 when Republicans tried to recall Mr. Newsom and he reached out to Democrats across the country for support. Then, in 2023, Mr. Newsom created a political action committee to support Democrats in Republican-controlled states — giving him a reason to collect more names and emails from beyond California.\n\nBuilding the list had become a discipline. Mr. Newsom called the list “huge” but declined to say an exact number. He now calls the list “the most valuable asset” of his political career.\n\n“It’s a very deliberative investment,” Mr. Newsom said. “It’s a lot of resources. It’s a lot of time and a lot of iteration.”\n\nAlong the way, Mr. Newsom picked up contact info for Steven Lamansky, a retired high school math teacher in Ankeny, Iowa, just north of Des Moines. Mr. Lamansky sent his first $35 donation to the Proposition 50 campaign on Aug. 10 after receiving a text message pitch from Mr. Newsom’s campaign. Two weeks later, he sent another $35. The next month, $35 more.\n\nMr. Lamansky, 77, said he donated because he wanted to counter gerrymandering in Republican-led states and help Democrats to take back the House next year. But he also pitched in specifically to boost Mr. Newsom.\n\n“I find him a very dynamic person,” Mr. Lamansky said. “Every time I’ve heard him on different shows, he’s really got his ducks in a row. He knows his facts. I really like him, and I’d like to see him run for president.”\n\nMr. Newsom has curated his national image, just as he has his supporter list. He has gone on Fox News to attack Republicans, including a face-off with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida in 2023 that was billed as “The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate.” He started the podcast “This Is Gavin Newsom” this year, turning heads when he asked conservatives like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon why the Democrats failed in 2024.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump sent National Guard troops to Southern California in June during immigration raids and protests, Mr. Newsom returned to his place as a chief antagonist of the Republican president. One night, with troops in Los Angeles, he gave a speech on national television warning Americans that “democracy is under assault right before our eyes.”\n\nThis summer, Mr. Newsom used a more experimental communication strategy. With help from his young staff, Mr. Newsom adopted an aggressively satirical voice mocking Mr. Trump on social media. And he began appearing on platforms that cater to young, male audiences — a cohort that Democrats lost ground with in last year’s election.\n\nBetween banter about sports and video games, the governor has slipped in pleas for his redistricting measure into the “All the Smoke” podcast, which is hosted by two retired N.B.A. players, and a livestreamed game of Fortnite with a Twitch streamer known as ConnorEatsPants.\n\nRepublicans have struggled to counter Mr. Newsom on Proposition 50, in part because of the governor’s fund-raising prowess, but also because he was so effective in making the race a referendum on Mr. Trump in a Democratic state. They lacked a central figure or message around which to build a groundswell of opposition.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Kiley, a California Republican who would become immediately vulnerable if Proposition 50 passes, has spent years challenging Mr. Newsom, including during the 2023 recall when he ran as a candidate for governor.\n\nMr. Kiley has been a lonely voice in Washington calling for a national prohibition on mid-decade redistricting. He said the ballot measure seemed to be serving as a “launching pad” for Mr. Newsom’s 2028 aspirations.\n\n“His entire governorship,” Mr. Kiley said, “he has treated as a warm-up to running for president.”\n\nMr. Newsom’s efforts have resonated with Democratic voters beyond California, as he has climbed to the top of several Democratic presidential primary polls in the months since he began the redistricting campaign.\n\nIt is, of course, too early to anoint any contender, let alone Mr. Newsom. The California governor could struggle in many states to overcome his reputation as a liberal coastal elite, an image that Democrats are desperately trying to shed at the moment.\n\nThough Mr. Newsom is getting a lot of traction with the Democratic activist base, it does not mean he will win a primary three years from now, said Mike Murphy, a former adviser to Republican presidential candidates who supported Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020 and Kamala Harris last year instead of Mr. Trump.\n\n“He’s got a flashy thing of the moment,” Mr. Murphy said. “In the 100 steps to the nomination, it doesn’t hurt him. I just think you can overrate it.”\n\nMatt Bennett, a Democratic strategist who worked on campaigns for former President Bill Clinton, said that Mr. Newsom may also have a hard time running a presidential campaign because of a perception nationally that California is a troubled state.\n\n“What he can do is run on his aggressive efforts to take on Trump and MAGA in various ways,” Mr. Bennett said, adding that the redistricting measure would be “the most important and prominent of them.”\n\nSteven Rich contributed data analysis, and Shane Goldmacher contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/business/apple-earnings.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:28:45-04:00","title":"Apple’s iPhones Fuel Record Sales and Profit","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Apple reported record quarterly revenue and profit in Q3 2025, reaching $102.5 billion in total revenue and $27.5 billion in profit, driven by a $100 price increase on popular iPhones and demand for redesigned models like the iPhone Air and iPhone Pro.

Profit rose 86 percent to $27.5 billion, after its net income was hit a year ago by a tax payment.\n\nIn September, Apple gave customers a reason to buy its newest iPhones by changing their external design. It unveiled a thinner and smaller model called the iPhone Air and overhauled the iPhone Pro to feature a raised bump across its back. The changes helped drive iPhone sales to $49 billion in the quarter, up 6 percent from last year.\n\nThe results topped expectations. Wall Street analysts had predicted quarterly sales of $101.52 billion and profit of $26.34 billion. Apple’s shares rose more than 4 percent in after-hours trading, after it projected total revenue in the current quarter to increase 10 percent to 12 percent.\n\nThe performance was marred by business in China, where sales fell 3.6 percent to $14.5 billion. But Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said Chinese customers wanted more iPhone 17 models than the company was able to produce. He expected sales in China to increase in the current quarter.\n\n“I couldn’t be more pleased with how things are going there,” Mr. Cook said.\n\nThe iPhone’s popularity has helped the company continue to wring more money out of users from apps and services like Apple Pay and Google, which pays it about $20 billion annually to automatically fulfill search queries on Apple devices. Services revenue rose 15 percent to $28.8 billion.\n\nLast month, Apple caught a break when a federal judge ruled that Google, which had been found to be an internet search monopoly, could continue paying to automatically fulfill search queries on iPhones. The ruling meant that Apple could continue collecting payments from Google, and also opened the door for it to charge A.I. companies to reach iPhone customers.\n\nThomas G. Plumb, president of Wisconsin Capital Management, said that the Google ruling and iPhone 17 had “been a pleasant surprise.” But he added: “They have to show they have a plan to move the needle for the next few years with A.I.”\n\nApple has largely avoided the artificial intelligence arms race. It is not pouring billions of dollars into data centers, developing expensive A.I. systems or building its own chatbot. It canceled a plan to release a more personalized version of its virtual assistant, Siri, saying the A.I. product it was developing did not meet its quality standards and needed improvement. Mr. Cook said the product will be released next year.\n\nThose stumbles have weighed on Apple’s stock. Shares of Google and Microsoft have soared more than 25 percent this year, but Apple’s share price has risen a more modest 11 percent.\n\nThis week, the company reached a value of $4 trillion. That was overshadowed on Wednesday when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable public company and dominant provider of A.I. chips, became the first company to be valued at more than $5 trillion.\n\nApple posted mixed results from its other main businesses. Mac sales rose 13 percent to $8.7 billion, but sales of iPads and wearables like the Apple Watch were flat.\n\nPresident Trump’s trade policy continues to give Apple headaches. The company makes almost all of its products abroad; many of its iPhones are made in China, which has a higher tariff rate than other countries.\n\nThough Apple has been producing more iPhones for the United States in India, it paid about $1.1 billion in tariffs in the September quarter. It expects the costs of tariffs to rise to $1.4 billion in the current quarter, even after Mr. Trump agreed this week to reduce tariffs on China to 10 percent from 20 percent.\n\nApple has promised to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, but has not committed to manufacturing any of its products in the country.\n\nIn August, Mr. Cook visited the White House and presented Mr. Trump with a 24-karat gold plaque. He also lavished the president with praise and committed to buy more semiconductors manufactured in America.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-prison.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:35:11-04:00","title":"Sean Combs Transferred to Federal Prison in New Jersey","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy or Diddy, has been transferred to the federal correctional facility at Fort Dix, New Jersey, following a 50-month prison sentence for two counts of transporting women to engage in prostitution.

to 50 months — four years and two months — in prison for two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. In July, a jury in New York had acquitted him of two more serious charges, sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.\n\nAccounting for time he has already served in detention since his arrest in September 2024, at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, known as M.D.C., Mr. Combs should be eligible for release in 2028.\n\nProsecutors had accused Mr. Combs, known as Puff Daddy or Diddy, of coercing two former girlfriends to participate in drug-fueled sex sessions with hired male prostitutes; the eight-week trial included grueling testimony from those women, Casandra Ventura and another who testified under the pseudonym Jane.\n\nAfter his sentencing on Oct. 3, Mr. Combs’s lawyers asked the judge overseeing the case, Arun Subramanian, to recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that Mr. Combs be sent to Fort Dix, “in order to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts.”\n\nIn his judgment order, the judge did not specify Fort Dix but asked the prison bureau to transfer Mr. Combs “as close as possible to the New York metropolitan area,” and recommended that he be considered for “any available substance abuse program, including the Bureau of Prisons’ Residential Drug Abuse Program.”\n\nIn legal filings submitted before his sentencing, Mr. Combs’s legal team said that he had used his time at M.D.C. to become sober “for the first time in 25 years,” and that he had led an informal six-week educational program for other inmates known as “Free Game With Diddy,” designed to “equip participants with essential skills in business management, entrepreneurship and personal development.”\n\nAt his sentencing, Mr. Combs begged Judge Subramanian for leniency, and portrayed himself as a changed man. The judge recognized how Mr. Combs’s success in music and his philanthropy have been an inspiration to many.\n\nBut the judge said the trial record showed that the women had been coerced, and he added: “A history of good works can’t wash away the record in this case, which showed that you abused the power and control that you had over the lives of women you professed to love dearly. You abused them physically, emotionally, and psychologically.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/trump-democrats-boat-strikes.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:13:37-04:00","title":"Democrats Condemn Trump Administration for Secrecy on Boat Strikes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has faced mounting criticism from Democratic lawmakers for its refusal to disclose the legal justification for military strikes targeting suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.

The U.S. military strikes have killed at least 61 people since early September.\n\nVisibly agitated, Mr. Warner said that the Republicans-only meeting was a violation of a law requiring bipartisan briefings of congressional leaders on national security matters.\n\n“When an administration decides it can pick and choose which elected representatives get the understanding of their legal argument of why this is needed for military force and only chooses a particular party, it ignores all the checks and balances,” he said.\n\nOn other side of the Capitol, military legal experts had been scheduled to testify in a closed-door bipartisan briefing for the House. But the Trump administration decided not to send them.\n\n“They didn’t even show up with the lawyers,” said Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, after the meeting.\n\nHe said that without the Defense Department’s legal advisers, lawmakers on the House Armed Services Committee were unable to obtain an explanation of the legal basis for the military strikes.\n\n“They just said that they can’t answer these questions because the lawyers aren’t here,” he said.\n\nA senior Trump administration official, discussing the strikes on the condition of anonymity, said the administration had been far more forthcoming on their legal rationale than the Obama administration had been when it conducted covert drone strikes against terrorist targets.\n\nA White House spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said the Democratic complaints were “bogus” and an effort to distract from the government shutdown.\n\n“The Department of War has held nine bipartisan briefings on narco-terrorist strikes, with additional bipartisan briefings scheduled, and individually works through requests from the Hill,” Ms. Kelly said.\n\nThe House briefing was led by Rear Adm. Brian H. Bennett, a military officer overseeing Special Operations for the Pentagon’s Joint Staff. Mr. Moulton said he gave him a lecture.\n\n“The last word that I gave to the admiral is, ‘I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in, and the peril you are putting our troops in,’” he said.\n\nRepresentative Sara Jacobs, Democrat of California, said the Pentagon officials conceded that the administration did not know the identities of all of the individuals who were killed in the strikes.\n\n“They said that they do not need to positively identify individuals on the vessel to do the strikes,” she said.\n\nThe Trump administration has designated a number of cartels as terrorist organizations and asserted that gives the military the power to target boats trafficking drugs, though experts have questioned that authority.\n\nMs. Jacobs said Pentagon officials said they needed to prove only that the targeted people were connected to designated terrorist organizations, even if the connection is “as much as three hops away from a known member” of a designated terrorist organization.\n\nThe people who have survived the strikes have been sent to other countries and released. None have been taken into American custody.\n\n“Part of why they could not actually hold or try the individual that survived one of the attacks was because they could not satisfy the evidentiary burden,” Ms. Jacobs said.\n\nThe Constitution vests the power to declare war and authorize military operations in Congress. But Republicans, who control both chambers, have not passed an authorization for the escalating campaign against the drug traffickers.\n\nRepresentative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado, has introduced legislation to reassert congressional oversight, but has been frustrated by the failure of the House to consider such measures.\n\n“A large reason why this is happening is because Congress has for decades allowed it to happen,” Mr. Crow said. “It’s gotten out of control, and it’s time to fix it.”\n\nFrustration is growing among Democrats and Republicans that the Trump administration has not provided the classified memo written by the Justice Department that lays out the legal argument for the strikes.\n\nTo address the concerns of Republicans, the Trump administration held the briefing on Wednesday for a dozen G.O.P. senators.\n\nSenator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, a Republican on the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee, said the White House called him after he asked why the Wednesday briefing had not included Democrats.\n\n“And I said, yep, because Intel and Armed Services, we do things on a bipartisan basis when it comes to this, we want to keep it that way,” he said.\n\nMr. Rounds said he hoped Democrats received the same information “because it was a very good briefing; it explained a lot of stuff.”\n\nSenator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, who has raised some questions about the boat strikes, requested the briefing, according to congressional officials.\n\nMr. Warner said that he appreciated Mr. Rounds’s comments but that the Republican lawmakers should have walked out of the briefing.\n\nThe Trump administration, Mr. Warner said, needed to make the Justice Department’s memo and the target list available to all members of the Senate.\n\n“If we allow this kind of foul to take place, what happens next time?” Mr. Warner said. “I shouldn’t be shocked. Only Republicans were called before the strike on Iran.”\n\nLawmakers asked Pentagon officials in the House briefing on Thursday to provide that legal memo, according to a U.S. official, who discussed the classified briefing on the condition of anonymity. But the Pentagon officials would not say when they would turn it over. The delay, the U.S. official added, was because the White House does not want to show members of Congress the memo.\n\nMr. Crow said the House briefing contained no discussion of the administration’s larger strategy, adding that the presentation had only deepened his concerns.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Crow said the United States was “spending vast amounts of money” for very little.\n\n“It looks as though the Trump administration has learned nothing from our last 20 years of war, and it’s going to end up giving us the same lackluster results,” he said.\n\nMs. Jacobs said House lawmakers pressed the Pentagon briefers for details about the drugs that were on the boats struck by the military.\n\nPresident Trump has claimed, without evidence, the strikes had destroyed both cocaine and fentanyl, a far more deadly drug. But Colombia mostly produces only cocaine, which is trafficked through Venezuela, according to experts.\n\n“They admitted that all of the narcotics coming out of this part of the world is cocaine,” Ms. Jacobs said. “They, you know, talked a little bit about the connection between cocaine and fentanyl, although I’m not convinced that what they said was accurate.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/arts/design/museum-heist-oakland-california.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:05:52-04:00","title":"Over 1,000 Objects Are Stolen From Oakland Museum","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 1,000 cultural and historical objects, including jewelry, political memorabilia, and rare artworks such as pieces by artist Florence Resnikoff and 19th-century scrimshawed walrus tusks, were stolen from the Oakland Museum of California’s off-site storage facility on October 15, 2025.

No museum staff members were present at the time of the burglary, which was not discovered until Oct. 16.\n\nThe museum has said that it waited to announce the theft to the public because it feared compromising its investigation, which the Oakland police are conducting with the F.B.I.’s art crimes division.\n\n“The theft that occurred represents a brazen act that robs the public of our state’s cultural heritage,” Lori Fogarty, the museum’s executive director, said in a statement released on Wednesday. “We are working in close partnership with the City of Oakland, the Oakland Police Department and the F.B.I. to see that these objects are returned.”\n\nIt is unclear how many people were involved in the robbery, and the museum has not yet determined the total value of the stolen items.\n\nA spokeswoman for the museum said officials there believed the theft was “a crime of opportunity, not a sophisticated heist by seasoned criminals.”\n\nA representative for the F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile a majority of the items stolen were common memorabilia such as political pins, award ribbons and souvenir tokens, other objects included neckpieces by the artist Florence Resnikoff, who was based in Oakland, and a pair of scrimshawed walrus tusks carved in the 19th century.\n\nThe Oakland Museum of California describes itself as “a leading cultural institution of the Bay Area and a resource for the research and understanding of California’s dynamic cultural and environmental heritage.” According to the museum, its collection contains more than two million objects.\n\nThe storage facility, in a separate location from the museum’s main campus in downtown Oakland, holds many objects that are available to researchers and curators. Fogarty told reporters on Wednesday that the facility was protected by security cameras and an alarm system.\n\nThe announcement of the Oakland burglary comes as the police in France arrested five more people in connection to the brazen theft of some of the country’s crown jewels, worth more than $100 million, from the Louvre in Paris on Oct. 19. French authorities arrested two other suspects in that crime earlier in the week.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/opinion/trump-conservatives-progressives.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:05:40-04:00","title":"Hey, Lefties!

Trump Has Stolen Your Game.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T17:05:40-04:00\n\nSometime in 1985 I had lunch with Sam Francis in the cafeteria of The Washington Times, where we both worked. You may never have heard of Sam Francis, but MAGA people (at least the more intellectual ones) know him as one of the seminal thinkers of their movement.\n\nThe lunch was awkward because I found him dark and creepy (and he probably found me naïve). Back then I didn’t understand that his way of thinking would triumph in conservative circles and my way of thinking would be vanquished. I don’t think he won because he was a flat-out racist, though he was. (He was later fired for writing a column arguing that “neither ‘slavery’ nor ‘racism’ as an institution is a sin.”) I think he won because he was a revolutionary, while I was a conservative. I wanted to reform things; he wanted to burn it all down.\n\nFrancis’ views coded reactionary on substance but revolutionary in method. He understood that his tactics were closer to Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin than Edmund Burke. And it wasn’t just him. Over the last 50 years or so, left-wing revolutionary ideas have entered what the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci called the “spontaneous philosophy,” and what we would call the cultural atmosphere. MAGA has profited by exploiting these ideas in order to destroy the left.\n\nThe ideas, conceived when the bourgeois center constituted the cultural establishment, were developed to destroy that establishment. Now the elite university left is the cultural establishment, and left-wing revolutionary ideas work just as well against them. Let me give you a few examples of how MAGA embraces left ideas to get its way (even while not knowing, in most cases, where these ideas came from):\n\nPostmodernism. Many postmodernists argued that there’s no such thing as capital-T Truth. Statements are constructed narratives for the imposition of power. What matters is whose narratives gain social dominance. As Jonathan Rauch noted in a brilliant essay in Persuasion, Donald Trump, who probably has never heard of the postmodernists, took that idea and ran with it. Truth is whatever he says it is. Kellyanne Conway talked about “alternative facts.” Rudy Giuliani, that notorious postmodernist, said that “truth isn’t truth.”\n\nAnti-Globalization. In 1999, a group of mostly left-wing activists protested free trade and globalization at a World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. I would love to go back in time and watch their faces as I told them who their eventual savior would turn out to be.\n\nThe Power Elite. The radical sociologist C. Wright Mills wrote a book with that title in 1956. His argument was that a shadowy elite made up of people who got into exclusive clubs at Harvard, Yale and Princeton actually ran America. The Berkeley professor Peter Dale Scott began to explore a stratum of politics that he eventually called the “Deep State” in his 2007 book “The Road to 9/11.” As you know, MAGA embraces the “deep state” concept and this kind of conspiratorial thinking.\n\nMarxist-Leninism. Marx saw history through the prism of class conflict. MAGA also sees history as the conflict between the masses and the elites. Lenin believed that every state institutionalizes the dictatorship of a single class. MAGA believes America has been ruled by a dictatorship of the educated elites. Lenin realized you can use a vanguard to seize power and utterly destroy the structures of the old regime. This is what MAGA seeks to do, using traditional Leninist tactics.\n\nBack in 2013, Steve Bannon was honest about this. “I’m a Leninist,” he told an interviewer. “Lenin wanted to destroy the state and that’s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, destroy all of today’s establishment.” Christopher Rufo, the conservative culture warrior, embodies Lenin’s concept of “vanguardism,” that it takes a small revolutionary cadre to propel history and liberate the masses.\n\nCritical Theory. This intellectual hodgepodge that emerged from something called the Frankfurt School built on Marxism and influenced the New Left over the past two generations. One of its tenets is that the supposedly neutral institutions of society are simply shams that the elite use to mask their grip on power. Trump agrees. A neutral Justice Department? Gone. A neutral media? Gone. A neutral Constitution? Going. A neutral judiciary? Going. Free speech? Going.\n\nIdentity Politics. This is based, first, on the idea that your group identity explains your worldview more than your individual consciousness. It is based, second, on the idea that history is a struggle between oppressor and oppressed groups. It is based, third, on the idea that victimized groups are innocent and oppressor groups are evil. You are defined by how much your group is oppressed. Over the last few decades identity-based departments flourished in American universities — women’s studies, African American studies, etc.\n\nTrump took this idea and flipped it on its head. Now cultural studies professors are the evil oppressors, and evangelical Christians are the persecuted oppressed. As so many have noted, MAGA is identity politics for white people. It turns out that identity politics is more effective when your group is in the majority.\n\nThe Gramscian Turn. Gramsci argued that cultural power is interwoven with political power. Capitalist establishments wield their power through cultural hegemony. Political shifts are concretizations of shifts in values that have already occurred in people’s minds. Sam Francis (who died in 2005) explicitly cited Gramsci as his role model as he waged his culture war struggles. Christopher Rufo does the same today. This is why Trump is going after the universities, public broadcasting and the Kennedy Center. Francis once wrote, “The main focus should be the reclamation of cultural power, the patient elaboration of an alternative culture within but against the regime — within the belly of the beast but indigestible by it.”\n\nTransgressivism. Since the 19th century, left-wing cultural figures have tried to “épater le bourgeois” — shock the bourgeoisie. They’ve done this in part through artworks like Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain” (1917), which was a urinal laid flat on its back, and “Piss Christ,” Andres Serrano’s 1987 photograph of a plastic crucifix submerged in a glass tank of urine. It’s fun to shock the pearl-clutching elites. You tell yourself you’re trying to jolt polite society into a new way of thinking. Recently Politico reported on a Republican group text chat that had a strong épater le bourgeois vibe, with participants sharing deliberately offensive and performatively transgressive statements like “I love Hitler” and Holocaust jokes like “We got to pretend that we like them. ‘Hey, come on in. Take a nice shower and relax.’ Boom — they’re dead.”\n\nCancel Culture. There are more human beings in America eager to be offended than there are those who are eager to offend. A few years ago, people had their careers destroyed for uttering words that offended the snowflake left. Now people see their careers destroyed for uttering words that offend the snowflake right. These are words like diversity, equity, gender, nonbinary, antiracist, trauma and hate speech. Even just typing words like trauma traumatizes me. The horror! The horror!\n\nLast year, a writer named James Lindsay cribbed language from “The Communist Manifesto,” changed its valences so that they were right wing and submitted it to a conservative publication called The American Reformer. The editors, unaware of the provenance, were happy to print it. When the hoax was revealed, they were still happy! The right is now eager to embrace the ideas that led to tyranny, the gulag and Mao’s Cultural Revolution. Interestingly, the right didn’t take the leftist ideas that were intended to build something; they took just the ideas intended to destroy.\n\nBut the left doesn’t get off the hook. Since 1848, leftist intellectuals have been working on a core body of thought, composed, in part, from the ideas listed above. Back in 2020, woke Democrats embraced these ideas with gusto — until Donald Trump utterly co-opted and discredited them. One of the reasons the Democratic Party is struggling so much is that the radical left ideologies that undergirded its cultural stances are kaput, and it hasn’t yet built a more moderate intellectual tradition to fall back on.\n\nIf you want a one-sentence description of where politics is right now here’s my nominee: We now have a group of revolutionary rightists who have no constructive ideology confronting a group of progressives who let their movement be captured by a revolutionary left-wing ideology that failed.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Breakthrough\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T18:30:59-04:00\n\nDr. Marthe Gautier, a physician and researcher who had a major role in identifying the cause of Down syndrome but whose achievement was undermined when a male colleague took credit for her work, died on April 30, 2022. She was 96.\n\nHer death, in a retirement home in Meaux, France, though not widely reported at the time, was confirmed by her great-niece Tatiana Giraud. The New York Times, which had prepared an obituary about Dr. Gautier in advance, in 2018, learned of her death only recently.\n\nThe disputed research in which Dr. Gautier was involved produced a historic breakthrough: It revealed that people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome, one of the microscopic strands of DNA and protein that carry a person’s genetic blueprint.\n\nMost humans have 46 chromosomes. Down syndrome is also called trisomy 21, meaning that three copies of the 21st chromosome are present instead of two, for a total of 47 chromosomes.\n\nThe discovery, at the Armand-Trousseau Hospital in Paris in 1958, was the first to link an abnormal number of chromosomes to a disorder that causes intellectual disability. More connections between such conditions and aberrant chromosomes were soon found.\n\nThose advances led to the development of tests to diagnose the disorders before birth, making it possible to terminate affected pregnancies in many cases.\n\nDr. Gautier’s story “starts like a fairy tale and ends like villainy,” said Dr. Jean Kachaner, a former student of hers who is a pediatric cardiologist at the Necker Hospital for children in Paris.\n\nAt 25, Dr. Gautier was a brilliant physician with a promising future: Among 80 candidates for sought-after internships at the Paris Hospitals in 1950, she was one of only two women chosen. Outstanding in that role, she was then awarded a scholarship in 1955 to study for a year at Harvard.\n\nBack in Paris in 1956, she went to work at the Armand-Trousseau Hospital, for Dr. Raymond Turpin, a pediatrician and geneticist whom she later described in an essay as “very distant and laconic.”\n\nDr. Turpin had long suspected that Down syndrome might be caused by a chromosome abnormality, but lamented that no one in Paris knew how to grow the cell cultures needed to test his theory.\n\nDr. Gautier told an interviewer in 2013, “It struck me in a rather negative way, that here was a man who had proposed a genetic hypothesis for Down syndrome nearly 20 years before, and yet he had not gone on to pursue his theory.”\n\nDr. Gautier offered to try — she had become an expert in cell culture at Harvard — and was allowed to proceed. But she was given only primitive lab space and a low-power microscope. She paid for other equipment out of her pocket, drew her own blood to feed the cell cultures and bought a young rooster to bleed periodically for its plasma.\n\nDr. Gautier saw little of Dr. Turpin, but a protégé of his, Dr. Jérôme Lejeune, who knew nothing about cell culture, frequently visited her lab.\n\nIn the spring of 1958, Dr. Gautier’s painstaking efforts paid off. Peering through her microscope at tissue she had cultured from children with Down syndrome, she saw that every cell had an extra chromosome.\n\n“I was alone, but I shouted out, ‘Yes!’” she told New Scientist magazine in 2014.\n\nDr. Gautier lacked the equipment needed to photograph what she saw, but Dr. Lejeune leaped to her assistance, offering to get the pictures made. She handed over her slides, all exquisitely prepared, and never saw them again.\n\n“I was too young to know the rules of the game,” she wrote.\n\nShe was stunned to learn that soon after, at a scientific meeting in Montreal, Dr. Lejeune had described the findings as his own.\n\nThen, to get the results on the record — and to beat other research teams doing related work — he quickly wrote up a brief report for a scientific journal without consulting Dr. Gautier or even telling her about it until a few days before it was published.\n\nDr. Lejeune listed himself as the first author — a prestigious spot customarily reserved for whoever had done the most important part of the work. He listed Dr. Gautier second, misspelling both her first and last names “by a slip of the pen that I dare not interpret,” she wrote.\n\nDr. Turpin’s name came last, the position usually given to the senior person who directs or oversees the research.\n\n“I was hurt and suspected a degree of manipulation, having a feeling of being the ‘forgotten discoverer,’” Dr. Gautier wrote.\n\nShe, not Dr. Lejeune, she said, had cultured the cells, prepared the slides, looked at them through the microscope and counted the chromosomes. All that would have warranted giving her name primacy on the report, but she made no official protest. Dr. Turpin had agreed to the order of the names, and Dr. Lejeune was known to be a favorite of his.\n\nChallenging authority could derail a career, especially that of a young woman trying to make her way in the male-dominated sciences of that era, particularly in France.\n\nAfter the publication, Dr. Gautier wrote, Dr. Lejeune was “showered with all kinds of awards” without sharing them, including the Kennedy Prize, bestowed by a Kennedy family foundation for outstanding research in the field of intellectual disabilities. President John F. Kennedy personally presented it to him in 1962.\n\n“I have no happy memories of that period,” Dr. Gautier added, “as I felt cheated in every respect.”\n\nThe story was strikingly similar to that of Rosalind Franklin, another female scientist who had been marginalized by ambitious men, this time in Britain. Dr. Franklin took detailed X-ray photographs of DNA that a male colleague, Maurice H.F. Wilkins, gave to James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick without asking her. The pictures, which they used without her knowledge, enabled them to determine DNA’s double-helix structure. Dr. Watson and Dr. Crick did not include her as an author of their 1953 landmark scientific paper on the subject.\n\nThey and Dr. Wilkins won a Nobel Prize for the DNA work in 1962. (Dr. Franklin would not have been eligible for the Nobel because she died in 1958; the prize is not given posthumously.)\n\nBoth the Franklin and Gautier episodes were examined by Dr. Peter Harper, a professor of human genetics at Cardiff University in Wales, who wrote extensively about the history of the field.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Lejeune’s conduct was appalling,” he said in a telephone interview for this obituary in 2018. (Dr. Harper died in 2021.) He added that eminent geneticists in Paris generally agreed that “Marthe Gautier was the principal person, but she was sort of elbowed out of the way by Lejeune as a forceful, dynamic character, and she never got proper support by Turpin.”\n\nDr. Lejeune went on to make important discoveries in genetics and to advocate for proper care for children with Down syndrome. He opposed abortion and the prenatal testing that could lead to it. He died in 1994, and his obituary in The New York Times gave him sole credit for finding the cause of Down syndrome. A foundation started by his family mentions Dr. Gautier and Dr. Turpin on its website but says that Dr. Lejeune made the discovery.\n\nThe foundation has also tried to have Dr. Lejeune declared a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. In 2021, Pope Francis bestowed the title “Venerable” on Dr. Lejeune in recognition of his “heroic virtues,” a step in the process of attaining sainthood.\n\nFor years, friends and colleagues had urged Dr. Gautier, who had never spoken publicly about Dr. Lejeune’s conduct, to set the record straight. She told them that she had written an essay about the episode but that it was to be published only after her death.\n\nBut as 2009 and the 50th anniversary of the Down syndrome publication approached, she found that she could no longer keep silent. The notion of Dr. Lejeune’s being made a saint may have been the last straw, said Dr. Simone Gilgenkrantz, a friend and fellow geneticist.\n\nIn 2009, Dr. Gautier’s “personal testimony” was published in a French scientific journal. An English version, translated by Dr. Harper, was published in Human Genetics.\n\nThe Lejeune Foundation has challenged her account, stating on its website, “There is not a single shred of evidence to support the charges made against Lejeune.” It also says that handwritten statements in his notebook indicate that he saw the extra chromosome first.\n\nDr. Harper was unpersuaded. “Gautier did all the initial work and most of the subsequent work,” he said. “There’s a sort of slight gray zone as to whether Lejeune did anything significant.”\n\nHe added, “What he did other than get the photographs done, it’s impossible to be sure.”\n\nDr. Gautier became a cause célèbre among doctors and scientists in Europe. In 2009, the Armand-Trousseau Hospital mounted a plaque to honor the Down syndrome finding, listing Dr. Gautier first, then Dr. Lejeune and Dr. Turpin.\n\nDoctors and researchers also contacted the Catholic Church to challenge Dr. Lejeune’s prospective sainthood, asserting that he had publicly misrepresented himself as the sole discoverer of trisomy 21.\n\nIn 2014, the French Federation of Human Genetics gave Dr. Gautier a medal to honor her for the Down syndrome discovery. She was invited to give a speech at a meeting of the group in Bordeaux, in which she planned to tell the whole story.\n\nBut the event became a fiasco. Just a few hours before she was to speak, her talk was canceled. Legal representatives of the Lejeune Foundation had arrived with a court order allowing them to record her speech as evidence in case she damaged Dr. Lejeune’s reputation. The genetics group, fearing a lawsuit, called off her talk and gave her the award a day later in a private ceremony.\n\nThe attempt to silence Dr. Gautier only drew more attention to her story. The newspaper Le Monde published a scathing article, critical of the genetics federation for backing down. The prominent journals Nature and Science also published news articles recounting the contentious history.\n\nThe genetics group later said it regretted the cancellation, and many members considered it a disgrace.\n\n“The organizers asked me not to speak to avoid legal problems,” Dr. Gautier told New Scientist. “But I should have refused and given my talk anyway.”\n\nMarthe Gautier was born on Sept. 10, 1925, in the Île-de-France region, not far from Paris. Her parents were farmers, and she was the fifth of seven children.\n\nIn 1942, when she was 17, Marthe followed her elder sister, Paulette, to study at the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, which was then part of the University of Paris. With the city occupied by Nazi Germany, Paulette was killed by stray gunfire in 1944 during a clash between German troops and members of the French Resistance.\n\nRather than fight for the credit due her after the Down syndrome discovery, Dr. Gautier left genetics research and returned to the field that had been her first love: pediatric cardiology. She had a long, illustrious career at Bicêtre Hospital in Paris, where she treated children with rheumatic fever and infants with heart defects; helped to develop diagnostic procedures for pediatric heart disorders; worked with surgeons to devise operations to repair heart defects; and trained generations of doctors.\n\nIn 1967, while still working at Bicêtre, she became director of research at INSERM, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, where she led a research program on pediatric liver disease.\n\nDr. Kachaner said Dr. Gautier was among the founders of pediatric cardiology. And yet, he noted, because she was a woman, she was not even allowed to apply to become head of her department at Bicêtre.\n\nShe retired in 1990 at 65. She is survived by many nephews and nieces.\n\nDr. Gautier wrote that she never forgot an admonition her sister Paulette had given her: “If you’re a woman, and you’re not the boss’s daughter, you have to be twice as good to succeed.”\n\nStella Raine Chu and Ash Wu contributed reporting and Alain Delaquérière provided translations.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/briefing/trump-nuclear-tests-prince-andrew-title.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:51:42-04:00","title":"Trump Revived a Cold War Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump sparked global concern by announcing the resumption of U.S. nuclear testing after a 30-year pause, reigniting Cold War-era debates about nuclear proliferation.

It revived an earlier era’s debate over whether such testing would demonstrate strength or incite a global arms race.\n\nOn his way home from his six-day Asia trip, the president told reporters he had made the call because of all the other countries conducting nuclear tests. Except, of course, the last nuclear test was in 2017 by North Korea, the only country to regularly conduct tests in decades.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Beijing has conducted a test in nearly 30 years. However, it is possible, as my colleagues David Sanger and William Broad explained, that Trump was confused by Russia’s recent declaration that it had tested two exotic delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons, which did not involve a detonation.\n\nMany experts believe that if the U.S. were to resume testing, it would essentially give other nations permission to do the same. The Kremlin said today that it would follow the U.S. if it began testing.\n\nIn other Trump administration news:\n\nTrump met with China’s president, Xi Jinping, and announced a sharp de-escalation of their trade standoff that rolled back contentious tariffs — and extracted key concessions from Washington.\n\nA judge appeared skeptical of the administration’s decision to suspend food stamps. Around 42 million Americans are set to lose access on Nov. 1; some states have made backup plans.\n\nThe administration is slashing the cap on refugee admissions to a record low and reserving the slots for mostly white Afrikaner South Africans.\n\nCalley Means, an influential adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., quietly departed the White House. His sister Casey Means, Trump’s nominee for surgeon general, had her Senate hearing postponed after she went into labor.\n\nWhen Hurricane Melissa lashed Jamaica this week with Category 5 winds and heavy rain, it left parts of the island unrecognizable. Towns were littered with rubble and the island nation was still working to count the dead.\n\nJamaica’s prime minister said that the port town of Black River “has literally been totally destroyed.” One frequent visitor to the area, Amiri Bradley, said that “only places that have four concrete walls are still standing, and usually their roofs are gone.” See photos and videos of the storm’s aftermath.\n\nFor more: In our Climate Forward newsletter, Judson Jones, a meteorologist for The Times, explained how Melissa became so damaging.
