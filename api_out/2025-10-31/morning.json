Here’s why experts are confused \n       \n  By Tom Foreman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A ghost of the Cold War is rising between the world’s superpowers, just in time for Halloween.\n \n\n   \n  In the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin bragging about his country testing both a nuclear-powered torpedo and a new cruise missile, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, has fired back. In a lengthy post on his  Truth Social platform , Trump announced, “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  Now ,  nuclear watchdogs worldwide are wondering  what might come of Trump’s pronouncement  — and what he even means since the US hasn’t conducted a nuclear weapons test in decades.\n \n\n   \n  “First of all, every statement in that post is wrong,” said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear weapons expert at Harvard University. “It’s not true the United States has the world’s most nuclear weapons. It’s not true that other states are carrying out nuclear tests. (Trump) seems to think it’s the Department of Defense that carries out nuclear tests. It’s not. It’s the Department of Energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s own nominee to head the US Strategic Command seemed unclear of the president’s intent as he faced the Senate Armed Service Committee in a confirmation hearing Thursday. “Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test,” Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll said, “so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out.”\n \n\n   \n  The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation defines nuclear tests as “generally controlled explosions of nuclear devise, such as bombs or warheads,” and Russia’s missile and torpedo tests do not meet that strict definition. \n \n\n   \n  What’s more, Jon Wolfsthal, who advised both Joe Biden and Barack Obama on nuclear matters, notes other nations are already conducting similar tests – along with the US. “Russia, the United States, China are all investing tens of billions of dollars on new nuclear delivery platforms – missiles, bombers, submarines,” Wolfsthal said. “We have returned to the arms race dynamics of the Cold War where each side believes nuclear weapons are important.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump truly wants to resume nuclear weapons testing, analysts say the complications are deep and wide. For starters, almost every nuclear-capable country in the world has voluntarily agreed to avoid such tests for decades. Russia ran its last test in 1990, the US in 1992 and China in 1996. North Korea is the only nation to conduct nuclear blasts this century, and that has contributed to Pyongyang’s status as an international pariah.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the diplomatic risk of standing up a fresh set of tests in the US, there are technical challenges. Federal studies have shown staging such a test safely would likely require several years of preparation, and even then, it might yield little useful information. The US routinely tests nuclear weapons components so thoroughly that America is widely seen as holding a treasure trove of nuclear knowledge unmatched by any other country.\n \n\n   \n  Critics say if Trump ushers in a new era of testing, that will only open the door for any other nation with nuclear dreams to start catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “The country that would benefit the most would be China,” Bunn said.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes no sense from a strategic point of view for the United States,” said former Democratic congressman John Tierney, who now heads the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear weapons experts note that both Russia and China have stepped up their nuclear aspirations already. Some political analysts speculate that Trump is hoping to back them down with tough talk, a notion he seems to echo. “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” the president said. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither the Defense Department nor the White House has offered a more complete explanation of the plan as of yet.\n \n\n   \n  But Tierney finds the president’s constantly shifting talk troublesome, to say the least. He fears in an already tense international environment, Trump is injecting more instability – which can prove explosive in its own way.\n \n\n   \n  “One day he wants everyone to get rid of their nukes,” Tierney says. “The next day he wants to start testing? It’s dangerous.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/food/wendys-problems-third-quarter-earnings-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"What’s wrong with Wendy’s?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Wendy’s is facing significant challenges in 2025, including a nearly 50% drop in stock value, declining same-store sales, and leadership instability.

Wendy’s? \n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For a logo with a trademark grin, Wendy’s has little to smile about nowadays.\n \n\n   \n  The burger chain’s stock has lost nearly 50% of its value this year. Wendy’s executive suite has contended with several departures, and it’s currently operating without a permanent CEO after its previous leader abruptly left after just a year-and-a-half on the job. Plus, a confusing mix of promotions hurt sales last quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not happy with our sales performance,” Ken Cook, Wendy’s CFO and interim CEO, bluntly admitted on its most recent earnings call in August.\n \n\n   \n  The fast food industry is in a slump, and Wendy’s isn’t immune. Chief rivals McDonald’s and Burger King also reported sluggish sales earlier this year as consumers cut back spending. However,  both rebounded  over the summer and fall thanks to an increased focus on marketing and targeted promotions.\n \n\n   \n  Not so much for Wendy’s.\n \n\n   \n  US sales at stores open at least a year in the third quarter are forecast to fall 5.8% when the company reports earnings next week, according to Jim Salera, a research analyst for Stephens. That’s even worse than the 3.6% decline in the previous quarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Investors are really focusing on when the company can get same-store sales trends moving back in the right direction and we had seen little progress of that,” Salera told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s is being forced to take action, recently announcing an aggressive turnaround plan that aims to reignite sales. However, revitalizing a 55-year-old chain is not easy.\n \n\n   \n  McDonald’s, which has nearly triple the number of locations in the United States, found recent success with new deals and  menu items . McDonald’s recent growth has also eaten away at some of Wendy’s market share.\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s sits in a “more of an elevated position where it’s not just focused on price,” Salera said, and is focused on quality. After all, the chain prides itself on its “fresh, never frozen” tagline for its patties, which has been  in use since its founding in 1969 .\n \n\n   \n  “But as consumers that are trading down or in some cases just trading out entirely and just skipping (fast food) occasions, McDonald’s is leading a lot more with price than an operator like Wendy’s,” he   added.\n \n\n   \n    Back to square one\n \n\n   \n  Wendy’s recently announced a  “comprehensive strategic plan”  called “Project Fresh,” under the guidance of former Taco Bell CEO Greg Creed.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s board of directors and management team are dissatisfied with the current valuation of the company and have been working to put the company on the right path to create value for our franchisees, employees and shareholders,” said Art Winkleback, chairman of Wendy’s board, in an October 9 press release.\n \n\n   \n  Plans include refreshed marketing to remind customers of its “rich heritage of quality, innovation and unique voice.” The company also intends to help franchisees improve profits and increase investments in restaurant technology, like digital menus, to “enhance the customer experience.”\n \n\n   \n  BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, however, doesn’t think Wendy’s plan is “tackling the root of the problem” and that its “issues go far deeper than some marketing changes or some menu adjustments.”\n \n\n   \n  Rather, he said that Wendy’s problems stretches back more than a decade to   a  remodel initiative  of its US restaurants that was meant to modernize the chain. Instead, the final product was “watered down a lot” from its initial plan because of several leadership changes.\n \n\n   \n  “Wendy’s is now starting to talk about kind of a multi-year plan to install digital menu boards, which have been around for over a decade,” Saleh told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  For comparison, around the same time, McDonald’s  remodeled a vast majority  of its US restaurants, adding digital kiosks and refreshed interiors. The work was largely completed by 2020.\n \n\n   \n  “The biggest problem (Wendy’s) have is not their food … it’s (their restaurants) are old and tired,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Salera agreed that Wendy’s has a “solid offering” with its food. The chain recently relaunched its chicken tenders to  capitalize on the trend  for crispy chicken, and he complimented the  revamped Frosty  offerings to establish it as a “unique Wendy’s asset.”\n \n\n   \n  He said that the brand’s plan of “focusing and skimming down the number of promotions or limited-time offers is a positive (move),” especially after the variety of deals in the “100 Days of Summer” promotion proved to be  too complex  for customers to understand.\n \n\n   \n  Additional details of Wendy’s plan will be revealed during its November 7 earnings call.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-numbers-trump-fact-check","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Fact check: Trump’s false claims about his poll numbers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article challenges President Donald Trump’s claims that he has the highest poll numbers ever and the best numbers for any president in many years.

But Trump also said two things about his popularity that are not even close to true.\n \n\n   \n  He said, “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had.” And he said, “I have the best numbers for any president in many years – any president.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s approval is down markedly from his second-term peak\n \n\n   \n  In reality, polls show that Americans’ approval of Trump has declined significantly since the beginning of his second term in late January. Multiple polling averages confirm that Trump’s poll numbers are nowhere in the ballpark of their highest-ever levels.\n \n\n   \n   A New York Times average  put Trump’s net approval at negative-11 points as of Tuesday: 43% approval and 54% disapproval. That is down a  net 20 points  from the first week of the term, when Trump was at positive-9 points – 52% approval and 43% disapproval.  CNN’s Poll of Polls  average, updated Wednesday, has Trump’s net approval at negative-15 points (41% approval and 56% disapproval), down a net 14 points from our first average of the term in early February.\n \n\n   \n  Other polling averages also show large drops in Trump’s standing since the beginning of the term.\n \n\n   \n  An  average produced by G. Elliott Morris , co-founder of the polling data website  FiftyPlusOne.news , put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-14 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 26 points from the first days of the term. An  average produced by data journalist Nate Silver  put Trump’s net approval at roughly negative-10 points as of Tuesday, down about a net 22 points from the first days of the term.\n \n\n   \n  The White House didn’t respond to a CNN request for comment for this article.\n \n\n   \n  It’s worth noting that Trump does continue to have  extremely high   approval   among Republicans , often in the vicinity of 90%. But he never said Tuesday that he was talking about his popularity with his own party rather than the country as a whole, and he is not at a personal record high even among Republicans in particular.\n \n\n   \n    Many other presidents had far better numbers\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current poll numbers are nowhere close to “the best numbers for any president in many years,” even if you ignore the fact that they’re not even his own best numbers in many years.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current low standing – a negative net approval, with approval specifically in the low-40s – clearly does not approach the  approval  peaks   of recent predecessors. President Barack Obama hit 69% approval in the early days of his first term, according to tracking by polling firm Gallup, while President George W. Bush hit 90% approval in the wake of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Even President Joe Biden, who struggled with weak poll numbers for much of his term, was up at 57% approval in both January 2021 and April 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s claim is also wrong even if he was referring specifically to other presidents’ poll numbers on the same date of a term.\n \n\n   \n  Biden had low net approval on the equivalent day of his term, but it was still better than Trump’s in both  Morris’s average  and  Silver’s average . And Trump’s boast about beating “any president in many years” clearly suggested he was comparing himself to other presidents in addition to Biden; the data shows that  every other person elected president after World War II  had better poll numbers than Trump on the equivalent date in their ​first term, in both net approval and approval alone.\n \n\n   \n  Silver’s  historical tracking  shows that, on the date Trump made this claim while having a roughly negative-10 net approval, Obama had about a positive-9 net approval in his first term, George W. Bush about positive-76, President Bill Clinton positive-2, President George H.W. Bush about positive-38, President Ronald Reagan about positive-20, President Jimmy Carter about positive-24, President Richard Nixon about positive-27, President John F. Kennedy about positive-65, President Dwight D.

FX, National Geographic and Freeform.\n \n\n   \n  The two companies remain in talks, although neither company indicated when customers can expect programming to resume.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, Google’s YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC,” a Disney spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Without a new agreement in place, their subscribers will not have access to our programming, which includes the best lineup in live sports — anchored by the NFL, NBA, and college football, with 13 of the top 25 college teams playing this weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  In its own  statement , Google said the decision “directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products,

Though the perpetrators  were convicted earlier this year , the fully functional, opulent toilet, titled “America,” was never found, believed to be cut up or melted down for the value of the gold itself, worth millions.\n \n\n   \n  But that isn’t the end of the saga for the satirical sculpture, which was once offered to President Donald J. Trump during his first term, in lieu of a Van Gogh painting requested by his administration (the counteroffer was  reportedly ignored) .\n \n\n   \n  Cattelan has previously stated he had made more than one edition of “America,” and now a second edition is making an unexpected, flashy debut on the art market next month.\n \n\n   \n  Sotheby’s in New York will sell the work, which has been in private (and anonymous) hands since 2017, on November 18. That also means the sculpture will be back on public view for a limited time, when the auction house installs it in the fourth-floor bathroom of its brand-new headquarters for 10 days leading up to the sale. This time, however, visitors will not be able to use it, per Sotheby’s. Officially that’s for security reasons, though one can guess why else.\n \n\n   \n  “The door will remain open,” said David Galperin, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art, laughing.\n \n\n   \n  Auctions typically have a set starting bid, informed by a number of market factors, as well as low and high sales numbers, estimated ahead of time. But the sale for this “America” will be worth its weight in gold — quite literally — as the starting figure will be its inherent value, fluctuating with the gold market right up until bidding begins. That will be somewhere in the $10 million range, according to the current value (with the price of gold lately  setting record highs ), plus whatever collectors deem its ascribed value to be.\n \n\n   \n  “The starting bid in accordance with the price of gold was really a way to lean into the very essence of the conceptual basis behind the artwork, which is largely to draw attention to the difference between a work’s artistic value, and a work’s inherent material value,” Galperin explained.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a “perfect foil” to Cattelan’s other equally infamous banana-on-a-wall, “Comedian,” which  sold for $6.24 million at Sotheby’s last fall , Galperin added. The duct-taped banana, worthless without Cattelan’s association, first debuted at Art Basel Miami on a bare white wall, originally priced at $120,000.  It has been eaten more than once .\n \n\n   \n  “If ‘Comedian’ was all about the intangibility of value and how we ascribe value to works of art, ‘America’ challenges that a step further by being in so many ways, intrinsically valuable, in a manner that so many works of art are not.”\n \n\n   \n  “America” is many things: a wry comment on the art world and the United States, as well as an object of torment for arts publicists and their lofty press statements. (The Guggenheim once described it as an opportunity for “unprecedented intimacy with a work of art.”) And this edition may actually be the only physical one in existence, according to Sotheby’s. Though the work is an edition of three, the auction house does not believe the third has been fabricated.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond the sculpture’s dramatic history, Galperin said “America” is an important 21st-century artwork, one with a direct lineage to landmark Modern art (see: Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 upside-down urinal “Fountain”), but with critical relevance to today.\n \n\n   \n  “Catalan, for his entire career, has critiqued the system,” Galperin said, “whether it’s the viewers’ experience seeing art in a museum, the way that works of art move through the system, the way that they’re valued, the way that they change hands.\n \n\n   \n  “All of these concepts are things that artworks so rarely confront head on. His ability to do that and do it in such a legible way and impactful way is part of its success here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/rescue-efforts-storm-melissa-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"Caribbean islands reel from Hurricane Melissa’s devastating impact as storm heads north","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in over 150 years, devastated the Caribbean in October 2025, with Jamaica suffering the worst damage as it made landfall as a Category 5 storm, causing complete destruction in coastal towns like Black River, over 15 feet of storm surge, and widespread power outages.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Rescue efforts are underway across the Caribbean after  Hurricane Melissa  tore through the region as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in more than 150 years.\n \n\n   \n  Torrential downpours and forceful winds have  already unleashed  widespread destruction along the storm’s path in Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa lashed Bermuda as a Category 1 storm overnight Thursday into Friday as the storm passed the islands, bringing quick-hitting bursts of strong wind and rain. The storm is expected to weaken and become post-tropical as it races south of Newfoundland into cooler Atlantic water.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the storm, authorities in Bermuda closed the Causeway – a transport link connecting the main island with the smaller St. David’s Island. All schools will be shut and ferries canceled on Friday, among other measures, out of an “abundance of caution,” said Michael Weeks, Bermuda’s national security minister, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  The storm has damaged homes, caused severe flooding and widespread power outages, and forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands across the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  At least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency officials have begun to pick up the pieces, clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief, as several international efforts have also been launched.\n \n\n   \n  The regional Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), activated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on October 29, has deployed and will be on the ground today.\n \n\n   \n    Jamaica hardest hit\n \n\n   \n  Jamaica took the  heaviest battering . Melissa made landfall there as a  Category 5 storm , with estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 kph).\n \n\n   \n  “Complete and utter destruction” is how CNN’s Derek Van Dam described the streets of Jamaica’s hard-hit coastal town of Black River on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  People gathering around the Black River Bridge searched for water, food and news about their loved ones. The Jamaican Defense Forces have landed in the area by helicopter, but desperation is setting in for residents, Van Dam reported. Many are trying to leave the area with their personal items by car, motorbike or on foot.\n \n\n   \n  Black River is dealing with the aftermath of over 15 feet of storm surge from Hurricane Melissa, which devastated the infrastructure of the town in the southwestern part of the island.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are complicating recovery efforts. There is a makeshift refugee camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything is gone,” one Black River resident, Britney Samms, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Looting was reported in the area. Van Dam described it as “a matter of survival.”\n \n\n   \n  “What once was paradise is now hell on earth,” he said of the town, first established in the 17 th  century and lately known as a center for environmental tourism.\n \n\n   \n  But the CNN team also witnessed signs of hope. Amid the chaos, there were moments of laughter and exchanges of hugs, as loved ones reunited after the storm.\n \n\n   \n  In Montego Bay on Jamaica’s northwestern coast, Alfred Hines, 77, told how he waded barefoot through mud to escape rising floodwaters.

Is it too little too late? \n       \n  Analysis by Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:47 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  King Charles’  decision  to cast out his brother Andrew from the monarchy as well as the  30-room mansion  where he’s lived for more than 20 years was as sudden as it was dramatic.\n \n\n   \n  It is the ultimate humiliation for the 65-year-old now-former prince,  known to enjoy the trappings and privilege of royal life. He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.\n \n\n   \n  The monarchy had been under intense pressure to resolve the Andrew issue amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which was further inflamed by the release of his sexual abuse accuser  Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir.  Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Two weeks ago, Andrew  gave up the use  of his titles and honors, more than five years after  stepping back as a frontline royal . He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first,” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.\n \n\n   \n  The palace statement was clear – the decision was the king’s and Andrew had no choice in the matter (although he is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions). Notable in the statement too, an expression of solidarity with victims of abuse.\n \n\n   \n  The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated. ﻿Not since the abdication crisis of 1936 has there been such a public casting aside of a senior British royal.\n \n\n   \n  The decision would doubtless have been difficult – and, given the personal family dynamics at play, deeply personal. But the monarch had no choice – Andrew’s controversies have been dogging the family for years and the publication of his accuser’s posthumous memoir was the final straw. The negotiations to get to this stage will have been challenging but the monarch had no option but to engage damage control mode.\n \n\n   \n  It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee. Perhaps this move will head off that particular indignity.\n \n\n   \n  Royal historian Kate Williams said the King’s decision was “unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Ms. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have had people in the past losing the title of prince or princess. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) said his daughters were no longer legitimate after he annulled the marriages with their mothers, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn – but he changed his mind later.”\n \n\n   \n  She also pointed out Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – whose title of the Duke of Albany was removed by parliament in 1917 after he fought for Germany in World War I. But Andrew’s situation, Williams said, was different as he was censured because of his serious errors of judgment.\n \n\n   \n  The King’s moves were welcomed by many British politicians. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”\n \n\n   \n  For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.\n \n\n   \n  Royal sources told CNN that the King was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.\n \n\n   \n  It is also understood that the King took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.\n \n\n   \n  The statement, when it came, was uncompromising. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” it said.\n \n\n   \n  For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. For some, the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. Royal sources have told CNN that he will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, and will receive an income from Charles as well.\n \n\n   \n  His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has been living with Andrew at Royal Lodge for the last two decades, is moving out as well and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as daughters of the son of a sovereign, in line with a directive issued by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear if the King’s actions will be enough to give a public perception that the situation has been handled, but Charles seems to be doing as much as he feels he can within his own royal prerogative.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/health/state-medicaid-undocumented-immigrants-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Trump’s HHS Orders State Medicaid Programs to Help Find Undocumented Immigrants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has ordered all 50 states to verify the immigration status of Medicaid enrollees, requiring state Medicaid agencies to check eligibility for individuals whose status cannot be confirmed through federal databases.

  7:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has ordered states to investigate certain individuals enrolled in Medicaid to determine whether they are ineligible because of their immigration status, with five states reporting they’ve received more than 170,000 names collectively — an “unprecedented” step by the federal government that ensnares the state-federal health program in the president’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Advocates say the push burdens states with duplicative verification checks and could lead people to lose coverage just for missing paperwork deadlines.\n \n\n   \n  Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n \n\n   \n  “We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a  press release  announcing the verification effort in August.\n \n\n   \n  The release said all 50 states would receive names to check within a month.\n \n\n   \n  To gauge the effort’s progress, KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 randomly selected states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  Most of those states declined to comment further. The other five — California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina — refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill  began posting pictures  on the social platform X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill could not be reached for comment. CMS spokespeople didn’t respond to a request for comment or confirm how many names the agency has submitted to states.\n \n\n   \n  “We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.\n \n\n   \n  In June, advisers to Kennedy ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.\n \n\n   \n  In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to  stop sharing the information  with immigration authorities.\n \n\n   \n  State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.\n \n\n   \n  In its August press release, CMS said it’s asking states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.\n \n\n   \n  He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  “CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.\n \n\n   \n  The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.\n \n\n   \n  “I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”\n \n\n   \n  Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.\n \n\n   \n  However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”\n \n\n   \n  If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.\n \n\n   \n  “Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.\n \n\n   \n   Renuka Rayasam and Rae Ellen Bichell contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/18/us/6-7-meme-slang-explained-cec","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"The ‘6-7’ meme can be annoying.

But kids are shouting it for good reason \n       \n  By Scottie Andrew, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:38 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Not since 69 has a number caused this much disruption.\n \n\n   \n  “6-7,” pronounced “ six-seveeeeen ,” is haunting school halls across the country (including  South Park Elementary ), making it the Gen Alpha nonsense phrase of the moment. Kids are shouting it in classrooms when a teacher turns to page 67, when lunchtime is 6 to 7 minutes away or for no reason at all. It’s become  so  ubiquitous that Dictionary.com  named  it the word of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a plague — a virus that has taken over these kids’ minds,” said Gabe Dannenbring, a seventh-grade science teacher in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “You can’t say any iteration of the numbers 6 or 7 without having at least 15 kids yell, ‘6-7!’”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a joke without a punchline (or a setup, for that matter). 6-7 means nothing, but using it can make a student feel like a member of a bigger, cooler group of their peers.\n \n\n   \n  “It becomes a language game to them that, it would seem, only folks in their group know how to play,” said Gail Fairhurst, a University of Cincinnati professor who teaches leadership communication (and Gen Alpha speak).\n \n\n   \n   Skibidi toilets  and  rizzes  come and go. 6-7 is likely destined for the slang graveyard soon, now that adults are talking about it so much. But there’s something almost profound about its infinite interpretations, its refusal to be defined.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s part of what upsets people about it, and I think that’s part of what people like about it,” said Taylor Jones, a  linguist  and social scientist.\n \n\n   \n    An attempt at explaining 6-7 (but don’t worry, no one knows what it means)\n \n\n   \n  There may be no coherent explanation for 6-7, but here goes anyway: The number appears in the chorus of “Doot Doot (6 7),” a viral  song  by the Philadelphia rapper Skrilla. (In Skrilla’s case, according to Jones, 6-7 is likely a reference to the 10-67 police code, which is often used to report a death.)\n \n\n   \n  In December 2024, around the same time “Doot Doot” started taking off, high school basketball phenom Taylen Kinney appeared to create a gesture to accompany the phrase. In a  clip  shared by his Overtime Elite team, Kinney’s teammate asks him to rate a Starbucks drink out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Like a 6 … 6 … 6-7,” he says, adding an indecisive gesture, as though he were weighing two options in his palms.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly thereafter, Kinney started incorporating the song and gesture into his  TikToks , where he has over 1 million followers.\n \n\n   \n  The song started appearing in  sports highlight reels , including those for Charlotte Hornets point guard LaMelo Ball. (He stands at  6 feet, 7 inches , natch.) Ball  doesn’t seem annoyed  by the memes yet, but the NBA season hasn’t officially started, so there’s still time.\n \n\n   \n  A face of 6-7 emerged in March, when a  video  caught a young, overexcited spectator at an amateur basketball game shouting “6-7!” with the accompanying hand gesture. He became the embodiment of that annoying classmate who can’t stop spouting nonsense phrases. Somehow, the internet decided this stereotype’s name was Mason — and thus, Mason 67 has become another inside joke. (This “Mason” character has since become an icon of online analog horror,  per  Know Your Meme, but that’s another story.)\n \n\n   \n  So, if a kid uses any of the above explanations when you ask what the heck 6-7 is, they’re probably right. But most kids don’t even know where it came from, Dannenbring said.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody knows what it means,” he said. “And that’s kind of the funny thing about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Its meaninglessness is partly due to what Jones calls “semantic bleaching,” where a phrase is divorced from its original context and comes to mean something entirely different (or, in this case, nothing).\n \n\n   \n  Using 6-7 comes down to a willingness to have fun, Jones said: “Do you have a little bit of whimsy? Or are you a party pooper?”\n \n\n   \n    Kids scream ‘6-7’ to belong (and that’s cool)\n \n\n   \n  Sure, it’s nonsense, but 6-7 serves a critical social function. It’s a shibboleth, or a phrase that signifies that one belongs to an “in” group, Jones said. People who don’t say it or get it are on the outs. And what kid doesn’t want to belong?\n \n\n   \n  “Language is a way for people to form community,” said Fairhurst. “Even if it’s a nonsense term, if they seem to know what it means, that can be a unifying force. And if somebody isn’t understanding the term, it can exclude people from that community, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  6-7 has also survived longer than other internet nonsense words — even that pesky “skibidi” — likely because “grown-ups are so angry about it,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that you can get a big reaction from somebody for something just totally meaningless — that might give it longer longevity than it might otherwise have,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Fed-up teachers are banning it from their classrooms or making exasperated TikToks about the number of times they’ve heard it in a single school day (for Dannenbring, the  record is 75 ). Shouting “6-7!” after it’s forbidden becomes a “way to show resistance,” said Fairhurst.\n \n\n   \n  Teachers are now playing defense by using 6-7 themselves. A Michigan middle school choir teacher successfully staved away cries of “6-7” by  incorporating  it into a warmup song that also includes “slay,” “Ohio” and “ rizz .”\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t scream at me … even though you get excited,” the teacher begs her class before they begin chanting “6-7, 6-7, 6-7, skibidi,” a chorus of little cringe cherubs.\n \n\n   \n  When instructing his students to open their textbooks to page 67, Dannenbring will suddenly adopt the timbre of his enthusiastic seventh graders, who immediately protest their teacher using a phrase that does not belong to him. (At 27, Dannenbring is an elder member of Gen Z. But a young teacher is still a teacher, and, therefore, too old to play.)\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t play into it, yeah, it’s super disruptive,” Dannenbring said. “If you acknowledge it, then it gets over with in about 15 seconds.”\n \n\n   \n  And if  that  doesn’t shut down the conversation, he said he uses it incorrectly on purpose: “‘That’s so 6-7 of you.’”\n \n\n   \n  “The easiest way to kill it is for teachers to say that it’s cool,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  Comedian Josh Pray has started using it in front of his kids, working it into his  videos , desperate to reclaim a formerly innocuous number.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to take our numbers back!” he said. “I’ll be 67 before they know it, and I don’t want to hear that specific tone all around me as a taunt to my age!”\n \n\n   \n    Maybe ‘6-7’ isn’t brainrot after all (you were a dumb kid, too)\n \n\n   \n  Fear not, parents — incessantly screaming “6-7!” is not enough to prove that your children are “ brainrotting .” Concerns about literacy falling and critical thinking skills diminishing are legitimate, but they’re being “projected onto normal, youthful behavior,” Jones said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re rewriting our own history,” Jones said. “This is not anywhere near being a new phenomenon.”\n \n\n   \n  Every generation invents its own slang, and language evolves in ways most of us will never consciously perceive, Jones said. Kids will always come up with cool new phrases (like  “cool”! ), and adults will be left scratching their heads in confusion.\n \n\n   \n  Nonsense phrases like this aren’t inherently harmful, and 6-7 certainly isn’t going to bring about the end of the English language, Fairhurst said. But its popularity  could  be a benign symptom of our “post-truth” society, she said, where the meaning and specificity of communication matters less than people’s interpretation of it.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like it’s sort of a relative of that kind of phenomenon, where we’re just using language to use language, and not because we see something particularly meaningful or particularly real about it,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps 6-7 is already on its way out — it’s survived for nearly a year, essentially a century in TikTok time. Some of Dannenbring’s students are starting to roll their eyes when they hear their classmates yelling it. Middle school teacher and comedian Philip Lindsay said he’s already hearing potential replacements in his classroom — “41,” for one, another similarly meaningless number that makes kids inexplicably giggle.\n \n\n   \n  “41 was started to try and dethrone 6-7,” Lindsay said. “6-7 just happened. 41 was pushed.”\n \n\n   \n  The way Dannenbring sees it, slang can get a lot worse than 6-7. Past trends have inspired students to stick pencils into their school-issued laptops to set them on fire or rip sinks straight off the walls of their school bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had those words before, like Skibidi toilet,” he said. “This one is  significantly  less annoying.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/poll-closing-times-election-results","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:10:00Z","title":"When polls close in Tuesday’s elections and when to expect results","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Election night on Tuesday, October 31, 2025, features pivotal races in Virginia, New Jersey, New York City, and California, marking the first major elections of President Donald Trump’s second term.

The winner will become Virginia’s first female governor.​\n \n\n   \n  Democrat Ghazala Hashmi and Republican John Reid face off for lieutenant governor.

Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:26 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.\n \n\n   \n  The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)  took over the city  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”\n \n\n   \n  Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.\n \n\n   \n  Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s  withdrawal from El Fasher  earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.\n \n\n   \n  RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.\n \n\n   \n  The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration,  accused the RSF of committing genocide  against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”\n \n\n   \n  Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.\n \n\n   \n  One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.\n \n\n   \n  The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.\n \n\n   \n  Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.\n \n\n   \n  Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.\n \n\n   \n  Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.\n \n\n   \n  Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.\n \n\n   \n  “The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.\n \n\n   \n  “So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.\n \n\n   \n  Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”\n \n\n   \n  “(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.\n \n\n   \n  “On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.\n \n\n   \n  “All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the  Russian paramilitary group Wagner .\n \n\n   \n  The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”\n \n\n   \n    Fears for the missing men\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”\n \n\n   \n  Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”\n \n\n   \n  “Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.\n \n\n   \n  “The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  “The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.\n \n\n   \n  The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.\n \n\n   \n  As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/americas/jamaica-hurricane-melissa-black-river-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:35:00-04:00","title":"‘Hell on Earth’: Ravaged by Hurricane Melissa, this once-vibrant Jamaican town is now in desperate need of help","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa devastated Black River, Jamaica, one of the worst-hit areas in the country, with a storm surge of up to 16 feet flooding homes, destroying infrastructure, and resulting in at least two deaths.

nowhere to stay,” Britney Samms, a resident of Black River’s Vineyard District, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Black River was one of the worst-hit places in all of Jamaica. A storm surge of up to 16 feet flooded parts of the community as the hurricane barreled through. At least two people died here – their bodies discovered floating in the water after the storm had cleared, St. Elizabeth Police Superintendent Coleridge Minto said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, at least 49 people are known to have died, Reuters reported, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  In Black river, hundreds of survivors are now walking through the streets in shock, trying to process the harrowing situation they face.\n \n\n   \n  Many have lost their homes and are wondering where they will go for shelter.\n \n\n   \n  “We live in a board house. Everything is gone – dressers, stove – everything is gone,” Samms said, sitting beside other residents next to shopping carts loaded with their remaining belongings.\n \n\n   \n  It was “a nice, quiet, very docile town,” said a man from a nearby town after surveying the devastation. Now it’s a “hell on Earth,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The town’s narrow roads are now cluttered with metal roof panels, slabs of concrete, and all kinds of trash that the water brought in.\n \n\n   \n  Agonizing screams often echo through the town as residents walk around in circles, searching for loved ones or taking stock of the damage.\n \n\n   \n  The heat and humidity are adding another layer of complexity to the recovery efforts. There is a makeshift camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.\n \n\n   \n  Mayor Richard Solomon described the conditions as devastating. “Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the devastation, Solomon said the storm “wiped out” the town’s relief supplies and rendered emergency vehicles inoperable due to water damage. This delayed the authorities’ ability to deliver much-needed aid.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of residents were seen clearing out the shelves of a damaged supermarket out of desperation, taking basic needs such as food and water.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no looting,” a resident said to CNN. “This is trying to survive. It’s a survival thing right now.” He said the police were also at the scene – not to deter them but to help.\n \n\n   \n  Getting aid from the outside has been a challenge as many roads remain blocked by debris, downed trees and floodwaters.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency crews and defense forces are gradually arriving to help where they can.

These shipments began shortly after the sanctions were reinstated and are believed to be a response to the loss of Iranian missiles during a 12-day conflict with Israel. Although sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned in the sanctions, experts argue it falls under the broader prohibition of materials contributing to nuclear weapons delivery systems. China maintains that it is not legally bound by the snapback sanctions and emphasizes its commitment to diplomatic solutions, citing long-standing ties with Iran.

intelligence says Iran is rearming despite UN sanctions, with China’s help \n       \n  By Melissa Bell, Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:17 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Iran appears to be stepping up the rebuilding of its ballistic missile program, despite the reintroduction last month of  United Nations sanctions  that ban arms sales to the country and ballistic missile activity.\n \n\n   \n  European intelligence sources say several shipments of sodium perchlorate, the main precursor in the production of the solid propellant that powers Iran’s mid-range conventional missiles, have arrived from China to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas since the so-called  “snapback” mechanism  was triggered at the end of September.\n \n\n   \n  Those sources say the shipments, which began arriving on September 29, contain 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate bought by Iran from Chinese suppliers in the wake of its  12-day conflict with Israel in June . The purchases are believed to be part of a determined effort to rebuild the Islamic Republic’s depleted missile stocks. Several of the cargo ships and Chinese entities involved are under sanctions from the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The deliveries come after more-than-a-decade-old UN sanctions were restored by the snapback mechanism – a provision for Iranian breaches of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal to monitor its nuclear program.\n \n\n   \n  Under the sanctions re-imposed on Tehran last month, Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN member states must also prevent the provision to Iran of materials that could contribute to the country’s development of a nuclear weapons delivery system, which experts say could include ballistic missiles.\n \n\n   \n  States are also required to prevent the provision to Iran of assistance in the manufacture of arms. China, along with Russia, opposed the reimposition of the sanctions, saying it undermines efforts for a “diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  While the shipped substance – sodium perchlorate – is not specifically named in UN documents on materials banned for export to Iran, it is a direct precursor of ammonium perchlorate, a listed and prohibited oxidizer used in ballistic missiles. However, experts say that the sanctions’ failure to explicitly prohibit the chemical may leave China room to argue that it is not in violation of any UN ban.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has followed the journeys of several cargo ships identified by the intelligence sources as being involved in the latest deliveries of sodium perchlorate from Chinese ports to Iran, using ship tracking data and the social media of their crew. Many of those vessels appear to have gone back and forth several times between China and Iran since the end of April. The sources say their crew seem to be employed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and their regular social media posts provide a trail of their stops on the China to Iran journey.\n \n\n   \n  Among them is the MV Basht, already sanctioned by the US, which left the Chinese port of Zhuhai on September 15, arrived in Bandar Abbas on September 29 and since returned to China.\n \n\n   \n  Planet Labs satellite images provided to CNN by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies confirm that the Barzin was being loaded with cargo at Gaolan Port, China, on October 1, before departing for Iran. The images then show the Barzin docked at Rajaei Port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, from October 16 to October 19, where it was being unloaded.\n \n\n   \n  The Elyana left the Chinese port of Changjiangkou on September 18 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12. Finally, the MV Artavand left the Chinese port of Liuheng and arrived in Bandar Abbas on October 12, with its AIS tracking system turned off to deliberately obscure its movements, according to Western intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not clear if the Chinese government is aware of the shipments. In response to a question from CNN about the transactions, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, while he was “not familiar with the specific situation,” China has “consistently implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with its international obligations and domestic laws and regulations.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to emphasize that China is committed to peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic means and opposes sanctions and pressure,” the spokesperson continued, adding that Beijing viewed the return of sanctions under the snapback mechanism as “unconstructive” and a “serious setback” in efforts to “resolve the Iranian nuclear issue.”\n \n\n   \n  Similar shipments had previously been reported, but their intensification since the 12-day war – when the Israeli military targeted at least a third of the surface-to-surface launchers that fire Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) – suggests a renewed eagerness on the part of the Islamic Republic to arm itself.\n \n\n   \n  “Iran needs much more sodium perchlorate now to replace the missiles expended in the war and to increase production. I would expect large shipments to Iran as it tries to rearm, just as I would expect Israel and the US to race to replace the interceptors and munitions that were expended,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  The best way to consider the current moment, he told CNN, is as a pause in hostilities, as each side seeks to rearm.\n \n\n   \n  “Two thousand tons of sodium perchlorate are only enough for about 500 missiles.  That’s a lot, but Iran was planning on producing something like 200 missiles a month before the war and now must replace all the missiles that either Israel destroyed or it used,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Long-standing ties\n \n\n   \n  China has long been a  diplomatic and economic ally  for sanctions-hit Iran, decrying “unilateral” US sanctions against the country and buying up most of Iran’s oil exports, despite not reporting purchases of Iranian oil for several years.\n \n\n   \n  That energy trade relies on a network of vessels that filter Iranian oil to independent refineries in coastal China, often through intermediary countries, according to analysts, who note this practice keeps refinement separate from Chinese state-owned enterprises that would be vulnerable to US sanctions. These so-called teapot refineries are known to work with what’s often referred to as a dark fleet of tankers that use concealing tactics to smuggle sanctioned goods.\n \n\n   \n  European security sources believe a similarly opaque system, involving front companies that are little more than fake numbers and billing addresses, has been used to keep the sodium perchlorate flowing to Iran. As have more legitimate companies, including two already sanctioned by the US back in April for their part in a “network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).” Most of the companies involved are based in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian, according to information from the intelligence sources.\n \n\n   \n    Earlier shipments\n \n\n   \n  In February, CNN  reported the shipment  of 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate to Iran from China. By April, the US had slapped sanctions on several Iranian and Chinese entities, including vessels believed to play a role in “a network procuring ballistic missile propellant ingredients on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).”\n \n\n   \n  Yet the shipments continued, the intelligence sources say, with the IRGC’s Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization acquiring another 1,000 tons of sodium perchlorate which left Taicang in China aboard the Hamouna on May 22 and arrived in Bandar Abbas on June 14 or 15. It set sail for the Iranian port less than a month after a massive explosion there on April 27, believed to have been caused by sodium perchlorate, killed 70 and wounded hundreds.\n \n\n   \n  The latest shipments represent much bigger quantities in a short space of time. The first of the 10 to 12 shipments that European intelligence sources have been tracking arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the snapback mechanism – triggered in August by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, the European partners to the JCPOA – restored UN sanctions. The others all left China after the sanctions were in place.\n \n\n   \n  Tong Zhao, a senior fellow with the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that China’s position on the legal status of the reimposition of sanctions may be related to how its authorities would view such shipments.\n \n\n   \n  “First and foremost, China – along with Russia and Iran – has denounced the legality of the snapback in a joint letter to the UN issued on October 18, indicating that Beijing likely does not consider itself bound by the reimposed measures,” according to Zhao.\n \n\n   \n  Had the snapback not been triggered, October 18 would have marked the official end of the 10-year JCPOA, at which point the option to reimpose previous UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program would expire and the Security Council would close Iran’s nuclear file.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, China joined with Russia in September to push for a six-month extension of the JCPOA, arguing that more time was needed for diplomatic efforts and pointing to what Beijing saw as signs that Iran wanted to engage with the international community on regulating its nuclear program. The UN Security Council  voted down  the China-backed resolution in September, one day before the snapback came into force.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing was one of the six countries – along with France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US – that signed the JCPOA with Iran in 2015. In a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in September, Xi reiterated China’s stance that it “attaches importance to Iran’s repeated pledge that it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons” and “respects Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zhao also pointed to the fact that the export of sodium perchlorate is not explicitly banned under the pre-JCPOA sanctions regime that is now back in force. What the reinstated UN resolutions do prohibit, he added, is the provision by member states to Tehran of “items, materials, equipment, goods, and technology” which could contribute to Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon delivery system.\n \n\n   \n  So, while sodium perchlorate is not named, it “should fall under the broader catch-all controls on materials used in solid-fuel missile production,” he said, but noted that the fact that it is not explicitly prohibited may leave China and other countries with greater room for interpretation.\n \n\n   \n  “Beijing may be aware that such exports indirectly support Iran’s missile program,” Zhao said, “yet it may also view this as a matter of principle – asserting China’s sovereign right to make independent export-control decisions on items not expressly banned by the UN.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/style/fondation-beyeler-chanel-culture-fund","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:26:00+00:00","title":"Swiss art museum appoints first-ever botanical curator, backed by Chanel Culture Fund","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Fondation Beyeler in Switzerland has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its first-ever botanical curator, a role supported by the Chanel Culture Fund.

Chanel Culture Fund \n       \n  By Fiona Sinclair Scott, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:26 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Fondation Beyeler, home to one of western Europe’s leading modern and contemporary art collections, is turning its gaze toward a novel type of gallery — its own gardens.\n \n\n   \n  Located near Basel, Switzerland, the museum has long been a popular cultural attraction for its art as well as its scenic setting. Designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect  Renzo Piano , the flat-roofed, single-story gallery in Riehen is gently nestled among centuries-old trees and mossy lily ponds, surrounded by green fields and vineyards, at the edge of Germany’s Black Forest.\n \n\n   \n  Since opening nearly 30 years ago, the Fondation Beyeler has hosted many site-specific artworks that engaged directly with its natural environment. In 1998, the late artist  Christo  wrapped 178 trees on the property in fabric, and, more recently,  Olafur Eliasson  removed part of the building’s facade to effectively bring one of the outdoor ponds into the gallery itself. The Icelandic artist used a non-toxic dye to give the water a neon glow, describing the work as a “model for a future landscape where human and non-humans can live together” more harmoniously.\n \n\n   \n  This week, the institution is announcing a groundbreaking new role. In what is believed to be the first role of its kind at a major art museum, the Fondation Beyeler has appointed Swiss academic Rahel Kesselring as its inaugural botanical curator. Her role will focus on the preservation of the site’s flora and fauna and on developing public programming within its gardens.\n \n\n   \n  The position — officially, the Chanel botanical curator — is supported by the Chanel Culture Fund, a philanthropic arm of the French luxury house that backs innovative cultural projects and initiatives around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring explained that her mission is to strengthen the dialogue between art and nature. “Plants are enormously important for our culture,” she said in a video interview. “They sustain us…we live in a world that has been fully built by plants. We have a deep connection to them, physically, culturally and historically.”\n \n\n   \n  Museum director Sam Keller called the appointment a reflection of the institution’s ethos. “Nature is not a backdrop to our work, but a living part of it,” he said in a statement. “This role affirms our commitment to caring for the whole ecology of this place with the same depth, imagination and responsibility we bring to everything we do.”\n \n\n   \n  Kesselring’s appointment  presents a new model for arts institutions — expanding the idea of curatorial expertise beyond the white walls of a gallery and into the living landscape.\n \n\n   \n  With the symptoms of climate crisis increasingly felt by people and businesses, including those within the art world, the Fondation Beyeler is making a statement by putting ecological stewardship on par with artistic curation. Kesselring hopes it will inspire broader change or, at least, more public engagement. “We need to rewrite our understanding of our relationship with nature,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Yana Peel, the president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel, said during a video call that with no brick-and-mortar cultural institutions of its own (as is common for many luxury brands), the company has focused on contributing to others — seeking out ways to create impact on a project-by-project basis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have specifically not been sponsoring galas or parties or short-term projects,” she said, explaining that they want to focus on “transformational” work that is entirely non-transactional and not aimed at selling Chanel products. The initiative is about “wanting to have a positive impact on the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Chanel did not confirm how long it would be funding Kesselring’s role at the foundation but it’s understood to be a multi-year partnership, in keeping with the fund’s wider mission to focus on longer-term projects.\n \n\n   \n  Established five years ago, the Chanel Culture Fund has invested in 50 projects across 15 countries. Chanel is working with the Power Station of Art in Shanghai to support a significant renovation of the institution’s third-floor gallery, including the addition of the first contemporary art library in China, with the capacity to house 50,000 books. In Brazil, the fund partnered with the Pinacoteca de São Paulo on a new annual residency program to support women artists. And in the US, the organization is funding the Chanel Center for Artists and Technology at CalArts in Southern California.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/entertainment/antoni-porowski-sexual-health","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Antoni Porowski Says Conversations Around Sexual Health Don’t Have to Be Awkward","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Antoni Porowski, best known as a member of the 'Queer Eye' team, is advocating for more open and honest conversations about sexual health, especially in the face of political efforts to cut funding for LGBTQ+ health initiatives.

that conversations around sexual health don’t have to be awkward \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Many years before he became the resident foodie and one fifth of the makeover dream team on “ Queer Eye ,” Antoni Porowski already had no problem having important and frank conversations.\n \n\n   \n  “I learned about STIs probably before I hit puberty,” he told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  When Porowski later called out his physician father   for broaching the subject of sexually transmitted infections when he was quite young, his dad’s response was, “Well you know what, you had to know and you were going to find out at some point anyway.”\n \n\n   \n  Porowski – whose mother, sister and grandfather also have medical backgrounds – grew up around science and having conversations about health, sexual and otherwise, and he says he feels privileged to have had that access to helpful information early on. It’s one of the reasons he’s partnering with pharmaceutical company Gilead to promote HIV prevention and having open discussions about sexual health.\n \n\n   \n  “The more you talk about it, anything that’s uncomfortable, the less precious it becomes. It loses its power,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski’s involvement in the  campaign  comes at a time of  unprecedented  cutbacks on DEI programs, which among many other things contain efforts designed to help people realize and achieve sexual wellness through access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP, drugs that prevents HIV infections, which are produced by companies including Gilead) and other information. Analysis of federal data by the  New York Times  in May found that Donald Trump’s administration had scrapped more than $800 million worth of research into the health of LGBTQ+ people.\n \n\n   \n  “With all of these unfortunate initiatives, I think it pushes us more towards stigmatization, because it helps fuel the taboo and negative understandings and perceptions of a lot of things,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  “Often as we’re seeing in culture right now and in politics, the things that a lot of certain people are afraid of, they end up turning (it) into anger, and it then flips to taking away or minimizing rights because they just don’t get it,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  For Porwoski, the current political landscape and its challenges present an opportunity to “keep talking about this even more than we did.”\n \n\n   \n  “Because as much progress as we’ve made – progress isn’t linear, as I’m learning with a lot of things, especially politically,” he said. “The key for anything that is misunderstood or misperceived, I think it’s an opportunity to have a conversation about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Part of his understanding comes from his involvement on “ Queer Eye ,” which will soon premiere its tenth and final season. The show has long focused on the ongoing conversations between queer and non-queer people, and their efforts to understand one another.\n \n\n   \n  “People who we’ve met on the show who definitely leaned more on the conservative side knew us as concepts, before meeting us,” he said. “They have their ideas of what it’s like to be queer and that was it.”\n \n\n   \n  The way past that, he said, was to help them “realize that we’re someone’s kid.”\n \n\n   \n  To “get to know the person as an individual and not a concept” is “a good blanket statement for any type of intolerance or lack of embracing of diversity in our culture,” Porowski said.\n \n\n   \n  Making connections and having meaningful conversations is ultimately what Porowski comes back to, for both learning the value of tolerance and arming oneself with information for better health by having those meaningful conversations with a doctor.\n \n\n   \n  “Talk to a physician, ask the questions, that’s literally what they’re there for,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Porowski says that while he had the “great gift of being raised around science and trusting it,” he knows there are others who weren’t and don’t.\n \n\n   \n  He urges those people “who sit on the other end of the spectrum, of not trusting it” to “just shut up and put your curiosity hat on and ask questions.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ask things that you’re genuinely curious about, so that you can educate yourself,” he said. “I think we all have a responsibility to educate ourselves.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/sport/football-nfl-week-9-ravens-dolphins-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:57:00-04:00","title":"Lamar Jackson throws four TDs in dominant return from injury to lead Ravens to big win over Dolphins","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lamar Jackson made an emphatic return from a three-game absence due to a hamstring injury, throwing four touchdown passes to lead the Baltimore Ravens to a 28-6 victory over the Miami Dolphins.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Lamar Jackson made an emphatic return to  NFL  action on Thursday Night Football, throwing four touchdown passes to lead his Baltimore Ravens to a 28-6 win over the Miami Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson had missed the past three Ravens games with a hamstring injury, with Baltimore struggling in his absence.\n \n\n   \n  But with the two-time NFL MVP back in the lineup, the Ravens looked much more like themselves, piling up 338 yards of offense, 229 coming in the second half.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson connected on touchdown passes to Rashod Bateman, Charlie Kolar and twice to Mark Andrews.\n \n\n   \n  And while he didn’t look as explosive when he chose to run the ball, the 28-year-old’s return seemed to open up the running game in general, with the team racking up 150 yards on the ground, including 119 for Derrick Henry on 19 carries.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awesome,” Jackson afterwards. “It’s great to be back and get a dub.”\n \n\n   \n  It was the Dolphins, coming off a big win last week against the Atlanta Falcons, who took the lead in the first quarter with a field goal before Jackson capitalized on a fumble by Tahj Washington, connecting with Andrews for their first touchdown of the game.\n \n\n   \n  Baltimore extended its lead in the second quarter with Andrews’ second touchdown reception of the game, capping off an eight-play, 75-yard scoring drive.\n \n\n   \n  A Miami field goal just before halftime did reduce the deficit but the Dolphins failed to make any further inroads on offense after halftime, with Baltimore adding 14 points in the third quarter to ease to victory.\n \n\n   \n  “I just felt a little comfortable and our guys were ready to score,” Jackson – who finished with 204 yards on 18-of-23 passing – said. “Shoutout to the offensive line. They did great.\n \n\n   \n  “All phases, all skill positions, and our running backs, those guys were just locked in and wanted to put points on the board because we only scored twice in the first half.”\n \n\n   \n  In what was Jackson’s first action since September 28, he continued his excellent record against the Dolphins. The Florida native now has 1,405 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, one interception and a 142.9 passer rating in five starts against Miami, the highest by any single player (minimum 100 attempts) vs. a single opponent in history,  per NFL Research .\n \n\n   \n  His return to the field is timely for Baltimore which has now won two in a row to keep its season alive, improving to 3-5 on the year.\n \n\n   \n  The Ravens still face an uphill battle to make it to the postseason, but with Jackson back at the helm, that journey seems a little easier.\n \n\n   \n   According to the NFL , only four teams since the 1970 merger have made the playoffs after starting a season 1-5. But, since 1990, 21 teams have made the postseason with a 3-5 opening.\n \n\n   \n  For the Dolphins, it was another crushing defeat as they slip to 2-7 and the pressure ramps back up on head coach Mike McDaniel after their big win over Atlanta last time out.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of their games this season, the loss to the Ravens was punctuated by self-inflicted errors – Washington’s first-quarter fumble gave excellent field position to Baltimore, a false start by Larry Borom on fourth-and-1 ended a promising drive, Riley Patterson missed a close field goal and Malik Washington also fumbled in the fourth quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Miami produced its best performance of the season in Week 8 against the Falcons but Thursday’s outing will do nothing to quiet the talk around McDaniel’s future.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/business/k-shaped-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing divide in American consumer spending, known as the 'K-shaped' economy, where wealthier consumers continue to spend despite economic pressures, while lower-income households cut back due to stagnant wages, high inflation, and rising living costs.

This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy \n       \n  Analysis by David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Fact 1:  America’s  economy  and  stock market  keep growing, buoyed by  robust consumer spending  and  AI mega-growth .\n \n\n   \n   Fact 2:  Hiring is at a  standstill ,  inflation  is rising,  loan defaults  are abundant and Americans give this economy a  near-record-low rating .\n \n\n   \n  Confused? To understand how both of those things can be true, consider the burrito.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle on Wednesday reported miserable earnings and cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter. The culprit: Young and lower-income consumers (Chipotle’s core customers) are cutting back on their spending, and they’re starting to skip the guac.\n \n\n   \n  Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright on the company’s earnings call: “We’re not losing them to the competition; we’re losing them to grocery and food at home. And so, that consumer is under pressure. It is one of our core consumer cohorts. And so, they feel the pinch and we feel the pullback from them as well.”\n \n\n   \n  Boatwright said the company’s customer surveys showed many believed Chipotle was no longer affordable. People in households that bring in less than $100,000 a year drive about 40% of Chipotle’s sales.\n \n\n   \n  Another problem: 25- to 34-year-olds, who make up 25% of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s a component of a more discerning consumer, and I think most of it – the majority of it – is this massive pullback,” Boatwright said. “That household under $100,000 a year is pulling back.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, some consumers are spending like they’re from a completely different universe.\n \n\n   \n  Crocs CEO Andrew Rees noted that bifurcation on a call with analysts Thursday: “There is a portion of our North American consumers that are highly affluent. They’re buying Crocs, they’re buying other high-end brands and they are in great financial shape,” Rees said. “But there is a large portion of consumers who are nervous, they are in less-good financial shape and are being super cautious about their spending and certainly spending closer to need.”\n \n\n   \n  Or take Coke (to wash down your burrito). Coca-Cola’s Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun on a call last week with analysts said Coke’s earnings were boosted by strong demand for the company’s premium brands: Topo Chico, Smartwater and Fairlife.\n \n\n   \n  But Braun highlighted a successful two-pronged corporate strategy, noting the tough environment for lower-income consumers hasn’t changed – despite the growth in its high-end brands. That’s why Coke is also cutting sizes (and prices) on the lower end to drive sales – to “really tackle not only affordability but premiumization as well,” Braun said.\n \n\n   \n  “When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said. “The pressure on middle- and low-end income consumers is still there.”\n \n\n   \n    The ‘K-shaped’ economy\n \n\n   \n  Economists call that phenomenon a “ K-shaped ” economy: Wealthier people are spending like nothing’s wrong. Lower-income people are making significant changes to preserve their finances.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell  addressed that concept  Wednesday in a media briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “On the K-shaped economy … if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not all anecdotal: Last month, Moody’s Analytics reported that the country’s top earners  are accounting for a growing share of overall spending .\n \n\n   \n  What’s causing that divide?\n \n\n   \n  Wealthier Americans are generally invested in the surging stock market, which has gained 17% this year. They have more job security than lower-income workers. And they own homes, which  keep appreciating  in the tight-supply market.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, less-affluent Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and their wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. If they lose their jobs, the cruddy labor market is preventing them from finding a new one – the number of Americans on unemployment insurance for multiple weeks recently surged to a  four-year high . And rents, until recently, had jumped as demand for rentals explodes – because so few homes have been on the market.\n \n\n   \n    What happens next?\n \n\n   \n  A K-shaped economy can be difficult to repair. America’s economy has been increasingly bifurcated for quite some time – with the exception of a few years following the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  During those post-pandemic years, government support for workers gave lower-income Americans a leg up. For the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed.  Wages outpaced inflation , especially for lower-income workers. Interest rates were low, and homeowners refinanced like crazy to lock in historically low mortgage costs.\n \n\n   \n  But it was short-lived. The sugar rush of government stimulus checks wore off, and the economy resumed its previous trajectory. Mortgage rates rose to multi-decade highs. And, concerning for people who are getting left behind, the US government began pushing safety-net programs in the opposite direction, reducing benefits and increasing hurdles to access support.\n \n\n   \n  Those actions could widen that “K” in the future. Wider than you have to open your mouth to eat a Chipotle burrito.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/top-election-campaign-ads","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The Top 10 Fall Campaign Ads of the 2025 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the final weeks of the 2025 off-year election campaign, voters in key states like California, New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania were flooded with targeted political advertisements.

\n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Voters in Virginia, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania have been inundated with campaign ads this year, with each state hosting critical off-year elections that offer a preview of the issues and arguments both parties are grappling with ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the ads getting the most spending during the critical final weeks of the off-year campaigns.\n \n\n   \n   (Note: Ads are ranked by committee spending between September 1 and October 27. CNN limited the list below to one advertisement per committee.) \n \n\n   \n    1. ‘Threatens,’ from opponents of California Democrats’ redistricting\n \n\n   \n  The top ad of the fall campaign season comes from the leading group opposing California Democrats’ redistricting push, “No on Prop 50: Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab.” Funded largely by Charles Munger Jr.,  a longtime supporter  of nonpartisan redistricting and heir of legendary investor Charles Munger, the group’s ad urges Californians to “protect your vote and democracy” and “vote No on Prop 50.” About $5 million has been spent on the ad so far, according to media tracking firm AdImpact. Opponents of the redistricting push have been splintered and  many are increasingly pessimistic  about Tuesday’s election.\n \n\n   \n    2. ‘Texts’ from Jason Miyares, Virginia’s Republican attorney general\n \n\n   \n   Violent text messages  sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, emerged as a lightning rod in Virginia’s off- campaigns, as Republicans have leaned into sharp criticism of Jones and linked him to other Democrats. “Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?” asks one ad from incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares, Jones’ Republican opponent.\n \n\n   \n    3. ‘Obama,’ from Gavin Newsom’s allied group for California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, who has  staked significant political capital  on his state’s redistricting fight,  called in the 44th president  to help. “California, the whole nation is counting on you,” Barack Obama says in the ad.\n \n\n   \n    4. ‘Stick it to Trump,’ from Tom Steyer, backing California Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Financier Tom Steyer, a liberal mega-donor  who ran for president in 2020  and is eyeing California’s 2026 governor race,  waded into his state’s redistricting fight  earlier this month with a $12 million ad buy.  “You want to stick it to Trump? Vote yes on Prop 50,” one of his ads says. Steyer gave a boost to Democrats’ messaging campaign while also raising his profile ahead of a potential statewide run next year.\n \n\n   \n    5. ‘Predators,’ from supporters of Mikie Sherrill, Democrat running for New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s allies are running a spot accusing GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli of “voting against legislation that would protect children and young adults in cases of domestic and sexual violence,” according to a review of his record while serving in the state assembly compiled by  the New Jersey Independent . The ad warns, “Jack Ciattarelli should never be governor of New Jersey.” Ciattarelli’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the ad.\n \n\n   \n    6. ‘Day One,’ from Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign\n \n\n   \n  One of Sherrill’s top campaign ads highlights her pledge to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on day one. Energy bills have  been a top issue  for New Jersey voters this year, with spiking utility rates and soaring demand on an aging grid. In New Jersey, residential rates have climbed by up to 20%, and the tri-state Regional Plan Association  found  that “increased demand from data centers is attributed to about two-thirds of the increased prices.”\n \n\n   \n    7. ‘Same But Worse,’ from Sherrill opponents\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, too, have honed in on energy bills as a key issue in the New Jersey’s gubernatorial race. Ciattarelli has argued Sherrill would continue policies from the outgoing administration of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy that he says contribute to the crunch. “More of the same, but worse,” Ciattarelli’s ad argues.\n \n\n   \n    8. ‘Protect Your Rights,’ from Democrats in Pennsylvania’s state supreme court vote\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 20 years since a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice lost a retention election. This fall,  three of the state’s liberal justices  are on the ballot. and Republicans are pressing for the chance to potentially flip the ideological balance of the battleground state high court. An ad from a Democratic group supporting the justices links the retention elections to abortion, saying the state Supreme Court is “our last line of defense.”\n \n\n   \n    9. ‘Speaking,’ from Abigail Spanberger, Democrat running for Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor of Virginia, has plastered voters’ screens with versions of an attack ad seizing on an unflattering moment from her rival, GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. The ad splices clips of Earle-Sears declaring to a booing crowd, “I am speaking,” with criticism of Republican policies. “Winsome Earle-Sears is so far right, she’s wrong for Virginia,” the ad closes, echoing a Spanberger campaign refrain. (Earle-Sears  recently aired an ad  nodding to the “I am speaking” moment in which she says to the camera, “They pick your worst day.”)\n \n\n   \n    10. ‘Extreme Silence,’ from Spanberger opponents\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears and her Republican allies in the Virginia governor race have made transgender policies a focal point of their attack ads, criticizing Spanberger over her support for the Equality Act and pressing her for answers on youth sports and school bathrooms. An ad from one of the groups, Restoration of America PAC, claims Spanberger “is as extreme as it gets.” Spanberger has argued local school districts should decide their own youth participation policies.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Teacher shot by a 6-year-old student thought she was ‘on my way to heaven.’ What we learned from Abby Zwerner’s testimony","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abby Zwerner, a teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, was shot in the hand and chest by a 6-year-old student on January 6, 2023, during a classroom reading session.

I thought I had died,” Zwerner said with a catch in her voice as she recounted the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s   “blank look” as he aimed at her is a memory Zwerner said she can’t shake.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million  lawsuit  against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  Parker also faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect in the criminal trial against her next month.\n \n\n   \n  The case offers a window into what to expect for the upcoming criminal trial against Parker. Both trials raise questions about who is responsible when children with access to guns carry out school shootings, a pervasive problem across the country.\n \n\n   \n  As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned from Zwerner’s moving and highly anticipated testimony.\n \n\n   \n    Effects of shooting linger\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s devastating hand injury has left her unable to do everyday things like open a bottle of   water.\n \n\n   \n  “I was trying to open the bag of chips on my own multiple times, different ways — trying to hold it different ways,” she testified about a recent lunch with her attorney. “And I eventually asked you to open it.”\n \n\n   \n  Even after six surgeries, Zwerner’s hand will never be normal, an orthopedic surgeon testified this week.\n \n\n   \n  Previous testimony from doctors on her care team revealed Zwerner’s injuries were life-threatening after a bullet narrowly missed her heart. And the impacts extended beyond the physical damage, she testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner struggled to describe how she now feels around people, even loved ones, but indicated she feels a “distance” and “numbness.”\n \n\n   \n  Psychiatrist Dr. Clarence Watson testified Thursday Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  Even a planned outing to the movies to see “Hamilton,” which features a duel scene with guns, became an overwhelming task that left her in tears, Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n  When her mother asked her what she wanted to do instead, she felt resigned.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember saying or telling them, ‘nowhere, like I can’t go anywhere. I just want to stay home,’” Zwerner said.\n \n\n   \n    Defense tries to undercut teacher’s testimony\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination Thursday, an attorney for Parker worked to undermine Zwerner’s claims that the shooting has limited her willingness to go out in public.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had been emotionally ready to attend concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school, worked and frequented a gym if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, her doctor had cleared her to do light workouts and she tried her best to do that with weights, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  The defense also pressed Zwerner on whether there was more she could have done after learning of the possible gun threat.\n \n\n   \n  Another school staffer told her about the boy potentially having a gun and she did not inform Parker because she knew the other staffer was going to, Zwerner testified.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorneys are trying to paint a picture that Zwerner may have been “a little bit at fault” for not acting on information that she had, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “That can be the basis for the defendant not being held negligent and having to pay damages, even if the defendant is more at fault, or mostly at fault,” Brown said .   \n \n\n   \n    What’s next\n \n\n   \n  The jury will reconvene Monday morning in the ongoing civil trial — which could be a roadmap for what’s to come with the criminal litigation against Parker.\n \n\n   \n  Holding civil cases before criminal ones is “really unusual,” Brown said. It may be because Parker waived her right to a speedy trial, and because the defense wants it that way, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that defense would want the civil trial to go forward first, because they’re not going to be able to avoid it, and it gives them a lot of information about what would come in at the criminal trial,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  While Zwerner’s pain and suffering have taken center stage in this trial, the upcoming   criminal trial would be more likely to touch on what action Parker failed to take, given her duty to protect children, Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “The more important evidence for the prosecution would be from other witnesses and sources that reveal what the defendant knew with respect to the threat the child posed, and whether he had a gun,” the professor said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/economy/us-government-shutdown-economy-snowball","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"As the shutdown drags on, here’s how it can drag down the economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the federal government shutdown enters its longest phase on record, experts warn it could severely damage the U.S. economy.

Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters on  artificial intelligence  and other technologies – in turn putting to the test that “low-fire” descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  Considering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.\n \n\n   \n  “However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote in a note earlier this month. “This would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.”\n \n\n   \n  US consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board’s latest index released this week.\n \n\n   \n    Health care and the care economy\n \n\n   \n  The expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at the  crux of the Congressional stalemate  to fund the federal government and end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, while  Republicans say they won’t negotiate  until the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace are  expected to see their monthly premium leap  by 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.\n \n\n   \n  Also on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk of  losing access to Head Start programs , which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.\n \n\n   \n  Any center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown to  negatively impact labor force participation  (particularly  for women ), productivity growth and overall economic growth.\n \n\n   \n    Spending\n \n\n   \n  The lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.\n \n\n   \n  “And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  There’s the job that doesn’t get filled, the trip that doesn’t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn’t occur.\n \n\n   \n  “At some point, things start to break because they’re just not getting done,” added Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.”\n \n\n   \n  If the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, “there’s no coming back from that quickly,” he said, adding that will cause “damage that’s longer-lasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remained  largely resilient , despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.\n \n\n   \n  However, it’s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or  “K-shaped” economy . Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.\n \n\n   \n    Prices and interest rates\n \n\n   \n  A drawn-out shutdown could inject further “crosscurrents” into an already  choppy price environment , Zandi said.\n \n\n   \n  On one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it’s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.\n \n\n   \n  “The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason to  continue cutting interest rates , he added.\n \n\n   \n  “The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,” he said. “This [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.”\n \n\n   \n    The human impact\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.\n \n\n   \n  Most Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,” Zandi said. “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.”\n \n\n   \n  A lack of funding for safety net programs,  particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.\n \n\n   \n  “It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” KPMG economist Swonk said. “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-senate-filibuster-nuclear-option-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00.000Z","title":"Trump calls for end of Senate filibuster to break funding stalemate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has called on Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Senate filibuster as a decisive step to end a weeklong government shutdown, arguing that doing so would immediately resolve the funding impasse.

And it immediately ratcheted up the pressure on Republican leaders, who have adamantly opposed eliminating the  60-vote threshold for passing legislation  as a way to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump on Thursday appeared to abruptly change course, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the  longest-ever government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n   Critical food aid  for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend.

it’s advantage Xi \n       \n  Analysis by Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:50 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the dust begins to clear around a  less-than-two hour meeting  between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump at an airbase in South Korea on Thursday, it’s clear that China’s leaders have stacked up another win for their hardball strategy with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting did not secure a broad trade deal, but rather a return to an uneasy truce built on a handful of agreements meant to keep the relationship steady as the two sides move toward one.\n \n\n   \n  Xi walked away with a 10% reduction in 30% tariffs newly imposed by Trump on Chinese goods this year – in exchange for   ramping up efforts to control its role in the US fentanyl crisis. He also secured US agreement to put on hold a new rule that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American tech.\n \n\n   \n  Trump averted Beijing imposing an expanded set of restrictions that could have hamstrung global industries reliant on China’s rare earths minerals. China will also ramp up purchases of US soybeans and other agricultural products, US officials said. Both sides also paused port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors and will extend a truce on more elevated tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  On paper, it looks like a reasonable exchange – and one that delivers, at least for now, what both leaders (and the wider global economy) wanted: stability after a tumultuous year of sparring between the world’s economic heavyweights.\n \n\n   \n  But for Beijing, the agreements – which came with a side of effusive praise from Trump for Xi – are also a clear confirmation of the success of its strategy in how to handle Trump 2.0.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because Beijing has been able to win valuable concessions on tariffs and export controls, while primarily conceding measures they only put out as retaliation against those from the US in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  Take soybeans, a key American export that saw Chinese purchases plunge this year over trade frictions.\n \n\n   \n  China agreed to purchase a minimum of 25 million metric tons of American soybeans annually for the next three years, US agricultural secretary Brooke Rollins  said  after the talks.\n \n\n   \n  But that baseline is still 1.8 million metric tons less than China’s soybean purchases last year, before the tensions, according to  US data .\n \n\n   \n  China’s highly nationalistic and censor-curated internet clocked all this on Friday, when social media commenters praised how “China really nailed this tariff war,” and observed that “Trump finally dealt with the mess Trump created.”\n \n\n   \n    China’s game plan\n \n\n   \n  The outlook is not all rosy for China.\n \n\n   \n  Even as tariffs from this year’s US trade spat have been whittled down to 20%, Chinese exporters still face what on average amounts to nearly 50% duties on their goods, with pre-existing duties factored in. That rate remains among the highest imposed on any country by the US. Washington meanwhile has seen  real progress  on its goal to narrow their trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  And, while the deal has yet to be inked, Beijing may have made some true concessions on the fate of the social media app TikTok, after changing its tune on staunch opposition to a US law requiring the app’s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its US business.\n \n\n   \n  China also remains blocked from accessing the highest-end US chips, a key weapon in the high-stakes AI race playing out between the two countries.\n \n\n   \n  But on the tech front, Beijing’s ability to push back by at least a year the new US rule which would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American technologies, is a major boon for Chinese firms.\n \n\n   \n  The now-suspended US effort to close loopholes could have ensnared some 20,000 more companies than are already on the list, according to  an analysis  by business intelligence firm WireScreen.\n \n\n   \n  That’s another win for Beijing’s strategy of using its near-total grip on the global rare earths supply chain as leverage against the US – a tactic it also deployed during a tariff escalation earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  And on China’s side, agreeing to defer for at least a year its expanded export control regime on rare earth minerals, which it announced as retaliation for the US blacklist expansion, is unlikely to be seen as a major setback in Beijing.\n \n\n   \n  As one Chinese scholar, foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, told CNN earlier this month, those measures were a “nuclear” option that Beijing knew wasn’t symmetrical – “but if China doesn’t use this weapon, China has little left to bargain with.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether Xi and Trump can manage to keep the detente as they work toward a broader deal and expected visits to each other’s countries in 2026 is the next big question.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, after all, knows first-hand that a trade truce struck with Trump  can quickly collapse. \n \n\n   \n  A range of pitfalls, both foreseeable and unexpected, in the US and China’s expansive rivalry could derail the newly-reached stabilty – and whatever deal is ultimately reached is  unlikely to address the deep-seated, structural issues between the two. \n \n\n   \n  But as Trump took off from South Korea’s Gimhae International Airport on Thursday, to return to a US stuck in the quagmire of a frozen government,   Xi stayed on  to join an international summit and tout China as a beacon for globalization, it’s clear the balance of power between them has shifted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/polls-election-major-races","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"What the Polls Say About Key Races in 2025 Off-Year Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes polling data from key off-year elections in 2025, focusing on Virginia, New Jersey, New York City, and California.

races this election? \n       \n  By Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  We’re just days away from 2025’s off-year elections. Beyond how the races themselves turn out, the contests will be a valuable source of data to analyze – and perhaps overanalyze – ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s an overview of what the polls suggest about the four big races we’re watching this year.\n \n\n   \n  A note: Polls are a valuable tool for understanding the electorate, but they’re most useful when they’re treated as estimates rather than attempts to predict the future with pinpoint precision. Often, what they tell us about the broader political environment is more valuable than the exact margin that any specific survey finds for a race.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia statewide races\n \n\n   \n   Virginia’s election for governor  takes place in the shadow of an unpopular GOP administration in Washington, DC.  A Washington Post-Schar School poll  asked voters to describe the most important issue in the race. The share who responded with negative comments about President Donald Trump or Republicans came second only to concerns about economic issues and the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  The Post-Schar poll, which found Democrat Abigail Spanberger with a 12-point lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears among likely voters, joins  other recent   surveys  in the state that show Spanberger with a stable advantage in the race. There’s much more uncertainty in the other statewide races, particularly the campaign for attorney general, where polls show support for Democrat Jay Jones facing some erosion after  the publication of text messages  in which he fantasized about killing a legislative colleague.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey’s gubernatorial race  is a tale of two incumbents: Trump is unpopular there as well, but the state’s outgoing Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, also draws closely divided ratings for his time in office. Many recent surveys of the race, including polls from  Quinnipiac University ,  F ox News,   Fairleigh Dickinson University  and the  Rutgers-Eagleton Poll , have found Democrat Mikie Sherrill with an edge among likely voters, hovering around the 50% mark, while her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, stands closer to 45%.\n \n\n   \n  Quinnipiac’s latest poll, like several others, found that Ciattarelli’s supporters were more likely than Sherrill’s to express strong enthusiasm about their chosen candidate, although Sherrill’s favorability ratings remained higher overall.\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n   New York City’s multi-candidate mayoral race  poses a unique challenge for pollsters. Surveys of likely voters, however, have been largely consistent in showing Democrat Zohran Mamdani with a double-digit lead over his nearest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, with Republican Curtis Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  In polls released Thursday by  Marist College  and  Fox News , Mamdani was buoyed by positive favorability ratings and broad support among younger voters, while older voters broke for Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n    California redistricting\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps nowhere is the role of national politics as clear as in California, where  voters are weighing Proposition 50 , a ballot measure to temporarily enact a new congressional map drawn by Democrats in response to Republican-driven redistricting in other states.\n \n\n   \n  A mid-October poll from  CBS/YouGov  found 62% of likely voters in support of Proposition 50, while  an October Public Policy Institute of California poll  put that support at 56%. It’s worth noting that  past research has found  that polling sometimes overshoots support for initiatives that implement new changes – whether liberal or conservative – because some voters default to preferring the status quo.\n \n\n   \n  Half of likely voters said in the CBS/YouGov poll that their decision had more to do with national issues and politics than with state or local issues. Broad majorities of likely voters supporting Proposition 50 said their choice was driven by the desire to oppose Trump, to oppose national Republicans and to support national Democrats.\n \n\n   \n    A note on the state of polling\n \n\n   \n  How have polls been performing lately? A  new postmortem report on 2024 election polling , released Wednesday by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, found that polling in last year’s election was significantly more accurate than it was in 2020 or 2016 even as it continued to underestimate Republican vote shares for the third straight presidential cycle. (Polls in the 2022 and 2018 midterms both saw smaller directional errors.)\n \n\n   \n  As the report also noted, polls last year weren’t always able to estimate the ways that turnout changed between 2020 and 2024. That bears mentioning because all of these surveys reflect pollsters’ best estimations about who’s likely to end up voting in an off-year election – and how much that might differ from four years ago, at the start of former President Joe Biden’s administration.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/politics/government-shutdown-billions-federal-aid-dries-up","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"‘I feel guilty eating a meal’: Low-income families prepare to lose access to billions in federal aid","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown continues, millions of low-income Americans are facing dire consequences, with key social safety net programs—such as SNAP (food stamps), Head Start (childcare and early education), and LIHEAP (energy assistance)—being suspended or delayed.

Khurshudyan, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Annemarie King is eating only once a day, and her husband, Randall, is picking up extra shifts at the drywall factory where he works. They are among the nearly 42 million Americans preparing for their food stamp benefits to run dry in November because of the ongoing  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The Kings, who live in Cincinnati and have eight young children, depend on the roughly $1,000 in food stamps that they receive at the start of every month to stock their refrigerator with fresh fruits, vegetables and meat.\n \n\n   \n  But since the US Department of Agriculture  announced in mid-October  that it doesn’t have the funding to provide next month’s benefits during the government shutdown, Annemarie, a stay-at-home mother, has been buying more canned and boxed items and preparing less for dinner.\n \n\n   \n  She’s also going without food herself. Her 11-year-old son has noticed, she said, but she tells him not to worry and that she ate while he was at school.\n \n\n   \n  “I feel guilty eating a meal,” Annemarie said. “I don’t want to take food away from them.”\n \n\n   \n  As the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it’s not just furloughed federal workers feeling the financial strain. Low-income households across the country will lose access to  key social safety net programs  in the coming days as billions of dollars in federal funding dries up.\n \n\n   \n  Beginning November 1, more than 65,000 children and families could lose access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources, according to the National Head Start Association. For some parents, that means they might have to quit their jobs because they won’t have child care anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Others are worried they might not get heat subsidies from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program before the winter months. On top of that, roughly 24 million Americans who receive health insurance through the Affordable Care Act are preparing for what is likely to be a  significant increase  in premiums next year.\n \n\n   \n  In interviews with people in cities across the country, the early implications of the stop in federal funding for low-income families are starting to come into focus. Food banks and other charities are expecting higher demand, as millions face increasingly desperate situations without the programs they rely on.\n \n\n   \n  At the Kings’ household, the loss of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, means that instead of serving chicken, a fresh vegetable and either mashed potatoes or macaroni and cheese, Annemarie has been cooking chicken and canned green beans. Chilis, pastas and roasts are on the menu more often since they can last for a few days.\n \n\n   \n  “Our family is suffering because neither side will compromise,” Annemarie said of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.  “It’s no longer a Democrat thing, it’s no longer a Republican thing. It’s our lives.”\n \n\n   \n  The status of SNAP funding for November is currently uncertain, however. A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight between Democratic-led states and the Trump administration over its US Department of Agriculture’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to provide benefits next month.\n \n\n   \n  However the judge rules, millions of Americans will not receive their food stamp benefits on time. An estimated 4.4 million people will be affected on November 1 alone, according to estimates from Code for America, which works with all levels of government to improve access to food assistance and other safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n   Food pantries  around the country are preparing for a surge in demand next week if people don’t receive their SNAP stipends. But food bank directors have warned that they can provide only a fraction of the meals that are supplied by federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  And for some households, the loss of more than one of these programs has a compounding effect.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, Ohio – about an hour outside Cincinnati – the closure of the local Head Start program means Lauren Lowe, 42, will likely have to quit her job as a restaurant server. She and her husband were able to both work full time while their 4-year-old son, Carter, attended Head Start on weekdays.\n \n\n   \n  He and 176 other kids got meals and health care there. And he loved his friends and teachers, Lowe said. Since she’s had to tell him that this will be his last week in the program, Carter is “broken-hearted right now. He’s crying every single morning because he wants to be in school with his friends,” Lowe said.\n \n\n   \n  Lowe is feeling uneasy, too. Quitting her job means less income for the household – in addition to missing their food stamp benefits. \n \n\n   \n  “It’s really scary because, how do we make ends meet?” Lowe said. “I either stay home and school my child or figure out how we’re going to pay the bills to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  Lowe will also have to replace the two meals Carter was getting every day he was at Head Start.\n \n\n   \n  “On Monday mornings, kids do come in hungrier than usual, so we know they’re really dependent on that breakfast, lunch and snack we give them,” said Julia Wise, the executive director of the Highland County Community Action Organization, which runs the Hillsboro Head Start program. \n \n\n   \n  Wise said 45 Head Start staff will be furloughed on Monday. Other Head Start programs — particularly those run by larger entities, such as nonprofits, school districts and local governments — can limp along by drawing on community support or taking out lines of credit.\n \n\n   \n  In the Kansas City area, 17 programs with grants expiring on November 1 decided to take a “financial risk” by staying open, said Kasey Lawson, the Head Start director for the Mid-America Regional Council. The providers do not know if they will be reimbursed later when the new grant year is funded.\n \n\n   \n  In Hillsboro, teachers prepared homework packets that will take the kids through the end of November, so they can keep studying even when the program is closed. Some of that staff will likely   get other jobs before the government shutdown ends, meaning whenever Head Start does get funding again, it might not have enough educators to reopen all its classrooms, Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  For those who can’t find other work, “they’re going on furlough, they’re not going to have money coming in, so they could apply for SNAP benefits, but now SNAP is not going to be available either,” Wise said.\n \n\n   \n  “This is impacting us across the board,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  In rural Oregon, where the temperatures are already dipping below the freezing mark, the suspension of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is putting lives at risk, said Sheri Gutierrez, energy program manager at Community Action Program of East Central Oregon, a nonprofit that provides a range of services for residents in need.\n \n\n   \n  The $4 billion program, which helps nearly 6 million people pay their utility bills, is not in as immediate danger as SNAP and Head Start; the aid is typically distributed to utility companies between mid-November and early December.\n \n\n   \n  But barely a month into the season, Community Action in Oregon already has more than $200,000 in grant payments that are on hold until the government reopens. Many of its clients heat their homes with propane, wood and heating oil, and they don’t enjoy the same continuous service and shutoff protections available to many people who use electricity and natural gas to stay warm.\n \n\n   \n  The delay has worried local residents, some of whom are using old space heaters or their ovens, which Gutierrez says aren’t safe.\n \n\n   \n  “We hear the desperation when speaking to these clients on a daily basis. People want reassurance that they will get assistance,” she said. “LIHEAP is lifesaving. Without heat, they won’t survive.”\n \n\n   \n  In Lakeville, Minnesota, Ronda Beck is also waiting for help from LIHEAP to cover the electric bill. After speaking with her utility company “at great length,” Beck was told she could pay whatever she can until her grant is funded and she won’t be disconnected. But she’s not sure how she’ll scrape together a couple of bucks since she’s not working.\n \n\n   \n  “Where do I get $5 from?” She said. “It’s a tough situation.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck figured she could survive on groceries she picks up from her local food pantries if she and her adult son stop receiving food stamps next month – that is until she found out on Tuesday that one of the groups is only providing two or three days of food, instead two weeks’ worth. Now, she’s terrified.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to go hungry,” said Beck, who along with her son is looking for jobs in Lakeville, Minnesota, where they live. “I don’t want to walk into [a food pantry] and have them say, ‘We’re at our limit’.”\n \n\n   \n  Just outside Washington DC, Willissa Bullock worries about her food bank running out, as it’s dealing with a surge in demand from furloughed federal workers in the area. When the Landover, Maryland, resident heard that the USDA would not issue benefits next month, Bullock says she cried – nervous about how she would provide for her kids, who are in college.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, Bullock left a local food pantry run by No Limits Outreach Ministries with only enough items – including lettuce, apple juice, and canned goods – to last two or three days. Until recently, her shopping cart would be overflowing.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m telling the kids to look for jobs,” said Bullock, who is unemployed and applying for disability after having back surgery. “It’s the only way we’ll be able to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  The food pantry has been receiving fewer shipments from Capital Area Food Bank after two  Covid 19-era relief programs  were canceled earlier this year. The pantry used to be able to offer meat, fish, eggs and milk to its clients, but now it mostly has beans, rice and canned foods, said Oliver Carter, pastor of No Limits Outreach Ministries.\n \n\n   \n  “Our storage used to be full and now it’s almost empty,” Carter said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/apec-summit-xi-trump-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:43:00Z","title":"China’s Xi in the limelight at Pacific summit with Trump conspicuous by his absence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, China’s President Xi Jinping takes a leading role in diplomatic engagement, hosting high-profile meetings with Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Canada’s Mark Carney, amid the conspicuous absence of US President Donald Trump.

October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, are gathering in South Korea for a major summit Friday. But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his  landmark meeting  with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to  de-escalate the protracted trade conflict  between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi stepped into the limelight and will hold high-profile meetings, including with Japan’s new leader Sanae Takaichi and Canada’s Mark Carney.\n \n\n   \n  Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs loom over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is standing in for Trump during the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  In his opening remarks to the forum, Xi called for unity and cooperation between the grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific.\n \n\n   \n  “The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”\n \n\n   \n  “China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year is on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.\n \n\n   \n  “We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “As the free trade order undergoes dramatic changes, global economic uncertainty is deepening, and trade and investment are losing momentum.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee said that “only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s three-leg tour of Asia, which stopped in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, was generally regarded as a success for all parties, with Asian leaders putting on a  masterclass in hospitality  and flattery as they sought to get the president on side — and ease trade negotiations in the process.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s meeting with Xi ended in a trade agreement that called for the US to lower tariffs on China by 10%, bringing the effective rate on Chinese exports down to 47%; and for China to delay some export controls on rare earths and resume purchases of American soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  In Japan, Trump and freshly appointed Prime Minister Takaichi embarked on a “new golden age” of relations and signed a critical minerals agreement. And a new trade deal reached with Lee would see South Korea invest billions of dollars in the US, including in shipbuilding, aerospace and technology,  according  to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Xi met Japan’s Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.\n \n\n   \n  Xi told Takaichi that China was ready to “work with Japan for constructive, stable bilateral ties that meet requirements of the new era,” Chinese state Xinhua reported.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi faces a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing  mounting economic woes. \n \n\n   \n  Xi also held meetings with Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, according to Chinese state media.\n \n\n   \n  In comments that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”\n \n\n   \n  Canada, he said, was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/prince-andrew-title-and-honors-remove-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:23:00-04:23","title":"King Charles strips his brother Andrew of ‘prince’ title and evicts him from royal mansion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"King Charles has taken unprecedented steps to distance the British royal family from Prince Andrew by formally stripping him of his royal titles, including Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killyleagh, and evicting him from Royal Lodge.

Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Max Foster, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:23 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles took  the extraordinary step  of starting the process to strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from the royal estate in Windsor, in the most dramatic attempt yet to quell the scandal over the disgraced prince’s links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n \n\n   \n  The move, described in stark terms by Buckingham Palace as “necessary censures,” cements the deepest split in the British royal family in decades. The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with  Epstein  from engulfing the monarchy.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”\n \n\n   \n  Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”\n \n\n   \n  In the statement, Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out of his residence and take the family name. “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His  lease on Royal Lodge  has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.\n \n\n   \n  It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing  use of his titles  earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status  could be removed  by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.\n \n\n   \n  CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.\n \n\n   \n  “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  In his interview with CNN, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”\n \n\n   \n  Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n \n\n   \n    Calls for Andrew to face justice continue\n \n\n   \n  The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”\n \n\n   \n  The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the British monarch was  heckled by a protester  who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.\n \n\n   \n    Andrew’s daughters to retain princess titles\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.\n \n\n   \n  Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.\n \n\n   \n  The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

Mohammad Al Sawalhi, Tal Shalev, Ibrahim Dahman and Oren Liebermann, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:02 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israel received the remains two deceased hostages held in Gaza on Thursday afternoon. The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.\n \n\n   \n  The deceased hostages were identified as Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper, 84, was one of the founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza. He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.\n \n\n   \n  Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional development.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/fbi-fires-agent-trump-investigations","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"12:05:00.000Z","title":"FBI fires special agent who helped oversee Trump investigation, sources say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI has fired Aaron Tapp, a special agent with over 20 years of experience who previously oversaw investigations into former President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, including the 'Arctic Frost' probe into a fake electors scheme.

San Antonio office, was previously the deputy assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters. There for a time he had oversight of probes into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  One of these investigations — known as Arctic Frost — focused on the fake electors scheme, in which Trump allies sought to have Trump electors counted as electoral college votes from states that Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Republicans have released FBI records showing details of the Arctic Frost investigation and accused Smith and FBI leaders of political motives in using grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone records of nine GOP lawmakers.

And the government is more shut than ever.\n \n\n   \n  Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that  behind-the-scenes efforts  were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  But the day ended with senators skipping town for the weekend — to join members of the House not seen inside the Beltway for so long it’s hard to remember what they look like.\n \n\n   \n  What’s so galling is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring  enhanced Obamacare subsidies , without which millions of citizens will see  the cost of health care rocket .\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again. Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.\n \n\n   \n  The result:  Vital SNAP benefits  that help feed more than 40 million people are within hours of running out. Federal workers deemed essential have slogged through demoralizing weeks without pay. And it’s no vacation for their furloughed colleagues either: Financial obligations aren’t shut down just because the government is.\n \n\n   \n  Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure  on air traffic controllers , implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies. And President Donald Trump — perhaps the sole agent with the capacity to change the political wind and end the shutdown — didn’t really say anything until a late-night post calling on GOP senators to  abolish the filibuster  to end the funding stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  West Virginia Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said staying in town over the weekend “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,”  Fetterman told CNN . He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    One judge says she won’t let people die\n \n\n   \n  Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.\n \n\n   \n  But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.\n \n\n   \n  One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed.  US District Judge Indira Talwani  signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.\n \n\n   \n    Is there any hope for a breakthrough?\n \n\n   \n  Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.\n \n\n   \n  But at some point, this shutdown will end. It has to.\n \n\n   \n  If the denouement does not come from a president who discovers a moral or political imperative to live up to his 2016 convention vow, “I alone can fix it,” it may emerge from a creative fudge in the Senate in which Republicans give a handful of Democratic senators political cover to vote to break the filibuster and reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  Majority Leader John Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to rage at Democrats in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.\n \n\n   \n  One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.\n \n\n   \n  Therefore, in the absence of progress, everyone had to fill the space.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now beginning Day 30 of the Democrat shutdown,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana. “There are millions of Americans … that are bracing themselves for further pain and hardship.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the administration of enacting “policy violence” by refusing to extend Obamacare subsidies while offering a  $20 billion bailout  to Trump’s MAGA pal President Javier Milei in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”\n \n\n   \n  And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not exactly promising.\n \n\n   \n  But Thune told reporters, “I’m always optimistic. Aren’t you?”\n \n\n   \n  That’s a tough one, senator.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/oakland-california-museum-theft","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"Over 1,000 Items Stolen from California Museum in Early Morning Heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major early morning heist on October 15, 2025, over 1,000 items from the Oakland Museum of California were stolen, including jewelry by Florence Resnikoff, Native American baskets, scrimshaw walrus tusks, and 20th-century memorabilia.

collection in early morning heist \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:45 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Police in California are investigating the theft of more than 1,000 items from a museum’s collection including metalwork jewelry, Native American baskets and everyday items like athletic trophies that tell the story of the Golden State.\n \n\n   \n  The burglary occurred in the early morning hours of Oct. 15 at an off-site storage facility of the Oakland Museum of California, Oakland Police said in a news release Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Lori Fogarty, the museum’s director, said Thursday the investigation was going public because the artifacts might show up at flea markets, antique stores or pawn shops.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not just a loss to the museum,” she said. “They’re a loss to the public, to our community and we’re hoping our community can help us bring them home.”\n \n\n   \n  Fogarty said it appeared to be a crime of opportunity, and not a targeted art theft.\n \n\n   \n  “We think the thieves found a way to enter the building, and they grabbed what they could easily find and snatch and get out of the building with,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Stolen items include neckpieces by the late artist and metalsmith Florence Resnikoff, a pair of scrimshaw walrus tusks and Native American baskets. But she said much of it was historical memorabilia from the 20th century such as campaign pins and athletic awards.\n \n\n   \n  The mission of the Oakland Museum of California is to document the art, history and natural environment of California, and its collection includes works by California artists from the late 18th century to the present, a well as artifacts, photographs, natural specimens and sound recordings. The museum has mounted shows dedicated to the Black Power movement and student activism.\n \n\n   \n  John Romero, a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain who led the department’s commercial crimes unit, told the  Los Angeles Times  that the items may already have been sold since the burglary occurred two weeks ago. He expects detectives are looking at resale platforms such as Craigslist and Ebay, and networks that specialize in historic or collectible antiques.\n \n\n   \n  “These people are interested in fast cash, not the full appraisal value,” he told the Times. “They need to get rid of it quickly.”\n \n\n   \n  In January 2013, an Oakland man broke into the museum itself and got away with a California Gold Rush-era jewelry box. Fogarty said the the item was traced to a pawn shop with help from the public, and she hopes the community can help again.\n \n\n   \n  The Oakland Police Department declined to provide further details, but said in its news release that police are working with a unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that specializes in art crime, including theft, forgery or antiquities and cultural property trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  The theft occurred four days before thieves made off with  priceless Napoleonic jewels  from the world’s most-visited museum, the Louvre, in broad daylight. Authorities have  made arrests  but the jewels have not been recovered.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/wnba-players-union-cba-extension","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-04:00","title":"WNBA and Players Union Agree to 30-Day Extension for CBA Negotiations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The WNBA and players' union have agreed to a 30-day extension of their collective bargaining agreement negotiations, pushing the deadline to November 30, 2025.

expensive rents. Some live in ‘haunted’ houses to cut a deal \n       \n  By Chris Lau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In land-starved Hong Kong a tiny, no-frills apartment far from the city center can eat up half of a monthly salary. But for bold renters there’s one sure way to get a discount: choose a property haunted by a murder or unnatural death.\n \n\n   \n  The houses, often apartments inside the city’s tall residential buildings, strike so much fear among residents that anyone willing to live there can negotiate hefty discounts in one of the world’s most expensive property markets.\n \n\n   \n  “The discount could be massive and many people who don’t mind can rent these places below the market price” said Ng Goon-lau, an investor so well-known for owning dozens of these apartments that local media has dubbed him the “King of Haunted Houses.”\n \n\n   \n  Lists of haunted houses can be found on most estate agent websites. They are places where an unnatural or premature death has occurred and include the scenes of some of the city’s most gruesome murders.\n \n\n   \n  Property-listing website Spacious.hk compiles a 92-page list that dates back to 2006, featuring details of how each death occurred. In a city known for its tightly packed residential towers, many entries state the cause of death as “fell from height.”\n \n\n   \n  Other real estate agencies  offer advice  about how to identify spooky apartments, including checking death certificates and quizzing potential neighbors about the apartment’s history.\n \n\n   \n  In a city heavily influenced by Buddhism and Taoism, living in apartments associated with ghastly deaths often stokes fear of bad fortune.\n \n\n   \n  Feng shui master Andrew Kwan said people believe that those who died a tragic death may not get closure. “Their hatred may stay. (Their spirit) may remain in the apartment,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The fear of a curse has created a unique market for bargain-hunting investors and tenants who are happy to try their luck.\n \n\n   \n  Property prices plunge by an average of 20% after they are labelled haunted – and up to 34% in the event of a murder, according to Utpal Bhattacharya, Chair Professor of Finance at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who led a study on the phenomena in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  A ripple effect spreads to properties on the same floor, which often see their value drop 10%, and even flats in the same building can fall 7%, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The belief in Feng Shui is quite strong among Chinese, and the population in Hong Kong is about 94% Chinese…implying that most buyers have a large distaste for haunted houses,” said Bhattacharya.\n \n\n   \n  Disclosure is not required under Hong Kong law, but regulators demand property agents provide accurate information about any death upon inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  These details matter because the circumstance of the death – from accidents to malicious murders – could determine the size of the discount.\n \n\n   \n    Turning bad fortune into dollars\n \n\n   \n  In death, Ng, a veteran investor in his 70s, sees opportunity. He scoops up the so-called haunted homes from owners who are desperate to sell, and leases them out at up to 30% below market price.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people don’t actually have a strong feeling against hung zaats. It all comes down to the extent of the discount,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the prevailing mood of the city is to stay away – or at least be cautious.\n \n\n   \n  That especially applies to properties linked to some of the city’s most chilling murder cases.\n \n\n   \n  In 2014, British banker Rurik Jutting  brutally murdered two Indonesian women  and hid one of the bodies in a suitcase in his upscale apartment in J Residence in Wan Chai, a popular nightlife district in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  As gruesome details of the murders emerged, the value of the one-bedroom apartment where they took place was estimated to have plunged from $1.16 million to $770,000, with its $3,740 monthly rental halved, Bloomberg reported at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Another unit in Tsuen Wan, a residential neighborhood in the New Territories, was sold at a loss of $142,000, shaving 40% off the original price, according to local news reports. The unit was the scene of a money-fueled murder in 2016 involving three men, who killed their friend and sealed his body in a slab of cement stored in the unit.\n \n\n   \n  Owners of the properties are almost certain to lose money. It’s very difficult to find a buyer for homes listed as a haunted house – partly because banks also tend to stay away.\n \n\n   \n  Eric Pau, Senior Associate Director at Ricacorp Properties, a major real estate firm in Hong Kong, told CNN many banks view them as high-risk investments. “In most cases, mortgages will not be granted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But he said others see it as an opportunity. As an investor, Ng’s playbook is to be selective about the type of “haunted homes” he buys.\n \n\n   \n  He tries to avoid properties associated with gruesome murders as much as possible and looks for places where the death occurred some time ago.\n \n\n   \n  “Fortunately, some ‘haunted houses’ have been around for so long that people have forgotten about what happened,” he said. “The main thing is to make people not to feel sad and unpleasant.”\n \n\n   \n  But like all investments, there are risks, and Ng has had some spooky failures.\n \n\n   \n  One time, he said, a tenant broke the lease just days after moving in. The tenant never told him why, so he turned to the neighbors.\n \n\n   \n  “The neighbors told me that the three-year-old son of this tenant opened a very difficult book in the middle of the night and read it attentively,” Ng recalled being told.\n \n\n   \n  “He thought his son was possessed,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/zohran-mamdani-nypd-idf-video","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-20:42","title":"Mamdani Clarifies Statement About NYPD Boots Laced by IDF, Faces Scrutiny in Mayoral Campaign","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic mayoral nominee in New York City, is facing renewed scrutiny over a 2023 comment at a Democratic Socialists of America convention in which he claimed the NYPD's boots were laced by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), implying a link between U.S. and Israeli law enforcement in oppression.

The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, are the armed forces of Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “We have to make, not specifically that example all the time, but just to say that for working-class people who have very little time, who have so many stresses, who are under so many pressures, there isn’t that much time for symbolism,” he then said. “We have to make it materially connected to their life.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Anderson Cooper played that clip Tuesday and asked Mamdani what he meant.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a reference to training exercises that have taken place between the NYPD and the IDF,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  “So do you still believe that the NYPD is basically working hand in glove with the IDF?” Cooper asked.\n \n\n   \n  “No, what I’ve made very clear is those are training exercises that are of concern to me,” Mamdani replied. “And what my focus is, is on working with the NYPD to actually deliver public safety for New Yorkers across the five boroughs.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mamdani would seek as mayor to end any training exercises or other cooperation between the NYPD and Israel. But the clip – and Mamdani’s explanation of it – became the latest instance during the mayoral campaign where the Democratic nominee had to answer for his past criticisms of both Israel and the police.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has apologized for some of his comments about law enforcement, including social media posts in which he called the police racist, wicked and corrupt. Seeking to reassure voters concerned about public safety, he has said he would seek to retain NYPD Commissioner  Jessica Tisch , though he acknowledged in an earlier interview with CNN’s Gloria Pazmino that he hadn’t spoken to Tisch about staying on.\n \n\n   \n  But he has not backed down on his criticisms of Israel, referring to its war in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7 attacks as a genocide. He has said that as mayor, he would seek to carry out an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  While Americans are  increasingly skeptical  of Israel’s actions in Gaza, Mamdani’s criticisms have caused anger within parts of New York’s Jewish community, the largest outside Israel. He has  sought to reassure  Jewish voters that he would fight antisemitism and provide requested security at synagogues.\n \n\n   \n  While the NYPD does not have international posts in the traditional sense, the department runs an “International Liaison Program” that stations detectives across more than a dozen countries around the globe with the purpose of developing contacts with local law enforcement and engaging in counterterrorism exercises, according to the New York City police foundation that helps fund the program.\n \n\n   \n  The program, which critics say has expanded for years with little oversight, was started after 9/11 as law enforcement professionals sought to learn more about overseas terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, the NYPD has continued to deploy senior law enforcement officers around the world, including to Israel, where they share in intelligence and training exercises.\n \n\n   \n  The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/jetblue-flight-emergency-landing-florida","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:11:00-04:00","title":"At least 15 people hospitalized after JetBlue flight drops altitude and forces emergency landing in Florida, officials say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"JetBlue flight 1230, operating from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced a sudden drop in altitude, leading to an emergency landing at Tampa International Airport on October 30, 2025.

but Britain’s weren’t. There’s now a movement to change that \n       \n  By James Frater, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EDT, Fri October 31, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While the women accused in the infamous  Salem witch  trials in colonial America have long since been pardoned, the convictions of hundreds of British women executed under similar laws officially still stand. Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that.\n \n\n   \n  Decades before Salem, hysteria over witchcraft was already sweeping through England – and perhaps nowhere more fervently than in the southeast, such as in the neighboring counties of Kent and Essex, which border London.\n \n\n   \n  Between 1560 and 1700, more than 500 women were tried for witchcraft in the southeast region, according to UK Parliament estimates. Of those, 112 were executed.\n \n\n   \n  But one trial in Maidstone, Kent, in 1652 stands out for its scale and public fascination.\n \n\n   \n  On July 30 that year, a court convened near where Maidstone Town Hall stands today. Thirty-two people faced charges ranging from theft and murder to witchcraft, Claire Kehily, councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. Six women, accused of bewitching to death a 10-day-old infant, her mother, and a 3-year-old child, became the focus of the town’s attention, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In the summer of 1652, the town was “abuzz with excitement,” Kehily explained.  “People came down from London to witness what was going on. It was the biggest thing we’d had here for a long time.”\n \n\n   \n  The accused were held in a small, dark jail that once stood on the ground floor of the courthouse, now tucked away in the attic of the rebuilt Town Hall.\n \n\n   \n  The trial’s notoriety was such that a special pamphlet was published shortly after, titled “A Prodigious and Tragic History of the Arraignment, Trial, Confession, and Condemnation of Six Witches,” of which Maidstone Council has a rare replica.\n \n\n   \n  The document describes bizarre and unverified claims – including one woman swelling “into a monstrous and vast bigness” before the court and another allegedly bearing “a visible teat under her tongue.”\n \n\n   \n  Three women were convicted after failing a crude test: a pin thrust into their arms. The court account said the women “did not feel it, neither did it draw blood.”\n \n\n   \n  Two others confessed to being impregnated “not by any man, but by the devil,” according to the document.\n \n\n   \n  All six were convicted of “the execrable and diabolical crime of witchcraft” and sentenced to death.\n \n\n   \n    Spectacle of execution\n \n\n   \n  Their execution took place at Penenden Heath, now a tranquil park with soccer fields and woodland.\n \n\n   \n  “They were dragged on hurdles – basically carts – to the heath,” Tony Harwood, a councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. “Thousands came to watch. Public executions were entertainment, but also a tool of control.”\n \n\n   \n  “These were women of all ages,” Harwood continued. “Very vulnerable individuals who had no idea what was going on or why they had been put into this situation. You just have to understand the absolute terror of these events – and that is partly what’s behind it. The powers that be wanted to instil terror.”\n \n\n   \n  Harwood described the horror and spectacle of the scene. “Public executions – they were public participation events. Thousands of people would attend. There were crime waves around them: pickpocketing, thefts, lots of complaints. That’s why the execution spot at Penenden Heath was moved several times – because of the impact from the many thousands of sightseers who came to watch,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “There would have been people who were just there for the show. There would have been people who were appalled by what was going on. There would have been people who were excited by it.”\n \n\n   \n  After the executions, the bodies were discarded without ceremony. “When roads were widened or housing built, human remains have often been found,” Harwood added.\n \n\n   \n  A small stone plaque on the edge of Penenden Heath that commemorates these women – alongside the plaques for the many other people executed at this site – is the only mark of the atrocities that took place.\n \n\n   \n    Seeking justice, centuries later\n \n\n   \n  Though the frenzy surrounding witchcraft in England faded in the decades following the Maidstone trial, and all laws criminalizing witchcraft have long since been repealed, the convictions of those women – and hundreds like them – still stand.\n \n\n   \n  Now, nearly 400 years later, Maidstone Borough Council is calling for change.\n \n\n   \n  Stuart Jeffery, leader of the council, has written to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, urging the British government to introduce legislation that would grant a general pardon to those executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1562, including the women hanged at Penenden Heath in 1652.\n \n\n   \n  “Justice is timeless,” said Harwood. “These terrible wrongs carried out between 1542 and the mid-18th century echo through the ages. They cannot just be painted over.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to set the record straight. These were innocent, vulnerable individuals who were brutally judicially murdered – often for political or personal gain. That injustice will echo down the ages.”\n \n\n   \n  Kehily said that the trials were “a very early form of violence against women and girls. It still happens. They were scapegoats.”\n \n\n   \n  “By highlighting it, we remind people that this has happened – and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  “To address a wrong that has been made,” Kehily said, “is to try and get it right, to learn from history, and to bring it to the fore. This hasn’t gone away.”\n \n\n   \n    Precedents for pardon\n \n\n   \n  Maidstone’s campaign follows similar efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to confront historical injustices.\n \n\n   \n  In Scotland, then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology in 2022 to the thousands of people – mostly women – who were accused and executed under the country’s Witchcraft Act between the 16th and 18th centuries. The apology came after a sustained campaign by historians and activists who argued that the victims were persecuted for being poor, vulnerable, or simply different.\n \n\n   \n  There is also precedent for legislative pardons.\n \n\n   \n  In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker convicted under laws criminalizing homosexuality, and in 2017 the UK government extended the pardon to thousands of other gay and bisexual men convicted under similar statutes. Known as the “Turing Law,” it marked a significant step in acknowledging the injustice of discriminatory legislation.\n \n\n   \n  Councillors in Maidstone hope that a similar approach can be taken to address the legacy of the Witchcraft Act.\n \n\n   \n  “This is about justice,” Harwood said. “We’ve seen the government take steps to right past wrongs. Now it’s time to do the same for the women who were judicially murdered under the guise of witchcraft.”\n \n\n   \n  A Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government would respond to the council’s letter “in due course.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/tech/amazon-layoffs-andy-jassy-ai-culture","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:33:00-04:00","title":"Amazon says it didn’t cut 14,000 people because of money.

October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Through the final days of this year’s campaign for New York City mayor, Andrew Cuomo has at times lived up to the nickname he earned in the early days of his political career: the prince of darkness.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo  relaunched his mayoral campaign  after his shocking Democratic primary loss, telling New Yorkers he was in it to win it in a video he filmed standing on a tree-lined sidewalk under the July sun. He would acknowledge he needed to embrace social media and address voter concerns about affordability.\n \n\n   \n  Over the four months that followed, Cuomo zigzagged between optimism about his candidacy and despair about the  possible mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani . He has described his run as the last chance New Yorkers will have to save the city from Mamdani’s  democratic socialism , once referring in a debate to the 34-year-old Mamdani as a “kid” and warning that his ideas were radical and unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s final general election ad leans on his executive experience and also questions whether Mamdani has enough.\n \n\n   \n  “Life in New York is tough right now,” he says in the ad. “Candidates who need on-the-job training can’t fix it.”\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of Tuesday’s election, early voting numbers were up dramatically ahead of the same point in 2021, reflecting the interest New Yorkers have in a mayoral race unlike any in recent memory. The latest Quinnipiac University poll had 43% of likely voters backing Mamdani versus 33% for Cuomo and 14% for Republican Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  And in a  new Marist Poll of likely New York City voters  released Thursday, Mamdani had 48% support over Cuomo’s 32% and Sliwa’s 16%. Indeed, every major poll on the race has found Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, though the vast majority have found Mamdani below 50% support, according to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Director of Polling and Analytics.\n \n\n   \n  With the exception of Fox’s survey earlier this month, every high-quality poll on the contest conducted since the Democratic primary has found Mamdani’s support landing between 43 and 48 percent. While Cuomo has made up some ground over that time, with his support rising from the mid-20s in early polls to consistent low-30s support, he continues to lag well behind the frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in the past week, aides to Cuomo have pointed to the early voting surge as evidence that his standing in the polls is not as bad as it seems.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo suggested on Wednesday that New Yorkers were just tuning into the race.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been focusing on it, but people have been living their lives. You now get down to the last week, they’re starting to focus,” Cuomo said. “You’re talking about a general election where many normal New Yorkers are going to vote and I think there’s gonna be a big turnout because (Mamdani) frightens New Yorkers.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s backers remain far more enthusiastic about their choice than are Cuomo’s supporters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.\n \n\n   \n  The survey also found a rise in how many New Yorkers have an unfavorable view of Mamdani (45% favorable to 41% unfavorable versus earlier in October when those figures stood at 43% favorable to 35% unfavorable).\n \n\n   \n  Still, 54% of New Yorkers had unfavorable views of Cuomo versus just 34% favorable.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch of the campaign, Democrats who previously supported Cuomo, political observers and even former aides of the governor were astounded after he  laughed with a radio host  who suggested Mamdani would “cheer” another 9/11. Cuomo  later said  he believed the host’s comments were offensive as Mamdani accused him of playing to Islamophobia.\n \n\n   \n  Days later, during an appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” host Jon Stewart joked with Mamdani about their back-and-forth.\n \n\n   \n  “You are clearly in the front-runner position right now – I can tell because they have gone 9/11 on you,” Stewart said eliciting laughter from the crowd.\n \n\n   \n  “The closing argument,” Mamdani responded.\n \n\n   \n    Cuomo reframes his legacy\n \n\n   \n  With every post and campaign stop, Cuomo tried a new media strategy while leaning into the legacy items of his 11 years as governor, including  legalizing same-sex marriage  and  raising the minimum wage . In doing so, Cuomo argued that he is the mayoral race’s original progressive.\n \n\n   \n  “I was a crazy liberal,” Cuomo said during an appearance on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” show. “Now, the party’s moved so far left, they call me a moderate.”\n \n\n   \n   Cuomo resigned  in 2021 amid an investigation into sexual harassment allegations that he has denied and questions about how he handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n \n\n   \n  He won an endorsement Wednesday from US Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Long Island Democrat whose district includes parts of Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot back a declared socialist with a thin resume to run the most complex city in America,” Suozzi  wrote on X . “We need leaders who will fight crime, not undermine the police. Who will create jobs, not harm the economy. Who will keep taxes down, not make it more expensive for middle class families to live here.”\n \n\n   \n    Embracing his inner influencer\n \n\n   \n  As his campaign apparatus tried to catch up on social media, Cuomo was dismissing its significance in public.\n \n\n   \n  Standing on the debate stage, Cuomo poked fun of Mamdani’s social media fluency, holding his hands up in the air, rocking side to side while moving his hands in a talking motion.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a TikTok dance,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Even as he mocked the videos that helped propel his opponent, Cuomo admitted they were effective. He has started posting videos of him meeting with New Yorkers that some Mamdani allies think are copying the Democratic nominee’s style.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very effective on it. His mother’s a film director, filmmaker. He’s an actor slash rapper. They did highly produced videos that were very effective. And that’s his sweet spot,” Cuomo said on Cohen’s show.\n \n\n   \n  He appeared recently at a “Cool Girls for Capitalism” event held in a swanky Tribeca members-only club known as Maxwell Social, where hosts doled out pink T-shirts and stickers emblazoned with the group name.\n \n\n   \n  At a “Young Professionals For Cuomo” fundraiser hosted by the independent candidate’s daughters, attendants got a chance to secure T-shirts showing a cartoon Cuomo surrounded by friendly iconography – a Statue of Liberty, the Star of David, a cross, a pretzel and a smiling apple.\n \n\n   \n    Experience, experience, experience\n \n\n   \n  Much like he did in the primary, Cuomo continued to lean on his experience, trying to draw a contrast between himself and Mamdani, who has served three terms in the State Assembly.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo focused on public safety, appealing to fears that  Mamdani’s police reform agenda  would lead to an increase in crime and demoralize police officers.\n \n\n   \n  The former governor has proposed hiring more officers and argued homeless people should be moved off the streets. A former housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, Cuomo said the city had suffered through years of inept governments who could not get projects off the ground.\n \n\n   \n  On the day of Hurricane Sandy’s anniversary in New York City, Cuomo was once again on the trail reminding voters of his experience and what he believed is at stake.\n \n\n   \n  “You need experience. You need the ability. You need the wisdom to know what to do because literally lives depend on you,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Cuomo got the endorsement of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who was in office on the day Hurricane Sandy devastated the city.\n \n\n   \n  Bloomberg, who also endorsed Cuomo in the primary and donated millions to a Cuomo Super PAC, reiterated his support for the governor and highlighted his experience.\n \n\n   \n  “Being Mayor of New York City is the second toughest job in America, and the next mayor will face immense challenges,” Bloomberg wrote in a post on X. “Andrew Cuomo has the experience and toughness to stand up for New Yorkers and get things done.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/autism-covid-pregnancy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:06:00-04:00","title":"Autism diagnosis rates higher among children born to mothers who had Covid-19 during pregnancy, study suggests","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A study from Massachusetts General Hospital analyzing over 18,000 pregnancies between March 2020 and May 2021 found that children born to mothers with confirmed Covid-19 during pregnancy were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism—particularly among boys and during the third trimester.

Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”\n \n\n   \n  The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n \n\n   \n  The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.\n \n\n   \n  “Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in  a news release .\n \n\n   \n  About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a  report  published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has  caused the autism epidemic .”\n \n\n   \n  In a news conference in September on the “ cause of autism ,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of  Tylenol during pregnancy  can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.\n \n\n   \n  The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.\n \n\n   \n  “These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/mississippi-police-drug-trafficking-charged","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:46:00-05:00","title":"Two Mississippi Sheriffs and 12 Officers Charged in Drug Trafficking Bribery Scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal authorities have indicted 20 individuals, including two Mississippi sheriffs—Washington County Sheriff Milton Gaston and Humphreys County Sheriff Bruce Williams—for allegedly accepting bribes as high as $37,000 to provide safe passage for drug traffickers and protect the transport of narcotics through the Mississippi Delta region.

authorities on Thursday announced indictments against 20 people, including 14 current or former Mississippi Delta law enforcement officers, who allegedly took bribes to provide safe passage to people they believed were drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  The yearslong investigation swept across multiple counties in the Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi and Tennessee. Two Mississippi sheriffs, Washington County Sheriff Milton Gaston and Humphreys County Sheriff Bruce Williams, were among those arrested.\n \n\n   \n  Some bribes were as large as $20,000 and $37,000, authorities said at a news conference.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s just a monumental betrayal of public trust,” US Attorney Clay Joyner said.\n \n\n   \n  The indictments say law enforcement officers provided armed escort services on multiple occasions to an FBI agent posing as a member of a Mexican drug cartel. The indictments allege the officers understood they were helping to transport 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of cocaine through Mississippi Delta counties and into Memphis. Some of the officers also provided escort services to protect the transportation of drug proceeds.\n \n\n   \n  Gaston and Williams are alleged to have received bribes in exchange for giving the operations their “blessing,” one indictment said. It also alleged that Gaston attempted to disguise the payments as campaign contributions, but did not report them as required by law.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials said the investigation into the alleged crimes began when people who had been arrested complained about having to pay bribes to various individuals.\n \n\n   \n  “Law enforcement is only effective when the community they protect can trust the law enforcement officers are honestly serving the community’s interests,” Robert Eikhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Jackson Field Office, said. “This type of corruption strikes at the heart of the community.”\n \n\n   \n  Nineteen of the 20 people indicted are also charged with violating federal gun laws.\n \n\n   \n  Court records show that the federal defender’s office is representing 16 of the 20 people charged, including the two sheriffs. That office did not immediately respond to an after-hours email Thursday evening seeking comment on the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said in a statement that he was disappointed to learn of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “The law must apply equally to everyone regardless of the title or position they hold,” he wrote. “Know that if you betray the people’s trust in Mississippi, you will face consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Multiple Mississippi law enforcement agencies and sheriffs have faced federal scrutiny in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, the former Hinds County Sheriff Marshand Crisler was  convicted  of accepting $9,500 in bribes and knowingly providing ammunition to a convicted felon.

Lisa Murkowski said this week, berating her colleagues in both parties for failing to act. “We’re pretending that people are not being impacted by this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats triggered the showdown, withholding support for a temporary government funding bill last month in an attempt to force Republicans to guarantee extensions for  expanded subsidies  for millions of  Affordable Care Act health plans .\n \n\n   \n  “They are completely and totally uninterested in solving or addressing, decisively, the Republican health care crisis that they’ve created,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “On November 1, when open enrollment begins, it’s going to be crystal clear to tens of millions of Americans, across the country, that their premiums, copays and deductibles are about to dramatically increase,” Jeffries said.\n \n\n   \n  But Republican leaders are standing firm. They’re offering to discuss extending the credits, but only when Democrats agree to open the government.\n \n\n   \n  A pitiful lack of trust between the parties, the unwillingness of either side to accept the political cost of a climbdown and Trump’s stunning indifference to his own shuttered government led to this stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  And the ramifications of the shutdown are getting quickly worse as the political duel becomes a test of which unfortunate Americans can bear the most pain.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most critical developments, tens of millions of Americans, including children, elderly citizens and those with a disability are set to lose vital food assistance under the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). \n \n\n   \n  The blow of soaring health care premiums is also being laid bare. Millions are getting notices showing Obamacare costs shooting up by an average of 26% and in some cases much higher, in the absence of the expiring enhanced subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Which pain point is the worst?” Collins asked Jeffries, referring to Americans hit by rising Obamacare premiums and those facing the potential loss of SNAP benefits. “None of this pain that Republicans have inflicted on the American people is acceptable,” Jeffries replied.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure on government workers — those forced to work without pay and colleagues who are locked out of their jobs — is also worsening.\n \n\n   \n  Flight disruptions are mounting as staff shortages emerge among air traffic controllers, who already operate  under acute stress . The controllers’ mental and emotional challenges are rising since they are  working without pay  — but still face housing, transport and childcare costs.\n \n\n   \n  A new crisis speed bump looms over paying military personnel. Trump accepted a  $130 million donation  from a fellow billionaire to fill the gap left by drained federal funds after reallocating Pentagon funds to meet a first wave of salary payments. But the gift won’t come close to paying wages for 1.3 million military members.\n \n\n   \n  Federal employees, who are spread throughout the 50 states, are getting increasingly desperate. Their financial obligations don’t just go on hold because the government can’t pay them.\n \n\n   \n    Will the misery being inflicted on Americans change political calculations?\n \n\n   \n  Conditions are therefore dropping into place for the spiking of pain that normally translates into political pressure that causes one party to flinch.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamps expiration could be a catalyst. Democrats accuse the administration of refusing to divert available funding to meet the shortfall. But the Agriculture Department insists it can’t tap a $6 billion contingency fund to pay the benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The disagreement set up a callous scenario as lawmakers squabble over what is more important — feeding the nation’s neediest people or ensuring that millions of families can continue to get health care. It’s a shameful spectacle that epitomizes a political system rendered inoperable by years of polarization and cynicism in both parties and a government that fails in its basic function to help citizens.\n \n\n   \n  As misery multiplies, the question becomes which party changes its calculus first.\n \n\n   \n  ► Will Democrats, who have stayed remarkably united during the drama, begin to see cracks, especially among moderate lawmakers, those who have competitive reelection races, or others who are retiring and can buck their party’s activists?\n \n\n   \n  ► Can Republican leaders keep their lawmakers, especially the often-fractious House GOP conference, in line? Will they risk political fallout from all this misery inflicted on voters already hit by rising inflation and grocery prices, given they have a monopoly on power in Washington?\n \n\n   \n  ► And will Trump, who has managed to defray some of the traditional pressure points during a shutdown, finally discover a political or moral imperative to end it?\n \n\n   \n    A hint of hope as senators talk\n \n\n   \n  A glimmer of hope shone late on Wednesday when details emerged of a  dual-track negotiation between frustrated Democratic and Republican senators . One goal would be to resolve the health-care impasse and reopen the government for a few weeks. The group also hopes to reach a separate long-term agreement to fund certain key departments — including the Department of Agriculture, which funds food stamps — through next year.\n \n\n   \n  Disagreements in Congress often end with creative fudges and concurrent steps that allow both sides to argue they didn’t fold. But there is no guarantee this approach will work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s office told CNN he remains unwilling to discuss Obamacare policy changes until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks ago, the closure of the federal government lacked the sweeping impact that helped earlier shutdowns seize the nation’s attention. But that’s beginning to change. The normally unruffled Thune erupted on the Senate floor Wednesday at Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján, who complained about SNAP benefits potentially expiring. “This isn’t a political game,” Thune snapped. “These are real people’s lives that we’re talking about. And you all just figured out, 29 days in, that, oh, there might be some consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic rhetoric is just as harsh.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tried Wednesday to exact a political price from Trump. “Every single president was not so cruel and heartless to hold those hungry children, hungry elderly, and hungry veterans as hostages,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is picking politics over the lives of hungry kids. He is weaponizing hunger.”\n \n\n   \n  The vitriol may offer an opening for the president because the shutdown — now just a week out from a new record — won’t end until he gets involved. He could turn his absence for most of the last week to his advantage by inserting himself into the bitterness between Democrats and Republicans to broker a resolution. After all, Trump is often more tempted more by the chance to make a deal and declare victory than by any rigid ideology. And he’s already signaled willingness to talk about expiring health-care subsidies. He could pose as the president who fed the hungry, paid the troops and made the skies safe again. This, however, would mean breaking with some of the harder-line elements in his own administration and offering Democrats a face-saving off-ramp.\n \n\n   \n  The conundrum for Democrats is how they engineer a way out of the crisis that they can present as a victory to base voters desperate to hit back at Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Early in the shutdown, the party succeeded in making Obamacare subsidies a national issue. And after nearly a year of internal mourning over the disastrous 2024 congressional and presidential elections, they found surprising unity in the shutdown. Sometimes, just picking a fight can give a party definition.\n \n\n   \n  But as the pain for millions of Americans mounted, the political clarity over health care blurred. And competing claims emerged. Everett Kelley, the president of the  American Federation of Government Employees  union that represents a wide swath of federal workers, who always opposed a shutdown, warned that it was time for the government to reopen. “I think that it’s vitally important to have health care for everyone … However, I don’t think that this should be built on the backs of federal employees,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are also increasingly wrestling with the possibility that blame for the shutdown could blow back against them. After all, when they held the power in government, they faulted Republicans for using federal funding as a political lever. CNN’s Kasie Hunt pointed out the inconsistency to Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona on Tuesday. “That’s an easy answer. It’s Donald Trump. You’re talking about norms in the time of Donald Trump. It’s also normal not to tear down the East Wing,” Gallego said. He added: “It’s all out the window. When you’re dealing time with Donald Trump, this is the man that is extorting people. … We’re not going to go back and play by the norms when we know what’s on the line.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans face their own risks.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to bring the House back to Washington looks like weakness. And he hasn’t been able to silence dissent in his conference, including from  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who keeps accusing her party of negligence over the health care issue. The political equation could shift for Republicans next week if Trump is rebuked in  bellwether elections in Virginia and New Jersey .\n \n\n   \n  And leaving kids hungry could be a disaster. That’s one reason  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill to fund SNAP benefits  until the end of the shutdown. Schumer said his party would vote for it. But Republican leaders will be loath to make a move that could alleviate pressure on Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If millions of Americans going hungry doesn’t break open the deadlock, the shutdown could drag on even longer. The next potential off-ramp may come in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving with the horrible prospect of an air travel nightmare at the busiest time of the year.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/listeria-outbreak-prepared-meals","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"19:19:00-04:00","title":"More illnesses, deaths reported in listeria outbreak tied to recalled pasta salads, meals sold nationwide","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A widespread listeria outbreak linked to contaminated precooked pasta supplied by Nate’s Fine Foods Inc. has resulted in 27 reported illnesses, 25 hospitalizations, six deaths, and one fetal loss across 18 U.S. states.

additional deaths have been reported in a listeria outbreak that’s been linked with recalled ready-to-eat pasta salads and prepared meals sold at major grocery chains including Trader Joe’s, Sprouts Farmers Market, Kroger and Walmart, health officials said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Seven new illnesses have been reported in three states over the past month, bringing the case count to 27 illnesses reported from 18 states. There have been 25 hospitalizations, six deaths and one fetal loss.\n \n\n   \n  The  US Food and Drug Administration,  the US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating the outbreak, which has been linked to Listeria monocytogenes contamination in precooked pasta supplied by Nate’s Fine Foods Inc.\n \n\n   \n  Nate’s Fine Foods said in  a statement  in late September that it’s cooperating with the federal agencies’ investigation. “Our top priority is ensuring the safety of the people who enjoy our products, and we will continue to take all appropriate steps until this matter is resolved. … Nate’s Fine Foods sincerely apologizes for the concern this may cause. We remain fully committed to transparency and to taking every necessary step to protect the health and trust of our consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  The affected pasta has been used in a variety of prepared meals and deli salads sold under various brands. Several products have been recalled:\n \n\n   \n  The FDA says that consumers should check their refrigerators and freezers for these products and that they should not be eaten. If customers are unsure whether they have purchased contaminated products, they should contact the retailer.\n \n\n   \n  Consumption of food contaminated with  Listeria monocytogenes  can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. These symptoms can sometimes be preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal problems.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA says that symptoms “usually start within two weeks after eating food contaminated with Listeria but may start as early as the same day or as late as 10 weeks after.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency also warns that the infection is most likely to affect pregnant women and newborns, adults 65 or older and people with weakened immune systems. Although pregnant women typically have fever, fatigue and muscle aches, serious cases may lead to stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn.\n \n\n   \n  Consumers who have symptoms of listeriosis are advised to seek medical care right away.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/elise-stefanik-plans-bid-new-york-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:33:00Z","title":"Elise Stefanik Plans to Launch Bid for New York Governor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elise Stefanik, a key Republican ally of President Donald Trump and a U.S. representative from New York, has announced plans to launch a gubernatorial campaign in 2026, with her formal entry expected shortly after New York City’s mayoral election.

At least 30 people have died, though the full toll of the catastrophic storm may take days or weeks to be determined.\n \n\n   \n  As the hurricane headed toward Bermuda early Thursday, emergency officials in countries along Melissa’s path have begun to pick up the pieces – clearing roads to reach isolated communities in need of relief.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, traveled to some of the hardest-hit areas of the island nation Wednesday to survey the significant damage caused by punishing winds and widespread flooding.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the difficulties, the Jamaican spirit shines through as a strong reminder that we are a resilient nation with the capacity to triumph over adversity,” he wrote  on social media .\n \n\n   \n    Path of destruction\n \n\n   \n  In the Caribbean, hotter-than-average waters paired with minimally disruptive winds higher in the atmosphere to create the perfect fuel and prime conditions for Melissa to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa rapidly  intensified , jumping from a 70 mph tropical storm on Saturday morning to a 140 mph Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning.\n \n\n   \n  By Tuesday, Melissa had morphed into a high-end Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, tying it with  four other hurricanes  as the second-strongest storm recorded in the Atlantic since records began in 1851.\n \n\n   \n  As it headed toward Jamaica, where it slammed into the coast as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned it expected the situation to be “catastrophic.”\n \n\n   \n  “For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,” WMO tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said.\n \n\n   \n  Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, it crossed into eastern Cuba, still a formidable Category 3 hurricane by the time it made landfall in the province of Santiago de Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  By the time it reached the Bahamas on Wednesday, Hurricane Melissa had been downgraded to a Category 1, but its broad wind field continued to drive torrential flooding rain, damaging winds and dangerous storm surge at the coast.\n \n\n   \n  More than 735,000 people were  evacuated in Cuba  as Melissa approached, according to President Miguel Díaz-Canel, while in the Bahamas, preliminary estimates show 1,485 residents were evacuated before all flights were suspended ahead of the approaching storm.\n \n\n   \n  Evacuation orders were also issued for six islands in the Bahamas.\n \n\n   \n  Other countries, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, also felt the cataclysmic impacts of Melissa.\n \n\n   \n    Devastation left behind\n \n\n   \n  Across the Caribbean, officials painted a consistent picture of the destruction Melissa left behind.\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions here are devastating. ‘Catastrophic’ is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” Richard Solomon, the mayor of the southwest Jamaican city of Black River, where Hurricane Melissa made landfall, said in a  video  posted by the Jamaica Constabulary Force.\n \n\n   \n  Around 140,000 people were cut off as the storm pummeled the island, the government has said.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN crew observed residents and military personnel push more than a dozen ambulances past storm debris in the town of Santa Cruz as the medical convoy headed to a coastal area in western Jamaica, which was hit hard.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities in Jamaica have recovered at least four bodies in the badly hit St. Elizabeth Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, a source in the government told CNN on Wednesday. The Jamaica Constabulary Force confirmed eight more deaths on Thursday in Westmoreland, Hanover and St. James.\n \n\n   \n  Three people also died during storm preparations.\n \n\n   \n  Holness  declared  the country a disaster area   Tuesday, as he sought to deter price gouging.\n \n\n   \n  “We must… continue to proactively maintain stability, protect consumers, and prevent any exploitation at a time when citizens are securing food, water, and supplies,” Holness said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 77% of the country was  left  without electricity after Melissa crossed, a spokesperson said. The country’s infrastructure has taken a battering, leaving it “severely compromised,” according to Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica’s minister of local government and community development.\n \n\n   \n  Around 25,000 tourists remained in Jamaica as the country emerged from the storm, Dana Morris Dixon, minister of education, skills, youth and information, said in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  In the already  beleaguered  country of Haiti, 23 people have died and 13 are missing, the country’s Civil Protection Agency said Wednesday. Twenty of the deaths, including 10 children, happened when a flooded river in Petit-Goâve burst its banks, the agency said, revising an earlier death toll of 25 reported by the mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Guadard, who lives in Petit-Goâve, told the  Associated Press  the storm killed his entire family.\n \n\n   \n  “I had four children at home: a 1-month-old baby, a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old and another who was about to turn 4,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said Hurricane Melissa had wrought “significant” damage on the island.\n \n\n   \n  “It has been a highly complex night, with significant damage reported,” Díaz-Canel wrote on X. “I urge our people to remain vigilant, to uphold discipline, and to continue taking all necessary precautions.”\n \n\n   \n    Recovery efforts\n \n\n   \n  Several international efforts have already been launched to aid in the recovery efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom said on Wednesday it was  deploying  £2.5 million ($3.3 million) in emergency humanitarian funding.\n \n\n   \n  China’s ambassador to Cuba shared a video on  social media  showing hundreds of boxes labeled as “family kit” being transported from a warehouse.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump on Wednesday authorized “an immediate US response” to mobilize support for affected communities in the Caribbean, according to a  statement  released by the State Department.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours, Secretary of State Marco Rubio “deployed a regional Disaster Assistance Response Team, including urban search-and-rescue teams, to assess needs and provide search and recovery assistance,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  “The State Department is collaborating with UN agencies, NGOs, and host governments to deliver food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits, temporary shelter, and search and rescue support.”\n \n\n   \n  The Jamaican government launched an  official website  for relief and recovery efforts, where users can access updates on flooding locations or blocked roads and locate shelters.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/fetterman-democrats-shutdown-snap","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:26:00-04:00","title":"Fetterman rails on his colleagues for not getting their ‘sh*t together’ with SNAP on the line amid the shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sen.

John Fetterman was exasperated with his colleagues Thursday, as the Senate heads home in the stalemate’s fifth week and millions of Americans are due to lose federal food assistance this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month, and now things are really going to land, and imagine being a parent with a couple kids, and how you’re going to fill their refrigerator and pack their lunches and get on with their lives when the things that they’ve depended on now is gone, because we can’t even agree to just open things up,” the Pennsylvania Democrat told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman said his wife helps distribute free food to the community and has already witnessed longer lines. He lamented that when he returns home this weekend, he’ll have to tell constituents who have lost their SNAP benefits, “I don’t have an explanation for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Democrat, who  has been outspoken  against shutting down the government in any form, has been one of just three in his caucus to routinely break from the party and vote with Republicans more than a dozen times to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate left town on Thursday for the weekend with no measurable progress toward a deal to reopen the government, with impatience inside the US Capitol skyrocketing and  critical social safety net programs at risk  in the coming days. Senators will not return until Monday, which will mark day 34 of the shutdown – just two days shy of setting a new record for longest shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Key senators of both parties took part in some private meetings Thursday to discuss potential off-ramps, including how to get both parties to support a deal on long-term appropriations bills. But lawmakers involved in those talks offered no more clarity about whether it could indeed end the standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the effort by some Senate Democrats to pass a bill to temporarily extend SNAP benefits, Fetterman questioned why Congress couldn’t also pay Capitol police officers, saying that “the world’s biggest lethal military in the world has relied on a donor to pay our service members last week. I mean, that’s a disgrace.”\n \n\n   \n  “We have to find a way forward,” the senator said. He added that while he “fundamentally” believes there will be an effort to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, as his fellow Democrats are demanding, his party must also consider those who receive other important benefits from the government.\n \n\n   \n  “You have 2 million people on SNAP in my state, and over 400,000 are receiving those kind of tax credits,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “For a Democrat, I can’t imagine a more sacred part of who we fight for is people that, that depend on SNAP to feed themselves,” he said, later adding, “Our party has bigger problems than I thought we might have already. It’s like that’s not controversial. Pay everybody.”\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t even get our shit together and just open up our government,” he lamented.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s prior suggestion that each day of the shutdown plays better politically for Democrats, Fetterman responded, “Ask the hungry people on Saturday.”\n \n\n   \n  “Americans are not leverage. This is not, this is not some shitty game show about who’s winning or whatever. It’s just like we have to be better than this and just open this up,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/release-chicago-immigration-daughter-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:46:00Z","title":"Chicago father of child fighting cancer released on bond by immigration judge","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 40-year-old Chicago man, Ruben Torres Maldonado, a painter and home renovator, was detained by federal immigration agents during Operation Midway Blitz in October 2025, despite having no criminal record.

the Black Lives Matter movement defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during racial justice protests in 2020, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, federal law enforcement officials have issued subpoenas and at least one search warrant as part of an investigation into the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. and other Black-led organizations that helped spark a national reckoning on systemic racism, said the people, who were not authorized to discuss an ongoing criminal probe by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  It was not clear if the investigation would result in criminal charges, but its mere existence invites fresh scrutiny to a movement that in recent years has faced criticism about its public accounting of donations received. The recent burst of investigative activity is also unfolding at a time when civil rights groups have raised concerns about the potential for the Trump administration to target a broad variety of progressive and left-leaning groups that have been critical of him, including those affiliated with BLM, the transgender rights movement and anti-ICE protesters.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for the Justice Department declined to comment on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people said the investigation had been initiated during the Biden administration but is getting renewed attention during the Trump administration. A second person confirmed that allegations were examined in the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  The foundation said it  took in over $90 million in donations , following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a White Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the US and around the world.\n \n\n   \n  Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, have accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase  a $6 million Los Angeles-area property  that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders previously have denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.”\n \n\n   \n  “We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old  Trayvon Martin  in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives.\n \n\n   \n  Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But as the movement’s influence grew, so did the number of organizations that became affiliated with BLM. In 2020, a tidal wave of public contributions in the aftermath of protests over Floyd’s murder came mainly to the BLM foundation, although other organizations were resourced from those funds.\n \n\n   \n  Leaders of the foundation  opened up about finances and organizational structure in 2022 , revealing detailed accountings of expenditures. The latest Form 990 filing shows the BLM foundation had $28 million in assets for the fiscal year ending June 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation is being run out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles. The top prosecutor there, Bill Essayli, was  disqualified from several cases  earlier this week after a federal judge concluded that the Trump appointee has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. It’s not clear whether Essayli’s disqualification will impact the BLM investigation. He effectively remains the office’s top prosecutor with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney.\n \n\n   \n  Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s Covid-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against state policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.\n \n\n   \n  As a private practice attorney, he characterized BLM as a “radical organization” while defending a White couple charged in 2020 with a hate crime after they were videotaped defacing  a BLM mural in Martinez, California .\n \n\n   \n  At the time,  city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways  in cities throughout the US in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli told a San Francisco CBS TV affiliate his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor a radical organization, Black Lives Matters.”\n \n\n   \n  The couple took plea deals to resolve the case in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-checks-into-prison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:56:00Z","title":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs checks into Fort Dix to begin prison sentence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sean 'Diddy' Combs, the music mogul, has been transferred to Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey, to begin serving the remainder of his 50-month sentence for two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.

its first glimpse at how iPhone 17 sales are going \n       \n  By Lisa Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:13 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that provided an early glimpse into how the iPhone 17 lineup may be catching on so far.   \n \n\n   \n  Apple’s earnings for the quarter that ended in September met analysts’ expectations on revenue but slightly missed on iPhone sales.   iPhone sales in the fourth quarter were $49 billion, up from $46.2 billion compared to the same period a   year ago but slightly lower than the $50.1 billion Wall Street was expecting. Overall revenue was $102.5 billion, an increase from $94.9 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Apple says both revenue and iPhone sales   numbers represent a record for the fourth   quarter. Services revenue, another closely watched metric ,  also hit an   all-time record at $28.8 billion, an increase from roughly $25 billion a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  During Apple’s earnings call on Thursday,   CEO Tim Cook said the company expects the December quarter’s revenue “to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for the iPhone,” suggesting strong iPhone 17 sales.\n \n\n   \n  Apple shares were up around 3% in after-hours trading.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street is looking for assurance that Apple’s biggest revenue driver is still growing despite concerns that the company is behind in the AI race. Analysts had estimated strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup, which Apple launched in late September.\n \n\n   \n  However, overall sales in China   shrunk compared to a year ago, with the company generating $14.5 billion in revenue in the region. In 2024, Apple earned $15 billion during the same period. Cook said on Thursday that he expects iPhone revenue to return to growth in China in the current quarter based on how the iPhone 17 is being received.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s results paint an early picture of iPhone sales since its fourth quarter ended on September 27, eight days after the iPhone 17 launch. Still, it’s possible that sales slowed in the July and August months as consumers waited for the iPhone 17.\n \n\n   \n  The iPhone 17 series outsold its predecessor by 14% in its first 10 days in the United States and China, according to  Counterpoint Research , with the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max being the most in demand. The iPhone Air, touted as the thinnest iPhone ever, is seeing “muted customer interest” according to UBS, which has been tracking retail wait times for new iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  Apple’s iPhone business is always under a microscope as the company’s largest revenue driver. But the tech industry is particularly paying close attention, prompted by speculation that another AI-powered gadget may eventually supplant the smartphone.\n \n\n   \n  While analysts previously grilled Apple about its AI strategy on recent earnings calls, Wall Street was more interested in the factors driving iPhone demand and the impact of tariffs. Apple said it expects to incur $1.4 billion in tariff-related costs this quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But Cook said he sees “opportunities on the App Store” for AI when asked about whether the rise of chatbots and AI apps will change how consumers use apps. He also said Apple Intelligence — a suite of AI-powered features for the iPhone and the company’s other products — is motivating people to upgrade their iPhones.\n \n\n   \n  “I would say that Apple Intelligence is a factor, and we’re very bullish on it becoming a greater factor, and that’s the way that we look at it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Apple delayed an update to Siri earlier this year that would have brought it closer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Rivals like Google, Microsoft and Samsung,   meanwhile, continue to pour billions into their AI infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  The earnings come in what has been a challenging year for Apple.\n \n\n   \n  The company has been impacted by   President Donald Trump’s trade war and has faced pressure from the Trump administration to make its iPhones domestically. Earlier this year it committed to investing $600 billion toward expanding its US operations. But Thursday’s earnings, along with the company surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization earlier this week, represent a turnaround.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/january-6-doj-memo-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s push to rewrite the history of January 6 takes an especially brazen turn","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s Justice Department has been actively rewriting the historical narrative of the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack by removing factual references to the event in legal documents, such as the sentencing memo for Taylor Taranto, who was pardoned by Trump for his role in the riot and previously convicted of a firearms-related offense.

Shortly after the  January 6, 2021, attack  on the US Capitol, the political right spent a lot of time parsing whether the word “insurrection” was an apt description of the day’s events.\n \n\n   \n  Today, President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is apparently  sanctioning its own prosecutors  for calling January 6 a mere “mob of rioters.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s difficult to fully convey just how brazen Trump’s efforts to rewrite the history of the day have become. He’s spent years trying to turn people who launched the worst attack on the US Capitol in two centuries into sympathetic figures. He even pardoned a bunch of people who assaulted police that day, despite  more than 8 in 10 Americans opposing that .\n \n\n   \n  But sometimes something comes along that completely drives the whole thing home.\n \n\n   \n  That’s what happened this week, in the  case of Taylor Taranto .\n \n\n   \n  To recap: Taranto was among those pardoned by Trump for his actions on January 6. But before that pardon, he committed an unrelated crime. In 2023, he was arrested in former President Barack Obama’s Washington, DC, neighborhood with numerous firearms and materials to make explosives. He was convicted in May.\n \n\n   \n  By late Tuesday, a reporter at Politico noted something interesting: Prosecutors in their sentencing memo for Taranto noted his presence in the “mob of rioters” on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building,” the  sentencing memo  said. “After the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  This wouldn’t normally be surprising, mind you. It’s a factual statement that notes the defendant isn’t a newcomer to legal trouble.\n \n\n   \n  But it  was  notable next to Trump’s own rhetoric about January 6 – and given the Trump DOJ’s efforts to  force out a batch of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases.\n \n\n   \n  Sure enough, mere hours later the prosecutors on the case – Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White – were  placed on leave . Then their sentencing memo was pulled from the docket and replaced with a new one, signed by different prosecutors, that excised the paragraph on January 6.\n \n\n   \n  And just in case it wasn’t clear that the changes were made to benefit Trump, consider another change to the sentencing memo.\n \n\n   \n  The other interesting aspect of Taranto’s crime is Trump’s proximity to it. In fact, Taranto was apprehended near Obama’s home  shortly after Trump reshared a post that included an alleged address for the former president  to social media. Prosecutors said Taranto began livestreaming in the area shortly after promoting Trump’s post.\n \n\n   \n  The new sentencing memo also removed a reference to that fact.\n \n\n   \n  The US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, declined to shed light on why the prosecutors were put on leave.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n  We still have plenty to learn about what happened here. But it’s one of the most glaring examples of the fruits of Trump’s long-running campaign to retcon January 6 – and to turn it into anything other than a tragic day for our country and our democracy.\n \n\n   \n  After the dust settled on that day, Trump and some allies in Congress began suggestively questioning how violent the day was, with one GOP congressman infamously comparing it to a “ normal tourist visit .”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump launched his 2024 campaign, he began featuring a  music video from a choir of January 6 defendants  that effectively lionized them. He began talking about the defendants as if they were ill-treated political “hostages,” often  citing misinformation  in the process.\n \n\n   \n  Then he, on his first day back in office, pardoned nearly all of them – even the worst offenders.\n \n\n   \n  But that was merely the first step.\n \n\n   \n  We’ve also seen a  purge of dozens of prosecutors  who tried January 6 cases, despite them merely enforcing the law. Trump’s Justice Department agreed to  settle a wrongful death suit for $5 million with the family of Ashli Babbitt , who was killed after breaking into a sensitive area of the Capitol, cementing her status as a martyr for some portions of the extreme right. The administration has also  pressured the Smithsonian , which has in some cases  softened its language about the events that day . The president and allies have continued to overhype  relatively minor   disclosures  about the government’s actions vis-a-vis January 6, which took place while Trump was in office, as if they proved a massive conspiracy against Trump and the GOP. The House is now undertaking an investigation that  appears aimed at recasting the narrative  of that day.\n \n\n   \n  Oh, and we recently learned Trump is reportedly  seeking $230 million  from his own government for alleged damages from the January 6 probe and other federal investigations. (Trump was never tried in these cases, which were dropped after he was reelected president, but nor was he acquitted.)\n \n\n   \n  If anything epitomizes Trump’s attempts to turn those who fueled what happened on January 6 into victims, it’s surely that. Even if you don’t think Trump committed a crime, the people who attacked the Capitol were clearly spurred by his lies about voter fraud and the supposedly stolen election.\n \n\n   \n  Trump just keeps pushing the envelope here, and we keep seeing that manifest itself in actions by his Justice Department and his administration.\n \n\n   \n  The question from there is whether he’s able to actually rewrite history in Americans’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  To this point, that’s been  a tough slog . Trump’s pardons of violent January 6 defendants were overwhelmingly unpopular. Strong majorities of Americans still regard that day as an attack against democracy.\n \n\n   \n  But we’ve also seen a steady downgrading of the right’s views on that day.\n \n\n   \n  By mid-2021, a Monmouth University poll showed 62% of Republicans labeled that day a “riot,” and 33% called it an “insurrection.” Two years later, though, those numbers  dropped significantly – to 44% and 15%, respectively .\n \n\n   \n  In that way, the erasure of the “mob of rioters” from the memo reflects how the political right has come to view that day.\n \n\n   \n  But that doesn’t mean it’s a reflection of the truth.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/us-nuclear-testing-trump-advisers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:13:00Z","title":"Trump Orders U.S. Nuclear Testing Amid China Tensions, Sparks Global Alarm","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, during a visit to South Korea for a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, unexpectedly instructed the Pentagon to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year moratorium, citing concerns over global nuclear capabilities, especially from China.

It caught even some advisers by surprise. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:13 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with  President Donald Trump  in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.\n \n\n   \n  Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump  instructed the Pentagon  to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.\n \n\n   \n  “That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.\n \n\n   \n  The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.\n \n\n   \n  Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”\n \n\n   \n  “To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”\n \n\n   \n  Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.\n \n\n   \n  A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”\n \n\n   \n  He seemed less cautious in his  Truth Social message  this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”\n \n\n   \n  Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.\n \n\n   \n  “With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.\n \n\n   \n  Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.\n \n\n   \n  Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”\n \n\n   \n  If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.\n \n\n   \n  There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.\n \n\n   \n  “The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.\n \n\n   \n  In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.\n \n\n   \n  In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”\n \n\n   \n  “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.\n \n\n   \n  “If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/thanksgiving-travel-shutdown-vance-duffy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:49:00-04:00","title":"Vance and Duffy warn Thanksgiving travel ‘could be a disaster’ if shutdown barrels on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued urgent warnings that the ongoing government shutdown could lead to a travel 'disaster' during Thanksgiving 2025, due to federal workers—especially FAA air traffic controllers—being required to work without pay.

\nUpdated: \n        4:49 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Thursday that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on  Federal Aviation Administration employees  who are being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans can fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy chimed in adding, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines CEO Robert Isom, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien and American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley were among those who attended Thursday’s roundtable, the officials said, in addition to nine other industry leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Behind closed doors, Vance and Duffy listened as O’Brien and Kelley laid out their concerns about the stress on their workforce, the officials told CNN. Meanwhile Isom and Kirby, in addition to a series of other airline association leaders, made clear just how damaging the shutdown was not only to their industry, but also the larger economy.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy told the group that he was working on recruiting more air traffic controllers as a temporary solution, arguing that they are most affected, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting came as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck of the shutdown this week. Controllers, employed by the FAA, are among the government employees required to continue working without pay.\n \n\n   \n  During the first Trump administration, controller staffing shortages helped   tip the scales  to end the longest government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In 2019, the decision by 10 air traffic controllers to call out sick temporarily shut down travel at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and caused delays at other major hubs in New Jersey, Philadelphia and Atlanta, driving President Donald Trump to agree to a temporary government funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  A CNN analysis found that reports of staffing problems at FAA facilities have more than quadrupled compared to the same period a year ago, raising broad concern over the fast-approaching Thanksgiving holiday.\n \n\n   \n  Geoff Freeman, the CEO of the US Travel Association who also attended the meeting, told CNN in a statement: “Sixty percent of Americans are already reconsidering their travel plans during the shutdown.

quick reaction force largely already exists, officials say \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:53 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon is moving forward on orders from President Donald Trump to build a National Guard quick reaction force in each state for domestic use, though two US officials say the effort is largely making incremental changes to a mission the Guard already undertakes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ordered that the Pentagon “ensure the availability of a standing National Guard quick reaction force that shall be resourced, trained, and available for rapid nationwide deployment,” in an August  executive order .\n \n\n   \n  But the two officials said those reaction forces already exist.\n \n\n   \n  “This whole thing – we’re already doing it,” one of the US officials said. “This is just updated guidance.”\n \n\n   \n  The officials said that plans are being developed within the Defense Department and National Guard for possible additional training or increase to the number of personnel available for existing units to meet the new requirement.\n \n\n   \n  Internal Pentagon guidance directs that most states have roughly 500 individuals dedicated to the reaction force, one of the officials said, though that number could vary depending on the size of the state.\n \n\n   \n  Some states may have to increase the size of their Guard contingent dedicated to the mission to meet that guidance.\n \n\n   \n  The Guardian was first to report on the guidance, which was issued earlier this month, with the director of operations for the Pentagon’s National Guard bureau outlining troop numbers for the quick reaction forces ordered by Trump including a total of roughly 23,500 troops nationally.\n \n\n   \n  The Guard already has two types of forces that meet this mission – the National Guard Reaction Force and the Homeland Response Force.\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard Reaction Force in each state provides “a rapid response capability focused on incidents requiring defense support of civilian authorities,” a publicly available fact sheet says.\n \n\n   \n  When needed, that force is meant to be able to deploy 25% of its personnel within the first eight hours, 50% of its personnel within 12 hours, and the entire contingent within 24 hours. Their mission, according to the fact sheet, includes civil disturbance control and personnel and site security.\n \n\n   \n  The Homeland Response Force, meanwhile, is meant to be able to assemble within six hours and support emergency response chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive disasters. Within that force, the US official said, is a group of roughly 200 US soldiers whose job is riot and crowd control.\n \n\n   \n  Those forces are organized matching the 10 regions the Federal Emergency Management Agency uses to subdivide US land, the US official said, meaning they are responsible for responding first for a group of states and/or territories. Region 2, for example, includes New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon guidance comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to use the Guard in various states as support to law enforcement and immigration officials. The administration has been caught up in legal disputes over its deployment of the Guard in  Los Angeles ,  Portland , and  Chicago , and CNN reported Wednesday that orders for the National Guard in Washington, DC, have been  extended into 2026 .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/travel/halloween-decorations-st-jude-fundraiser","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:44:00Z","title":"A Veteran’s Halloween Spirit Gives Him a New Purpose — $1 Million Raised for Kids with Cancer","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jeff Robertson, an Air Force veteran and father of two, began a Halloween display in 2020 in Holly Springs, North Carolina, using plastic skeletons to bring joy during the pandemic.

We want to help sick children get out of the hospital so they can see all these neat Halloween decorations.’”\n \n\n   \n  So the family printed a simple sign on their front yard that said in part: If you like what you see, feel free to donate to St. Jude – a leading children’s hospital for kids with cancer and other diseases.\n \n\n   \n  Within days, Robertson said a car pulled up with an emotional couple and their young daughter in the backseat. The tearful father told Robertson that they’re a St. Jude family and wanted to thank him for raising money for pay for treatment for families like them.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson didn’t get their names and they never saw each other again. But that encounter changed everything for him.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d been looking for purpose after retiring from the service,” he said. “This little girl was going through such a tough time, but she saw these goofy plastic skeletons in my yard, it put her in an awesome place.”\n \n\n   \n  The family raised  over $8,000 in 2020  – and the next year, Robertson created a Facebook group called Skeletons for St. Jude to spread the idea nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  This spooky season, the group has more than 5,000 members, and over 1,000 partner homes across the country have joined the cause and raised funds. On October 21, they officially hit the $1 million mark.\n \n\n   \n  Robertson’s neighborhood in North Carolina looks forward to his epic display every year with scores of visitors stopping by every day all month long to soak in the skeleton spectacle.\n \n\n   \n  It takes Robertson a whole year to plan the theme and build new props. He’s accumulated 100 or so toy skeletons that he keeps in storage, and he adds onto the display every day until Halloween — so there’s always something new for visitors to see.\n \n\n   \n  This October, skeletons are sailing on a 25-foot phantom pirate ship that Robertson has positioned so it appears to have crashed through the first and second stories of his house.\n \n\n   \n  “The real focus isn’t on me,” Robertson said. “It’s on the thousands of people giving five or ten dollars here and there. That’s what made this a success.”\n \n\n   \n  Robertson is grateful knowing this money will help families focus on getting their kids better.

He has already spent 23 months behind bars and hasn’t been detained since he was pardoned.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Carl Nichols, a 2019 Trump appointee, had found him guilty at trial in May of the gun crimes and for making a false threat to use a car bomb against a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  In a  sentencing memo for Taranto filed Tuesday , prosecutors Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White wrote that after “then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama,” Taranto had re-posted Trump “and thereafter started livestreaming from his van” as he drove through Obama’s neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s original post – which included the Obama address – was itself a repost of a blog article.\n \n\n   \n  Politico reporter Kyle Cheney highlighted the filing and mentioned it also included Taranto taking part in the January 6 riot, on the social media platform X late Tuesday night. Within 24 hours, the court filing was no longer available in the court record and the two prosecutors who had signed it were suspended from their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  In the original memo, Valdivia and White wrote that “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building” and “after the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n \n\n   \n  Two new prosecutors then  filed an amended version  of the sentencing memo to the court on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  That new memo scrubbed all references to Trump and him posting Obama’s supposed address – which Taranto had reposted – as well as Taranto’s participation and conviction related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s shocking that prosecutors could be put on leave for accurately stating the court record in a sentencing memo, and it’s just as shocking that those truthful statements have been whitewashed in a revised filing,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney and now executive director and founder of Justice Connection, which works to represent the viewpoints of former federal prosecutors, especially those who have been fired by the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “These prosecutors did their job and upheld their duty of candor by informing the court of clearly established facts relevant to their case,” Young added.\n \n\n   \n  Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney in Washington, DC, did not comment on the suspensions and filing changes when asked about it during a news conference Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the papers speak for themselves, and what goes on in this office is not something that I’m going to comment on. Thank you,” Pirro said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Orwellian’\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, the moves made by the Justice Department had employees reeling within the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the FBI, which had investigated and caught Taranto, believing he was a danger to the public in 2023, people familiar with the office told CNN on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  One source called the sentencing memo change “Orwellian.”\n \n\n   \n  Valdivia had no indication he may have employment issues — especially given that on Tuesday, the day before his suspension, he helped to secure a guilty verdict from a jury in a fraud case where he was on the trial team, according to two people familiar with the US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, White is a supervisor on Superior Court cases and was a US Marine.\n \n\n   \n  A Justice Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday following the suspensions: “While we don’t comment on personnel decisions, we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously. We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson declined to clarify if the comments were about Taranto’s 2023 actions toward Obama, or his participation in the Capitol riot in 2021, in which a mob of Trump supporters injured multiple people, including many police protecting the federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The move by Justice Department officials to place the two attorneys on leave and erase all mention of Trump posting Obama’s address or Taranto’s participation in the events of January 6 comes at a time when administration officials have already worked to fire scores of federal prosecutors and officers they see as potential roadblocks in their efforts to use the DOJ against political opponents.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia were recently pushed out of the Justice Department after failing to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and many prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases were removed from the DC US Attorney’s office earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n    Taranto sentenced to 21 months\n \n\n   \n  When Taranto was initially investigated, one source said, he had been on federal law enforcement radar because he had been at the January 6 riot. But federal authorities focused on him after he livestreamed a video in 2023 where he threatened bombing federal facilities, and law enforcement then arrested him near Obama’s Washington address.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto was arrested that day and law enforcement officials found guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his van. He was later found guilty by Nichols of several gun related charges and making false threats that he would drive a car bomb into a federal building.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ continued to seek the 27-month sentence originally sought by White and Valdivia, who said in court documents that Taranto has also made threats against former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin.\n \n\n   \n  Taranto’s attorney asked the court to sentence him to time served in jail already, with no further detention. The defense attorney, Carmen Hernandez, has asked for rehabilitation that the court could order, noting Taranto’s past military service and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, according to a filing on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Typically, a defendant’s history and characteristics become part of court arguments for or against leniency when a judge decides a sentence.\n \n\n   \n  At a hearing Thursday, Nichols sentenced Taranto to 21 months in prison, essentially covered by time served.\n \n\n   \n  Nichols found that Taranto “made troubling statements” in his online livestream but noted he had no criminal history and his conduct “was far from egregious.”\n \n\n   \n  Taranto spoke briefly during Thursday’s hearing, not to apologize for his conduct but to highlight a book on the 1787 constitutional convention and mention that some people questioned the results of the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  “I would like to keep people’s minds open,” he concluded.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also said he thought the two prosecutors placed on leave “upheld the highest standard” throughout the case.\n \n\n   \n  “My view is that they did a commendable and exceptional job,” Nichols said of the prosecutors, adding that he felt “they did a truly excellent job in this case.”\n \n\n   \n  White and Valdivia attended Taranto’s sentencing and declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz and Casey Gannon contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/media/mtg-the-view-marjorie-taylor-greene-abc-disney","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:09:00Z","title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene to Appear on 'The View' Amid Pivot from Republican Orthodoxy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial Republican congresswoman from Georgia, is set to appear on ABC’s 'The View' on Tuesday, October 31, 2025, marking a significant shift after years of conflict with the show’s hosts.

Next week, they’re getting one of the most outspoken: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n \n\n   \n  The MAGA congresswoman from Georgia, long known for her fiery rhetoric and penchant for political brawling, will appear on the ABC daytime talk show next Tuesday, co-host Whoopi Goldberg announced during Thursday’s broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  After the show briefly discussed Greene as an example of a Republican lawmaker who has begun to break with her party, Goldberg said, “I’m happy to say that she’s going to be here on Tuesday.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene confirmed the news in an  X post , sharing a clip of Goldberg’s announcement and writing, “I look forward to joining the ladies on The View on Tuesday!”\n \n\n   \n  The booking of Greene is remarkable given the congresswoman’s years-long, antagonistic posture towards both “The View” and its owners at Disney. She once  railed against  “the angry, nasty women on The View” and  publicly beefed  with co-host   Joy Behar. Greene has also accused Disney of being “ pro-child predator ” for its opposition to Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “The View” co-hosts have often criticized Greene’s behavior and rhetoric. In 2023, co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump aide,  mocked Greene for sporting  a fur-collared jacket to a State of the Union address, saying “it looked like she skinned my puppy.”\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s appearance on “The View” will come amid the congresswoman’s apparent pivot into a rogue conservative figure willing to break with Republican leaders, especially over their shutdown strategy. (She is also set to  make her late-night TV debut  this Friday on Bill Maher’s HBO talk show; HBO and CNN share a corporate owner.)\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, “The View”  praised  Greene, calling her “the surprising voice of reason” on the GOP side of the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a dark day when Marjorie Taylor Greene is the voice of reason, but you know what they say about a blind squirrel,” Farah Griffin said. “They find a nut every now and then.”\n \n\n   \n  “Frankly, we should invite her on,” co-host Ana Navarro said.\n \n\n   \n  A few weeks later, “The View” did just that.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/gift-tracker-trump-foreign-leaders-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:24:00Z","title":"Gold crown, golf clubs and a jet: Tracking Trump’s gifts from foreign leaders this year","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article explores the diplomatic gift-giving practices during Donald Trump’s second term, focusing on extravagant and personalized items such as a gold crown, golf clubs, and a jet received from foreign leaders in Asia.

consumers’ credit scores from medical debt \n       \n  By Noam N. Levey, KFF Health News\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:49 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration took another step Tuesday to weaken protections for Americans with medical debt, issuing new guidance that threatens ongoing state efforts to keep that debt off consumers’ credit reports.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen states, including Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Maryland, New York, and most of New England, have enacted laws in recent years to keep medical debt from affecting consumers’ credit.\n \n\n   \n  And more states — including several in conservative regions of the Midwest and Mountain West —  have been considering  similar protections, spurred by bipartisan concerns that medical debt on a credit report can make it harder for people to get a home, a car, or a job.\n \n\n   \n  Nationwide,  about 100 million people  have some form of health care debt, with millions burdened by $10,000 or more in unpaid bills.\n \n\n   \n  But  in the new guidance , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau asserts that federal law bars states from restricting medical debts from credit reports, arguing that only the federal government has this authority.\n \n\n   \n  “Congress meant to occupy the field of consumer reporting and displace state laws,” the bureau concluded in an “interpretive rule” signed by Russell Vought, the White House budget director and acting head of the CFPB.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance, which offers a new interpretation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, reverses policies advanced under former President Joe Biden that sought to empower states to expand protections for people with medical debt.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s latest move will not immediately roll back existing state protections.\n \n\n   \n  But advocates for patients and consumers warn that the new guidance may stall progress elsewhere, just as millions of Americans are poised to lose federal aid that helps them buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The aid is tied up in the current budget showdown between congressional Republicans and Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “You’d be hard-pressed to find a crueler regulatory interpretation,” said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president for the Community Service Society of New York. The nonprofit has pushed for medical debt protections in that state.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Culp, who oversees state lobbying efforts by Blood Cancer United, formerly known as the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, warned that the Trump administration’s guidance could reverberate across the country. “This rule will have a chilling effect on states’ willingness to pass these critical patient protections,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The new CFPB guidance might spur more litigation challenging state restrictions on medical debt credit reporting.\n \n\n   \n  Trade groups representing credit reporting agencies and debt collectors went to court early this year challenging  regulations issued by the Biden administration  that would have removed medical debt from credit reports nationwide.

30-room mansion in Windsor \n       \n  By Lianne Kolirin and Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:07 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Britain’s King Charles has announced that his brother,  Andrew , will be stripped of his “ prince ” title and ordered to leave Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion that has been his home since 2003, over the swirling Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the sprawling property in Windsor Great Park, west of London, that is home to Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and where their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, spent much of their teenage years\n \n\n   \n    Why does Andrew live in Royal Lodge?\n \n\n   \n  The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, which is officially owned by the Crown Estate. The prince paid £1 million for the property in 2003, and under the terms of the 75-year lease, which was due to expire on June 15, 2078, he was expected to pay for any refurbishment work and the maintenance of the surrounding grounds.\n \n\n   \n  He was also required upfront to pay £7.5 million ($10 million) to cover necessary refurbishments that were completed in 2005, according to a  National Audit Office report.  According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent “if demanded” was only required to be “one peppercorn” per annum.\n \n\n   \n  The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener’s cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in.\n \n\n   \n  It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n \n\n   \n  There had been intense media speculation in recent weeks over Prince Andrew’s continued occupancy of Royal Lodge. Before Thursday’s announcement, Buckingham Palace and the Crown Estate had declined to comment on reports that he was in talks to leave the residence.\n \n\n   \n    Two centuries of royal residents\n \n\n   \n  A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. Its first links with the royal family came in the early 19th century when George IV, then the prince regent, converted the rustic-styled cottage into a hunting lodge and then private retreat. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge.\n \n\n   \n  After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a “grace and favor” residence for most of the rest of the century.\n \n\n   \n  The Royal Chapel was added to the site in 1865, but, though situated within the grounds of the lodge, it does not come under the current lease.\n \n\n   \n  The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV’s original cottage.\n \n\n   \n  Prince Andrew’s late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents — then the Duke and Duchess of York — in 1932. The family remained at Royal Lodge until the duke and duchess were crowned four years later, following the abdication of Edward VIII.\n \n\n   \n  Following her husband’s death in 1952 and the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother used the Royal Lodge as her Windsor residence until her death in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  After his grandmother died, Prince Andrew approached the Crown Estate about acquiring the leasehold on the property. The property was not offered to the wider market because of its sensitive location in the heart of Windsor Great Park and the need for security, given its proximity to the Royal Chapel.\n \n\n   \n    What changes has Andrew made?\n \n\n   \n  The renovation work that Andrew carried out on the family property included internal alterations to the tiled ceiling, external repainting, new tarmac for the gate entrance and light fittings and cameras for outside the lodge, according to a planning application lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001.\n \n\n   \n    Queen Elizabeth’s fairy-tale playhouse\n \n\n   \n  Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as “little cottage.” The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children — as did their children and grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n  In a 2012 BBC documentary called “The Diamond Queen,” Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been “lucky enough” to play there together with their cousins as children.\n \n\n   \n  She described it as the “most glamorous Wendy house ever” and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a “bit of a spruce-up.”   \n \n\n   \n  Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.   \n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Eugenie’s sister, Beatrice, tied the knot on the estate itself, marrying Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a small ceremony in the chapel while Covid-19 restrictions were in place.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/science/interstellar-comet-3i-atlas-sun","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"16:20:00Z","title":"Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS just made its closest pass of the sun.

closest pass of the sun. Discover where it’s going next \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An interstellar comet that originated outside our solar system just made its closest pass of the sun, setting it on an outgoing path — but it’s not leaving our cosmic neighborhood yet.\n \n\n   \n  The comet, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, came within about   126 million miles (203 million kilometers) of our star, according to  EarthSky . The object is currently behind the sun from the perspective of ground-based telescopes on Earth, but astronomers anticipate being able to view the comet again in a few weeks, said Darryl Seligman, assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University.\n \n\n   \n  Stargazers using telescopes should be able to see the object in the predawn sky beginning November 11, according to EarthSky.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers will have a few more months to observe the comet before it begins heading   out of our solar system, Seligman said.\n \n\n   \n  The comet will make its closest approach of Earth on December 19, coming within about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) — but it poses no threat to our planet, according to the  European Space Agency .\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers have been observing the comet, only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, since its discovery on July 1.\n \n\n   \n  Each observation is shedding light on this interstellar object and how different it may be from comets that originated in our solar system.\n \n\n   \n    The ingredients of an interstellar comet\n \n\n   \n  Comets are like dirty snowballs left over from the formation of solar systems.\n \n\n   \n  A comet’s nucleus is its solid core, made of ice, dust and rocks. When comets travel near stars such as the sun, heat causes them to release gas and dust, which creates their signature tails.\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers are interested in capturing as many observations of the comet as they can because as it nears the sun, material releasing from the object could reveal more about its composition — and the star system where it originated.\n \n\n   \n  “When it gets closest to the sun, you get the most holistic view of the nucleus possible,” Seligman said. “One of the main things driving most cometary scientists is, what is the composition of the volatiles? It shows you the initial primordial material that it formed from.”\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have used powerful tools, such as the Hubble Space and James Webb Space telescopes, along with a multitude of space-based missions, such as  SPHEREx , to study the comet.\n \n\n   \n  The SPHEREx and Webb observations detected carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide,  carbonyl sulphide  and water ice releasing from the comet as it neared the sun, according to the ESA.\n \n\n   \n  Preliminary estimates indicate that the interstellar comet is 3 billion   to 11 billion years old, according to a  study  coauthored by Seligman and Aster Taylor, a doctoral student and Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellow at the University of Michigan, in August. For reference, our solar system is estimated to be about 4.6 billion years old.\n \n\n   \n  Carbon dioxide turns directly from a solid into a gas in response to temperature changes much more easily than most elements — which means the comet has likely never been close to another star before its brush with the sun, Seligman said.\n \n\n   \n    All eyes on 3I/ATLAS\n \n\n   \n  The interstellar comet faded from the view of ground-based telescopes in October, but it remained in sight for missions such as  PUNCH , or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, and  SOHO , or the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. The object also made its closest approach of Mars on October 3, coming within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the red planet — and the spacecraft orbiting it.\n \n\n   \n  While the government shutdown has prevented data sharing from any NASA missions that have observed the comet since October 1, the ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter attempted to capture views of 3I/ATLAS in October.\n \n\n   \n  The cameras aboard those missions are designed to study the relatively close, bright surface of Mars, but ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter managed to observe the comet as a fuzzy white dot.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the orbiter’s camera, said in a statement, noting the comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times “fainter than our usual target.”\n \n\n   \n  ESA’s  Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer , or Juice, will also attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS in November using multiple instruments despite the comet being farther from the spacecraft than it was when observed by   the Mars orbiters. But astronomers don’t expect to receive the observations until February due to the rate at which the spacecraft is sending data back to Earth.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got several more months to observe it,” Seligman said. “And there’s going to be amazing science that comes out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/democrats-leave-classified-briefing-on-us-military-strikes-unsatisfied-after-pentagon-pulls-lawyers","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00-04:00","title":"Democrats Leave Classified Briefing on US Military Strikes Unsatisfied After Trump Administration Pulls Pentagon Lawyers","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democrats have expressed deep dissatisfaction with the Trump administration’s refusal to provide full transparency regarding recent U.S. military strikes on suspected drug boats in the western hemisphere, particularly after being excluded from a key classified briefing on Capitol Hill.

Democrats leave classified briefing on US military strikes unsatisfied after Trump administration pulls Pentagon lawyers \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Morgan Rimmer, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:39 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democrats say the Trump administration still won’t share critical details of  recent US military strikes  on suspected drug boats in the western hemisphere, asserting that Pentagon lawyers were pulled at the last minute Thursday from a briefing on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  As they emerged from the closed-door session, they railed on the administration for not being transparent and appearing to flout the law. The briefing came a day after  Democrats say they were shut out of another meeting  where administration officials shared information on the strikes with their Republican colleagues.\n \n\n   \n  “Am I leaving satisfied? Absolutely not. And the last word that I gave to the admiral was, ‘I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in and the peril you are putting our troops in’,” Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts told reporters of the Thursday briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “What I heard here today was a tactical brief. I heard no strategy, no end game, no assessment of how they are going to end the flow of drugs into the United States, which needs to happen, by the way,” Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, who sits on the House Armed Services and the Intelligence committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Fuming at a separate press conference over his accusation that the White House  cut Democrats out  of a Wednesday briefing, Sen. Mark Warner had an even sharper take: “bullsh*t.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let me be blunt, what the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive, not only to our democracy, but downright dangerous for our national security,” Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration in recent weeks has accelerated its attacks against boats they allege are involved in drug trafficking. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly criticized the administration for failing to provide them with enough information related to those strikes.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has defended its information sharing with Congress, telling CNN earlier this week it has given  seven separate classified briefings  on the strikes to various committees. But the information that Pentagon officials have offered so far on those attacks during closed-door briefings has largely fueled more questions and concerns from Democrats about the administration’s legal justification for them – especially as only select Republicans have been allowed to see the classified legal opinion detailing that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats said the information provided to them Thursday fell short of what they needed to provide proper congressional checks on the president’s war powers.\n \n\n   \n  “I sit on the Armed Services and the Intelligence Committee. Our job is to oversee the use of lethal force by our military outside of the United States, and I’m walking away without an understanding of how and why they’re making an assessment that the use of lethal force is adequate here,” Crow said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California similarly said “the level of transparency was not OK” and added that “there’s nothing that we heard in there that changes my assessment that this is completely illegal, that it is unlawful and even if Congress authorized it, it would still be illegal because there are extrajudicial killings where we have no evidence.”\n \n\n   \n  The briefers, Jacobs said, only cited Article II as the legal justification for the strikes and said they didn’t know the identities of all of the individuals involved in them. They also told lawmakers that cocaine was the only narcotic targeted in the strikes so far and claimed it is a “facilitating drug of fentanyl,” according to the congresswoman. “It was not a satisfactory answer for most of us,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the Democratic ranking members, Republican chairmen of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees attended the meeting but declined to comment to reporters afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Mike Rogers, the Armed Services chairman, would only tell CNN he expects an additional briefing.\n \n\n   \n    Republicans defend need for bipartisan briefings\n \n\n   \n  Still, several Senate Republicans said Democrats should have been invited to Wednesday’s briefing on the Caribbean boat strikes, though they insisted their exclusion wasn’t malicious.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an unfortunate situation, and I wish it wouldn’t have happened this way. It did, but I’ve talked to a number of my colleagues already and told them that we still agree that this should be delivered on a bipartisan basis,” Sen. Mike Rounds, who sits on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said.\n \n\n   \n  Rounds added that his understanding was that several GOP senators had requested a further briefing on the legality of the strikes, and other Republicans, including him, also asked to be included.\n \n\n   \n  “When I got into the meeting, I realized that there were people from a lot of different committees, but I couldn’t identify the group in particular, but there were no Democrats there,” he said. “And so afterwards, we went back and followed up. The White House called us and said, ‘Yeah, this was a separate meeting. It was asked for by one of your colleagues.’ We just happen to have also been invited to it, and that is consistent with what we saw.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Kevin Cramer agreed that his Democratic colleagues should have access to the same briefings as Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that any administration should leave out any party from a briefing of that level of importance. And I think their justification — you can argue it, and no doubt people will — but I don’t think that something of that importance shouldn’t be shared. Whether it’s legal justification or if there’s — if there are details about who are on these boats and what these boats are containing, you know, the tactics, I think all of that should be available to people who oversee the Pentagon,” Cramer said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats didn’t hide their their frustration with the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “It is totally unprecedented in my 15 years of service in the United States Senate that intelligence briefings on a matter of this consequence would be held for one party alone,” said an angry Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal.\n \n\n   \n  “It speaks volumes to this administration concealing the facts and worrying about the law.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/africa/tanzania-election-protests-dar-es-salaam-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:54:00Z","title":"More protests in Dar es Salaam after chaotic Tanzanian election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a general election in Tanzania, widespread protests erupted in Dar es Salaam and other cities, driven by claims of vote manipulation, the disqualification of major opposition parties like CHADEMA and ACT-Wazalendo, and allegations of government repression.

release of the trailers for “Scream 7” and “Stranger Things 5” on the same day, also known as Halloween eve.\n \n\n   \n  The latest in the “Scream” franchise reunites stars Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox as part of a cast which also includes several others, including Isabel May, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Joel McHale, Mckenna Grace and Mark Consuelos. Campbell sat out the last round, so this  marks her return  to the slasher franchise. Joining her are other returning stars including some who were previously believed to be killed off, like David Arquette,  Matthew Lillard  and Scott Foley.\n \n\n   \n  “When a new Ghostface killer emerges in the quiet town where Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has built a new life, her darkest fears are realized as her daughter (Isabel May) becomes the next target,” according to the film’s synopsis. “Determined to protect her family, Sidney must face the horrors of her past to put an end to the bloodshed once and for all.”\n \n\n   \n  Kevin Williamson created the characters from the slasher franchise and directs the latest film. “Scream VI” came out in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Hawkins crew has reunited for the  final season of the hit Netflix series “Stranger Things.” \n \n\n   \n  In Season 5, it is the fall of 1987, the town has been quarantined by the military and everything has been turned Upside Down. The Queen song “Who Wants to Live Forever” underscores the drama in the trailer.\n \n\n   \n  “I think what’s unique about this season is that it starts a little bit in chaos because our heroes ultimately lost at the end of Season 4,” series co-creator Ross Duffer  told Tudum.  “We usually set up their normal life and how they’re going about school, and then we introduce the supernatural element. But in this case, this season is sprinting from the start.”\n \n\n   \n  The last season of “Stranger Things” premiered in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Volume 1 of “Stranger Things 5” starts streaming November 26, with subsequent volumes coming around Christmas and New Year’s.\n \n\n   \n  “Scream 7” hits theaters on Feb 27, 2026.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/boston-judge-intervene-snap-payments","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:46:00-04:00","title":"Judge Indicates She’ll Intervene in Fight Over SNAP Food Assistance Money","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Boston, Indira Talwani, has signaled her intent to intervene in a legal battle over the Trump administration’s refusal to use a $5.3 billion emergency fund to cover food stamp (SNAP) benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November.

\nUpdated: \n        2:46 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A federal judge in Boston indicated Thursday that she will intervene in a high-stakes fight over the Trump administration’s decision to not tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to help cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” US District Judge Indira Talwani said near the end of a hearing, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Though the judge’s options vary, one possibility is that she issues an emergency order that essentially compels the administration to tap into the emergency funds. While she indicated from the bench that she was likely to issue a ruling favorable to a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors who sued the administration earlier this week, she acknowledged that benefits, which should start being sent to recipients on November 1, will be delayed.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re dealing with the reality that … the benefits aren’t going to be there on November 1,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Talwani said she would work quickly to issue her decision later Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps, a critical piece of the  nation’s safety net.  The program costs roughly $8.5 billion to $9 billion a month, while the contingency fund now has about $5.3 billion in it, according to court filings submitted by the Justice Department, which is representing USDA in the case.\n \n\n   \n  If the judge orders the government to use the emergency funds, it will take time for the US Department of Agriculture and states to get their systems up and running again, which means at least some beneficiaries will likely have to wait for the November allotment.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also unclear whether recipients will receive their full November benefits since the USDA’s contingency fund does not have enough money to cover the entire payments without drawing from other resources. But the Trump administration has shifted money to fund other priorities during the shutdown, including transferring $300 million to keep the  WIC food assistance program  for pregnant women, new moms and young children afloat for October.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the discussion during Thursday’s hearing centered around the fact that the contingency fund contains far less than what is needed to fully cover November benefits for the millions of Americans who receive them. The judge said multiple times that federal law made clear that when the government is unable to pay benefits, it should reduce what it provides, not suspend the program altogether.\n \n\n   \n  “It does seem to me really clear what Congress was trying to do,” Talwani said. “What Congress was trying to do is protect the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger, Talwani added.\n \n\n   \n  A group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC,  sued the administration on Tuesday   over the US Department of Agriculture’s recent decision to not tap into the contingency fund.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, USDA said that it was unable to use the rainy-day fund, reversing course from earlier agency guidance that said such a move was possible. In the program’s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\n \n\n   \n  As the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene on an emergency basis to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  In the food stamps case, the attorneys general and governors argued the administration was violating federal law that requires the government to consistently fund the food stamps program and that its decision to not tap into the contingency fund ran afoul of federal rulemaking laws.\n \n\n   \n  “USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits,” they wrote in the lawsuit. “Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.”\n \n\n   \n    Delayed payments\n \n\n   \n  States stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees’ information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients’ benefit cards.\n \n\n   \n  Each state has a specific date by which they must send the information – ranging from a week before the start of the month to the first day of the month – in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to acknowledging the likely delay in benefits, the judge on Thursday also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won’t cover the full amount.\n \n\n   \n  An attorney for Massachusetts told Talwani that it would be up to the states to figure out how to reduce payments based on the available federal funds, but an attorney representing the Trump administration pushed back strongly on that idea.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department lawyer, Jason Altabet, said that while it was up to USDA officials to make decisions on reductions in benefit amounts, the agency was extremely concerned about the prospect of having to do that work.\n \n\n   \n    Changing positions\n \n\n   \n  In its shutdown contingency plan, which has since been taken offline, USDA indicated that the contingency fund can be used for benefits in case of a lapse. The plan noted that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue.”\n \n\n   \n  But on October 10, the agency began raising red flags, informing states that there is  not enough money  to pay full food stamp benefits in November if the lapse in federal funding continues and asking them to hold off on next month’s payments until further notice.\n \n\n   \n  Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins doubled down on that position the following week, telling reporters that food stamps will run dry by the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  And last week, the USDA said it  will not tap into the fund , stating in a memo that “contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time that food stamps have been at risk during a shutdown. During the record-long impasse that began in December 2018, the USDA initially said benefits would run dry at the end of January. But the agency then said it would use a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse to  cover February payments . That workaround ultimately wasn’t needed since the shutdown ended in late January.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/democratic-campaign-trail-2028-hopefuls","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:43:00Z","title":"The 2025 Campaign Trail Becomes Popular Stop for Democrats with Eyes on 2028","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, the Democratic Party is using off-year elections—particularly in New Jersey and Virginia—as a strategic platform for 2028 presidential hopefuls.

Ruben Gallego of Arizona appeared with the party’s nominee Abigail Spanberger to rally Latino voters before holding a similar event with Sherrill in her state this weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg and Gallego’s appearances come as the off-year and midterm elections have turned into an early testing ground for 2028 presidential hopefuls – giving them a chance to sharpen their campaign skills outside of their home states and help elevate fellow Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the high-profile Democratic surrogate work has played out in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  But the New York City mayoral race has drawn the progressive star power of hometown Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ardent backer of Democratic nominee  Zohran Mamdani . And in California,  Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Prop 50 campaign  to push through mid-decade redistricting in his state has further propelled him into the national conversation.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re thinking about future campaigns, it’s smart to have a strategy that’s not just about going to the primary states but also showing that you’re a team player in the Democratic Party and that your message can help turn voters out,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for the Democratic Governors Association.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, Buttigieg, a former transportation secretary, touted his work with Sherrill to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel project, a rail project between New Jersey and New York City that Trump said he had “terminated” earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg described the move as “mob boss politics” and criticized Sherrill’s  Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli  for not having “the backbone” to push back on the president.\n \n\n   \n  “This state needs a governor who can think for herself, and someone who will put the best interest of the state first. And there’s only one candidate who will do that,” Buttigieg said at an event with Sherrill at a Westfield, NJ, train station.\n \n\n   \n  Buttigieg was slated later Thursday to help turn out voters in Red Bank and raise money for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. His appearances with Sherrill came one week after he headlined an event with Spanberger and Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of his stop with Sherrill this week, Buttigieg sent an e-mail to his fundraising list saying he was “back on the campaign trail” to help candidates across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Gallego, who has said the Democratic Party needs to do more to win back Latino voters, is tapped this week with taking that pitch to Latino communities in Virginia and New Jersey, a state where the  Latino vote could be key  to picking the next governor.\n \n\n   \n  “Every day, all we want is to have a chance at the American Dream, to be able to build a family here, to have a chance to continue to grow this country and the beautiful vision that everyone has,” Gallego said Thursday at a “Latinos for Spanberger” event in Alexandria, Virginia. “And this is why we as Latinos have to come out and vote today and all the way until Tuesday, because the only way we get that dream is when we have friends that care about us.”\n \n\n   \n    Big names out on the campaign trail for Democrats\n \n\n   \n  Several sitting Democratic governors potentially eyeing higher office have descended on New Jersey and Virginia to give a boost to the women they hope will join their ranks next year. That includes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n \n\n   \n  “The big names you’re hearing in the Democratic Party are more and more governors,” said Leopold. “It’s especially helpful if you’re running for governor to have a governor campaign with you to show the executive experience and show what a governor can do.”\n \n\n   \n   New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker  has been a frequent surrogate for Sherrill in his home state. Other high-profile Democratic surrogates who have hit the campaign trail in New Jersey or Virginia this year include Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; California Rep. Ro Khanna and former US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, who is now a CNN commentator.\n \n\n   \n  “These are the type of leaders that are focused on the everyday problems, the everyday concerns of Americans, and that can be the type of leaders that re-earn the faith of the American people,” Beshear, vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said of Sherrill and Spanberger during a virtual event with the Democratic National Committee Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have helped raise money for the off-year candidates. Newsom, who has said he will make a  decision about 2028  after the midterms, participated in a virtual fundraiser with Sherrill for New Jersey’s Democratic campaigns and state committee, a source familiar with the event said. Meanwhile, Pritzker has donated six-figures across the New Jersey and Virginia races, a source familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  While 2028 hopefuls on the Democratic side have eagerly stumped during this year’s off-year elections, the Republican side has not drawn as much attention from presidential aspirants.\n \n\n   \n  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz joined Virginia’s Republican gubernatorial nominee  Winsome Earle-Sears  last week for a fundraiser. New Jersey’s GOP gubernatorial nominee Ciattarelli has recently campaigned with Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor in Florida in 2026. Trump also held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli this month.\n \n\n   \n  Though New Jersey and Virginia have seen frequent visits from high-profile Democrats, the New York City mayoral race has not drawn as many national party figures to campaign on behalf of Mamdani, a democratic socialist.\n \n\n   \n  But  he has received a boost  from Ocasio-Cortez and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – both popular figures with the progressive base who are able to draw large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m talking to you, Donald Trump,” Ocasio-Cortez declared at a rally last weekend, saying that “we will work our hearts out to elect Zohran Kwame Mamdani as the next mayor of the great city of New York.”\n \n\n   \n  While each of these high-profile Democrats has taken a turn on the campaign stage, former President Barack Obama remains the party’s most sought-after surrogate. He’s taped ads for Sherrill and Spanberger and will campaign in-person for the two Democratic candidates in their states on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  But the Democratic party’s most recent leaders – former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden – have not appeared on this year’s campaign trail as Democrats still grapple with the fallout of last year’s election.\n \n\n   \n  Harris, who has left the door open to a possible run in 2028, sent a fundraising e-mail on behalf of Sherrill this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Again and again, Mikie has shown that she is not afraid of a tough fight, and that she will stand up to anyone who attacks the rights, freedoms, or livelihoods of the people she serves,” Harris wrote. “That is exactly the kind of leadership we need right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden has not made any campaign stops since leaving office but is scheduled to appear at a political event for the Nebraska Democratic Party three days after Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Biden was one of the Democratic Party’s most active surrogates for the midterm elections, stumping for candidates in places like Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. He launched his presidential campaign the following spring.\n \n\n   \n  Now, a new crop of Democrats is trying to chart its own path to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the start, 2025,” said Leopold. “And you’re going to see a lot more of it in 2026.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/ed-martin-doj-trump-political-prosecutions","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"15:00:00-04:00","title":"The Weapon of Justice: Ed Martin’s Influence at DOJ","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ed Martin, a Missouri Republican and former US Attorney for Washington, D.C., has risen to significant influence within the Trump Justice Department despite failing Senate confirmation.

 \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Failing to win Senate approval as US Attorney for Washington, DC, has made Ed Martin a more formidable force inside the Trump Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  After three chaotic months as interim US attorney earlier this year, Justice Department officials placed Martin in the department’s headquarters in a traditionally more supervised position. Unconfirmable and intent on rewriting the consequences of the January 6 prosecutions, Martin was, as one Trump ally said, being put under more “adult supervision.”\n \n\n   \n  That move, though, didn’t appear to hold him back. Martin now wields a surprising amount of political power and four titles: Associate Deputy Attorney General, Pardon Attorney, director of the Weaponization Working Group and Special Attorney for Mortgage Fraud. He’s also become the chief enforcer of using the Justice Department to exact President Donald Trump’s personal agenda — including by playing a role behind the scenes in the recent indictments of Trump foes  James Comey  and  Letitia James,  delving into so-called “weaponization” within the federal government and Biden-era pardons, and continuing to bear down on others Trump wants to see investigated.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Martin told the Republican-led House Oversight Committee that he was working on an “ongoing investigation” of pardons and commutations during Joe Biden’s presidency.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, which adds fuel to Trump’s attacks of presidential clemency given to members of the House Select Committee that investigated January 6 and others before they faced charges, recasts the traditional role of a pardon attorney in the extreme. Previously the job focused on reviewing and making recommendations to the president after prisoners petitioned for clemency. Under Martin, it’s become a much more active, politicized approach, where he is now critiquing past presidents’ clemency, a Constitutional power that has few limitations.\n \n\n   \n  “My ongoing investigation has revealed abuses of the pardon and commutation process by political actors in the Biden Administration. The use of AutoPen at the direction of staff and perhaps others is troubling,” Martin wrote to committee chairman James Comer, according to an email to obtained by CNN’s Jake Tapper. The Justice Department has previously said a president’s use of an autopen is legally sound.\n \n\n   \n  Martin’s influence also has become evident in cases where career prosecutors have balked at charging Trump political opponents and which his bosses, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, had reservations about before bringing.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, prosecutions of Comey and  James  have moved ahead over the protests of career prosecutors and even some Trump political appointees. Firings and resignations by experienced prosecutors have followed, and Martin has been in close contact with  Lindsey Halligan , whom Trump placed as the lead US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, who initiated those indictments, sources tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, Martin has turned his focus toward building his connections to other US Attorneys’ Offices, including in Atlanta, St. Louis and upstate New York, according to sources familiar with Martin’s efforts. Some of that effort may include known probes around Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor whom Trump has tried to fire, on mortgage fraud allegations.\n \n\n   \n  “Ed Martin is one of the most dangerous people in the Justice Department. He’s not a serious lawyer, but he has serious power,” said Liz Oyer, a former career Justice Department official who preceded Martin as pardon attorney. “He seemingly has the power to open criminal investigations, which is serious business. Being subject to a criminal investigation can ruin someone’s life.”\n \n\n   \n  Oyer noted that investigating Trump’s political opponents and holding the pardon post gives Martin especially unusual influence — as a political force who can both punish Trump’s enemies and reward his friends.\n \n\n   \n  His willingness to use the Justice Department to advance MAGA movement politics stands in contrast with the Justice Department norms since the Richard Nixon era. Reforms after the Watergate crisis led to a tradition under Republican and Democratic administrations to distance prosecution decisions from the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Even in the first Trump administration, attorneys general generally enforced rules limiting contact between White House officials and Justice Department employees.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has no such qualms and is known to maintain regular contact with White House officials, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A Missouri Republican, Martin burnished his MAGA credentials following the 2021 Capital attack, becoming a vocal defender of Trump vote fraud claims in the 2020 election and of January 6 rioters — some of whom he represented as an attorney.\n \n\n   \n  As part of his so-called weaponization probe, Martin brought onto his staff former FBI agent Jared Wise, who was prosecuted for allegedly urging January 6 rioters to attack law enforcement officers, calling the officers “Nazis” and the “Gestapo.”\n \n\n   \n  Martin maintains at least two offices at the Justice Department – one in a complex north of the US Capitol where the pardon attorney office is located, the other inside the Justice Department headquarters.\n \n\n   \n  His active social media presence including a Substack blog and his support for January 6 rioters caused wary Senate Republicans to tank his nomination to lead the federal prosecutors’ office in Washington, DC, which prosecuted more than 1,000 January 6 riot defendants, in May.\n \n\n   \n  But Martin appears undaunted despite receiving cautions from top Justice officials about some of his public comments.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Martin has been posting nearly every day on social media photos of people he meets with, including right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the comedian Russel Brand, US Attorneys from outside of DC, and Trump supporters in politics from around the country.\n \n\n   \n  He also has been lobbying prosecutors in Maryland to pursue mortgage fraud allegations around Democratic California Sen.  Adam Schiff,  another one of Trump’s political opponents, who helped lead congressional investigations of him, sources say.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department and Martin didn’t comment for this story.\n \n\n   \n  Martin sought to flex his influence earlier this month as former New York Rep. George Santos won a sentence commutation from the president, after serving in a minimal-security federal prison camp only three months of his seven-year sentence for fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Santos for months had sought the help of intermediaries to get Trump’s attention for a pardon and Martin tried to help behind the scenes, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  After the president granted the commutation, Martin said in a post on X: “I was honored as U.S. Pardon Attorney to have played a small role” in the clemency grant, and he thanks the president for “making clemency great again.”\n \n\n   \n  “Martin has made it known that his intent with pardons is to use them to benefit people with MAGA affiliations,” Oyer said. “For Martin to have both of those roles,” of pardon attorney and prosecutor, “it shows how this department is operating a system of both punishment and reward.”\n \n\n   \n    Catching Trump’s attention\n \n\n   \n  Some of Martin’s recent campaigns have been channeled into the president’s own social media feed. For instance, with Martin as the mortgage fraud investigator, Trump lashed out at Bondi, demanding in a  remarkable Truth Social  post for the prosecution of his political enemies.\n \n\n   \n  “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Blanche has sought to bring a measure of control to Martin’s efforts, according to people briefed on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  The tension between Blanche and Martin spilled out into the public in late September, after Martin sent a letter to an FBI agent who had responded to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Martin, in his letter, disclosed what he said was an investigation of the agent, after the agent had testified about being smeared in a conspiracy theory pushed by Jones, who gained notoriety with claims that the Sand Hook attack was staged by the FBI. The agent was awarded nearly $100 million in a case against Jones.\n \n\n   \n  Jones made Martin’s letter public, demanding responses from the FBI agent, until Blanche demanded Martin retract his requests.\n \n\n   \n  Martin then wrote to the agent’s lawyer, “I write to inform you that there is no investigation of you or your client. Because of this, I hereby withdraw my request for information from you or your former client.”\n \n\n   \n    An ally in Virginia\n \n\n   \n  But Martin’s power has accrued alongside the arrival of another former Trump adviser, Halligan, who Trump installed to run the powerful US Attorney’s Office in Alexandria, Virginia, in late September.\n \n\n   \n  While career prosecutors and top Justice officials viewed cases against Comey and James to be duds, Halligan managed to deliver the two indictments Trump publicly called for.\n \n\n   \n  Halligan replaced Erik Seibert after attorneys in the office objected to charging Comey with lying to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Both Comey and James have pleaded not guilty and are challenging the prosecutors’ handling of the cases.\n \n\n   \n  In the James investigation before she was charged, Martin took several steps that fall outside the norms of prosecutorial conduct.\n \n\n   \n  Martin this summer sent a letter to James’ attorney, Abbe Lowell, suggesting that James should resign as attorney general. And he paid a visit to James’ Brooklyn  home  in August, posing for photos outside it wearing a long trench coat, accompanied by an assistant who acts as an unofficial spokesperson, unusual for a person in Martin’s position to have at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to go to the very bottom of the facts, and if somebody did something wrong, we’re not only going to hold them accountable. We’re also going to look at everything else that they’ve been doing. Because when you’re a liar, you lie not just on one thing,” Martin said on Fox News in August when asked about the mortgage investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Some senior DOJ officials were frustrated by the stunt, one source said, as they had no idea Martin would be traveling to New York.\n \n\n   \n    Attention in Maryland\n \n\n   \n  Apparently emboldened by the charging successes in Virginia, Martin’s fast-moving advocacy turned in recent weeks to Maryland’s US Attorney’s Office.\n \n\n   \n  The office’s US Attorney Kelly Hayes, a respected career prosecutor who worked for years out of Greenbelt, recently secured the indictment of former Trump national security adviser  John Bolton , another Trump political foe. Prosecutors accuse Bolton of keeping national security secrets in unsecured personal accounts and on printed paper after he left the government.\n \n\n   \n  Hayes’ approach, and the Bolton case itself, are viewed more seriously than the indictments and investigations of other political figures who have faced charges at Trump’s urging, several sources familiar with the case and the office have told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But the Maryland office still has a prosecutor looking into the financial records of Schiff, another Trump target, and Martin continues to push Hayes to bring an indictment against him.\n \n\n   \n  Last week after it became known Hayes’ team had doubts about the case, sources said the investigation was continuing and the Deputy Attorney General’s office may be working with Hayes, in a vote of confidence for the US Attorney in a precarious moment.\n \n\n   \n  Yet because of Martin’s pushes for prosecution in Maryland and Virginia, the districts are now buzzing with speculation Martin could end up as a prosecutor in one of the offices.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/abby-zwerner-lawsuit-trial-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00Z","title":"Teacher Shot by 6-Year-Old Student Testifies in $40 Million Lawsuit Against Former Assistant Principal","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abby Zwerner, a first-grade teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia, was shot by a 6-year-old student on January 6, 2023, during a classroom reading session.

I thought I had died,” Abby Zwerner said Thursday, shortly before her attorneys rested their case, recounting the moment she was shot in the hand and chest on January 6, 2023, while sitting at a reading table in her classroom at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner raised her hand instinctively as she realized what the student was going to do, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “The look on the student’s face is the large memory that I have,” Zwerner said Thursday. “It was like a very blank look, but it wasn’t a blank look at all.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN All Access has live coverage of teacher shot by student trial \n \n\n   \n  One of Zwerner’s last memories at the school the day she was shot, she said, was thinking, “I was on my way to heaven or in heaven.”\n \n\n   \n  “My next memory is I see two coworkers around me,” Zwerner said. “I process that I’m hurt, and they’re putting pressure on where I’m hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has filed a $40 million lawsuit against ex-assistant principal   Ebony Parker, saying Parker failed to act when several people approached her with concerns the boy had brought a gun to school.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial offers a peek inside some of the key details that will be presented during the criminal case next month against Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect.\n \n\n   \n  Filing charges against school officials in the aftermath of a school shooting is rare, a law professor at the University of Virginia told CNN, and this case could set a precedent for future events as US communities grapple with questions of responsibility after a school is scarred by gun violence.\n \n\n   \n  It remains an increasingly pervasive problem: As of Monday, there have been  64 school shootings  in the United States so far this year, 27 of which took place on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n    Official ignored warning signs, lawsuit alleges\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner described the consequences of the physical trauma wrought by the shooting. Because of her injury, which prompted multiple surgeries, Zwerner is unable to fully use her left hand to this day, she said. \n \n\n   \n  “Overall, I would say I do struggle with things, doing things,” she said, like opening a bag of chips and water bottles. \n \n\n   \n  She also testified to lingering emotional trauma such as being afraid to go out in public with her mother and sister and feeling distant from friends. \n \n\n   \n  “I just want to stay home,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The  lawsuit alleges  Parker ignored concerns raised by several teachers and staff members, including that the student may have had a gun in his possession hours before the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Parker is accused of ignoring “warnings from teachers and staff that students had seen the firearm” and that the student had “removed an object that was likely a firearm from his backpack before it was searched,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  A guidance counselor and administrator at the school said Parker also “forbade” teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his mother would pick him up soon, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was required to be accompanied by a parent at school “because of his violent tendencies.” But the day of the shooting, school administrators “allowed him to remain unaccompanied,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  During the previous school year, the boy strangled and choked a teacher and pulled up a female classmate’s dress and touched her inappropriately on the school playground, the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  Poor decisions led up to the “avoidable” shooting, a grand jury report found last April.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorney has previously not responded to CNN’s request for comment. On Thursday, during cross-examination, an attorney for Parker worked to undercut Zwerner’s claims about the shooting, limiting her willingness to go out in public.   \n \n\n   \n  The attorney presented evidence Zwerner had attended concerts since the shooting, including the Taylor Swift Eras tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking Zwerner how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner was proud of graduating but was often in pain, she said. She has yet to get a job in cosmetology and can’t work in the field until after her hand heals from her latest surgery, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal was reassigned to another school. The incident also led the school board to vote out the superintendent.\n \n\n   \n    Teacher’s witnesses describe emotional toll\n \n\n   \n  The third day of testimony began with Zwerner’s attorneys calling to the stand a psychiatrist who testified Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner had overcome mental stressors in the past, Dr. Clarence Watson testified, like when she had a heavy workload in college or soon after her father’s sudden death. But the shooting was “like throwing gasoline on top of the fire,” causing her recurring nightmares.\n \n\n   \n  “She has lost the sense of being safe, something that she had not experienced before, even when she was feeling depressed or anxious … She now doesn’t want to go anywhere,” Watson said. “She had become socially withdrawn and isolated, pulled away from friends, didn’t want to be in public as much, and felt fear in places that she didn’t feel fear before.”\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Zwerner wiped away tears as her twin sister reflected Wednesday on the   changes she’s seen in Zwerner since the first-grade teacher was shot by her 6-year-old student more than two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah Zwerner told the court, saying the shooting dimmed a sister who used to be a bright light.\n \n\n   \n  “She had a lot to be excited about. And she doesn’t anymore.”\n \n\n   \n    Injuries were devastating\n \n\n   \n  The chief of surgery where Zwerner was hospitalized testified Tuesday her injuries were life-threatening. Her lung collapsed and the bullet that remains inside Zwerner’s body just missed her heart, Daniel Munn said. An orthopedic trauma surgeon testified about the details of Zwerner’s devastating hand injury, her multiple surgeries and ongoing recovery.\n \n\n   \n  After two weeks in the hospital and six surgeries, Zwerner is left with a hand that will never be normal, orthopedic surgeon James Stuart told the court.\n \n\n   \n  A now-retired corporal from the Newport News Sheriff’s Office testified Wednesday about his response to the scene after the shooting. “We were quite taken aback. We didn’t expect to see so young a suspect,” the corporal testified.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s lawyers also introduced body cam footage and police scene photographs into evidence.\n \n\n   \n    School official is only defendant\n \n\n   \n  Parker is the only defendant in the lawsuit. A judge previously dismissed the others, including the Newport News School Board, the district’s former superintendent and the former school principal, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  The student’s mother was  sentenced  to a total of nearly four years in prison for    child neglect and federal weapons charges.\n \n\n   \n  The boy was  not charged  with any wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The gun used in the shooting was purchased by the boy’s mother, kept on the top shelf of her closet and was secured by a trigger lock, an attorney for the mother  previously told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  However, prosecutors  later said  authorities found no trigger lock and no key to a trigger lock. The boy stood on a dresser drawer and took the gun from his mother’s purse.  ﻿ He then brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said.\n \n\n   \n  The boy’s mother had no criminal record and cooperated with authorities since the shooting. She  turned herself in  to police after state charges were filed  against her and was released after posting a $5,000 bond.\n \n\n   \n    Case could set precedent\n \n\n   \n  Because attempts to hold school officials criminally accountable for school shootings are rare, this case could set a precedent, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The closest thing to something like the case against Parker is when charges were filed against the deputy who stayed outside during the mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, he said. The deputy in that case  was acquitted  on all counts against him in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  As of October 26, there have been  356 mass shootings  in the US this year, leaving  at least 300 people dead  and 1,600 injured,  according to  data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one that injured or killed four or more people.\n \n\n   \n  Charging school officials for neglect appears to be an “emerging strategy,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems to be kind of the only strategy left that we can put responsibility on the people who provide access to guns, at least to children, at least to school children and children under 16 or 18,” Brown said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the civil trial could be a “dry run” for what’s to come in the criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone on both sides the prosecution and the defense should have a very clear idea of what the evidence is going to be and what the witnesses are going to say,” the professor said.\n \n\n   \n  The cases could end up setting “a very big” precedent and lead to school officials more aware of their duties to act on any information they have about a child with a gun or who poses a danger to students and staff, Brown said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-7-500-refugees-limit-white-south-africans","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:54:00-04:00","title":"Trump Sets 7,500 Annual Limit for Refugees Entering US.

 \n  By Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:18 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The neurologic disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE has most often been found in people who experienced repeated blows to the head while playing contact sports and there’s now  evidence  of genetic damage inside the brain, too.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers examined the brains of football players and others with the  rare neurological disease , and the genetic damage they found looks similar to what they see in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. The damage was so extensive that it was the equivalent of hundreds of years of aging.\n \n\n   \n  CTE typically develops years after someone has received repeated blows to the head. Symptoms can include memory loss, impulse control problems, anxiety, depression and anger issues. It’s most often seen in people who play sports like football, hockey and soccer, but it’s also been detected in the brains of soldiers who have been injured in explosions and in some people who experienced domestic violence.\n \n\n   \n  The disease was first identified nearly 100 years ago in boxers – at the time, scientists called it  “punch-drunk syndrome”  – but there’s still much that experts don’t know about CTE. Not everyone with repeated head trauma develops the condition, and scientists don’t totally understand why or even how head trauma can lead to this disease.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Chris Walsh, co-author of the  study published Thursday  in the journal Science, says there are still people who deny that CTE is even a disease. The latest research, he said, should change naysayers’ minds.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel like this study helps establish that CTE is something distinct from just repetitive head trauma. It represents a more gradually developing pathological process and is a well-defined entity,” said Walsh, who is chief of the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Children’s Hospital and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.” We suspect it involves immune activation in a way similar to Alzheimer’s disease.”\n \n\n   \n  At this point, scientists don’t have a simple blood test or scan that can detect CTE   in a living person. The only way to make  a definitive diagnosis  is to take thin slices of the brain after the person’s death and use a microscope to look for an abnormal accumulation of tau, a protein that stabilizes certain elements of the brain. Too much tau can damage blood vessels and brain cells, and this buildup is also a hallmark   of Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  The brain is made up of a mosaic of cells that each have their own genome. Every time a stem cell divides, it accumulates mutations. The new study used sequencing and amplification technology only recently made available to look at the genes of single cells in hundreds of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain used for decision-making and other thinking skills.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers compared the results from four groups: 15 people who had repeated hits to the brain and were diagnosed with CTE; four people who had repeated head injuries but hadn’t developed CTE; 19 people without a history of head injuries or signs of CTE; and seven people who had Alzheimer’s.\n \n\n   \n  Among the people with CTE, the cells showed genomic damage that looked similar to the brains of people who had Alzheimer’s. The people who had repeated brain trauma but were not diagnosed with CTE did not have the same kind of damage.\n \n\n   \n  “Cells carry a bar code of their whole developmental history, including reflecting environmental influences, and that’s what’s happening in CTE,” Walsh explained. “The abnormal environment created by the repeated trauma damages the genomes of the cells.”\n \n\n   \n  With better understanding of the mechanisms that cause CTE, Walsh hopes the work can eventually lead to developing treatments. Because brain damage with CTE looks similar to Alzheimers, it may even be possible to use therapies for CTE patients that helped people with Alzheimer’s, but much more research will be needed before that could happen.\n \n\n   \n  The new study builds on recent research indicating that brain damage from repeated blows to the head can show up much earlier than the excessive tau markers that are seen with CTE become clear.\n \n\n   \n  A  2023 study  showed that the brain’s immune cells were increasingly activated in proportion to the number of years an athlete played contact sports, suggesting that early cellular damage may be setting the stage for the disease to progress.\n \n\n   \n  A  2020 study  also found that the risk of CTE doubles for every 2.6 years spent playing football. The condition has been reported in people as young as 17, meaning by the time a football player goes pro, they have experienced hundreds of thousands of hits to the head, and that damage seems to be adding up.\n \n\n   \n  The NFL has implemented several rule and equipment changes to reduce the number of head injuries, and the number of concussions has declined, with data from the  2024 season  showing the lowest number of concussions since tracking began in 2015.   Other sports leagues including the NHL, MLS and the English Premier League have also made changes to reduce the number of concussions among their playeres.\n \n\n   \n  But experts say it’s not just concussions that are the problem; any hit to the head can cause damage. Some suggest that if children really want to play football, their parents might skip early leagues, which can start as early as age 5, and instead wait until children turn 14 or 18 to let them play tackle football. The American Youth Soccer Organization doesn’t recommend heading the ball before the age of 10, and coaches are not encouraged to teach or practice heading at early ages.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/trump-global-tariffs-senate-rebuke","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:16:00-04:00","title":"Senate Republicans Rebuke Trump for a Third Time This Week, Voting with Democrats Against President’s Global Tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant bipartisan move, four Senate Republicans — Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, and Mitch McConnell — joined Democrats in voting against President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, marking the third such vote in a single week.

rollout of a new annual asylum application fee, citing confusion and inconsistent policies between federal agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Stephanie Gallagher said two agencies, the US Citizenship and

created under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n \n\n   \n  Gallagher found that the lack of coordination between the two agencies had caused “significant confusion” and even led to some asylum seekers being ordered removed before any mechanism to pay the fee existed. She temporarily stayed both agencies’ policies, blocking enforcement of the annual fee nationwide, until they issue clear, uniform guidance.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants have not resolved the inconsistency between the two agencies’ policies,” Gallagher wrote, adding that the government’s conflicting rules created “irreparable harm” for asylum applicants.\n \n\n   \n  The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP) filed a lawsuit in federal court in Maryland accusing the government of unlawfully applying a new annual asylum fee to people who filed their cases before the law took effect.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed on July 4, asylum applicants are required to pay the $100 fee each year their case remains pending.\n \n\n   \n  Previous to the legislation, there was no fee required when applying for asylum.\n \n\n   \n  The US Citizenship and Immigration Services began sending notices of the new fee on October 1, giving applicants a 30-day window to pay the fee —meaning the fee will start being due as early as October 31.\n \n\n   \n  ASAP says the rollout has caused panic and confusion among asylum seekers. One member, a man from Russia who applied in 2022, told the group he’s been “very worried” because he hasn’t received any instructions from the government on how or when to pay, according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, some applicants do not have the financial means to pay the fee, plaintiffs say.\n \n\n   \n  “They would have to choose between feeding their families or paying the fee,” Susan Pelletier, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said during Tuesday’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit includes stories of people who say they’ve been impacted by the fees. A woman from Honduras says she fears she’ll face deportation over a fee she can’t afford and has no way to pay.\n \n\n   \n  Another asylum seeker from Nigeria says he only learned about the new rule from social media and worries missing a payment could jeopardize his case.\n \n\n   \n  In response to ASAP’s lawsuit, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, has established a payment portal that allows asylum seekers to pay the annual asylum fee.\n \n\n   \n  EOIR has also stated that it will provide notice to individuals who are subject to the new annual fee and credit any payments made through other existing systems.\n \n\n   \n  ASAP argues that USCIS and EOIR are retroactively applying the new annual asylum fee and providing contradictory information — and even set conflicting deadlines. In at least one case, the lawsuit says an immigration judge rejected an asylum application and ordered a removal for nonpayment, despite there being no mechanism to pay the fee at the time.\n \n\n   \n  During a hearing on Tuesday, Gallagher, an Obama appointee, pressed Department of Justice attorney Zareen Iqbal on whether the asylum application fee was being applied retroactively. Gallagher also noted that many applicants have already been waiting years for a decision on their cases.\n \n\n   \n  Iqbal responded that the policy was not being applied retroactively, explaining that it was intended to help address the high volume of asylum cases that have been pending for years. She compared the fee to a property tax — a recurring payment meant to sustain the system rather than penalize past applicants.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department acknowledged that some applicants have faced difficulties following the announcement of the new fee. Iqbal told the court she would reach out to the plaintiffs and USCIS to help resolve the issue.\n \n\n   \n  The judge on Thursday said she would quickly entertain a motion to lift the stay on the fee once agencies enacted “uniform policies providing asylum applicants with fair notice of the applicable fee deadline, the mechanism for payment, and the adverse consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/economy/xi-trump-trade-deal-economy","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-10:30","title":"A Trump-Xi trade deal won’t fix either country’s economy","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes a recently announced trade agreement between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which includes a 10% reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports and China’s promise to delay rare earth export controls and increase soybean purchases.

China is in a far more precarious state, mostly due to preexisting problems, but  the new trade agreement  is unlikely to move the dial much for either of the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  On the surface, the headlines coming out of the historic meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggest a big victory for both sides. The agreement calls for the United States to lower tariffs on China by 10%, bringing the effective rate on Chinese exports down to 47%; and for China to delay export controls on rare earths and increase purchases of American soybeans.\n \n\n   \n  Such measures might alleviate some of the pain businesses and consumers have felt since Trump returned to office. However, it’s going to take a lot more to address the wounds that have been festering.\n \n\n   \n    Too little, too late?\n \n\n   \n  For one particular part of the American economy that’s been hurting the most from the resurgent trade war with China, the agreement may be coming too late.\n \n\n   \n  American soybean farmers  have been reeling  from China’s effective embargo on the commodity that began in May, when higher tariffs went into place. Up until this week, China hadn’t purchased any American soybeans, the top agricultural export for the US. China has historically been the largest export market for American soybeans, so the embargo has significantly depressed American soybean prices for the past few months.\n \n\n   \n  And even though Trump said China will buy “tremendous amounts” of soybeans, with  peak harvest season already in full swing , many US farmers may have already sold crop yields at lower prices.\n \n\n   \n    No quick fix in sight for the US job market\n \n\n   \n  Trump inherited a labor market that was already weakening, and the latest data shows that hiring  slowed to a crawl in recent months .\n \n\n   \n  His aggressive and unpredictable tariffs have only exacerbated that, as businesses have become hesitant to hire more workers due to uncertainty. Increasingly, US companies are now laying off workers, too. For the first time in years, there are more people unemployed than jobs available, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  Advances in artificial intelligence are also playing in to some layoffs, as highlighted by  Amazon’s massive job cuts  this week. And while rate cuts have traditionally been the Federal Reserve’s primary tool to support the labor market, central bankers say AI may already have caused systemic damage that can’t be fixed through monetary policy.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Christopher Waller noted in recent remarks that even over a longer horizon, “if AI constitutes a structural shift in the demand for labor, monetary policy will not be an effective tool.”\n \n\n   \n  Moreover, there are growing concerns that lower rates could do more harm than good, pushing up inflation at a time when goods and services are already  more expensive . Some of that inflation is attributable to higher tariffs, and some is from tighter immigration controls that have cut back on the supply of workers in areas like child care and farming.\n \n\n   \n    China’s cocktail of economic woes\n \n\n   \n  For China, while its exports have shown remarkable resilience this year in the face of Trump’s global tariff offensive, its longstanding domestic economic woes have persisted to the point where there are even fewer immediate benefits of a trade deal compared to the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Chief among the factors clouding China’s economic outlook are a prolonged property downturn, persisting deflation, dampened consumer confidence and high youth unemployment.\n \n\n   \n  “Beyond a cyclical impulse, it’s hard to see today’s revised trade terms as materially shifting China’s more structural challenges at home, where we think tariffs are, if anything, fading in macro relevance,” Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at research firm Oxford Economics, said in a note on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the fentanyl-related tariff reduction as part of the Thursday deal could at best add a “marginal” 0.2% upside to China’s growth forecast next year.\n \n\n   \n  Recent economic data from China continues to paint a gloomy picture. In September, the decline in China’s factory-gate prices, a gauge of deflation, extended into the 36th straight month, though the drop has narrowed following Beijing’s attempt in recent months to rein in price competition in certain sectors. China’s much-touted electric vehicle industry, for example, has been embroiled in a relentless race to the bottom, partly due to excess capacity.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also not helping that consumer demand is on the decline, as evidenced by the pace of retail sales slowing to a 10-month low at 3% in September compared with a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the mix of challenges, China’s new home prices sank in September at their fastest pace in 11 months, despite traditionally being a peak season for property spending. The protracted slump, which  began with developers’ debt defaults in 2021 , is expected to continue weighing on consumer sentiment.\n \n\n   \n    Not a done deal\n \n\n   \n  The agreement Trump and Xi reached Thursday can merely be thought of as a rough draft — nothing has been signed. It’ll likely take several more meetings between American and Chinese counterparts to nail down a firmer agreement that eventually becomes a signed deal. Or it may not even get to that point at all.\n \n\n   \n  For now, though, both economies can take some solace in the fact that Trump’s threat of an additional 100% tariff on Chinese exports, which Beijing almost certainly would have retaliated against, is off the table.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/science/dueling-dinosaurs-fossil-nanotyrannus-tyrannosaurus-rex","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"14:03:00Z","title":"Dueling dinosaurs' fossil forces a radical rethink of T. rex remains","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A groundbreaking study has reevaluated the famous 'dueling dinosaurs' fossil housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, originally interpreted as a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex locked in combat with a Triceratops.

fossil forces a radical rethink of T. rex remains \n       \n  By Katie Hunt, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:03 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A legendary fossil housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh features skeletons apparently locked in prehistoric combat — an epic meeting of two of the world’s favorite dinosaurs: Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex. Or so paleontologists thought.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers who spent the past five years studying the stunning collection of bones called the “dueling dinosaurs” say they have uncovered a case of mistaken identity, determining that the small-bodied dinosaur was not a juvenile T. Rex but rather a fully grown example of a hotly debated species known as Nanotyrannus lancensis.\n \n\n   \n  “We have the growth record preserved in the microstructure of the bone, which shows that it’s an adult,” said James Napoli, a vertebrate paleontologist at Stony Brook University and coauthor of the new study published Thursday  in the journal Nature.  The discovery has triggered a rethink of many other fossils previously identified as teenage T. rex remains, Napoli added.\n \n\n   \n  While similar in appearance, the two dinosaur species would have been very different: Nanotyrannus was 18 feet long, agile and built for speed, with long legs and strong arms to grasp prey, while 42-foot-long T. rex had stocky legs and used its devastating bite to devour huge, slow-moving dinos.\n \n\n   \n  Despite its relatively diminutive size, Napoli said that Nanotyrannus had larger upper limbs than a fully grown T. rex, which had famously tiny arms. “Bones don’t shrink when animals grow so this could not have possibly become an (adult) T. rex,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The finding “flips decades of T. rex research on its head,” according to study coauthor Lindsay Zanno, associate research professor at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.\n \n\n   \n  “A wealth of studies on the biology of T. rex over the past three decades have unknowingly mixed data from Nanotyrannus with that of T. rex. Those studies need to be reevaluated in light of this discovery,” Zanno said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The dueling dinosaurs  fossil was first discovered 2006 , exposed as sedimentary rock eroded from the Hell Creek Formation, which dates back 65.5 million years and stretches across parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.\n \n\n   \n    Mistaken identity\n \n\n   \n  Nanotyrannus lancensis, which like T. rex is part of the larger tyrannosaurid family in taxonomic classification, was first identified from a fossil unearthed in the 1940s from the same rock formation as the dueling dinosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  However, scientists later shifted the narrative and interpreted that initial find and many other small Tyrannosaur fossils uncovered in the following decades to be juvenile T. rex specimens. The idea that another species might have produced the fossils fell out of favor, though the possibility was still debated at scientific conferences and other forums.\n \n\n   \n  The new research, which examined and compared over 200 Tyrannosaur fossils, suggests that juvenile T. rex fossils were not as common in the fossil record as paleontologists previously thought. For years, the study authors reported, paleontologists have misidentified Nanotyrannus fossils as juvenile T. rex specimens and used the morphological features of the remains to  model T. rex growth and behavior .\n \n\n   \n  “What’s exciting is that this discovery opens the door to a whole series of new questions about how these different predators — one built for brute strength and one built for speed — interacted in the twilight of the dinosaurs,” Zanno said.\n \n\n   \n  The study authors said they also had identified a fossil called “Jane” as a  second species of Nanotyrannus , which they dubbed Nanotyrannus lethaeus. The name is a reference to the River Lethe, the river of forgetfulness in Greek mythology, a nod to how this dinosaur remained hidden in plain sight and “forgotten” for decades.\n \n\n   \n    Uncomfortable questions\n \n\n   \n  The finding raises “uncomfortable” questions about why a scientific consensus came together so quickly around the idea that all Nanotyrannus specimens are juvenile T. rexes, said Larry Witmer, Chang Ying-Chien Professor of Paleontology at Ohio University. Witmer didn’t take part in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Many T. rex fossils, which can sell for  tens of millions of dollars at auction , were commercially collected and are in private hands, making them difficult to study, he noted in a commentary published alongside the research.\n \n\n   \n  “This exceptionally researched study by Zanno and Napoli puts Nanotyrannus on a solid foundation,” Witmer said.\n \n\n   \n  He added that the implications of the findings go beyond settling a scientific disagreement.\n \n\n   \n  “There is much more at stake here than declaring a victor in the debate, because there are literally decades of research and probably hundreds of publications based on a premise that this article overturns,” he said. “These analyses will all need revision.”\n \n\n   \n  Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology at the University of Edinburgh said the finding should prompt “a fundamental reassessment of tyrannosaur classification and evolution.”\n \n\n   \n  “For many years in my research on tyrannosaurs, I’ve considered a set of smaller skeletons found in the same rocks as the famous skeletons of huge T. rexes to be juveniles of T. rex rather than a distinctive smaller species,” Brusatte, who wasn’t involved with the new study, explained.\n \n\n   \n  “Reading this new paper, I think new evidence from this exquisite new specimen in the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences shows that I was wrong — at least in part,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  However, not every smaller tyrannosaur skeleton should be classified as Nanotyrannus, according to Brusatte. “T. rex was the size of a bus as an adult, and bones of adult T. rexes are very common across western North America, from Saskatchewan down to New Mexico,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some of these must be juvenile T. rexes, and I think it is ultimately going to be very hard to tell apart adult or near-adult Nanotyrannus from teenage T. rex, as they were probably both very similar in size, and in their skeletal features,” he noted. “That will be the challenge for future paleontologists.”\n \n\n   \n  The evidence presented in the study that the smaller animal in the dueling dinosaurs fossil is in fact Nanotyrannus is “pretty conclusive,” according to Thomas Carr, a senior scientific advisor at the Dinosaur Discovery Museum and an associate professor of biology at Carthage College. However, fresh fossils are needed to understand the differences between Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named species of Nanotyrannus lethaeus, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Carr also said he isn’t sure about whether the fossil “Jane” should be reclassified as Nanotyrannus lethaeus, as the new research suggests. “They’ve done strong work, but we must be cautious,” said Carr, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  Napoli said dueling dinosaurs, which is still partially encased in rock, has many more secrets to spill. Scientists still don’t know how the two animals died — or why they were found entangled. But the Nanotyrannus specimen is 100% complete, which is extraordinarily rare in the fossil record, Napoli noted.\n \n\n   \n  “There are some bones that are partially broken with a piece missing, but every individual bone is represented to some degree,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers hope skin or feathers might also be preserved in the sediment surrounding the remains and that there are injuries on the specimen, such as a broken finger, they haven’t yet explored.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a tremendous amount of science to do on the dueling dinosaurs,” Napoli said. “It’s an amazing fossil to work on.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/palestinian-american-teenager-remains-in-israeli-jail-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"11:36:00-04:00","title":"Palestinian American Teenager to Remain in Israeli Jail Despite Growing Pressure in Congress for His Release","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American from Palm Bay, Florida, has been detained in Israeli prisons without trial for over eight months following accusations of throwing rocks at Israeli settlers in the West Bank.

Five things to know about Week 9 in the NFL \n       \n  By Andy Scholes, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:55 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hard to believe we’ve already reached the halfway mark of the  NFL season . Week 9 brings the return of Lamar Jackson, another Mahomes–Allen duel, and hopefully a few games that actually keep us on the edge of our seats. Here are five things to know about Week 9:\n \n\n   \n    Lamar’s finally back\n \n\n   \n  Let’s try this again. Baltimore Ravens quarterback  Lamar Jackson  is set to start Thursday night in Miami against the Dolphins.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson practiced last week, and many expected him to suit up against the Chicago Bears, but the team opted to give his hamstring one more week to heal. Jackson now says he’s “100 percent healthy,” and the Ravens are banking on that being true.\n \n\n   \n  At 2-5, Baltimore is in dangerous territory – only two teams in NFL history have reached the postseason after starting 2-6. After their slow start, Jackson and the Ravens have almost no margin for error the rest of the way.\n \n\n   \n     Chiefs-Bills showdown \n \n\n   \n  No matchup in football has delivered more drama over the past five seasons than the  Kansas City Chiefs  vs. the Buffalo Bills. Sunday’s clash will mark the 10th meeting in six years between Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. It’s become must-see TV anytime these two square off and is undoubtably the league’s best quarterback rivalry.\n \n\n   \n  Allen owns a 4-1 record against Mahomes in the regular season, but Mahomes is undefeated where it counts – he’s 4-0 in the postseason. After a sluggish start, Kansas City’s offense is back in sync, averaging 30.8 points over its last five games, fourth best in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  Buffalo’s defense dominated in last week’s 40-9 rout of the Carolina Panthers but suffered another setback,  losing Ed Oliver  to a torn bicep. Will we get another epic shootout? This latest installment of Mahomes vs. Allen headlines Sunday’s CBS slate, kicking off at 4:25 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n     Can we get a close game, please? \n \n\n   \n  Here’s hoping Chiefs-Bills gives us a thriller because  Week 8 was a snooze fest .\n \n\n   \n  It was the first NFL Sunday since 1970 with one or fewer games decided by single digits (with a minimum eight games). The lone nail-biter came in the New York Jets’ 39-38 comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n \n\n   \n  Week 9 features more big spreads, but in the NFL, these things tend to even out. Here’s to some games that actually go down to the wire.\n \n\n   \n     Don’t expect points in Houston \n \n\n   \n  If you like fireworks and 40-point shootouts, you might want to skip the Denver Broncos going to Houston to play the Texans.\n \n\n   \n  Both defenses are elite. Houston leads the NFL in yards allowed (266.9) and points allowed (14.7) per game. Denver, meanwhile, tops the league in sacks with 36. The over/under is set at just 39.5 – one of the lowest totals all season.\n \n\n   \n  The Texans, sitting at 3-4, can’t afford many more losses if they hope to chase down the 7-1 Colts in the AFC South.\n \n\n   \n     Kyler owns Arlington \n \n\n   \n  Arizona Cardinals QB Kyler Murray is officially questionable for Monday night’s showdown with the Dallas Cowboys because of a foot sprain, but don’t expect him to sit this one out – AT&T Stadium is basically his personal playground.\n \n\n   \n  Murray has never lost there – 5-0 in high school at Allen High (with three state titles), 1-0 at Oklahoma (Big 12 Championship) and 2-0 as a pro against Dallas.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes are high again. At 2-5, the Cardinals are clinging to postseason hopes. Fall to 2-6, and those hopes all but disappear.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/david-drake-mfa-boston-tan","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-04:00","title":"MFA Boston Returns Works by Enslaved Artist David Drake to His Heirs","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) Boston has taken a historic step by returning two works by 19th-century enslaved potter David Drake to his descendants, marking the first time a U.S. museum has formally addressed ownership claims for art created under slavery.

 \n  By Jori Finkel\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:01 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a very rare and likely precedent-setting agreement, the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) Boston has agreed to return two works from 1857 by the Black potter David Drake, who made his ambitious jars while enslaved, to his present-day descendants.\n \n\n   \n  By the terms of the contract, one of those vessels will remain on loan to the museum for at least two years, according to the lawyer George Fatheree, who is representing Drake’s descendants. The other vessel — a masterpiece known as the “Poem Jar” — has been purchased back by the museum from the heirs for an undisclosed sum. Now the work comes with “a certificate of ethical ownership.”\n \n\n   \n  “In achieving this resolution, the MFA recognizes that Drake was deprived of his creations involuntarily and without compensation,” a museum spokesperson said in a statement. “This marks the first time that the museum has resolved an ownership claim for works of art that were wrongfully taken under the conditions of slavery in the 19th-century US.”\n \n\n   \n  Fatheree goes further, saying he believes their agreement “is groundbreaking in the art world.”\n \n\n   \n  “The application of principles of ethical restitution to artwork created by enslaved Americans, this is the first time that has ever occurred to my knowledge,” he said in a video call.\n \n\n   \n  Ethan Lasser, chair of the art of Americas at the MFA, said the museum has learned from its work restituting Nazi-looted art. “We’ve become very expert in Holocaust restitution. We’re dealing with (repatriation) issues in our African collections and Native American collections,” he said over the phone. “And we want to bring the same standard to the fullness of our collection.”\n \n\n   \n  He considers Drake’s work an example of “stolen property,” too, “since the artist is always the first owner of his work and he never got to make the call about where it went or what he was paid for it.”\n \n\n   \n  Born enslaved around 1800 in Edgefield, South Carolina, a region known for its rich clay, Drake (who was also known as Dave the Potter) was one of relatively few African American potters to sign his work. He also dared — despite punitive anti-literacy laws for enslaved people in the state — to etch short sayings or poems on the jars, making them powerful acts of resistance. Some inscriptions boast of the jar’s intended contents or enormous capacity; others remark more poignantly on his own life or working conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The “Poem Jar,” which the MFA originally bought in 1997 from a dealer in South Carolina, features a couplet that hints at Drake’s financial exploitation. The inscription reads: “I made this Jar = for cash/Though its called Lucre trash.” Currently in a gallery for self-taught and outsider art at the museum, it will assume a more prominent spot at the entrance of the Art of Americas wing once renovated in June 2026. (The jar that Drake’s family now owns has a signature and date but no writing.)\n \n\n   \n  Another jar made the same year, 1857, has a particularly wrenching inscription in light of Drake’s forced separation from a woman believed to be his wife and her two sons. That vessel, at the Greenville County Museum of Art in South Carolina, reads: “I wonder where is all my relation.”\n \n\n   \n  One of Drake’s great-great-great-great grandsons, the children’s book author and producer Yaba Baker, said he feels the restitution process offers one answer to that question. “It’s been exciting, overwhelming and feels full circle,” he said in a video call. He praised the MFA for “showing integrity and leadership” in “allowing us to connect to Dave’s legacy,” noting that “to go from being slaves to having a family of engineers and doctors and people in executive positions is a testament to Dave’s legacy in a different way.”\n \n\n   \n  These descendants began talking about getting involved in Drake’s legacy in 2022, upon the opening of “Hear Me Now: The Black Potters of Old Edgefield, South Carolina,” an exhibition jointly organized by the MFA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The family soon hired Fatheree, fresh from his win in the  Bruce’s Beach  land reparation case. Earlier this year they established the David Drake Legacy Trust, governed by five of the oldest heirs.\n \n\n   \n  So far there are about 15 family members involved, according to Fatheree, but they have created a website so that other descendants of Drake can be identified and join the efforts — what Fatheree calls “a big tent approach.”\n \n\n   \n  The initiative’s repercussions could be widespread. There are thought to be around 250  pots by Drake still in existence, and over the past five years the market for his work has exploded, driven mainly by American museums competing for pieces in the hopes of telling a more complex story about the history of slavery in the US. Several have paid six figures for his work, and in 2021 the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas paid a record-setting $1.56 million for a 25-gallon stoneware jar at auction.\n \n\n   \n  Other museums that own Drake’s work include the Met, the Philadelphia Art Museum, the De Young Museum in San Francisco, the Art Institute of Chicago, Harvard Art Museums, the St Louis Art Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, as well as smaller venues in the American South.\n \n\n   \n  Fatheree confirmed he has begun to reach out to some of these other art institutions on behalf of the family. “Our approach has been one of collaboration and invitation. I am not a litigator; we did not go to the museum and file a lawsuit (or) threaten to sue them. But our hope and frankly our expectation is that other institutions” — and private collectors of Drake’s work, he added — “will follow the Boston museum’s lead here.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not just an opportunity for museums to be on the right side of history,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for museums to rewrite history and think not just about ownership and stewardship, but think about stewardship and justice.”\n \n\n   \n   Read more stories from The Art Newspaper  here .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-diary-ceo-interview","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:17:00-04:00","title":"Kamala Harris Opens Up About ‘Complicated’ Relationship with Biden, Including When He ‘Greatly Disappointed’ Her","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris, during a podcast interview promoting her book '107 Days,' revealed a strained and 'complicated' relationship with former President Joe Biden, citing a phone call moments before her 2024 debate with Donald Trump.

The timing—just three weeks before the 30th anniversary of the Dayton Agreement—adds to the controversy, as it undermines regional peace efforts and raises concerns about the erosion of accountability

sanctions on Putin-backed Bosnian Serb strongman after Trump allies’ lobbying \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:04 PM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on a kleptocratic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was removed this month as president of the Serb territory within Bosnia and Herzegovina for chipping away at the US-brokered peace deal that ended bloody ethnic violence in the Balkans in the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  The waiving of sanctions on  Milorad Dodik  followed a months-long lobbying effort by allies of Donald Trump, which painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik had been sanctioned by the US for flouting the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was painstakingly thrashed out in Ohio in 1995 to end the Bosnian War. While the agreement stopped the bloodshed, it carved Bosnia into two entities: the Federation, where Bosnian Muslims share power with Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska.\n \n\n   \n  Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia’s integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.”\n \n\n   \n  Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump’s Washington.\n \n\n   \n  “What sort of message does this send – that if you have the right connections and the right lobbyists, you can be removed from the sanctions list? It’s setting a negative precedent,” Andi Hoxhaj, a Balkan expert at King’s College London, told CNN. Coming three weeks before Dayton’s 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration’s decision was especially dispiriting.\n \n\n   \n  The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska’s National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska’s installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik hailed Trump and his allies for waiving the sanctions against him, saying the decision corrected “a grave injustice” inflicted upon Srpska “by the Obama and Biden administrations.” What Dodik failed to mention, however, is that he was also sanctioned by the Trump administration in  July 2017  for obstructing the Dayton agreement. The Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on him in 2022 and again in early 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Dodik began to court Trump before the 2024 election, when the president was facing dozens of criminal charges. “America needs you, but the rest of the world as well!” Dodik wrote to Trump in September that year, following the second assassination attempt against him.\n \n\n   \n  Since Trump’s return to the White House, Dodik’s overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months.\n \n\n   \n  In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska.  Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich’s firm, signed a  contract  with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. The value of that contract was redacted.\n \n\n   \n  Marc Zell, another lobbyist, also signed a  contract  with the Srpska government in December 2024 worth $1 million for one year’s work, plus a bonus if Zell’s firm successfully brought about the removal of sanctions on Dodik and his allies, according to documents also filed with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agents Registration Act website. In an email, Zell told CNN that the bonus fee provision was canceled in accordance with US law.\n \n\n   \n  This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik’s cause. Laura Loomer, the far-right influencer with a direct line to the president,  said  Dodik’s removal as president of Srpska was “the latest example of the brazen assault against Trump-like leaders across the world.” She claimed Dodik – a “Christian” leader – was “enduring ruthless political attacks from a coalition of Muslims and globalists.”\n \n\n   \n  Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser,  called  for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.”\n \n\n   \n  Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump’s one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump’s famous MAGA hats.\n \n\n   \n  Hoxhaj, the Balkan expert, said Dodik will use the sanctions relief to claim “to his people and to the public that he has been vindicated by the US, and that what was done to him was unjust.”\n \n\n   \n  US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denounced the lifting of sanctions as “reckless and premature.”\n \n\n   \n  “Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said. “The American people deserve answers.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/europe/dutch-election-poll-d66-party-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:08:00-04:00","title":"Dutch Centrist Jetten Confident of Forming Government After Far Right’s Election Setback","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 Dutch parliamentary election, centrist leader Rob Jetten of the D66 party emerged with 26 seats, tying with Geert Wilders’ far-right PVV, which lost over a quarter of its seats due to poor performance and rising competition.

leader Rob Jetten said he was “very confident” of being able to put together a government after his party’s strong showing in parliamentary elections that saw  Geert Wilders’  anti-Islam Freedom Party lose ground.\n \n\n   \n  With most of the votes counted from Wednesday’s election, which was seen as a test of the far right’s strength in Europe, Jetten’s D66 and Wilders’ PVV were tied on Thursday, with both projected to take 26 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament.\n \n\n   \n  That was a sharp drop for Wilders’ party, which lost over a quarter of its seats in two years, stemming from a poor performance in its first attempt at government and growing competition on the right. D66 tripled its score.\n \n\n   \n   Major mainstream parties  have ruled out governing with Wilders this time after he brought down the last coalition, which was led by his own party. This leaves him no viable path to a majority, unlike D66’s young leader Jetten - who will still need to clinch the support of several other parties.\n \n\n   \n  At 38, Jetten would be the Netherlands’ youngest, and first gay, prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  The election delivered a “very strong message form Dutch voters that they want positive political powers in the center to work together and deliver for all the people in the Netherlands,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  With polished messaging and a surge in advertising spending, Jetten moved beyond his D66 party’s traditional themes of climate change and education, plunging into the divisive topics of immigration and a housing crisis. In the process he won over some voters who had previously looked to right-wing parties.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very excited that we’re going to have the first homosexual prime minister in the Netherlands and also one that is combining all the positive forces,” Lotte van Slooten, a 25-year-old voter, said at a D66 election rally overnight.\n \n\n   \n  Talks to form a government, which usually take months in the Netherlands, will be particularly complex in a very fragmented parliament. “It will be very difficult,” said Kajsa Ollongren, a D66 party member who served as defense minister in government with Jetten.\n \n\n   \n  With D66 and PVV tied for first spot, it was still unclear who would get the first chance to form a government.\n \n\n   \n  Party leaders will likely convene on Friday to decide on the next steps, and could either appoint a “scout” to start holding coalition talks or decide to wait for final results, which are likely to come in a few days.\n \n\n   \n  The Dutch election was seen as a test of whether the far right can expand its reach or whether it has peaked in parts of Europe.\n \n\n   \n  The outcome suggests there are some limits to its appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve shown not only to the Netherlands, but also to the world that it is possible to beat populist and extreme-right movements,” Jetten told the crowd at his party’s election-night celebration.\n \n\n   \n  But with PVV tied for the top spot, it also showed the far right is an enduring part of an increasingly fragmented European political landscape at a time when many other parties have toughened their stance on immigration.\n \n\n   \n  Wilders said he would take the lead in forming a government if the PVV ultimately came out with more votes.\n \n\n   \n  “As long as it’s not 100% clear, D66 can’t take the lead. We will do everything we can to prevent that,” he said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Counting of ballots was still under way, but with 98.8% of votes accounted for it was not expected to change the fact that the two biggest parties are tied for the top spot.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/white-house-ballroom-east-wing-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:03:00-04:00","title":"The White House ballroom saga could be worse for Trump than he realizes","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's decision to demolish the East Wing of the White House and replace it with a $300 million, privately funded 90,000-square-foot ballroom has sparked widespread public disapproval.

And both show similar things.\n \n\n   \n  The former shows Americans disapproved of Trump’s demolition of the East Wing (57%-26%), his plans for replacing it with a 90,000-square foot ballroom (61%-25%) and his broader handling of the situation (55%-28%) all by around a 2-to-1 margin.\n \n\n   \n  The latter shows Americans also oppose the broader project by a 2-to-1 margin, 56%-28%.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump’s supporters aren’t defending him too hard.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, just 55% of Republicans in the Yahoo poll approved of both demolishing the East Wing and building a ballroom. That’s compared to 94% of Democrats who disapproved of both. Around one-quarter of Republicans disapproved on both counts.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, the passion on this issue seems to be very much on the “anti” side.\n \n\n   \n  In both polls, the percentage strongly opposed to the project far outpaced the percentage strongly in favor – 46%-18% in the Yahoo poll and 45%-15% in the Post-ABC poll. In both surveys, about half of independents strongly opposed it.\n \n\n   \n  So this  does  appear to have animated people of many stripes, to a significant extent.\n \n\n   \n  None of that means this is a game-changer of a political issue which will suddenly send Trump’s overall approval numbers plummeting to new depths. But it does reinforce that he just keeps doing things rather haphazardly that give lots of people reason to dislike what they’re seeing – even, it seems, some people who generally approve of him.\n \n\n   \n  An important question from there is why people disapprove.\n \n\n   \n  Is it just because they don’t really like change? Were the images of the demolished East Wing just that jarring? Or maybe people objected to the lack of transparency and the fact that Trump downplayed the extent of the construction. (Trump said less than three months ago that the ballroom project “ won’t interfere with the current building ,” even though the White House had released images showing the gigantic ballroom completely replacing the East Wing.)\n \n\n   \n  All of those are valid hypotheses. But the numbers might actually point in another direction.\n \n\n   \n  While people disapproved by about a 2-to-1 margin no matter how you asked the question, they were actually slightly more likely in the Yahoo poll to object to the ballroom plans (61%) than they were to the demolition of the East Wing (57%).\n \n\n   \n  That’s a little counter intuitive.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing demolition was the jarring part. You could see a situation in which people might think the ballroom is okay and even necessary, but don’t like how the East Wing was summarily torn down. But in fact, Americans disliked the ballroom slightly more than the East Wing teardown.\n \n\n   \n  What that might suggest: People don’t really like the idea of building an elaborate new $300 million ballroom – privately funded, Trump says – on the White House grounds during a time of significant economic hardship and inflation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has shown remarkably little concern about these kinds of optics issues. He’s  gilded the interior of the White House . He and his family have taken little care to insulate themselves from allegations that they’ve ignored conflicts of interest and enriched themselves using the presidency, most notably with their crypto ventures. Even as the country is dealing with the impacts of a government shutdown, Trump is overseas accepting gifts  like a golden crown from South Korea .\n \n\n   \n  There are signs that maybe people are starting to pay attention to this. A  Pew Research Center poll  conducted a month ago showed 61% of Americans and even 31% of Republican-leaning people said they believe Trump has at least “probably” improperly used his office to enrich himself, his friends and his family.\n \n\n   \n  A  CBS News-YouGov poll  around the same time showed 75% of Americans said Trump wasn’t focused enough on the issue of “lowering prices of goods and services.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, it doesn’t seem to have been a great time to bulldoze part of the White House in the name of building an expensive place to hold parties. And Trump did a great job of making sure people noticed that’s exactly what he was doing.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/nuclear-weapons-testing-trump-china-russia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"10:35:00-04:00","title":"Trump instructs Pentagon to start testing nuclear weapons ‘on an equal basis’ with Russia and China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced that the United States would begin testing nuclear weapons on an equal basis with Russia and China, marking a dramatic reversal of the 1992 U.S. nuclear testing moratorium.

Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:35 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to begin testing US nuclear weapons “on an equal basis” with Russia and China, heralding a potentially major shift in decades of US policy at a time of growing tensions between the world’s nuclear-armed superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made the announcement moments before his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, for what had been billed as make-or-break talks intended to restore stability after almost a year of trade and economic turmoil.\n \n\n   \n  In a  post  on social media Trump said, “The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China as “a distant third” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House and Department of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to a nuclear weapons test, or  a test of a nuclear-capable weapons system . Not since the 1990s has one of the world’s three major military powers conducted a nuclear weapons test, with China having conducted its last known test in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  The US last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, when it began a voluntary moratorium on such explosive testing. It’s also not clear how quickly it could do so again, with an August report from the Congressional Research Service saying it would take 24 to 36 months for the US to test a nuclear weapon after the president gives the order.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s apparent policy pivot comes at a fractious time in global geopolitics, when a growing great power rivalry between the US and China has deep echoes of the Cold War era. Meanwhile, Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine raises the risk of a broader confrontation between Moscow and the West.\n \n\n   \n  Washington has been watching closely as both China and Russia continue to develop and test advanced weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said that the country had tested a new nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile and a nuclear-powered torpedo, known as the Poseidon, which the Russian leader boasted was without rival, according to Russian state media.\n \n\n   \n  Russia, with some 6,000 warheads, and the United States with nearly that many, account for 90% of the world’s arsenal,  according to  the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia would “act accordingly” if any country withdraws from the moratorium on nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  “There is indeed an ongoing (nuclear testing) moratorium,” Peskov told reporters Thursday, adding that he was unaware of any nuclear tests being conducted by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump mentioned that other countries were allegedly testing nuclear weapons. Up until now, we have not known that anyone was testing. And if the reference was to the (nuclear-powered) Burevestnik (cruise missile) test, that is by no means a nuclear test,” Peskov said.\n \n\n   \n  “All countries are developing their defense systems,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  China is also believed to be rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade, according to a Pentagon report.\n \n\n   \n  China has constructed at least three complexes for launching ballistic missiles in recent years,  according to the Federation of American Scientists , and it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  At  a military parade  in Beijing in September, China showed off its nuclear triad – systems that can launch nuclear-capable missiles by land, sea and air – for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  When asked by a reporter later Thursday why he decided to announce the US nuclear testing plans right before his meeting with Xi, Trump said “it had to do with others.”\n \n\n   \n  “They seem to all be nuclear testing,” Trump said, speaking from Air Force One. “We halted (testing) many years ago, but with others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also.”\n \n\n   \n  The US too has recently tested nuclear-capable weaponry, with the US Navy in September conducting four tests of its submarine-launched Trident missiles.\n \n\n   \n    A new arms race?\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s comments come as he concludes a trip that began with the US president touting his peace-making abilities in Malaysia, where he joined a signing ceremony for a peace accord on Thailand and Cambodia’s border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The US president has billed himself as a “peacemaker” and contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, while leaning into a “peace through strength” for the US military.\n \n\n   \n  But the latest remarks, if operationalized, have the potential to significantly change the status quo of nuclear testing should American rivals move to mirror the US.\n \n\n   \n  “If by testing he means nuclear explosive testing, that would be reckless, probably not possible for 18 months, would cost money that Congress would have to approve,” Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Kristensen warned it would “most certainly” encourages countries like Russia, China, India and Pakistan to resume their own tests. “Unlike the United States, all these countries would have much to gain by restarting nuclear testing,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  When asked Thursday whether the world was entering a “more risky environment” on nuclear issues, Trump maintained his goal was de-escalation.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to see a denuclearization,” he said, pointing to the arsenals of the US, Russia and China. “We’re actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said China hoped the US would also uphold “its commitment to suspend nuclear testing, and take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and maintain global strategic harmony and stability.”\n \n\n   \n  The timing of Trump’s announcement is also significant for its potential implications on regional security in Asia, a region with numerous nuclear powers, including rival nations India and Pakistan, as well as North Korea, which analysts have warned in recent years could be preparing for a new nuclear test.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea is responsible for the world’s most recent nuclear test in 2017– and all tests that have taken place in the 21st century. Only three countries – India, Pakistan and North Korea have tested nuclear weapons since a 1996 test ban treaty, according to the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  After testing cruise missiles earlier this week, Pyongyang said that it is taking steps to toughen its “nuclear combat posture” – a line not out of step with numerous bellicose statements from the country that has resisted calls to give up its nuclear arsenal.\n \n\n   \n  There have been signs that a new era of nuclear testing may be in the offing.  CNN reported in 2023  that the US, Russia and China had all built new facilities and dug new tunnels at their nuclear test sites in recent years, according to satellite imagery.\n \n\n   \n  “There are really a lot of hints that we’re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN at the time.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/entertainment/rap-falls-out-top-40","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:19:00-04:00","title":"Are We Living Through a Rap Drought?

The Billboard charts suggest we are \n       \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:19 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It feels like the Billboard charts could use a good rap beef right about now.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because, according to the publication, for the first time since 1990, there is no hip hop in the Top 40 of the Billboard 100 chart.\n \n\n   \n  “With Kendrick Lamar and SZA’s 13-week Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 ‘Luther’ falling off the Hot 100 dated Oct. 25, 2025, there were officially no rap songs in the chart’s top 40 last week,”  Billboard reported. \n \n\n   \n  The last time that happened was the week of February 2, 1990, “when the top-ranking rap song was Biz Markie’s eventual top 10 hit ‘Just a Friend,’ which had just climbed to No. 41 on the chart.”\n \n\n   \n  The following week, that song shot to the number 29 slot, “starting a Hot 100 streak of rap songs in the top 40 that would last for the next 35 years, eight months and three weeks.”\n \n\n   \n  There are, however, rap songs currently down lower on the Hot 100 list.\n \n\n   \n  YoungBoy Never Broke Again’s “Shot Callin,” came in at number 44 followed by Cardi B’s “Safe” (featuring Kehlani) and BigXthaPlug’s “Hell at Night” (featuring Ella Langley) at 48 and 49, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  So is hip hop declining or nah?\n \n\n   \n  Billboard reports that “the lack of rap songs in the Hot 100’s top 40 is the latest sign of a recent dip in rap’s commercial dominance,” while also pointing out that they made a rule change that contributed to the recent Lamar and SZA collab dropping out of the top.\n \n\n   \n  “For the chart dated Oct. 25, descending songs were deemed recurrent and removed from the chart if they had exceeded certain durations on the chart while also falling below certain updated chart thresholds — for instance, if they had fallen below No. 25 after spending over 26 weeks on the chart,” the publication explained. “That particular change resulted in the departure of ‘Luther,’ which had fallen to No. 38 on the previous week’s Hot 100 in its 46th week on the listing.”\n \n\n   \n  Lamar’s latest album, 2024’s “GNX,” was bolstered by  his now legendary beef  with fellow rapper and former collaborator, Drake.\n \n\n   \n  The hip-hop superstar  won five Grammys  in February, two of them in major categories for his hit “Not Like Us,” a diss track of Drake.\n \n\n   \n   Drake filed suit against his own record label,  UMG Recordings, Inc. The Canadian rapper and actor’s claim was that the label participated in defaming him by publishing and promoting the song.\n \n\n   \n  Lamar was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, and it  was recently dismissed by a federal judge.  This week, though, the beef goes on, because Drake’s attorneys  made it known  they would file an appeal.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/health/casey-means-surgeon-general-hearing-delayed-labor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:15:00-04:00","title":"Confirmation hearing delayed for Trump’s surgeon general nominee as she goes into labor with her first child","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. Casey Means, a Stanford Medicine-trained physician and author of the best-selling 'Good Energy,' was nominated by President Donald Trump as the next U.S. Surgeon General after the withdrawal of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat.

Trump’s big concession to Xi is loaded with red flags \n       \n  Analysis by David Goldman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:36 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump made an extraordinary concession in his  landmark deal  with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday: In exchange for promises that China will crack down on fentanyl, the United States will shave 10% off the tariffs it charges on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  On the surface, it’s a promising deal that could restore some of the trade that tariffs had stymied between the world’s two largest economies. The reduction will bring the minimum tariff on Chinese imports down to 20%, and the average tariff rate will fall to around 47%. That’s lofty compared to many other US trading partners but still more in line with the rest of the world.\n \n\n   \n  It could give some relief to US consumers, and it means Chinese goods can shed the outcast status in the United States that Trump’s high tariffs had imposed on them.\n \n\n   \n  But the tariff reduction is also a significant gamble for the Trump administration, which has encountered a persistent problem in its unprecedented trade war with China: ﻿Trump has been  bested by Xi in the trade war  at every turn. Even the fact that they met in person Thursday means Trump has already given into China’s demands. And, as history has proven in these on-again, off-again deals, it’s not clear the United States will get anything serious back by giving in on fentanyl tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Trump risks further eroding America’s relationship with its key allies while gaining a friendlier relationship with its chief economic adversary.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is betting this time will be different. History suggests otherwise.\n \n\n   \n    China’s successful fight against Trump\n \n\n   \n  Trump wanted  four main outcomes  from his  tariffs on China : A reduction in fentanyl coming into the United States, a return of manufacturing to the United States, restoration of the balance of trade and a sale of TikTok’s US assets.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has made real progress on all four: China has pointed to strong actions it has taken toward preventing the export of the foundational chemicals used to make fentanyl. Dozens of companies have promised multibillion-dollar investments in US manufacturing. The US-China trade gap hit a 21-year low in August. And Trump and Xi agreed to the framework of a TikTok deal.\n \n\n   \n  But the frosty relationship has also caused major problems for the United States. China has restricted the export of  rare-earth minerals  – crucial elements in electronics and military equipment. It has refused to buy US soybeans, devastating American farmers. And it has made life more difficult for some key US businesses by launching antitrust investigations. China also has put in place hefty tariffs of its own on US imports.\n \n\n   \n  Despite several rounds of talks with US trade negotiators, China has continued to slow-walk promises to the Trump administration. Rare earths, in particular, became a key sticking point, and earlier guarantees of a free-flowing rare-earth market never materialized. Beijing has even tightened its controls by expanding its restrictions earlier this month.\n \n\n   \n  Under Thursday’s deal, China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, TikTok’s future in the US remains uncertain after rounds of trade talks between the two countries. Beijing stopped short of confirming a final deal on TikTok has been reached following the Xi-Trump meeting, pledging only to work with the US to “properly address” the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently acknowledged that China often fails to hold up its end of the bargain – including when he  announced in November  2024 that he would raise tariffs on China because of the fentanyl crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social several weeks after Election Day. Then President-elect Trump claimed that Chinese officials promised him the country would execute drug dealers caught funneling drugs into the United States but “never followed through.”\n \n\n   \n    Why Trump is making a deal\n \n\n   \n  So why would Trump make a deal with China on fentanyl now if Xi keeps reneging?\n \n\n   \n  First, China has taken honest-to-goodness action on fentanyl. For example, the country over the summer added two more elements used to make fentanyl to its list of controlled substances. When criminal networks adapted and began selling those elements on the black market, China worked to thwart those exports, too.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Thursday cited China’s  “ very strong action ”  in cracking down on fentanyl as a reason for lowering US tariffs on Chinese goods.\n \n\n   \n  It appears that some  progress has been made on reducing fentanyl  emanating from China in recent years – and there’s some limited evidence that China’s actions are making an impact since Trump’s tariffs went into effect. The US Drug Enforcement Agency in an  annual report  released in May said fentanyl purity declined throughout 2024, consistent with indications that fentanyl cooks in Mexico were having trouble obtaining key precursor chemicals. US Customs and Border Protection have also  reported  that fentanyl stopped at the border was down in 2024 and is on pace to fall again in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Trump may or may not agree that China has made progress on fentanyl, but he sounded a different note on the subject this week than he has sung in the past. He claimed Wednesday that “China is going to be working with me” on restricting the drug.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe that they’re going to help us with the fentanyl situation,” Trump said. “They’re going to be doing what they can do.”\n \n\n   \n  Second, China holds significant leverage over the United States. Trump’s tariffs have backfired in numerous ways, including by angering US farmers – a key voting bloc – and creating a rare-earth shortage. China has also refused to fully open up their market to American AI chips, a major Trump goal to help cement US dominance in artificial intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  Tariffs remain one key lever that Trump can pull, even as China has found markets outside the United States willing to buy its goods, blunting the damage Trump’s levies have imposed.\n \n\n   \n  Still, reducing tariffs represents one key Chinese demand. Trump’s meeting with Xi was another.\n \n\n   \n  Giving up some of that ground – particularly if China has shown some goodwill on fentanyl – gives Trump some ability to get what he wants out of these negotiations. In a vague statement on Thursday, China said it will make “corresponding adjustments” to its countermeasures on fentanyl-related tariffs after Trump agreed to cut the levies by half.\n \n\n   \n    What’s next?\n \n\n   \n  A potential problem for the United States: The other two countries on which the Trump administration has imposed fentanyl tariffs – Mexico and Canada – probably watched Thursday’s announcement with a raised eyebrow and some raised blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Both countries have also made real efforts to restrict fentanyl coming over the US border. And fentanyl coming in from Canada has never posed a major problem, making up less than 1% of overall fentanyl coming into the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Nevertheless, Trump has threatened to raise  Mexico’s  and  Canada’s tariffs  while he is reducing tariffs on China. The deal could improve America’s relationship with its chief economic adversary while angering key allies and its two biggest trading partners.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the reduction in tariffs could help Americans who are paying the price. Albeit slowly, tariffs have raised prices in the United States. Any reduction will be welcome news for inflation-wary consumers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Liu and Simone McCarthy contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/lukoil-to-sell-foreign-assets-gunvor-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:44:00-04:00","title":"Crushed by punishing US sanctions, Russia’s Lukoil accepts offer to sell its international business","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia’s second-largest oil company, Lukoil, has accepted a proposal from global commodity trader Gunvor to sell its international assets in response to U.S. sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A landmark meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump on  the sidelines of an international summit  in South Korea Thursday appears to have made major strides to resolve frictions in the volatile relationship between the world’s two largest economies and rival superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  The two leaders had agreed on “almost everything” and reached a trade deal that could be signed “pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after wrapping up the highly anticipated meeting with Xi, which capped his five-day tour of Asia.\n \n\n   \n  Xi also pointed to the “consensus” reached on resolving “important economic and trade issues” and called on the two sides to “refine and finalize follow-up work as soon as possible, uphold and implement the consensus, and deliver tangible results,” according to a Chinese readout.\n \n\n   \n  “Economic and trade relations should continue to be the ballast and engine of Sino-US relations, not a stumbling block or point of conflict,” the Chinese leader said.\n \n\n   \n  The two appeared to find common ground on their duelling export controls, with a readout from Beijing saying that the Chinese sides would suspend for one year the implementation of sweeping export controls  on rare earth minerals , in exchange for the US hitting a one-year pause on a rule announced in September that would vastly expand the number of Chinese companies restricted from buying certain American technologies.\n \n\n   \n  In his comments to reporters, Trump said the understanding would “eliminate” roadblocks to the export of the strategically critical materials and could be renewed each year. He did not explicitly mention the pause on the US rules.\n \n\n   \n  Under their consensus, the US would reduce by 10% of existing tariffs on Chinese imports – in exchange for what Trump said was Xi’s pledge to crack down further on China’s role in the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl into the US. A truce that reduced an escalation from both sides to triple-digit levies earlier this year would remain in effect, according to statement from both sides.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said that would bring the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47%. China said it would make “corresponding adjustments” to its US tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  China would also ramp up purchases of “tremendous amounts” of American soybeans, Trump said, with Beijing noting that the two sides had “reached consensus” on expanding agricultural trade. Beijing also said the two sides would suspend tit-for-tat port fees targeting each other’s shipping sectors.\n \n\n   \n  One of China’s top concerns – US export controls blocking its access to high end technology including semi-conductors – was discussed, according to Trump, but didn’t appear to have yielded any new breakthroughs.\n \n\n   \n  On the lingering issue surrounding TikTok’s future, China said it will work with the US to “properly address” it, but stopped short of confirming a final deal has been reached.\n \n\n   \n  The one-hour-and forty-minute meeting – the leaders’ first in six years – also appeared provide a key venue for the two men to stress their interest in stabilizing their countries’ fractious relationship.\n \n\n   \n  In comments ahead of the talks, Trump praised Xi as the “great leader of a great country” and said he thought the two “were going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” while the Chinese leader said it was a “great pleasure” to see Trump after many years.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not always see eye to eye with each other, and it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then … you and I at the helm of China-US relations should stay the right course,” Xi said, adding the two nations could “prosper together.\n \n\n   \n    Troubled trade\n \n\n   \n  The global economy has for months been roiled by a tit-for-tat of mounting tariffs, export controls and other penalties hitting areas from high-tech goods to high-seas shipping, as the US and China have vacillated between escalation and negotiation.\n \n\n   \n  At the crux of those tensions are a gaping trade imbalance and efforts from the US to ensure its national security against an increasingly assertive China, including by expanding restrictions on China’s access to American high tech, like the advanced semiconductors needed to power AI.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also appeared to raise the stakes of the meeting moments before landing in Busan, announcing the end of a more than three-decade moratorium on US nuclear testing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the US “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” naming Russia as second and China “a distant third,” but catching up.\n \n\n   \n  “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what he was referring to as neither of the three countries has tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes the US will “earnestly uphold its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s statement added to other twists and turns ahead of the meeting, including Trump openly questioning whether it would happen and threatening additional tariffs and export controls on critical software in recent weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Eleventh-hour trade negotiations by top officials in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, set the meeting on track. Expectations rose on both sides, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, with the hopes that the deal would produce more than just a low-key touchpoint between the two world leaders.\n \n\n   \n  But the consensus reached will be just one touchstone in a thorny and volatile great power rivalry between the world’s superpower democracy and an authoritarian China, whose growing military assertiveness under Xi in the East and South China Seas is rattling US allies in the region.\n \n\n   \n  Both sides have seen a leader-level meeting as key to stabilizing the relationship as they continue to grapple with how to structure their economic ties.\n \n\n   \n  The meeting offered a win for China, which wants predictability in its US relations while it sprints toward self-sufficiency from American high-tech, and also for Trump, whose meeting with Xi delivers a big-ticket finale for what has already been a dealmaking blitz across Asia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/basketball-nba-sports-business-cosm","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"NBA and Cosm Extend Immersive Sports Viewing Partnership Through 2030","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NBA and Cosm, a start-up redefining the sports bar experience with immersive 'shared reality' domes, have extended their partnership into 2030 and beyond.

sporting world’s most intriguing start-up companies \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of the sports world’s most intriguing start-up companies is renewing its long-term partnership with its first-ever major  professional sports league  partner.\n \n\n   \n  The  NBA  and Cosm, the entertainment company that’s reinventing the sports bar with what they like to call “shared reality,” announced Thursday an extended partnership to air live NBA games in Cosm’s domes. The IMAX-esque experience allows Cosm’s customers to watch live sporting events on its unique 87-foot-diameter, 12L+ LED screens that have gone viral for offering a first-of-its-kind experience for fans.\n \n\n   \n  The NBA was Cosm’s first-ever league partner long before the company opened its first location in Los Angeles in 2024. The two entities are now set to work together into 2030 and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  “Our ambition is to give another option for fans that might be out of the marketplace or their favorite team is on the road, or they haven’t been able to get to those courtside seats or lower bowl seats,” said Jeb Terry, Cosm’s president and CEO, in an interview with  CNN Sports . “So, it’s really complementary, I would say, to the NBA’s ambition of opening up access, giving fans more ways to celebrate the game, and providing other opportunities to lean into that action.\n \n\n   \n  “And that’s why it was really an obvious opportunity from the beginning. Because not only is that the innovative spirit of the league, the tech-forward approach, but the same way we approach it by leveraging technology to augment that fan experience and give more optionality, so fans can just lean in and celebrate wherever they are, whether they’re in-market, out-of-market, wherever that may be.”\n \n\n   \n  The extended partnership will allow Cosm to produce and distribute live NBA games at Cosm’s venues for at least the next five years. That means Cosm will be able to send its in-house production team, which is responsible for the unique views provided to viewers at their domes, to key national TV games, events from next year’s  All-Star Weekend , the  playoffs  and  NBA Finals .\n \n\n   \n  Teddy Kaplan, NBA vice president and head of new media partnerships at the league, said working with Cosm has been a no-brainer for his team from the start.\n \n\n   \n  Kaplan was on a ski trip to Park City, Utah, in 2022 when he got the opportunity to visit Cosm’s headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. He diverted from that vacation for a bit to see what the company was working on and was introduced to Cosm’s experience center for the first time, which gave him an idea of what the finished domes would be like.\n \n\n   \n  He left that meeting wowed.\n \n\n   \n  “I got there and I said, ‘Oh my God, this is, this is the future. This is what we need,’” Kaplan told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  He added, “Our fans are young, tech-savvy, diverse, and they push us to be innovative. And as you’ll see, across our portfolio of distribution points, we’re always looking for ways to innovate the way fans watch our game, whether it’s alt streams, whether it’s via virtual reality, whether it’s with our social partners. Cosm is the perfect piece in our broader network here.”\n \n\n   \n  The initial partnership with the NBA, agreed to in February 2023, was an important inflection point in the company’s history, according to Terry.\n \n\n   \n  That kind of high-profile partner gave Cosm – at that point about a year-and-a-half from opening its first location near SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California – much needed legitimacy as it entered into discussions with other leagues and broadcast companies that hold the rights to sporting events aired in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “When you’re building companies, there’s always these pivotal moments along the way. You get the technology sorted. You’re like, ‘OK, it works.’ Then you have to work on getting market adoption, and there’s a lot of ways to do that with our business,” Terry said.\n \n\n   \n  “Partnerships are paramount. They are critical to how we bring this to life with our fans. And so, having the NBA as our first, it was a great moment for our company to announce it … and then get that word of mouth trending within the industry and then pushing that forward. And so, you look to have all these credible moments along the way in this growth phase. And this was one of the big ones.”\n \n\n   \n  The next move for Cosm is scaling up into more locations. It currently has domes open at that initial location in Inglewood and one in Dallas. Three more locations have been announced in Detroit, Cleveland and Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  That puts the company in five NBA cities and looking to expand to more, including overseas locations that could put international fans closer to professional American basketball in a way that’s much cheaper and easier than flying across an ocean to get into an NBA arena.\n \n\n   \n  Given that Cosm is able to show its customers views that they would have to pay dearly to afford – the courtside view from the scorer’s table, underneath the hoops in the front row at either end of the floor – all from the comfort of a sports bar environment, Kaplan said the hope is that NBA fans will be able to approximate that experience from the domes.\n \n\n   \n  “We like to use the stat that 99% of our fans will never make it to an NBA game, and that’s in the US. When you go global, it’s 99.99%. And when you think about sitting courtside, basically 100%, right?” Kaplan said.\n \n\n   \n  “And so having Cosm as a tool to bring fans closer to the game and speak to those tech-savvy fans is really perfect for us.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/boxing-mayweather-pacquiao-rematch-negotiations-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:26:00-04:00","title":"Blockbuster rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao ‘almost’ agreed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A potential rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao, billed as a continuation of their historic 2015 'Fight of the Century,' is reportedly 'almost' agreed upon, with both camps in negotiations.

and why are they central to Trump’s trade deal with China? \n       \n  By Ramishah Maruf, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:32 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US trade deal with China seeks to resolve a major sticking point of their ongoing trade war: rare-earth minerals.\n \n\n   \n  Despite multiple rounds of talks with US trade negotiators over the past several months, China continued to slow-walk promises to the Trump administration that it would free up crucial rare-earth metals, and earlier guarantees of expedited rare-earth licenses to US companies never materialized. Beijing even  tightened earlier this month  its controls by massively expanding its restrictions..\n \n\n   \n  Under  Thursday’s deal , China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.\n \n\n   \n  The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration; China  for years  has built up near-total control of the   minerals   as part of its wider  industrial policy .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know about rare earths.\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths, and are they actually ‘rare?’\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths include   17 metallic elements in the periodic table made up of scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides.\n \n\n   \n  The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth’s crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process and are   also  environmentally damaging .\n \n\n   \n    What are rare earths used for?\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are ubiquitous in everyday technologies, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They’re crucial for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments.\n \n\n   \n  Rare earths are also essential for the US military. They’re used in F-35 fighter jets, submarines, lasers, satellites, Tomahawk missiles and more, according to a 2025 research  note  from CSIS.\n \n\n   \n    Where do rare earths come from?\n \n\n   \n  Sixty-one percent of mined rare earth production comes from China, according to the International Energy Agency, and the country controls  92%  of the global output in the processing stage.\n \n\n   \n  There are two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn’t have the capability to separate rare earths after extraction.\n \n\n   \n  “Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Trump administration’s announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America’s reliance on China for rare earth separation, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The US has one operational rare earth mine in California, according to Baskaran.\n \n\n   \n    Why do rare earths matter in the trade war?\n \n\n   \n  Beijing is using rare earths as major leverage in the trade war, and its latest restrictions were a major topic of conversation when Xi and Trump met Thursday at the APEC summit in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, China  added five rare-earth elements  – holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and related magnets and materials – to its existing control list, requiring export licenses. That makes the total amount of restricted rare earths to 12.   China also required licenses to export rare earth manufacturing technologies out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time this year that Chinese restrictions on rare earths have angered Trump. In June, Trump said on Truth Social that  China violated a trade truce  as   Beijing kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products.\n \n\n   \n  The export controls could have a major impact, since the US is heavily reliant on China for rare earths. Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a  US Geological Survey report .\n \n\n   \n  But China’s latest restrictions were seen as a dramatic escalation in Trump’s trade war between the world’s two biggest economic powers.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nectar Gan, John Liu, Donald Judd, Kylie Atwood, Phil Mattingly and David Goldman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/sport/chess-danny-rensch-profile-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"06:05:00-04:00","title":"From being raised in ‘the Collective’ to being a ‘shepherd’ of chess: the winding journey of Danny Rensch","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Danny Rensch’s journey from being raised in a cult known as the Church of Immortal Consciousness, where he was manipulated, emotionally abused, and separated from his mother, to becoming a leading figure in chess as the chief chess officer at Chess.com, illustrates a profound personal transformation.

From being raised in ‘the Collective’ to being a ‘shepherd’ of chess: the winding journey of Danny Rensch \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:05 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Danny Rensch is at the vanguard of chess.\n \n\n   \n  He, alongside a few others, has helped to develop the sport from one which was played by the elites to a phenomenon that has exploded in recent years, particularly thanks to the rising popularity of online chess.\n \n\n   \n  But to get to where he is now – a self-described “shepherd” for chess in his role as chief chess officer at Chess.com – Rensch has been on quite the life path.\n \n\n   \n  As he describes in his new memoir, “Dark Squares: How Chess Saved My Life,” Rensch was raised in Arizona in what he describes as a cult, a group that he says orchestrated a separation from his own mother and exploited his proficiency at playing chess for its own reputational gain.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch had to overcome many hurdles: Surviving emotional and substance abuse, developing tinnitus and allegedly being manipulated by a charismatic leader by being told he’d be the savior of chess. But along the way, his journey has taken him from a small commune to becoming a guiding light in a sport which, he believes, still has plenty of opportunity to grow.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the hardship and trauma he’s dealt with over his life, Rensch says he doesn’t hold any resentment. He believes the struggles of his past are all part of life’s rich tapestry, highlighting a quote from influential Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung as the motto he lives by: “We are not what happens to us, we are what we choose to become.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we can learn through pain and suffering sadly, but also it can give us an appreciation for what we have,” Rensch told CNN Sports. “Part of my journey is that what grief has taught me is that your relationships are what matter the most and connecting with other people through whatever you’re doing is what actually gives you purpose.\n \n\n   \n  “Your purpose is not anything you do. It is what you feel and what you find within why you do it. And I adhere myself to the fact that I am not what has happened to me. I am what I’ve chosen to become. And I try to take that into everything that I do and everything that we do at Chess.com.”\n \n\n   \n    Life in the ‘Collective’\n \n\n   \n  Growing up, Rensch recalls in his memoir that he was afforded the freedom to run around with children his own age, spending days in the woods with his friends or splashing around in the water.\n \n\n   \n  That was initially what life was like inside the now-disbanded Church of Immortal Consciousness.\n \n\n   \n  According to the group’s beliefs, the Church of Immortal Consciousness followed the teachings of Dr. Pahlvon Duran, a figure who last lived in the 15th century. Rensch describes the group as a spiritual haven for those looking for direction. Known internally as the Collective, the group sought to give lost souls direction – or as they called it, a Purpose – in a supposedly egalitarian society.\n \n\n   \n  Run by Steven and Trina Kamp, the Collective would meet to ensure members focused on their spiritual alignment and, as a group, would pool their money together to ensure they were financially merged.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch recalls they would organize meetings – called Processes – where the members of the Collective would discuss whether or not a fellow member was following the teachings of Duran and, therefore, if they were spiritually pure. Rensch says in his memoir that these meetings often descended into loud arguments due to the amount of alcohol being consumed, and it would not be uncommon for someone to be “glassed” by having a full cup of liquid thrown in their face.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Kamp has previously denied the Church of Immortal Consciousness was a cult.\n \n\n   \n  Families would share accommodations, with Rensch recalling sharing beds with other kids across multiple abodes. But as a child, this was just something he was used to at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Many traveled to the Collective in search of meaning. But, as Rensch came to find out, life in an idealistic commune often doesn’t end in spiritual happiness.\n \n\n   \n  Despite preaching an equal society, it became apparent to Rensch that that wasn’t the case. He references a famous George Orwell quote from the classic novella Animal Farm when describing the hierarchy inside the Collective: “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.”\n \n\n   \n  “There were leaders and there was a literal hierarchy, a totem pole system. In some ways, the members self-ranked and sort of self-flagellated in order to keep everything in check,” Rensch explained to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Steven Hassan, a licensed mental health professional and one of the leading experts on cults, told CNN Sports that these kinds of groups can cause a “dissociative disorder and a disruption of identity” in members.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan has personal experience having been a former member of the  Unification Church , the controversial religion founded by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954 and accused by critics of being a cult.\n \n\n   \n  “So in my case, I went from Steven Hassan of Flushing Queens, youngest of three kids, nice Jewish boy, wasn’t political, to a right-wing fascist wanting to take over the world,” Hassan said.\n \n\n   \n  “And so I had a pseudo-identity in the image of the cult. So my own critical thinking was pushed down. It wasn’t erased, but it was pushed down. The public has this incorrect assumption that people who get into cults are weak or stupid or uneducated, and it’s just not true. In Danny’s case, he had no choice.”\n \n\n   \n  As a child, the social dynamics of the group didn’t register with Rensch. But in hindsight, he is now able to recognize the pitfalls of the group.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch says in his book that the Kamps were able to weaponize the faith the Collective preached in an attempt to alter people’s life courses for the gain of the individual and the group. Whether it be how they raised their children or the job they were doing, the Kamps could decide whether it was the right fit spiritually and, if not, take steps to adjust.\n \n\n   \n  Also, in the search of spiritual happiness, it was commonplace for families to undergo dramatic changes. Husbands would leave their wives in search of their “Like Vibration” – a better fitting partner in the eyes of the Collective – and Rensch says children would be separated from their parents and adopted into other families to allow the child to flourish.\n \n\n   \n    Separation\n \n\n   \n  Rensch was an ordinary kid who liked ordinary activities. But his whole life changed upon watching the film “Searching for Bobby Fischer.”\n \n\n   \n  He was immediately gripped by a sport which was so different to any other, one which tested the brain in completely different ways than any other.\n \n\n   \n  And, as it turned out, Rensch was good at it from the outset. He would spend hours playing and teaching himself until his skills eventually caught the eye of church leader Steven Kamp.\n \n\n   \n  Kamp, a chess fan himself, saw the potential in Rensch’s game. Rensch said he later came to realize that Kamp saw Rensch’s ability at chess as a way of legitimizing the teachings of the Collective and justify the way the group worked.\n \n\n   \n  CNN Sports has attempted to contact Kamp to offer him the chance to comment.\n \n\n   \n  According to Rensch, Kamp took it upon himself to make sure that the boy received special chess training – including hiring the former Soviet defector, Igor Ivanov – and providing funds and transport so Rensch could travel to tournaments around Arizona and the country to test his skills. More than that, Kamp instructed Rensch that chess had become his Purpose, therefore instilling a religious importance to a game he was in his formative stages in learning.\n \n\n   \n  This added pressure on chess distorted his view on what was meant to be an enjoyable game, Rensch says.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was receiving discipline, to say it was wrapped up in shame and self-worth doesn’t even do it justice because the shame and self-worth was meant to transcend this lifetime. It was meant to transcend the planet,” he explained.\n \n\n   \n  “It was like: ‘Oh, I’m actually, literally going to hell if I’m not putting my efforts into getting as good as I can at chess all the time.’”\n \n\n   \n  This added attention and time to focus on chess meant Rensch quickly went from promising youngster to tournament winner and chess prodigy. Over his chess career, he would become the youngest national chess master in Arizona history and a multi-time national scholastic champion.\n \n\n   \n  But this success came with a catch: Kamp took it upon himself to push Rensch further and further into the chess world, no matter the consequences, Rensch says. He saw Rensch as a future grandmaster.\n \n\n   \n  The constant flights and elevation changes involved in the journeys he was making across the US resulted in Rensch developing tinnitus, he said, which would eventually develop into chronic pain, infections and sinus pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch describes the most painful moment of his time with the group as being when he was separated from his mother, with his future success at chess given as a main reason why that move was orchestrated.\n \n\n   \n  Hassan said that children being separated from their parents is commonplace in cults, saying “parent alienation” is a typical practice.\n \n\n   \n  “This is something that typically happens with authoritarian cults. One of the parents gets into a cult, the other one doesn’t want to,” Hassan said. “So I’ve seen that one for 48 years. Every single cult does that as a thing.”\n \n\n   \n  Rensch’s chess playing career would eventually fizzle out, and looking back in hindsight, his relationship with the sport changed as he grew up and could recognize the environment he was living in.\n \n\n   \n  “The game gave me everything and then it took everything away. And I’ve been to hell and back with chess so many times,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Moving on\n \n\n   \n  As Rensch went through his life in the Collective and his chess playing faded away, his issues continued to pile up.\n \n\n   \n  While he met his wife Shauna and had children of his own, Rensch says he dealt with alcohol and substance abuse as he struggled with the dynamic of the Collective and how he fit in. Shauna was briefly with the Collective when she was six but moved away before returning later in life.\n \n\n   \n  He recalls the moment he decided to leave the Collective shortly after the birth of his second child and coming to the painful realization that it was time to move on.\n \n\n   \n  That decoupling wasn’t an easy thought to process for Rensch, having spent most of his life with the group.\n \n\n   \n  “Whatever I could do to myself, whatever baggage I was willing to carry, as long as it was just me, there was probably a part of me that could or would do it forever,” he said. “And that’s part of how you dip in and out of addictive behavior and back out again, you dip in and out of almost ruining your marriage but then barely saving it.”\n \n\n   \n    Stewards\n \n\n   \n  By that point, in 2009, Rensch had begun coaching on Chess.com. It was a humble beginning, but it allowed him to get his foot in the door at an organization which would soon enjoy a meteoric rise.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t easy at the beginning. The website was set up in 2007 and, at that time, the main online chess platform was the Internet Chess Club (ICC).\n \n\n   \n  Through years of development and clever marketing, Chess.com was able to develop into the dominant force of internet chess, with Rensch playing a key role behind that growth.\n \n\n   \n  As well as making it the main platform for coaches to help nurture the next generation of chess stars, a key manta in developing Chess.com was to open the sport to the wider community, with Rensch admitting that the game has at times been a “gatekeep community” by the “intellectually elite or (those who) want to revere and worship the intellectually elite.”\n \n\n   \n  “We were like: ‘This is wrong.’ And I saw that it was wrong from having failed to try to reach the mountain as a prodigy and (Chess.com CEO and co-founder) Erik (Allebest) saw that it was wrong as someone who always loved the game but felt kept out of the club,” Rensch said.\n \n\n   \n  Nowadays, Chess.com is home to over 230 million members, sees more than one billion moves being played every day, and is valued at over $1 billion with no venture backing, according to the company. During those early years as a start-up, the only financial backing the site was ever able to receive was a $70,000 temporary loan from the mom of Allebest’s friend.\n \n\n   \n  As one of the biggest organizations in the sport, Chess.com has also had to weather its fair share of controversy, most notably a  cheating scandal  involving an accusation from Magnus Carlsen that Hans Niemann cheated in an over-the-board game. Niemann was  eventually cleared of cheating  in that particular match.\n \n\n   \n  Rensch said that the episode taught the people involved with Chess.com that it had “way more influence than we thought we did.”\n \n\n   \n  But despite the meteoric rise and the sway the site now has over the sport, Rensch and his colleagues see themselves as guiding hands.\n \n\n   \n  “We really are the shepherds of something that belongs to humanity and we do not take that for granted,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “The truth is we always had a bit of an existential – viewing ourselves from 30,000 feet – view that this was kind of bigger than us and that we owed chess the opportunity to reach more people.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/us/faa-workers-without-paycheck","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:30:00-04:30","title":"The stress is just always there, as thousands of FAA workers go without paycheck","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal government shutdown in October 2025, thousands of FAA employees—including radar technicians and air traffic controllers—are working without pay while continuing to perform essential safety functions.

The equipment has to be flawless, he said. It’s how controllers make air traffic decisions with planes full of hundreds of passengers.\n \n\n   \n  His family mostly relies on his income, as his wife works part-time and stays home with their son.\n \n\n   \n  It broke Schmidt’s heart as a father to tell his son a month ago that he couldn’t get his allowance due to the family’s financial situation.\n \n\n   \n  “Having to tell your child that you can’t provide for them is a difficult burden,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Working six days a week and now not getting paid\n \n\n   \n  Many of these critical federal jobs were understaffed, and the people who do them overworked even before the shutdown, making the gap in pay even harder to take.\n \n\n   \n  Corinne Wiseman’s husband – a controller at the Boston TRACON - supports them on his sole income, often working Thursday through Monday and then a sixth day on Tuesday, when he must pick up mandatory overtime.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s not really home,” Wiseman said. “He doesn’t already see his kids hardly at all. Not his fault. It’s his schedule.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has omitted her husband’s name to maintain his anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  The schedules at the FAA are demanding – oftentimes controllers work long hours through the evenings or overnights, making critical decisions and setting personal life aside to maintain the safety of the flying public.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman said it is “hard to not get personal about it,” knowing that her husband has missed years with their four children already, and now he’s not getting paid to do his job and support his family. Her husband has built up exhaustion and resentment, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “(Being an air traffic controller) has been my husband’s dream for almost two decades and in the last five years, I have only seen a decline in his mindset,” she said. “He loves the work, he is angry that the federal government could get away treating them the way they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, some controllers are calling out sick causing a rippling effect of staffing shortages and delays.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to this shutdown, the family had taken out a loan to complete some much-needed repairs around their home. That included new windows, a new roof and more, she said. Now, they’re left to cut costs elsewhere to ensure bills get paid. She said the family keeps the heat off in the house for as long as possible and mostly uses firewood to keep warm.\n \n\n   \n  “As a spouse, watching your significant other feel the full weight of the financial strain of the family while also being unable to physically be present is painful and stressful,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman stays home to take care of their children, but since the shutdown she has been looking for an online job to help their family while still managing their schedules.\n \n\n   \n  “In our family, the stress is just always there, just because the career itself is already extremely stressful and takes a lot of time away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    No end in sight\n \n\n   \n  For now, Schmidt is calling creditors to figure out what bills must be paid. He takes side jobs to make extra cash, and many of his colleagues are doing the same, he said. Schmidt’s union, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, represents about 11,000 FAA employees. About 5,000 of them, like Schmidt, are working without pay during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m trying to stay strong and do my job with dignity and with the best of my ability,” Schmidt said. “I don’t think I could handle if I was responsible for a loss of life, a loss of lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Keeping the public safe is something that drives many aviation workers, even when they aren’t getting paid, despite the hardships on their families.\n \n\n   \n  As the holidays approach, Wiseman’s family of six is already making adjustments to pinch pennies where needed. She’s canceled or postponed doctor’s appointments, chiropractic care and vet appointments to avoid co-pays or bills piling up.\n \n\n   \n  All four of Wiseman’s children are in their pre-teen to teenage years, involved in activities and costly sports. One has even started driving, which helps Wiseman keep up with the schedules, but adds another cost given high car insurance rates for a new driver.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been just trying to be very frugal, like extra spending at a very bare minimum,” she said, noting the family doesn’t eat out anymore.\n \n\n   \n  Wiseman’s children carpool for sports to avoid additional expenses. The couple is not sending their youngest son to an out-of-state hockey tournament in two weeks because of the financial strain it would cause. He’s a goalie.\n \n\n   \n  The family has been through this before. In January 2019, the decision by 10 air traffic controllers, which didn’t include Wiseman’s husband, to call out sick helped end that 35-day long shutdown. Their absence temporarily shut down travel at New York’s LaGuardia airport and caused delays at other major hubs in New Jersey, Philadelphia and Atlanta, driving President Trump to agree to a temporary government funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  How this shutdown will end is anyone’s guess, but for now these families are struggling to cover their costs as they still report to work.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/lily-allen-nun-west-end-girl-lotw","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:25:00-04:00","title":"Look of the Week: Lily Allen is a wayward nun, cigarette and all","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lily Allen's new album, 'West End Girl', is interpreted as a post-mortem of her five-year marriage to actor David Harbour, which began in September 2020 after they met on the dating app Raya.

nun, cigarette and all \n       \n  By Jacqui Palumbo, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:25 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There are no saints in the aftermath of a complicated breakup, and in one of the visuals accompanying Lily Allen’s latest album, “West End Girl” — interpreted as a post-mortem on her marriage to actor David Harbour — she assumes the role of the wayward nun, donning the familiar black and white habit to take a smoke break.\n \n\n   \n  The surprise album, which Allen released last Friday, can be taken as a play-by-play of the downfall of her five-year marriage, which began with Las Vegas nuptials in September 2020 after the couple met on celebrity dating app Raya. Though Allen did  tell Vogue  the album is only “inspired” by the relationship and not “all gospel.”\n \n\n   \n  Since its release, listeners have been piecing together a bigger picture of their relationship and its fallout, referencing the lyrics with years of reports and rumors. Also in the crossfire: the couple’s divisive  Architectural Digest feature  in early 2023, featuring their eclectic Brooklyn townhouse, which is now being retrospectively eyed as a warning sign. (“Perhaps The David Harbour-Lily Allen Home Is Worth Wrecking,” pop culture critic Hunter Harris  penned  as a Substack headline at the time.)\n \n\n   \n  Blessedly, the album visuals are striking not in their maximalism, but their quieter reverie. Throughout the images, Allen unsettles Catholic iconography: In one looped video, she clasps her hands in prayer, wearing the blue and red of Mother Mary; on the album’s cover, painter Nieves González  depicts  the singer as an updated Baroque icon, stoic in polka dots and chiaroscuro lighting.\n \n\n   \n  In the video loop of Allen as a nun, she crosses a leg to reveal sheer tights and black pumps as she smokes a cigarette. She seems to be grappling with the duality of desire — something she candidly sings to in the song “Sleepwalking” (“I know you’ve made me your Madonna / I wanna be your wh**e”). But the visual metaphor resonates across the album at large. Allen doesn’t depict herself as the virtuous, scorned wife, but a real and raw person who cycles through anxiety and insecurity until everything reaches its bitter end.\n \n\n   \n  Nun imagery has often been deployed in music, art and fashion to symbolize a reverence that is readily subverted, by sex, sin or feminism. Lady Gaga has worn the habit in music videos and on tour, while designers including Rick Owens have frequently played with the cloth caps’ austere form. And though Allen’s version of a nun is certainly no stranger to vice, she is perhaps most subverted by a lack of faith in herself, as she painfully recounts going against her better judgement again and again.\n \n\n   \n  “Listen, I am in a period of self-discovery at the moment and I’m really trying to explore how I’ve got myself into certain situations in the past,” she told Vogue. “I need to unpack some things and break some patterns and probably talk to my therapist about my relationship with my dad.”\n \n\n   \n  Online, some commentators have already dubbed the upcoming months “West End Girl Winter,” as Allen ushers in a period of self-reflection, leaving 2024’s “ Brat summer ” far in the rearview mirror. The key items for this new season are yet to be determined, but will presumably include a posh home, smudged eyeliner, revenge heels and an incisive pen. The full nun’s habit remains optional.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/louvre-jewels-heist-arrests-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:08:00Z","title":"Five new suspects arrested over Louvre heist – but still no sign of looted jewels","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Five new suspects have been arrested in connection with the October 19, 2025, heist of France’s crown jewels from the Louvre Museum’s Apollo Gallery, bringing the total number of arrests to seven.

but still no sign of looted jewels \n       \n  By Saskya Vandoorne, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:08 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Five new suspects have been arrested over the theft of France’s crown jewels from the  Louvre  museum, the Paris prosecutor announced Thursday, bringing the total number of arrests over the  stunning heist  to seven.\n \n\n   \n  Of the five new suspects, one is believed to have been part of the four-man gang who carried out the heist, Laure Beccuau, the prosecutor, told French radio RTL.\n \n\n   \n  This means that, following an 11-day manhunt, police have now arrested three of the four men they believe participated directly in the heist, disguising themselves as construction workers to steal artifacts dating to the Napoleonic era.\n \n\n   \n  Beccuau said the investigation had yet to uncover any of the looted treasures, estimated to be worth  more than $100 million . Experts say the jewels – among them an emerald necklace set with more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife – were likely to be dismantled for their raw materials.\n \n\n   \n  The latest arrests took place Wednesday night in Paris and in the surrounding region, including in Seine-Saint-Denis.\n \n\n   \n  The first two suspects were arrested last weekend, just as one was reported to be trying to flee to Algeria from the Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Those two suspects were placed under formal investigation for organized theft and criminal conspiracy. The pair have  “partially admitted”  their involvement following 96 hours of questioning, Beccuau announced late Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The first suspect, 34, is of Algerian nationality. He had prior records for traffic-related offenses and was identified through DNA recovered from one of the scooters.\n \n\n   \n  The second suspect, 39, is an illegal taxi driver and delivery driver born in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. He was previously known to police for aggravated theft. His DNA was found on glass that had been broken from one of the display cases, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  Police did not immediately provide details about the five new suspects.\n \n\n   \n  The heist has captured the world’s attention and raised uncomfortable questions about security arrangements at France’s most-visited museum. Laurence des Cars, the Louvre’s director, admitted to the French Senate that  no security cameras  were monitoring the second-floor balcony where the thieves broke into the Apollo Gallery using an angle grinder on October 19.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/food-banks-snap-funding-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"Food banks face a ‘perfect storm’ of surging demand as shutdown drags on","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A prolonged government shutdown and the expected suspension of federal food benefits in November have created a 'perfect storm' of demand at food banks across the U.S., with demand doubling in Washington, DC and emergency funds being tapped in Texas.

over the past few weeks, while another in Texas has been forced to dip into emergency hurricane reserve funds to meet demand. Meanwhile, a Florida charity is giving out 300,000 meals per day but, an official there says, “still it’s not enough.”\n \n\n   \n  After a nearly monthlong  government shutdown , the looming  suspension of federal food benefits  in November is poised to put millions of Americans at risk of going hungry — and food banks and other charities across the country face a bleak outlook as they head into a busy holiday season.\n \n\n   \n  More than a dozen large and small charitable nonprofits told CNN they have exceeded their ability to help and warned that the level of support they can provide will fall far short.\n \n\n   \n  “The real impacts are starting now,” said Brian Greene, CEO of Houston Food Bank. “There’s been some uptick, but nowhere near what we’re going to see by the time we get to early November. … it’s going to be unprecedented.”\n \n\n   \n  With Thanksgiving just weeks away, hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay are becoming new faces at food banks and other charities, which are also bracing for more demand as the Trump administration signals that it doesn’t have the funds to provide food stamps to nearly 42 million Americans next month.\n \n\n   \n  Those factors combine to form a “perfect storm” that will push charities past their brink, said Miette Michie, a board member of the Emergency Food Network, which serves parts of central Virginia. The volunteer-based food distribution site has consistently been at capacity since the shutdown began, Michie said — at which point all the volunteers can do is tell people to call back the next day.\n \n\n   \n  “It makes you angry. … You’re messing with people’s lives here,” Michie told CNN. “This is not just a game, it’s actual people, working people, whose lives are being affected by this.”\n \n\n   \n  Dave Silbert, who leads So What Else, a food bank in Washington, DC, told CNN that “it’s brought a level of chaos and uncertainty.”\n \n\n   \n  “How do we expand?” he asked. “How do we go from 450,000 pounds of food to 550 or 600,000 pounds of food a week? How do we go from raising $300,000 a month to $400,000 a month?”\n \n\n   \n    States rush to provide support\n \n\n   \n  States across the country are working to fill the gap on their own.\n \n\n   \n  California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster have deployed their state’s National Guard troops to support food banks, and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican,  has signaled he’s prepared  to do so as well.\n \n\n   \n  New Mexico, Minnesota, Washington and West Virginia have announced millions in funding to support relief programs, while Virginia, home to tens of thousands of federal workers, is setting up its own food-assistance system for residents who receive SNAP benefits. That program is expected to cost $37.5 million a week and can be funded through November from the state’s surplus, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  But not every state is able to match federal funding. Several nonprofit directors told CNN that food banks were always meant to supplement, not replace, federal aid programs and that the timing of this influx of need will only further stretch social safety nets.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in Georgia, for example, receive about $250 million in SNAP benefits monthly. Food banks distribute only about $4.5 million worth of food each month, said Amy Breitmann, the CEO Golden Harvest Food Bank, which serves 24 counties in that state and South Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  “The food bank is supposed to be the safety net underneath SNAP, right?” Breitmann said. “It’s not supposed to replace that.”\n \n\n   \n    Food banks already reeling from federal cuts\n \n\n   \n  The surge in demand at food banks across the country comes months after the Trump administration terminated millions  in funding for a program  that allowed food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Higgerson, Chief Development Officer of Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida, said that there’s been “an erosion of the federal food support,” over the past year. A quarter of the food the Second Harvest Food Bank distributes comes from the Emergency Food Assistance Program, he explained.\n \n\n   \n  Between the shutdown and an already-lost millions of dollars from federal budget cuts this year, the situation is “unprecedented” for the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, a charity that has scrambled to launch pop-up shops in areas with the most SNAP-reliant and federal-worker-heavy communities, said president and CEO Amy Beros. Her group lost $2 million when the local food purchasing program was cut earlier this year and had roughly 80 truckloads cancelled from the Emergency Food Assistance Program.\n \n\n   \n  “We know there’s no way for the food banks to fully fill the gap,” Beros said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/asia/us-north-korea-trump-kim-analysis-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"03:52:00.000Z","title":"Trump Departs Asia Without Meeting Kim Jong Un; North Koreans Don’t Seem to Care","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s 2025 Asia tour, which included stops in Malaysia, Tokyo, and South Korea, concluded without a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, despite public expressions of interest.

North Koreans don’t seem to care \n       \n  Analysis by Will Ripley, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:52 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As President Donald Trump  danced on the tarmac  in Malaysia,  met Japan’s emperor  in Tokyo, and  accepted a gold crown  in South Korea, one key question kept following him – would he hold a surprise meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un?\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions  Trump made public overtures  that he’d “love” to meet Kim while in the region. It could have been a made-for-TV sequel to his  surprise 2019 visit at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) , when Trump made history as the first sitting US president to step foot on North Korean soil.\n \n\n   \n  In the end it never came together. And in Pyongyang, just a few hundred miles away, it was like Trump’s trip never happened.\n \n\n   \n  There were no headlines. No television news reports. No mention of the US president’s offer to “work very hard with Kim Jong Un” to bring peace to the Korean peninsula. Even as Trump’s entourage rolled through Asia and speculation swirled about a possible reunion between the two leaders, North Korean state media stayed silent.\n \n\n   \n  American filmmaker and manager at  Young Pioneer Tours  Justin Martell just returned from an eight-day trip to Pyongyang, where he was attending an international film festival that happened to coincide with much of Trump’s Asia trip.\n \n\n   \n  He said most people he spoke with in Pyongyang didn’t even know Trump was in the region, and none were aware that Trump wanted to meet Kim again.\n \n\n   \n  “They weren’t negative about it,” he told CNN. “They weren’t overly hopeful either. They just kept repeating Kim Jong Un’s recent remarks — that while he has warm memories of President Trump, politics are different from feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  Martell said the tone wasn’t hostile, just detached. “It was more or less, ‘Here’s how we feel right now. If it happens, great. If not, it doesn’t really change much.’”\n \n\n   \n  That matter-of-fact indifference marks a striking change from 2018 and 2019, when Trump’s summits with Kim — first in Singapore, then in Hanoi, and later at the DMZ — gripped both capitals and dominated global headlines.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward to 2025 and Trump’s overtures barely registered. But there’s good reason for that.\n \n\n   \n  Only last month Kim stood side-by-side with China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin in the heart of Beijing at a historic military parade in an unprecedented and  historic show of unity  against the West.\n \n\n   \n  Kim now has Moscow for weapons deals and oil, Beijing for trade, and a domestic narrative of resilience under sanctions and  heroism on the battlefield in Ukraine .\n \n\n   \n  Frankly, a handshake with the US president no longer carries the weight it once did.\n \n\n   \n    Why the meeting didn’t happen\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the missed meeting with Kim was  “a matter of timing.” \n \n\n   \n  “We never were able to talk because… look I was so busy,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Thursday after departing South Korea and ending his Asia tour.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was also away on a diplomatic mission of her own this week. She first flew to Russia for a  meeting with Putin  to discuss strengthening ties before speaking at an international forum in Belarus.\n \n\n   \n  That made it logistically impossible for North Korea’s top diplomat to help arrange any last-minute meeting between Kim and Trump  as she did in 2019 , when Choe helped pull together the DMZ meeting just hours after  Trump posted on social media  he wanted to meet Kim.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, North Korea test-fired cruise missiles to the west of the Korean peninsula ahead of Trump’s visit, during which he held a summit with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung.\n \n\n   \n  But as Martell’s conversations in Pyongyang suggest, timing may be only part of the story. North Korea simply may no longer feel strongly compelled to say yes.\n \n\n   \n  Kim has made his terms clear: he’ll meet Trump only if Washington abandons what he calls its  “absurd obsession” with denuclearization . In a September speech, he said he still has “fond memories” of Trump, but that his country “will never trade away nuclear weapons to be free of sanctions.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words, the deal Trump offered six years ago – trading sanctions relief for disarmament – is no longer on the table. North Korea wants to be recognized as a nuclear-armed state.\n \n\n   \n  What Martell saw in Pyongyang underscores why.\n \n\n   \n  The North Korean elite in Pyongyang – whose support is crucial to maintaining national stability, despite Kim’s near-absolute power – appear to be enjoying a higher living standard than previously, with more access to modern technology and amenities. For the elite, at least, sanctions have done little to dent their lives.\n \n\n   \n  Even South Korea’s President Lee seems to recognize the challenges in bringing Kim to the table.\n \n\n   \n   In an interview with me this week , Lee said he hopes Trump can act as a “peacemaker,” while Seoul plays “pacemaker” — creating the conditions for dialogue that remain “difficult” to achieve directly. “If the two leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together,” Lee said, “we would welcome such engagement.”\n \n\n   \n    High-rises and traffic jams in ‘Pyonghattan’\n \n\n   \n  Martell had not been to Pyongyang since 2017. The capital’s development over the past eight years, despite sanctions and the extreme isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, stunned him.\n \n\n   \n  “It used to feel much less developed compared to others in the region,” he said. “Now, honestly, Pyongyang feels very much like a modern city.”\n \n\n   \n  He described futuristic high-rises, residents paying with QR codes, new domestic apps for ordering taxis and food, and social media.\n \n\n   \n  “What used to take twenty minutes now takes forty,” he said, referring to the traffic. “We kept joking with our Korean guides that it was Pyonghattan” because it has developed so much.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the capital’s new Hwasong district, he dined at sleek restaurants offering both Asian and Western menus, with high-end liquor on display. He says all the restaurants were full of locals dining when he visited.\n \n\n   \n  Private car ownership was once rare and politically sensitive. Now, it’s common enough to cause occasional traffic jams in busy areas. “There seems to be a burgeoning middle class now,” Martell said.\n \n\n   \n  Even outside the capital, he saw evidence of growth.

\n\n   \n  Both suspects were presented before an investigative judge on Wednesday and placed under formal investigation for organized theft and criminal conspiracy, according to Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau. The pair had “partially admitted” their involvement under questioning, she said.\n \n\n   \n  The heist – a brazen, seven-minute daylight raid on the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery – captured the world’s attention after thieves escaped with jewels worth tens of millions.\n \n\n   \n  The two men were arrested Saturday evening and held in custody, where they were questioned for 96 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Police arrested a third suspect in the Paris region on Wednesday evening, CNN affiliate BFM TV reported on Thursday, citing sources. That suspect was in police custody, the report said.\n \n\n   \n  The first suspect, 34, is of Algerian nationality. He had prior records for traffic-related offenses and was identified through DNA recovered from one of the scooters.\n \n\n   \n  The second suspect, 39, is an illegal taxi driver and delivery driver born in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. He was previously known to police for aggravated theft. His DNA was found on glass that had been broken from one of the display cases, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  “There is nothing to suggest that the four perpetrators benefited from any form of inside help within the museum,” Beccuau. said in a Wednesday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  The crime of theft as part of an organized gang carries a potential 15-year prison sentence and a heavy fine, the prosecutor said.\n \n\n   \n  More than 100 investigators have been involved in the manhunt, and authorities were able to track down the individuals after analyzing more than 150 DNA samples and examining several items the group left behind, such as gloves, a helmet and high-vis jackets left at the scene.\n \n\n   \n  One of the men was arrested at Charles de Gaulle Airport as he attempted to leave the country. He was stopped during a passport check before he could board an evening flight to Algeria.\n \n\n   \n  The stolen jewels – among them an emerald necklace set with more than 1,000 diamonds gifted by Napoleon to his second wife – were not recovered during the arrests.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves raided the Apollo Gallery on the Louvre’s upper floor, which houses the French Crown Jewels, on October 19. They used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the museum, through a window. They broke into two high-security display cases and made off with nine items, including a diamond and sapphire jewelry set worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The jewelry taken from the museum is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million).\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to keep the hope that they will be found and could be returned to the Louvre museum and the nation,” Beccuau added. “These jewels are now unsellable.

whether SNAP benefits can be cut off on Saturday \n         By Tovia Smith \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 3:29 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         BOSTON — A federal judge indicated Thursday she is inclined to take steps to ensure that  federal food assistance  keeps flowing to 42 million Americans who depend on it. Trump administration officials say because of the government shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, will be cut off on Saturday.  \"The well has run dry,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, posted on  its website . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Democratic governors and attorneys general from some two dozen states  sued the federal government  to keep the payments coming, arguing SNAP benefits are an entitlement that cannot legally be cut off. They also make the case that stopping benefits would cause irreparable harm to millions of Americans, and to the state governments who will be left to deal with the fallout. The Trump administration had argued the opposite; officials say they are legally  prohibited  from extending the benefits by using emergency funds. But after an hour of arguments in Boston federal court Thursday, Judge Indira Talwani wasn't buying it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Congress put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency,\" Talwani said. \"It's really clear to me that what Congress was trying to do was protect the American people,\" she said, and she believes it was lawmakers intent to ensure that in the event of something like a shutdown, \"we're not going to make everyone drop dead because it's a political game someplace else.\" Even if the emergency fund is tapped for SNAP benefits, administration officials say its $5.5 billion falls short of the $9 billion needed to fully cover the whole month of November. They say recalculating benefits and arranging for partial payments would be a logistical nightmare — and could take weeks. That means millions of Americans would still see some delay in receiving their next benefit, and they would also be receiving less than usual. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/feathers-fashion-runway-shows","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"08:48:00-04:00","title":"The plume boom: Feathers are coming for your spring wardrobes","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the resurgence of bird feathers in fashion, tracing their historical roots from ancient Egypt to modern runway shows.

Black feathers spilling out the front of a beige car coat at Brandon Maxwell. An Altuzarra knit two-piece that made its wearer look like they had been tarred and feathered, but beautifully rather than as some heinous ancient punishment. A strapless gown that appeared cloud-like through rows and rows of delicate white plumes at Prabal Gurung.\n \n\n   \n  The London shows were in on the game too — the cascading, multi-colored plumage of a Roksanda evening gown, or feral, feather-stuffed Converse high tops at Oscar Ouyang. In  Paris , designers moved with the synchronization of a swallow murmuration. Pierpaolo Piccoli’s proposition for Balenciaga rested on feather-work: There was the full, plume-covered maxi skirt paired with a casual T-shirt, since worn in the wild by Elle Fanning, as well as a number of boxy dresses finished with delicate feather trims.\n \n\n   \n  For Chanel,  Matthieu Blazy  set its specialist atelier Maison Lemarié on the task of creating feather Camellias, headpieces, earrings and large skirts. At Victoria Beckham the dresses were smaller, but no less quilled. Even The Row, the cult favorite of every millennial minimalist, dipped its toe into the showy textile with mid-length skirts that were given a feathery facade. Stella McCartney, fashion’s stalwart eco-warrior, joined in too with the invention of the world’s first plant-based alternative to feathers.\n \n\n   \n  There was Big Bird Energy all over the runways this season. But how did bird feathers become a symbol of luxury in the first place?\n \n\n   \n  Plumage has been in fashion since ancient Egypt, when ostrich feathers were used to decorate fans and even appeared in hieroglyphics. In Babylonian and Assyrian artworks, too, feathers are often seen covering the bodies of deities or embellishing royal crowns.\n \n\n   \n  Around the mid-1500s, feathers entered the wardrobes of real people, at least in the UK. “That’s when they start to be worn specifically for fashionable reasons,” said Dr. Elisabeth Gernerd — a fashion historian and professor at De Montfort University in England. The ever-practical Brits worked with what they had to hand; attaching goose, chicken and egrets feathers that had been sterilized in chalk and sulfur to hats and fans. But while the material was fairly common, working people often reserved it for more everyday tools like making brooms or bedding.\n \n\n   \n   18th century trend-setter Marie Antoinette  popularized the style of having large, stately plumes — usually ostrich, the most prominent feather globally traded — erupting from a tower of hair. So giant were these headpieces, newspapers at the time often wrote salaciously about whose feathers caught fire from a candlelight at which ball. But it wasn’t until the 19th century, as the British Empire expanded and global trade routes became more established, that the “feather craze” reached its peak, according to Gernerd.\n \n\n   \n  Birds of paradise from islands such as New Guinea were hunted and skinned, then exported to Europe and the US, where they were sold to milliners at auctions in London, Paris and Amsterdam. Their exotic feathers became associated with a new level of luxury and access. “In the 19th century, the Empire was in fashion and feathers are a way to display that fashion,” said Gernerd. “You’re wearing something that has travelled thousands of miles to get to you. You’re a symbol of growing Imperialism and trade.”\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t just the odd plume, either. Entire hummingbirds were taxidermied and mounted on circular, feathered fans in the 1870s; while larger preserved birds adorned velvet bonnets. By the 1900s, millions of birds had been killed for the feather trade, threatening the extinction of several species. Demand was so high, the millinery industry was even pricing out American ornithologists from buying specimens for scientific research. When the Titanic sank in 1912, one of the most valuable commodities onboard was a container of ostrich feathers being shipped to New York. “They were insured for around $2.3 million in today’s money,” Gernerd said. “They were worth essentially as much as diamonds.”\n \n\n   \n  But the style wasn’t universally accepted, and some campaigned against the mass slaughtering of the endangered animals. Harriet Hemenway and Minna B. Hall, two Boston socialites, turned against the fashion of their peers — launching a series of tea parties to attempt to dissuade other high-society women from wearing feathers. They founded the Audubon Society, an environmental conservation group, in 1905 — managing to influence state laws, such as the 1910 Audubon Plumage Law which prohibited the sale or possession of feathers from protected birds in New York State. By 1918, they had their first major victory: the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a federal law that made it illegal to hunt, capture or sell any migratory bird. In 1921, the UK passed its own anti-plumage legislation which outlawed the importing of exotic birds for fashion. But frustratingly for activists, ostrich — one of the most prominently used feathers in the fashion industry today because of their unique individual filaments and diffused softness — were exempt from conservation laws, according to Gernerd, since their feathers can technically be harvested without killing or skinning the animal.\n \n\n   \n    Are feathers the new fur?\n \n\n   \n  Today, many fashion designers such as Donatella Versace, John Galliano and the late Giorgio Armani, have openly rejected the use of fur after decades of animal welfare campaigns — while luxury brands such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada and Burberry have also committed to going fur-free. Earlier this year Conde Nast  announced  it will no longer feature new animal fur in editorial content or advertizing across its numerous publications. But could the success of the anti-fur movement be fueling a plume boom?\n \n\n   \n  “Fashion designers are definitely using ostrich feathers as an alternative to fur, but it’s an ill informed decision to do so,” said Emma Håkansson, founder of ethical fashion activist group Collective Fashion Justice, in a phone interview. “Because we don’t want to kill animals specifically for fashion, we’re just replicating that same problem with a different species here.” Despite the fact ostrich feathers can be harvested without slaughtering, Collective Fashion Justice  published research  in 2023 that found all ostrich feather production systems ultimately kill the bird.\n \n\n   \n  It was Håkansson and her team who worked with Copenhagen Fashion Week to ban all wildlife materials on its runways in 2024, and who convinced the British Fashion Council to prohibit the use of fur and exotic animal skins later that year. Currently they are lobbying organizers at New York, Paris and Milan to commit to similar bans, and Håkansson is “hopeful” that their dialogue will lead to action.\n \n\n   \n  But change needs innovation, as well as restriction, to stick. One of the most feather-filled shows of the Spring-Summer 2026 season came from Stella McCartney. According to the fashion house, the plant-based “Fevvers” used to adorn dresses are the world’s “first ethical alternative” to bird feathers. Inventors Nicola Woollon and James West, who have protected the technology with a strict Non Disclosure Agreement, used Stella McCartney’s runway as a proof of concept. The idea, they told CNN, only took a few intense months of development.\n \n\n   \n  “With so many brands trying to move beyond animal-derived materials, it felt like the right moment to reimagine something so loaded with history and emotion,” Woollen told CNN in an email. “The conversation around materials has mostly focused on leather and fur. Feathers slipped through the next, and we wanted to change that,” West added.\n \n\n   \n  Their first foray into faux feathers took inspiration from ostrich — the final frontier animal campaigners couldn’t restrict over 100 years ago. “Ostrich feathers are the ones most associated with couture and cruelty in equal measure. We wanted to reclaim that form and give it new meaning,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the feather-filled runways of the latest season, it’s developments like Fevvers that keep Håkansson going. “What I hope people come to realize is that having policies in place that make fashion more ethical and sustainable is not restrictive of creativity,” she said. “It actually helps to produce more of it, because you have to think outside the box a bit more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/redistricting-rebellion-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00Z","title":"Both Democratic and GOP-led states are starting to rebel against the national redistricting push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details a growing political arms race over redistricting across multiple U.S. states, driven by national political pressure—especially from former President Donald Trump's campaign—which is pushing both Democrats and Republicans to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Democratic and GOP-led states are starting to rebel against the national redistricting push \n       \n  By Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  National political leaders are making frantic, last-ditch efforts in multiple states to  redraw more US House districts  ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  But their ambitions face big political and procedural obstacles and in some cases, open rebellion from state lawmakers pushing back against pressure from the top leaders in their own parties.\n \n\n   \n  Consider Kansas, where Republican lawmakers are trying to force a special session and join the wave of states undertaking once-rare, mid-decade redistricting to gain an edge in the 2026 congressional elections. GOP leaders this week were working to secure the signatures from two-thirds of lawmakers in both chambers needed to bypass the state’s Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and proceed. On the line: the US House seat currently held by four-term Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s terrible for democracy,” said Kansas state Rep. Mark Schreiber, one of the remaining Republican holdouts, in an interview with CNN. “It’s fairly simple: Redistricting was meant to accommodate changes in the population, based on the decennial census, and that’s it.”\n \n\n   \n  “This mid-cycle redistricting is being done only for political purposes, in this case to maintain a Republican majority in the US House,” Schreiber added. “I don’t think that’s an appropriate use.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also have faced resistance as they ramp up their redistricting campaign. In Maryland, for instance, a top Democratic lawmaker has balked at taking up map-drawing, warning it will only escalate the ongoing redistricting arms race and help Republicans in the end. National Democrats are seeking changes to maps in at least three other states: New York, Virginia and Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections. If Democrats gain three seats next year, they will win the House and obtain the power to block parts of President Donald Trump’s agenda. But Republicans have more opportunities than Democrats do to shape the election outcome through congressional mapmaking.\n \n\n   \n  So far, GOP lawmakers have redrawn seats in three states – Texas, Missouri and North Carolina – to add a  total of seven potential seats  to the Republican column.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the Democrats’ push\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s political operation instigated the political arms race this year when they persuaded Texas to undertake redistricting and create five additional GOP-friendly seats. Next week, California voters will decide whether to counter that and  approve five additional Democratic-friendly seats , representing the largest tranche of seats Democrats can secure through a map change in a single state.\n \n\n   \n  The states now eyeing new maps represent “the third-tier opportunities for redistricting,” said Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor of Inside Elections, an independent political newsletter. But, he said, “in order to squeeze an advantage, you have to go piecemeal once you get beyond the big hitters. For Democrats, especially, California is all they have.”\n \n\n   \n  Virginia, a purple state where Democrats hold the majorities in both chambers of the legislature, is potentially the biggest remaining redistricting prize for the party. Democrats currently hold six of the state’s 11 seats in the US House, and an aggressive map redraw could potentially give the party nine or 10 seats.\n \n\n   \n  But it will take a monthslong effort to get there as lawmakers tackle multiple hurdles to bypass the redistricting process the state established five years ago. Under current law, the power to redistrict rests with a bipartisan redistricting commission created by voters through a constitutional amendment.\n \n\n   \n  First, Democrats must pass language to amend the state constitution before Tuesday’s elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. Then, it must be approved again next year in a second legislative session before voters have their say in a statewide referendum.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Republicans have signaled that they intend to mount legal challenges to any action by the legislature, arguing that Democrats already have run afoul of a requirement to pass the proposed constitutional amendment before the election since early voting is underway.\n \n\n   \n  The US House’s top Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is working to persuade Illinois lawmakers to eke out an additional seat there, despite objections from the head of the state Senate’s Black caucus. In Jeffries’ home state of New York, a  new lawsuit  by a leading Democratic-aligned elections firm takes aim at the sole Republican-held seat in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  After meeting with Jeffries this week, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch said in a statement that “all options must remain on the table to protect our democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  But at least one Democrat in the state – state Sen. Willie Preston, who heads the Black caucus in his chamber – has opposed it, arguing the new map risks diluting Black political power in the state. Preston is running for a US House seat now held by Rep. Robin Kelly. Kelly is running for an open US Senate seat to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.\n \n\n   \n  “Black Democrats have given our all to our party - the answer to fighting back against Trump’s efforts to crush Black political power cannot be diluting Black political power,” Preston said in statement.\n \n\n   \n  In deep-blue Maryland, the state Senate President William Ferguson has publicly opposed map-drawing targeting the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation. But other Democrats, including Jeffries, insisted Wednesday that redistricting remains a viable option in the state.\n \n\n   \n    Rare GOP resistance to Trump\n \n\n   \n  For Republicans, the most immediate battleground is Indiana, where GOP Gov. Mike Braun has announced a special legislative session starting next week to tackle a redistricting plan that could possibly yield two more seats for his party – although it’s uncertain that the plan has enough support among Republicans in the state Senate majority to succeed.\n \n\n   \n  Some Indiana Republicans have been among those resisting Trump’s moves, despite significant lobbying by the president and two visits to the state by Vice President JD Vance. Braun, a staunch Trump ally, has called legislators back to the statehouse to start working on a redraw next week.\n \n\n   \n  But on the same day that Braun announced the legislative session, Molly Swigart, a spokeswoman for the top Republican in the state Senate, said there still were not enough Republican votes to support redistricting in that chamber.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Wednesday for an update, Swigart   responded: “I do not have anything new to share.”\n \n\n   \n  Prominent Republicans in the state, including former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, have opposed the redistricting. Under the current map, the GOP holds seven of the state’s nine US House seats.\n \n\n   \n  In a  recent Washington Post column , Daniels said the current map is fair and urged Republicans in the Hoosier State to continue to resist. “Someone has to lead in climbing out of this mudhole,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “We generally pride ourselves in doing what’s right, not what’s easy,” Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and former Indiana lawmaker, told CNN. “We take our time. We weigh things.”\n \n\n   \n  In another Republican-controlled state, Louisiana lawmakers this week took steps that could give their party an edge next year. Legislators voted to delay the state’s 2026 primary elections by a month to give them more time to draw new congressional lines if the US Supreme Court decides a redistricting case in the state’s favor.\n \n\n   \n    ‘An incredible Pandora’s box’\n \n\n   \n  While Republicans have structural advantages that allow them to rack up more seats through redistricting than Democrats can, Rubashkin of Inside Elections said the final outcome of the ongoing redistricting battle is unclear, particularly if next year becomes a wave election for Democrats, akin to 2018 midterm elections when the party gained more than 40 House seats during Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  “If the partisan, national environment is favorable enough to one party or the other, you cannot redistrict your way into the majority,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  However, Rubashkin added, the redistricting push now underway likely has changed US politics, by opening “an incredible Pandora’s box … that will persist long after this election cycle. I don’t see what will stop states that have the capacity from simply redrawing every two years.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-95763","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-04:00","title":"What has 11 questions and makes you feel smart?

young voters, who see no political fix \n         By Elena Moore, Rahul Mukherjee, Anusha Mathur \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         For many young voters, the future doesn't feel quite so bright. Gen Z and millennial Americans are feeling increasingly demoralized about their economic prospects, and some say their concerns have gone unaddressed by elected officials. In communities of all kinds, voters in their 20s and 30s are confronting a financial reality of rising costs, mounting debt and minimal wage growth. But how is this changing their political views? It's a question that NPR  put to readers . We received more than 1,100 submissions from across the political spectrum from almost every state in the U.S. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many described a similar reality — one where economic worries loom large over their everyday lives and erode their faith in the ability of those in power. Taken together, their responses paint a portrait of a generation of voters discouraged by what they see in Washington and who increasingly feel as if they have no political home. It is important to note that the responses are not from a representative sample of all young voters. But what readers shared helps highlight a steep challenge facing Democrats and Republicans alike as they work to win over these voters, who are collectively expected to make up  more than half the electorate in 2028 . Here is a snapshot of what readers shared.  These responses have been edited for clarity and length. Young voters are united in disappointment  Many young Americans feel a collective sense of disillusionment in the political system, and respondents told NPR that their financial struggles are exacerbating that pain. Recent polling seems to underscore the frustrations many shared with NPR. Just a fraction of young voters feel confident in government institutions, with less than 2 in 10 of those 18 to 29 years old saying they trust the federal government to do the right thing most or all of the time, according to the latest  Harvard Youth Poll , from this spring. Similarly, only 16% of those under 30 believe democracy is working well for them,  according to a report  from the young voter research organization, CIRCLE. Their life goals are on hold — for some indefinitely  Young people shared that one of the biggest drivers feeding into their sense of political frustration is the struggle to get ahead financially or even just stay afloat. When asked what economic success looks like for them, respondents didn't want lavish mansions or high-priced sports cars. Instead, their ambitions were more modest, often centering on the need for financial stability. Yet even that felt out of reach for many. Young Americans said goals like owning a home, starting a family or pursuing a dream job feel increasingly like a luxury rather than an achievable milestone. Financial concerns are forcing them to reframe what's possible and sometimes choose one goal over another. Financial roadblocks standing in the way  Many are navigating a unique economic moment where both median home and rental prices, for example, have  risen at a faster pace than wages  for roughly two decades. People are also waiting longer to buy homes. The median age of a first-time homebuyer in 2024 stood at 38, 10 years older than in the early 1990s,  according to the National Association of Realtors . Debt is also a barrier. Despite collectively making up the  largest share of the labor force  and being on track to surpass older generations in  educational attainment , Generation Z and millennials have  higher rates of student loan debt  and more  mortgage debt . Family planning looks different as well. People are deciding to have  fewer children  or not start a family. Last year, the U.S. fertility rate hit a  record low , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They watched their parents succeed, but struggle themselves In the face of financial challenges, respondents say they're struggling to reach or build upon the lifestyle achieved by their parents and grandparents, making some feel less hopeful about the future. Even with hard work and a degree, many readers said they have accomplished less than their parents had by the same age. This has led many to feel disillusioned with, even betrayed by, the very system that promised to set them up for success and stability. Despite losing faith in most politicians, populism resonates Young Americans see very few politicians actively addressing their concerns around affordability, leading some to lose faith in the effectiveness of either major political party. \"Over time, I've come to see our two-party system as two wings on the same bird,\" explained 27-year-old respondent Sophie Howard, from Davenport, Iowa. When asked which politicians are speaking to their concerns, liberal-leaning respondents frequently highlighted progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats' nominee for mayor in New York City. Readers on the conservative side often coalesced around President Trump and Vice President Vance. Many respondents returned to the same point: that they're most inspired by populist-style leaders who focus on disrupting the status quo. It's a message that young people say goes past political labels, pushing some to opposite poles on the ideological spectrum and leaving others feeling stuck in the middle. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591978","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-04:00","title":"Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is urging the Senate to eliminate the filibuster to allow Republicans to bypass Democratic opposition and end a 30-day government shutdown.

Press \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 2:59 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government. \"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE 'NUCLEAR OPTION,' GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,\" Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The filibuster is a long-standing tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began. Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday. Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government. His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight. Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill. \"People are stressing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce. \"We are well past time to have this behind us.\" While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry. Money for military, but not food aid The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program. At the same time, many Americans who purchase their own health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces, with open enrollment also beginning Saturday, are experiencing sticker shock as premium prices jump. \"We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,\" said Rev. Ryan Stoess, during a prayer with religious leaders at the U.S. Capitol. \"God help us,\" he said, \"when the cruelty is the point.\" Deadlines shift to next week The House remains closed down under Johnson for the past month. Senators are preparing to depart Thursday for the long weekend. Trump returns late Thursday after a whirlwind tour of Asia. That means the shutdown, in its 30th day, appears likely to stretch into another week if the filibuster remains. If the shutdown continues, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections — the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal. \"I hope that it frees people up to move forward with opening the government,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. GOP cut SNAP in Trump's big bill The Republicans, who have majority control of Congress, find themselves in an unusual position, defending the furloughed federal workers and shuttered programs they have long sought to cut — including most recently with nearly $1 trillion in reductions in Trump's big tax breaks and spending bill. Medicaid, the health care program, and SNAP food aid, suffered sizable blows this summer, in part by imposing new work requirements. For SNAP recipients, many of whom were already required to work, the new requirements extend to older Americans up to age 64 and parents of older school-age children. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans now \"have the nerve\" to suggest it's a political strategy to withhold food aid. \"We are trying to lift up the quality of life for the American people,\" Jeffries of New York said about his party. \"The American people understand that there's a Republican health care crisis,\" he said. \"The American people understand Republicans enacted the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history when they cut $186 billion from their one, big, ugly bill.\" During the summer debate over Trump's big bill, Johnson and other Republicans railed against what they characterized as lazy Americans, riding what the House speaker calls the \"gravy train\" of government benefits. The speaker spoke about able-bodied young men playing video games while receiving Medicaid health care benefits and insisted the new work requirements for the aid programs would weed out what they called \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" \"What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said in spring on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all,\" he said. What remains out of reach, for now, is any relief from the new health care prices, posted this week, that are expected to put insurance out of reach for many Americans when federal subsidies that help offset those costs are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats have been holding out for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans to keep those subsidies in place. Republicans say they can address the issue later, once the government reopens. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1132016606","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00.000Z","title":"The Digital Shift: How Social Media is Reshaping Society and Culture","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article examines how the rise of social media has led to significant changes in cultural practices and traditional community structures.

It calls for awareness and intentional efforts to preserve the integrity of traditional social frameworks in an increasingly digital world.","keyTakeAways":["The article highlights the growing influence of social media on cultural practices and societal norms.","It discusses the role of technology in reshaping traditional community structures.","The importance of balancing digital connectivity with face-to-face interactions is emphasized."],"namedEntities":[{"name":"Social media","whatIsThisEntity":"A platform that allows users to share content, communicate, and build communities online","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Central to the discussion on cultural changes and community dynamics."},{"name":"Traditional communities","whatIsThisEntity":"Groups of people who maintain established social, cultural, and sometimes religious practices","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Contrasted with digital communities to illustrate shifts in social structures."},{"name":"Technology","whatIsThisEntity":"Instruments and systems used to process information and enable communication","whyIsThisEntityRelevantToTheArticle":"Primary driver of cultural and societal transformation discussed in the article."}],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Social media","Cultural change","Community structure","Digital connectivity","Face-to-face interaction","Technology impact","Societal norms"],"content":"\n         3 personal safety tips to help you protect yourself on a night out \n         By Michelle Aslam, Audrey Nguyen \n        \n           Updated Monday, October 31, 2022 • 12:17 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It can be fun to go out on the town at night — to clubs, restaurants, bars and concerts. But for me and my friends, who are mostly women in our early 20s, it can also be scary.  Most of us have been catcalled on the street while walking home, grabbed at while moving through a crowd or pressured into having another drink or staying out later than we'd like. Because of concerns like these, it can be hard to enjoy going out. In fact, studies have shown that popular nightlife destinations like bars and clubs aren't the safest places to hang — especially for women and girls. According to  a 2017 study  published in the journal  Violence Against Women , this group frequently experiences unwanted sexual touching and persistent advances in these settings.  The burden shouldn't be on people like me, my friends and others in marginalized communities to protect ourselves — but depending on who you are and what you've experienced, you might feel like you don't have much of a choice. So what can we do to have a safer time out?  I reached out to health and safety educator  Karen Hughes  at the University of California, Berkeley, and Michelle and Zelda Gay, a mother-daughter duo who runs the personal safety group  Self-Offense , for advice. They say there are practical ways for people to reclaim control and minimize harm in these environments. And it starts with thinking about your well-being and security before you even step out of the house.  Here are their top three tips, which they say are helpful not just for marginalized folks, but for everyone.  Create a safety plan before the night begins For most people, the goal when going out is to have a nice time and prevent negative experiences, says Hughes. So take a moment to think about how to do that.   Reflect on previous nights out. What strategies helped you feel safe? Maybe you asked your bestie to join you on an outing with new friends. Or perhaps you took a taxi home late at night instead of waiting for the bus.   What did you regret the next day? If you went out with someone who ditched you minutes after getting to the venue, for example, you might consider not going out with her again — or inviting a trusted friend to tag along.  If you are planning on drinking or using drugs, Hughes says, ask yourself: what is your limit? Make sure you're sober enough to be aware of your surroundings and safety risks at all times. And if you're not partaking in these activities, that's totally OK — you can enjoy a night out sober, so ignore people who might try to tell you otherwise.  After considering these questions, create a personal safety plan, says Hughes. Do it before the night begins when you have a clear mind. And make your plan as specific as possible. You might say to yourself: \"Tonight, I am going to take a taxi home before midnight. I am not going to have more than two cocktails. And I will not go out alone with that friend who ditched me if she asks to hang out again.\"   It can be hard to stay true to these commitments, says Hughes, especially if friends beg you to stay out longer or have more drinks than you planned for. But try to find practical and creative ways to follow through. Make it convenient to stick to your curfew, for instance, by scheduling a ride share home in advance. Or make plans early the next morning as an extra incentive to go home at a reasonable hour.  \"Respect your earlier, more mindful self,\" says Hughes, and \"remember there was a reason [why you made those choices].\" Communicate confidence with your body language You might have seen those viral self-defense videos on TikTok, where people demonstrate how to escape choke holds or explain how to free your hands if they're bound by zip ties. Zelda and Michelle, who teach workshops on safety, sexual harassment and conflict de-esclation, say these strategies may not be helpful in a real-life scenario. If you're not comfortable with the maneuvers and haven't practiced them enough, they add, you may find yourself freezing up in the moment and putting yourself in harm's way.  An alternative approach to staying safe, say Zelda and Michelle, is to communicate alertness and confidence with your body language.  First, pay attention to your surroundings. When walking home alone late at night, your instinct might be to avoid making eye contact with passersby. But Zelda and Michelle say that can make you look like an easy target for harassment because you don't seem to be aware of your environment.  Instead, they say, actively look around and occasionally behind you. Is there anything that is making you feel nervous or unsafe? If something bad happens, are there any potential allies nearby who might be able to jump in and help? Michelle says making brief eye contact with passersby can communicate confidence and potentially deter someone who might otherwise try to bother you. Another tip is to project an air of self-assurance, say Zelda and Michelle. If you're waiting at a bus stop, for example, don't slouch over your phone — stand straight and be vigilant of your situation. When you're walking, look as though you have a clear destination in mind. If you don't know where you're going — let's say you're looking for your venue or your ride share pickup — focus on a fixed point ahead and walk toward it with purpose. These moves, says Zelda, \"read as confident,\" and can make people think twice before approaching or harassing you.  Learn how to say 'no' effectively If someone is harassing you in public, say, catcalling you on the street, you might want to turn around and tell them off. But sometimes, the safest course of action is to walk away, says Michelle. When people feel humiliated or shamed in public, she adds, they can get more aggressive — and the situation could further escalate and put you in a dangerous position. If you can't walk away — maybe a person has cornered you at a bar and is repeatedly asking to buy you a drink — Michelle suggests a kind but persistent \"no, but thank you,\" to communicate your message as clearly as possible and avoid a potentially aggressive outburst.  You can also help avoid this situation by trying a non-verbal tactic. Hughes says to hold a drink in your hand — even if it's a Shirley Temple or a diet Pepsi — to signal that you are not in need of a drink because you already have one.  And remember, says Zelda: our relationship to \"no\" has a lot to do with our gender. Men are often encouraged to be persistent and aggressive to get what they want. And women are conditioned to acquiesce and get along with everyone. That dynamic — especially in an environment where people are drinking and can be more uninhibited or vulnerable — is a recipe for disaster. Learning to say and respect \"no\" is an important practice to communicate your boundaries on a night out.  The audio portion of this episode was produced by Audrey Nguyen.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MICHELLE ASLAM, HOST:   Just a heads up - this episode contains discussion about sexual harassment and assault. I moved to a new city recently, and I've been super lucky to find a great group of friends here. We hit it off almost immediately, and we've been getting together almost every weekend since. There's a lot to do in the city at night - restaurants, bars, music events, comedy clubs, bowling. We were having a conversation over dinner recently, coming up with new places we could go, fun activities to try. A conversation that should have been light and fun got kind of intense. We ended up talking about all of these bad experiences we've had with nightlife - getting harassed on the bus at night, someone getting handsy in a crowd, friends that pressure you into situations that you're uncomfortable with, even assault. Everyone had a different story, and if it wasn't something that happened to them, it's something that they witnessed or that happened to a friend. I started thinking about how hard it can be to enjoy your night when you're carrying around all of these very real and legitimate anxieties about keeping you and your friends safe at the same time. It's not fair, and the burden shouldn't lie on you to keep yourself safe. But depending on who you are and what you've experienced, you might not feel like you have much of a choice. ZELDA GAY: There are folks who live like they are under attack at all times. And that's valid, especially for folks who are in marginalized communities 'cause there is statistical evidence that someone is trying to harm you. ASLAM: I'm Michelle Aslam, a producer for LIFE KIT. This episode is not going to prevent you from running into trouble. And it's not an exhaustive resource on safety. Instead, we're turning to the experts for some tips and strategies to reclaim some control over your night out, whatever you want it to look like. Think of it like a pregame. Z GAY: There's pregaming with booze. And then there's pregaming with safety. ASLAM: Stick around. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ASLAM: Let's jump right into takeaway one. Before you head out the door, have a game plan. I'm sure you're eager to get out there, but you want to think things through before you commit, or you might find yourself in an unexpected situation. So first, take a minute to check in with yourself. KAREN HUGHES: Take the time to reflect on previous experiences. What worked? What didn't work? What do you want to find out more about before you get ready to go out tonight? Most importantly, what do you want to get out of this experience? Socially, emotionally, physically, what do you and don't you want to get out of it? ASLAM: Karen Hughes is a health educator at UC Berkeley. She put together a collection of tips and strategies for her students over the years that takes a harm reduction approach to safety. HUGHES: So harm reduction is really about getting what you want out of any experience without what you don't want out of any experience. So you can - and many of us do - take a harm reduction approach to life in general. ASLAM: So that means she's not going to spend time lecturing you about the right or wrong way to have fun. That's your decision and not what this episode is about. Instead, her advice focuses on how to keep everyone safe. And that starts with some introspection. Once you have some clarity about what you want to do, draw some lines in the sand for yourself. Are you committed to staying sober tonight? If so, are you comfortable being around drugs or alcohol? If you are planning on using or drinking, how much is too much for you? In the heat of the moment, it can be easy to brush off commitments you made before the night started, so think of ways to hold yourself to them. For example, if you want to be home by a certain time, Karen says it might be a good idea to schedule your ride home before you even head out. HUGHES: It might be hard at that moment that evening to realize it's the time that you had pre-set to exit, but respect your earlier self, respect your mindful self. There was a reason. And go with it. ASLAM: Next, make sure everyone in the group is on the same page. This can also be a good way to learn what everyone is looking for tonight and stick to a mutually agreed on plan. Ask your friends, how is everyone getting home at the end of the night? What happens if someone in the group wants to stay behind by themselves? Or what if someone's drunk and wants to go home with a stranger? If plans aren't lining up with what you've decided that you want for yourself, it's OK to sit this one out. FOMO is a real thing, but a night out turning into a nightmare is also a very real possibility. And then there are the basics. So charge your phone and consider bringing a charger along with you. Drink lots of water. And maybe swap emergency contact info. It can be helpful to have a roommate's phone number in case you have to check in to make sure your friend made it home safe at the end of the night. Next, getting safely to your destination. Whether you're going out to meet a hinge match for a nice dinner date, going to a concert or planning on a night of dancing with the girlies, there's a lot that can go through your head when you're walking around at night, especially if you're alone. We've all seen the TikToks with the complicated self-defense choreography, videos about how to get out of zip ties or escape a choke hold. And while holding your keys between your fingers like a weapon might make you feel like you have some power over a scary situation, for most of us, none of that is going to do much in a real scenario for a lot of reasons. Z GAY: Many people - when we imagine self-defense, it's like we freeze. MICHELLE GAY: Where the real progress is going to be made is in that space that precedes an attack. ASLAM: That was Michelle and Zelda Gay. They're a mother-daughter duo who teach workshops on personal safety. But they're not here to tell you how to fight your way out of trouble, because let's be honest - most of us are probably not going to karate chop our way out of being harassed in the middle of a street. Here's Zelda again. Z GAY: The other thing we want to say is like, we do not want you walking around in life like you're in a personal protection workshop. Like, that is exhausting. Either people are on hyper alert, like, I need - I can't trust anyone, or there's this kind of false confidence of, like, I know what bad people look like. I know what bad situations look like. ASLAM: Instead of self-defense, Michelle and Zelda focus on teaching us ways to avoid that kind of conflict with verbal and nonverbal communication. They call this approach to safety Self Offense. It's also the name of their organization. Z GAY: It's not rules to follow. It's not the truth about safety. It's not the truth about protecting yourself. We don't have answers. We do have some very useful practices. Life is going to go down how life is going to go down. And I have the ability to own that without shame or blame and even to potentially recontextualize that so that you have power - that's self-offense. That's the game. ASLAM: So what can you do to make yourself feel a little bit less vulnerable as you get to your destination? That's takeaway two - practice self-offense and communicate confidence. It's not enough to prevent you from becoming a target, but Michelle and Zelda say projecting confidence and alertness can make a big difference. Z GAY: Communicate awareness, like, that you are actively paying attention and to also communicate that you know where you're going, which we say reads as confident - and that if you look confident and you look like you know where you're going, that you don't read as much as a target. ASLAM: So whipping out your phone while you're walking or looking down at the sidewalk to avoid eye contact might not be the best idea. I'll admit I'm guilty of this, too. Instead, Zelda and Michelle recommend the self-offense walk. Z GAY: So we say that you pick a point, and you move directly towards that point. Now, you know, you might not know where you're going, but you can see from here to the garbage cans. You're going to walk to the garbage can like you know where you're going. And then you're going to actively turn your head to look around you so that you appear obviously alert. And this includes looking behind you. ASLAM: So walk like you know where you're going. Pay attention to your environment. Look around and make eye contact. I know this probably sounds like a lot to think about when you're just trying to find the venue. But the idea is that you put this into practice. And eventually, it just becomes a habit, a way of confidently moving through the world that just comes naturally to you, even in situations where you feel more vulnerable. Z GAY: So we recommend that you practice looking behind you in broad daylight when you're not afraid because like, it's a profound and valid fear when you're walking down the street, and it's dark to look behind you. Like, we do not want to, like, oh yeah, just look behind you. Like, no, it - like, when you're dealing with that really real concern, you'll want some muscle. ASLAM: Muscle that you build through practice. If you do find yourself in a situation in the middle of the street, maybe someone screaming at you or approaching you when you just want to be left alone, Zelda says it's important to evaluate the situation. Ask yourself, what exactly is the danger here? Z GAY: While the experience is very upsetting, even alarming, we want you to ask questions like, how close is this person to me? Do they appear to be escalating? Like, do they appear to be getting more and more agitated or more and more angry? Are they carrying anything of any kind that could be used as a weapon? ASLAM: Sometimes, putting distance between you and the other person is the simplest solution. But on public transportation, that can be kind of hard to do. Michelle has some advice that comes from personal experience. M GAY: The subway was super crowded, and I sat beside this guy. I could tell he was maybe a little bit high or drunk. And he looked at me, and he said, yo, baby. He said, I got somebody at home. But if you want to come with me, I'll call her and tell her I'm going to be late. And he said it loud, and people were watching me. And I had this opportunity where I could just be like, ew. Or what are you, nuts? Or, like, totally, like - would you call it dragging him? And instead, I said, oh, that's just so sweet. Thank you so much, but I'm going to pass on that. But, like, just to make it light, I don't really want to embarrass or belittle somebody when given the opportunity. ASLAM: This isn't just about being polite. If you're pissed and feeling like telling them off, you have every right to. But consider that when people feel embarrassed or humiliated in public, they can get more aggressive, and the situation could start to escalate. So that's public transit. If rideshare makes you feel vulnerable, too, that's completely valid. You're in someone else's car, and they have total control over where you're going. Familiarize yourself with the safety features that come with those apps. Some let you message your trip to a friend so they can follow along and make sure that you get to your destination. Others have numbers that you can call in case of an emergency. And here are some basic tips. Confirm your driver's license plate matches the info that you have before you get in the car. When they arrive, ask them who the ride is for. You can even screenshot your ride's info and send it to your friends when you're on your way so they have an idea of when to expect you. You can call a friend during the trip, but make sure you're paying attention to the ride and heading in the right direction. And whether you're walking, taking the bus, driving or taking rideshare, sharing your locations with your friends along with an on-my-way text is a good way to let your friends know to keep an eye out. OK. So you've made it to your destination safe and sound. If you've got a game plan, you're walking into this with a good idea of what you want to participate in and what your boundaries are, so stick to it. If I'm starting to make the game plan sound like a legally binding document, I want to make it clear that it's not. Obviously, things can still change in the moment, but you want to think hard about why you're changing your mind. HUGHES: I know it feels hard sometimes. I love spontaneity as much as anybody does. But maybe this is not the time and place to be spontaneous and make a quick decision that wasn't in your plan. ASLAM: A lot of the time, we can get pushed into making choices we wouldn't usually make because of social pressure. We've all heard about the dangers of peer pressure before, but this isn't something that only teenagers struggle with. And, sometimes, it can come from friends who have the best intentions. So that's takeaway three. Stick to your boundaries and respect other people's boundaries. When you don't want to do something, say so. And if someone else makes their boundaries clear to you, respect that. It can be awkward to turn something or someone down, but clear communication and mutual respect is key. If you're not planning on drinking or you're done for the night, here's one tip Karen gives her students. HUGHES: Having a cup in your hand seems that - a cue for people who are using when they see someone who doesn't appear to be using. I guess it makes them uncomfortable. But if you have a cup in your hand, you can help avoid that. So you can put whatever you want in that cup. ASLAM: Trust me, I order my fair share of Shirley Temples and mocktails. This works. But there's also just a good old-fashioned, no thanks. I'm good. And side note, if you're the one throwing the party, there are things you can do to help make sure folks are safe, too. HUGHES: In fact, party throwers have so much opportunity and responsibility for creating spaces in which everybody can get what they want without what they don't want. ASLAM: If you're providing mixed drinks, make sure guests know exactly what's in it. Put up a sign detailing exactly what's in the drink. Also, think twice about a self-serve type of setup to minimize the chance that someone can add something to the drinks that shouldn't be in there. Having a designated bartender can also help you keep an eye out on folks who look like they're hitting their limit. And if you decide to drink or use yourself, know what you're putting in your body. Remember to watch your drink and pay attention to the way you're feeling. Karen says that if you feel like you're not alert enough to be aware of your surroundings, you probably want to stop or slow down so you're not putting yourself at risk in any way. Now let's talk about socializing and flirting. Here's an example from an experience that Zelda had. Z GAY: I was in a bar, and I was with these girls in Seattle. And this guy just kept asking to buy us drinks. And the girls were like, oh, OK, well - like, you could tell that they were - they didn't know how to say no directly, or they weren't empowered to say no directly. And so they just kind of kept dancing around it. And he kept asking. He kept persisting. And so I turned to him, and I was like, you know what, man? Thank you so much. But I think we're good. And it was like, he turned on me. He was like, oh. ASLAM: Unfortunately, this happens a lot. People who can't figure out how to say no when someone offers to buy them a drink or get their number and then the people who just refuse to hear it or push right past it. Z GAY: We have all this cultural conditioning around no, and then we wonder why it's so freaking muddy, and none of us know how to communicate effectively or listen effectively. ASLAM: If you're like me, you might find yourself dancing around no because you don't want to be rude or make anyone feel bad. Or maybe you're someone who hears, I don't want to do that, and thinks, I can change your mind. Z GAY: A lot of cisgendered men are conditioned to push past no. It's a part of, like, in the same way that a lot of cisgendered women - we're supposed to smooth things out. We're supposed to get along. We're supposed to make everybody feel good. So then you have this dynamic of folks who are taught to persist and folks who are taught to acquiesce. And then, of course, we have all this miscommunication and upset in the realm of boundaries. ASLAM: Zelda says it's important to consider what your relationship to no is and why. Z GAY: We really want you to look from, like, OK, I'm just going to try on that maybe there are some interactions that I'm not very good at hearing no, either. And I'm going to start to get interested in those. ASLAM: It's hard to look at yourself and see ways that you might be hurting other people, but this isn't just about making people a little uncomfortable. You have to learn to respect people's boundaries and really listen to what people are trying to tell you, or you might be crossing some serious lines. Sexual assault is a huge problem and could be a very real consequence if you ignore someone's no. And look. Consent can be surprisingly difficult to talk about and to navigate, which is why we've got a whole 'nother episode dedicated to it. But back to setting boundaries during a night out. If you're having trouble communicating no, try practicing what Michelle mentioned earlier. A kind but firm and persistent no, but thank you. And if you're trying that, but the other person just does not seem to be backing off... Z GAY: You might want to start to be like, I'm going to put a little bit of distance in between me and this person. ASLAM: And if you need an excuse to get away, you could try, thanks, but I've got to go meet up with some friends now. At the end of the day, trust your gut. If things feel more serious than that and you feel like your safety is at risk... M GAY: Then you want to maintain the distance. So you're going to have to probably back up and then definitely look to see, where are the exit? Who else is around? Who's paying attention to what's happening? Who's your potential ally? Is there somebody who looks like they can, you know, be a support to you? ASLAM: In an emergency situation, you want to let a bartender or another staff member know what's going on. A lot of places have phone numbers and codes posted in signs on the bathroom so you can get help or have someone escort you safely out of the venue. Here's something to keep in mind. You also want to be a good ally. So really listen to what people are trying to say. Even for the small things, back off when someone isn't interested and step in if you notice that someone's being pushed into something. That brings us to takeaway four. Watch out for your friends. If you came with a group, you want to stick together if possible. When someone leaves the group to go mingle or get a drink or use the bathroom, you want to make sure you keep an eye on them. And if you notice that one of your friends has been gone for too long or that they're having a hard time getting out of a situation, they might need some rescuing. Z GAY: Hey, do you really want to say no, and you're just having some trouble? Like, what's going on? ASLAM: And remember, you came with a plan. And if they say they want to leave with a stranger or stay behind, remind them about your earlier conversation. You may have to really put your foot down. They might hate you for it now, but you've got to have faith that they'll appreciate you for stepping in later. Watching out for your friends also means cutting them off when they've had too much. But it can be hard to know when they've gone too far and what exactly you're supposed to do about it. Karen says it can be helpful to think of intervention on a scale. HUGHES: The earliest signs of intoxication you can recognize are slurring and swaying. And at that point, you want to slow the person down. So offer them food. Offer them water. Distract them. The next level up on our scale is if you see somebody who's stumbling, rambling, vomiting, we say that's time to cut them off. And you got to trust your gut. ASLAM: At that point, it's probably best to get them home. Again, it's not fun to fight your friends when they're drunk. But if you don't step in, the consequences can be pretty scary. Here's when Karen says it's time to call for help. HUGHES: So we created the acronym CUSP - C-U-S-P. C is for cold skin. U is for for unresponsive. S is for slow breathing. And P is for puking repeatedly. ASLAM: Calling for medical attention can be a traumatizing experience for everybody involved. Depending on where you are, there may be laws to help protect you against consequences for participating in prohibited activities like underage drinking or using illegal drugs if you're calling for help. They're called medical amnesty laws. You can look them up by state. And if you're a student, familiarize yourself with your campus's safety policies. But listen. Either way, you really don't want it to go that far. So when you notice that things are starting to get out of control, intervene early. The goal is to have a good time and get everyone home safely. That brings us to takeaway number five, check in at the end of the night and reflect. Once everyone is home safely, take a beat to debrief. If you're too exhausted, maybe talk things out over breakfast the next morning. HUGHES: Later on, when you're reflecting back on your whole experience, you can decide, did that work the way I wanted it to? Would I do it a little differently the next time? ASLAM: Sometimes, our bad experiences were out of our control. And that's OK. But for the things that you can control, consider what needs to change so that you can have a better experience moving forward. And to recap, takeaway one, before you head out the door, have a game plan. Know your motivations, your boundaries and your limits. Takeaway number two, practice self-offense and communicate confidence. These strategies don't just come to you when you need them. It's a muscle that you build with practice in your daily life. Takeaway three, stick to your boundaries and respect other people's boundaries. Learn to communicate and listen to no effectively. Takeaway number four, watch out for your friends and keep an eye on everyone. Step in when you need to for their safety. Takeaway number five, check in and reflect so that things go better for everyone the next time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ASLAM: For more LIFE KIT, check out her other episodes.

Key outcomes include a reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports from 57% to 47% due to China’s pledge to curb fentanyl and resume soybean purchases, as well as mutual commitments to ease export controls on rare earth minerals.

        By Deepa Shivaram \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:25 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump is back in Washington after spending a week in Asia. He attended the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, addressed U.S. troops in Japan and met with China's President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Here are five takeaways from the president's first visit to the region in his second term. 1) U.S.-China trade relations have mostly stabilized… On the flight back to Washington after his meeting with Xi on Thursday, Trump said the tariff rate on Chinese exports would be lowered from 57% to 47%. The 10-point drop comes because Xi committed to trying to decrease the amount of fentanyl coming into the U.S. That issue has been a priority for Trump, who months ago put an extra 20% tariff on China because of fentanyl. Trump also said that China would resume buying soybeans from the U.S., which has been a major issue for American farmers since China had halted those purchases. China also agreed to back off the extra limits it had put on rare earths exports, in exchange for the U.S. scaling back some of its own export restrictions. That agreement will hold for a year. Those minerals are critical for the U.S. and other countries because they are used in military equipment and other technology. 2) But a finalized deal isn't done \"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made,\" Trump told reporters after his meeting with Xi, \"There wasn't too much left out there.\" But he wasn't specific about what exactly is left for China and the U.S. to discuss. Trump said he is scheduled to visit China next April, which will be followed by another meeting with Xi in either Washington or in Florida. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Dennis Wilder, a former national security official and a professor at Georgetown University, said the meeting between Trump and Xi gave \"momentum\" for trade talks between the two countries to continue. \"Both sides have not given up their trade weapons but merely have agreed to stop firing as long as both sides hold to the agreements,\" Wilder said. 3) Diplomacy = flattery A charm offensive was on full display in Malaysia, Japan and Korea as leaders tried to cater to Trump ahead of trade talks and other negotiations. Trump's style of foreign relations is often rooted in personal relationships; heads of state, when visiting Washington, have tried to appease Trump to have a smoother relationship with the president. That strategy came forward in Asia, too. Nearly 100 dancers in Malaysia greeted Trump on the red carpet at his first stop. In Japan, Trump was gifted late Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's golf clubs and the newly elected prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, announced that she was going to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump's arrival in South Korea was also full of fanfare – YMCA, a song that's played at Trump's rallies for nearly a decade, was performed on the tarmac in Busan when Air Force One landed. President Lee Jae Myung gave Trump a replica of a golden crown significant to Korea's history. Trump also got a gold medal and was awarded Korea's highest civilian honor. 4) Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker Trump has renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War, he's deployed National Guard troops around different U.S. cities and in recent weeks, he has ordered strikes on a number of boats in the eastern Pacific allegedly carrying drugs. But on this trip in Asia, Trump wanted to emphasize his role as a peacemaker. His first stop in Malaysia at the ASEAN summit included presiding over the signing of a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand. A border dispute reignited between the two countries earlier this year, and Trump helped broker a ceasefire by threatening to increase tariffs. In his remarks in Kuala Lumpur, Trump said he was in Scotland playing golf when he got on the phone with the leaders from Cambodia and Thailand, and Malaysia, who also helped broker peace. \"You caused me very good entertainment. I could've had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun for me than anything,\" Trump said. Even before the trip, Trump had been claiming his administration has ended eight global conflicts. Russia's war in Ukraine hasn't been one of them, which has frustrated Trump. But it's possible he adds another conflict to solve to his peacemaking list. Though he didn't meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while in Asia, Trump left the door open for a future meeting and said his administration would work on tensions between North and South Korea, who never formally ended their war. 5) Trump's making deals abroad, but Congress is still at a standstill Despite the deal-making and peace-making on the world's stage, Trump came home to a federal government that's still shut down, federal workers who aren't getting paid and critical programs like SNAP running out of funding. The president hasn't shown the same interest in making deals across the aisle with Democrats to reopen the government. Instead, he returned to Washington Thursday night and mused on Truth Social about using the \"nuclear option,\" which he said would be to get rid of the filibuster. That would allow Senate Republicans to pass a funding agreement with a simple majority, not a 60-vote majority that would require support from Democrats. \"We are in power and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying 'SHUT DOWN',\" Trump said, adding that ending the filibuster   would \"take advantage\" of Democrats. Democrats have refused to vote in favor of the agreement to temporarily fund the government unless it includes a measure that would extend the tax credit that lowers the cost of health insurance premiums, which is set to expire at the end of the year. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5591404","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Shopping for ACA health plans this open enrollment?

Here's what to know \n         By Michelle Andrews \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This year's Obamacare open enrollment period, which starts Saturday in most states, is full of uncertainty and confusion for the more than  24 million people  who buy health insurance through the federal and state Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The fate of the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for  92% of enrollees  remains up in the air, with the prospect of significantly  higher premiums looming . But there are steps marketplace shoppers can take to ensure they make the right choices for the upcoming plan year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. Understand how we got here In 2021, as part of a COVID-era relief package, the ACA premium tax credits were enhanced to lower costs for previously eligible people and expand eligibility to people with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty level (which amounts to  about $63,000  for one person in 2025). But those enhancements, which were extended in 2022,  will expire  at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts. The debate over whether to extend them again has been at the center of a political battle of wills between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a fight at the heart of the now month-old  government shutdown. The financial implications for many marketplace enrollees are huge. Average out-of-pocket premium payments for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double if the enhanced tax credits expire, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. \"The longer this goes on, the more damage is done,\" said  Cynthia Cox , a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF. \"If someone logs on Nov. 1 and sees their premium doubling, they might just walk away.\" That would be a mistake, marketplace experts agree. What is clear, though, is that buyers need to beware and be informed. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Follow the news It can be frustrating to track day-to-day Capitol Hill machinations. But that may be your best source for up-to-date information. Congress could make a deal to extend the enhanced subsidies anytime during the next few days, weeks or months -- or not. Either way, it could affect your enrollment decision. So, pay attention. Don't count on the marketplace or your insurer to notify you about what you should expect to pay. \"Many state marketplaces have hit delay\" on sending consumers notices of net premiums, which take premium tax credits into account, said  Sabrina Corlette , a co-director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The federal government doesn't send enrollees notices about plan premiums for the coming year for the  28 federally facilitated  marketplaces. For 2026, it has said that health plans can also  opt not  to. 3. Update your account information and don't auto-enroll Log in to your marketplace account and update your income, household size, and any other details that have changed. This year, it's particularly important to provide an accurate estimate of your anticipated income for 2026. A provision in HR 1, sometimes called the  One Big Beautiful Bill Act ,  eliminated the caps  on what many people were required to repay if they underestimated their projected income and received more premium assistance than they should have. Next year, people will have to repay the entire excess amount. In the past few years, it's been possible to put your ACA insurance on auto-pilot with  automatic reenrollment  in your current or a similar plan. Given the uncertainty around premiums, this is not a good year to do that, enrollment specialists say. This is especially true for people who, without a deal in Congress, will no longer qualify for subsidies next year, specifically those whose incomes are over 400% of the federal poverty level. 4. Shop based on sticker prices When people see their projected premiums, assuming Congress hasn't reached a deal to extend the enhanced credits, many will be shocked. Health insurance premiums on the marketplaces are expected to increase, on average, 26% next year,  according to KFF . That's the largest rate increase since 2018. Until now, people have largely been shielded from those increases by the enhanced premium tax subsidies that nearly all enrollees receive. Here's how it works: Most people with ACA marketplace plans are responsible for paying a portion of their premium based on a sliding income scale, and the government pays the rest. According to an analysis by KFF, if the enhanced credits are not renewed, a family of four with $75,000 in income, for example,  will be responsible  for paying $5,865 in annual premiums for a benchmark silver plan in 2026 — more than double the $2,498 it'll pay if they are renewed. When evaluating a plan, focus on the listed price. If it's not affordable without the enhanced tax credits, it's not a good buy. \"People need to make a decision based on what is in front of them,\" Cox said. If you can't afford the sticker price without the enhanced credits, consider enrolling in a less generous plan with a lower premium but a higher deductible, Cox said. Bronze plans must provide comprehensive coverage, including covering preventive care at no cost, and may cover some doctor visits before the deductible. \"In most cases, it makes more sense to have a bronze plan than to be uninsured,\" she said. The Trump administration has been promoting  catastrophic plans  as a more affordable option for people who face financial hardship, including those who don't qualify for subsidies because their incomes are either less than 100% or more than 400% of the federal poverty level. Similar to bronze plans, catastrophic plans cover a set of essential health benefits, provide free preventive care, and must cover at least three doctor visits before people reach their deductible. But catastrophic plan deductibles are the highest of any type of marketplace plan: $10,600 for individuals and $21,200 for families in 2026. \"They are expensive relative to what they cover,\" said  Jennifer Sullivan , director of health coverage access at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting premiums can cost several hundred dollars. 5. Come back, check, and recheck If you're dismayed at premium prices on your first pass, \"don't slam the computer shut and decide that there are no options for you,\" Sullivan said. \"Congress might still act and things might change radically.\" Lawmakers could restore the enhanced premium tax credits right up to the end of the year, or later. In a majority of states, including the 28 that use the federal government's centralized marketplace, open enrollment lasts until Jan. 15. There are also other key dates to remember. In most states, people  must enroll  by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, and by Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, though some states have later deadlines. 6. Wait to pay your premium Premium payments are generally due before the plan takes effect, although marketplaces and insurers have flexibility to extend deadlines, Corlette said. They might allow people extra time to make a first payment, for example. \"We've seen that in the past. State officials and insurance companies have gotten creative to try and keep people in coverage,\" she said. But if there is a last-minute deal and someone has already paid their premium for January coverage and received a lower tax credit than the deal provides, they should still be able to receive the higher credit. \"There are ways to make people whole,\" Corlette said, although how that might happen this enrollment period is unclear.

meeting with Xi \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Wayne Chang, Will Ripley, Zachary Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:45 AM EDT, Thu October 30, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Days before President  Donald Trump  departed for Asia where he will sit down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday for their first in-person meeting of his second term, the president refused to count out the possibility of America’s position on Taiwan getting tangled in US-China trade talks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to be talking about a lot of things. I assume that’s going to be one of the things, but I’m not going to talk about that now,” Trump said when asked about reports that China may pressure the US to oppose Taiwan’s independence in exchange for a larger trade deal.\n \n\n   \n  The refusal to definitively count out Taiwan becoming a pawn in trade talks between the world’s two largest economies comes as Trump has privately and publicly suggested he believes China will not invade the self-ruled island that Beijing claims it owns while he is in office – raising questions about how seriously the president will prioritize boosting Taiwan’s defense during his second term.\n \n\n   \n  Trump again gave an evasive answer on Taiwan as he spoke with reporters on Air Force One en route to South Korea Wednesday for the Asia-Pacific Cooperation summit where he will sit down with Xi, saying he is  not even sure  the topic will be raised by the Chinese leader. A senior administration official expressed confidence that Trump would not be backed into stating opposition to Taiwan’s independence during the meeting, adding that the meeting will be focused on Xi “holding a gun to the head of the global economy” with its critical mineral export controls.\n \n\n   \n  Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said over the weekend that no one in the administration is contemplating a trade deal that includes “favorable treatment” for walking away from Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Some experts remain worried, however, that Trump might be willing to make concessions on Taiwan for a better trade deal, but former Trump administration officials argue that those concerns are over-blown.\n \n\n   \n  “That idea of a grand bargain, of Trump selling out Taiwan, gets most of its oxygen from Chinese Communist Party trial balloons that are floated in US media, and from isolationists on the far left and the far right who believe in appeasement,”   said Matt Pottinger, Chairman of the China Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and Trump’s former deputy national security advisor. “Trump understands the strategic nature of Taiwan.”\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is also publicly downplaying concerns about the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting, and with a senior Taiwan government official saying they are “cautiously optimistic” about the meeting and pointing to Rubio’s latest remarks as an encouraging sign.\n \n\n   \n  Whenever leaders of the United States and China meet, Taiwan’s government is closely watching and calibrating its own strategy. Very little is typically said publicly given the precarious position Taipei finds itself in – wedged between two superpowers with vastly conflicting agendas and interests.\n \n\n   \n  And Taiwan’s anxieties have amplified in Trump’s second term, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s team is filled with more isolationist and far-right figures than the establishment Republican and Democratic officials who have traditionally shaped US foreign policy. And while Trump has prioritized securing a major trade deal with Beijing, his administration has paused some US military support to the island and complicated basic engagements such as the transit of Taiwan’s president through the US earlier this year, current and former US officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “Some stakeholders in Taipei have found it really jarring to be in this position where they’re suddenly so unclear on whether the US president will support them,” said Henrietta Levin, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), adding they have found an “unwelcome surprise” in how challenging it has been to bolster the US-Taiwan relationship this year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump went into his first term having taken a phone call from Taiwan’s president  during the transition,  which upended protocol because there are no formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan. His administration then accelerated the sale of weapons to the self-governing island and allowed the transit of Taiwan’s president though the US on multiple occasions – which is in line with past norms.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, Trump came into office for his second term after having repeatedly claimed in recent years that Taiwan “stole” the US chip business, which resonated uneasily in Taipei. He has been careful in public statements about Taiwan, his administration has halted the flow of some weapons from US stockpiles to the island and complicated the transit of the island’s president through the US.\n \n\n   \n    The return of strategic ambiguity, or a downgrade of the relationship?\n \n\n   \n  Some experts make the case that to date, Trump in his second term has acted in line with decades of US policy with a return to strategic ambiguity.\n \n\n   \n  While it may be a hard shift after former President Joe Biden declared multiple times while he was in office that the US would militarily defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, they say it’s not an abnormal approach.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at Obama, Bush before that, it’s always been a little bit of a hands-off approach, and trying to keep Taiwan at arm’s length and being very careful about any messages you sent to China. So, we are somewhat back to that new normal again,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, the chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a foreign policy think tank.\n \n\n   \n  But Taiwan is grappling with whether the current state of the relationship with the US is a short-term aberration as Trump focuses on a productive meeting with Xi, or more of a long-term reality.\n \n\n   \n  It has led them to parse over the deeper meaning of every single engagement with the administration – or lack thereof.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this fall, there was a gathering on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly with Taiwan’s foreign minister at Le Bernardin, an upscale New York restaurant. Multiple senior US administration officials were expected to attend but they didn’t show up, according to a source who attended the gathering. Even though the administration signaled through intermediaries that the no-show was simply the unintended consequence of over-packed schedules, it left Taiwan feeling defeated, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The island is actively re-evaluating how they can move to bring the Trump administration to their side, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Facing pressure from both Washington and Beijing, President Lai Ching-te has pledged to raise defense spending sharply to 3.32% of GDP by 2026 and 5% by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  But there are also actions that are being taken – or considered – that won’t attract headlines but could impact the overall relationship.\n \n\n   \n  One option being considered is recalling their de facto ambassador to the US Alexander Yui in order to replace him with a diplomat who is more politically savvy, sources said. Some Trump administration officials have said that the current career diplomat doesn’t have the juice to effectively engage despite support from some close to the president, multiple sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan flatly denied that suggestion on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Taiwan and the US maintains a smooth communication channel,” Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung, told a legislative committee meeting. “Our representative office in the US has been functioning well. We are not recalling him.”\n \n\n   \n  Taipei has also launched an unprecedented charm offensive aimed at conservative media figures and influencers aligned with Trump’s movement.\n \n\n   \n  President Lai granted  a rare interview  to radio host Buck Sexton, praising Trump and even suggesting he would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if he could persuade China to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President  Hsiao Bi-khim spoke with  YouTuber Shawn Ryan, while Taiwan’s de facto ambassador appeared on Steve Bannon’s podcast and hosted Ryan at Twin Oaks, the historic ambassadorial residence in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Such outreach marks a sharp departure from Taipei’s conventional diplomatic approach, underscoring its effort to engage directly with the Trump-aligned ecosystem currently shaping US foreign policy discourse.\n \n\n   \n  Taipei is also trying to offset its US trade deficit by purchasing 6 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Alaska, a move officials describe as both an energy-security measure and a goodwill gesture toward Washington while they are still working on a trade deal between the two sides.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Taiwan is not willing to concede to the US across the board. The island   vowed  to resist pressure  from Washington to shift half of its chip production capacity to the United States, throwing down the gauntlet to the Trump administration just earlier this month. The subject is expected to continue as an active piece of the ongoing trade talks between the US and Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n    Making Taiwan a porcupine ‘without giving Beijing the middle finger’\n \n\n   \n  Chinese leader Xi Jinping views Taiwan’s “reunification” with the mainland as a core requirement for the sweeping vision of a “national rejuvenation” China aims to achieve by mid-century.\n \n\n   \n  Senior Communist Party officials recently drew up their upcoming five-year plan, which analysts expect will see Beijing prioritize greater economic integration with Taiwan as part of its push for “peaceful reunification.” State media on Monday released a sweeping commentary laying out the many economic carrots it said would be available to Taiwan’s people “after reunification.”\n \n\n   \n  China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has not ruled out using force to take control of the island.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US officials have said that Xi has ordered the country’s military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration plans to adopt a policy on Taiwan with the goal of making the island a “porcupine” by investing strategically in precision and smaller weapons built for asymmetric warfare to deter Chinese aggression or make an invasion so costly and painful that costs would outweigh benefits, two sources briefed on the policy discussions said. US officials also want to get Taiwan to that place “without giving Beijing the middle finger,” the sources explained.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration refused to green-light the transfer of US weapons stocks to Taiwan earlier this year, under a process known as Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), sources said. The move led to questions about the US military’s commitment to Taiwan. But the move was not meant to signal a complete abdication of US support, sources said. While the administration does not want Taiwan pulling from US weapons stocks — with one administration official pointing out that most of the stockpiled weapons that the US can give to Taiwan would be ineffective in a fight against China — there are no plans to halt sales of weapons which would be purchased by Taiwan, administration officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Taiwan to put in more orders for military equipment, and they are still waiting on those new orders, the senior administration official said. This private push comes as the administration has made clear that it views the economically prosperous island through the same lens that it views Europe – that it must invest more towards its own defense.\n \n\n   \n  Still, speed needs to be addressed. Taipei is waiting on a backlog of more than $20 billion in undelivered US military equipment, with production times in the US delayed in part because of the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the delayed National Defense Strategy from the Pentagon and internal disagreement over the extent to which the administration plans to prioritize sending military resources to the Western Hemisphere and Europe versus the Pacific is raising questions about the military focus and resources that will actually be put towards Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  Dictating the flow of US arms to allies and partners would typically be the job of the defense secretary but the Pentagon has tried to make those calls in recent months with policy memos that have at times been slapped down by Trump directly, sources pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has publicly claimed in recent weeks that Xi won’t invade Taiwan because of US military strength.\n \n\n   \n  “China doesn’t want to do that. First of all, United States is the strongest military power in the world by far, it’s not even close,” Trump said earlier this month. “Nobody’s going to mess with that and I don’t see that at all with President Xi.”\n \n\n   \n  While US officials claim Taiwan must act more quickly to shore up its own defenses, there are concerns on the island that Trump’s personal conviction that Xi will not invade while he is in office could impede the US from effectively boosting their military capabilities in the coming years.\n \n\n   \n  “They are concerned about that, so if there’s no invasion until 2029, but all the time between now and then is wasted, both on the US side and the Taiwanese side, that will set us up for a disaster in 2029 or 2030,” Alperovitch said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Simone McCarthy contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting live musical performances from the Tiny Desk Concert series, which is part of NPR's programming.

Take this quiz to find out \n         By Kia Miakka Natisse, Clare Marie Schneider, Connie Hanzhang Jin, Koko Nakajima \n        \n           Tuesday, February 15, 2022 • 12:03 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         How do you feel when your partner doesn't respond to your text right away? Is it easy for you to express your feelings to friends or loved ones, or do you struggle? Do you stay in touch with exes? Worry your current partner will leave you? How you answered those questions can offer some insight into your attachment style. According to the field of attachment theory, each person has a unique attachment style that informs how you relate to intimacy: secure, anxious, avoidant and a small subset who are anxious-avoidant.  This quiz, adapted from Amir Levine and Rachel Heller's bestselling book,  Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find — and Keep  —  Love , will help you figure out your own attachment style.  Research has shown  that even just knowing about the four attachment styles can positively influence your relationships. \"It helps people become more secure,\" says Levine, who is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia University.  And though you may not have a choice in which attachment style you have, it's not just up to you to address it — other people have a role to play too. \"It's something that happens in the space between two people. They think, 'Oh, I have this attachment style, so I have to fix it by fixing myself.' But it's a relational thing,\" says Levine. He recommends creating a \"secure village\"— surrounding yourself with secure people as a way to make yourself more secure. Curious about your partner's attachment style?  This quiz can help .

Today, we're talking attachment styles, which are very popular these days. You've probably seen people online talking about how they can help you in relationships. And though it might feel new, it's actually an old idea that first started in the parenting world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AMIR LEVINE: So the founder of attachment theory with children initially is John Bowlby, and he made this idea leap at the time. NATISSE: This was back in the 1950s, when the general belief was that babies just needed food and shelter and that distancing yourself - not holding them too much, letting them cry and generally just leaving them alone - was good parenting. LEVINE: But Bowlby thought differently. Bowlby thought that - he took different, separate type of basic need that humans have to attach to others. NATISSE: That's Amir Levine. He's a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia University and also the co-author of \"Attached: The New Science Of Adult Attachment.\" John Bowlby's research showed that it wasn't actually just about making sure the baby has food and a roof over their head. A secure relationship with a parent or caretaker played a major factor in their development. LEVINE: You can provide children with all of the physical sustenance that they need, like food and shelter, but if you don't interact with them and there isn't an attachment, they will actually fail to thrive. NATISSE: There are four basic attachment styles - secure, anxious, avoidant and anxious avoidant. Eventually, years of research and experiments revealed that not only did children have different attachment styles, those styles could continue into adulthood, showing up in their romantic relationships. That said, it isn't just about how you were raised. Other dynamics, like temperament, genetics and early romantic experiences, can play a major part in your attachment style. The point is that we all have an innate need for connection. LEVINE: We have brain circuitry that is designed to choose a person out from the crowd and make them special and important. And we do it to a large degree not just with our significant other. We do it also with friends, but to a much higher degree with significant others. And if there are none available to us, it will sort of - we will feel a great distress. NATISSE: And you're saying it's biological. We actually have no choice. We do this whether or not, maybe, we're conscious of it, where we choose an important person. LEVINE: Right. So why would you blame someone who is really, really craving a relationship? But in our society, sometimes there's judgment about that and this whole idea that, oh, that means that something is wrong with you. You have to learn to love yourself first before you love someone else. But that's not our biology. Our biology doesn't work that way. We are extremely social species. In fact, it's kind of like the opposite. We can learn to love ourselves better through other people. NATISSE: And though you may not have a choice in which attachment style you are, it's not just up to you to address it. Other people have a role to play, too. LEVINE: It's something that happens in the space between two people. They think, oh, I have this attachment style, so I have to fix it by fixing myself. But it's a relational thing. NATISSE: Even just learning about the different attachment styles can impact your relationships. LEVINE: And actually, there was a recent paper that came out that says that just by knowing about those attachment styles, it helps people become more secure. NATISSE: Oh, that's really... LEVINE: I know. NATISSE: ...Great news. LEVINE: So that's great news for anyone who's going to listen now to this show. NATISSE: In this episode of NPR's LIFE KIT, Amir Levine explains the different attachment styles, how to figure out your own and others, plus how to use that awareness to have healthier, more connected relationships. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) NATISSE: So I know there are different attachment styles. What are the different styles, and how do you figure out which one you are? LEVINE: So there's the anxious, avoidant, secure, and there's a small segment of the population that's anxious and avoidant. And it all has to do with how comfortable you feel with intimacy and closeness, but also how sensitive of a radar do you have for potential disruption in that closeness. NATISSE: So do you want to break it down from the, like, four different types - how they respond to that radar system? LEVINE: Yeah. If we love, love intimacy and closeness, but yet we have the very sensitive radar system - like we can read a lot of things as potential threats - then we have an anxious working model. And the truth is that research finds that people with anxious attachment styles are actually better at identifying potential threats than other attachment styles. So it's not all in their head. It's like... NATISSE: Yeah. LEVINE: ...There's an advantage sometimes of sort of being able to see danger. It's like having a sixth sense for danger... NATISSE: Right. LEVINE: ...But sometimes also seeing danger where there isn't any. So then if we love intimacy and closeness but we actually don't really have a very sensitive radar system, a lot of stuff goes over our head - oh, they're there. They're not there. It's fine. We don't really - it's like, we don't notice it, even. It just like - then we have a secure attachment style 'cause... NATISSE: OK. LEVINE: ...We love closeness, but we're not that - the person - they show up late from work, or they show up, like, upset from work or - like, we don't pay much attention to that. We don't really see it as a threat. NATISSE: OK. LEVINE: But that is the secure. And the avoidant is - they also have this mechanism of making someone else special. But when that happens, something strange happens. They want the closeness, but they don't like too much closeness. So what they do is they use what we call deactivating strategies, which is any strategy that will actually cause some distance in their relationship, in order to still be together with someone but a little bit more, like, at arm's length, at a distance. So that's the avoidant attachment style. NATISSE: So you kind of mentioned this before, but thinking about, like, some of the judgments around these attachment styles - and I really appreciate the way you described secure attach because as an anxious person, you know, like, secure just seems so idealized. But what you're also saying is that, oh, they are not also always picking up on things that maybe other people are that could be helpful. You know, so I guess, should we be judging these styles as, like, good or bad? Is there a healthy way to think about these categories? LEVINE: It's such a good question because one of the reasons why I love this field so much is because it's not embedded in a medical theory way of thinking, where a lot of things are either healthy or sick or... NATISSE: Right. LEVINE: ...Psychopathology. NATISSE: Yeah. LEVINE: It really looks at variations - normal variations in the population. So we're not talking about any, like, mental illness here or being healthy or sick. We're talking about the normal variation in the population. NATISSE: Yeah. Do attachment styles change over time? Are we, like, set in our ways? Or is there some flexibility around - like, can I become a more secure person? LEVINE: The answer is definitely yes. And that's another reason why I love this field so much because, especially as a therapist, to think that there is this framework in which people can change and change a lot is very promising to me. And not everybody can change to the same degree, but we can all try and strive for it. One of the main things that I think people don't appreciate enough is how scary it can be, actually, becoming more secure initially, just because, like, we're so set in our ways and things are so familiar, then all of a sudden - it's almost like reaching, like, a different planet. And one of the ways of - the best ways of becoming more secure is surrounding yourself by more secure people. If your partner is secure, you lucked out big time. But even if they're not secure, you can find additional people in your life that are more secure. But initially, sometimes it doesn't feel comfortable when you meet someone secure because you expect something else, and you don't know how to handle that exactly. Part of the work is to tell people, just take a deep breath and take it in and trust me that in the long run it will be worth it. NATISSE: Yeah. In the book, you have all these different sort of quizzes and tables to help people figure out their attachment style. What do you do with that information? How can we use attachment theory to improve our connections it sounds like not just with our romantic partners, but with other people that we really care about too, right? LEVINE: Yes, definitely. So in the book, we did two things. We sort of adopted a questionnaire about deciphering your own attachment style, but we went a step further and we put in a questionnaire of how you can identify other people's attachment style. You can pretty easily tell what other people's attachment styles are. Sometimes it's harder than others, but a lot of the time it's pretty easy. And then that really puts you on a different plane. For example, I had a supervisor at work, and she had an extreme - extremely, extremely anxious attachment style - so much so that it used to drive me to distraction. I just didn't know what to do. She would call and call and call, and it was like, OK, I'm so tired of this person. I would just, like (laughter) - I would just hit ignore. But she would see that I'm hitting ignore. It would make her even more anxious, and she would call even more. And then, like, it will be unpleasant, to say the least, in the way that she would speak to me. And then I realized after thinking, oh, she has an anxious attachment style, it doesn't work, ignoring her. It only makes her resort to protest behavior - right? Then she calls me and lashes out at me. That's protest behavior. So that's very helpful to understand, rather than take it personally. It's much more efficient in the way that you then understand the situation, and it has an immediate way of correcting it. And the way to correct it is to - sometimes it's kind of, like, the opposite of what you think - is to make yourself available to the person. So then I've learned to even preemptively reach out and say, hey, I'm not done with this yet, but I'll be done with it in the day. NATISSE: Yeah. LEVINE: We call that sort of turning out a small flame before it becomes a forest fire. NATISSE: Right. LEVINE: So you identify that, and you make yourself more available. And lo and behold, the relationship really transformed. She was much more calm, and we were able to get a lot of work done together in a remarkable way. NATISSE: Yeah. So what it sounds like is that you're saying that, like, attachment style, A, can help you outside of romantic relationships. It's not just about who you're dating. LEVINE: For sure. NATISSE: But B, also help you to navigate, like, points of conflict with people. If you can learn what their sort of attachment style is and how it might be activated in whatever interaction, you could more efficiently learn how to navigate that instead of, like, almost - I mean, we would say, like, two people triggering each other. You know, like if... LEVINE: Yes. NATISSE: ...You're an avoidant or an anxious person, it can kind of step in the gap. LEVINE: You used one word that's, like, the key word, and the key word is efficiency. So we're not talking about good or bad. We're talking about, is it working for you or is it not working for you? For, like, avoidant people, they think, ugh, I don't want too much closeness, so I'm not going to text this person - like I did with my mentor. I'm not going to - I'm like, I'm just going to ignore them. I'm not going to text them. Or if they're calling me, I'm just like, I don't have time for them now, missing the point that this is going to lead to great inefficiency because they're going to end up to basically deal with a forest fire later. So it's actually in their best interest to maintain more quiet, so they can actually not have that much need for constant interaction to keep this whole attachment system quiet and at bay. And you can do that - doesn't need a lot. That's the most surprising thing. It doesn't need a lot in today - in our today's world. With texting and emailing and all that stuff, you can remain connected very easily by sort of giving small, little gestures to your partner. NATISSE: Yeah. What are those steps of, like, quieting an active sort of attachment system and understanding that, like, different people's - depending on your attachment style, it might manifest differently? But either which way, it's like, your attachment system is activated. How can someone quiet theirs? LEVINE: I like that people oftentimes think about, OK, it's been activated. Now I need to look after myself, and I need to quiet it down. But that's not exactly how we think from an attachment perspective because we always think about the dyad. We don't think about, OK, now you got to activate it, and now you have to go and quiet down because that's not how it works. NATISSE: OK. LEVINE: You are in a dyad, and something happens in the space between two people. And if you got activated, that means that someone activated you (laughter), right? And it's - that means that someone wasn't in tune enough toward your needs and that things got spiraled out of control. I'm a believer in actually figuring out what the other person needs and trying to find a way to do what they need and trying to find a mutual way in which then things work seamlessly. It's like a dance, figuring out how to not step on each other, and then you can dance together as a couple, and it looks marvelous. NATISSE: Right. OK, so what I'm hearing you say, though, is that, like, it's a two-person process. If you're - if attachment... LEVINE: Exactly. NATISSE: ...Is about two people, it can never just be on one person to say, like, oh, I'm going to go soothe my attachment system, because you're saying we have to acknowledge that a person's attachment system might have been inflared (ph) by their partner's actions, even if their partner might think, perhaps they're reacting in a way that doesn't feel necessary - because I feel like that's where the traps, at least - now I'm talking about myself. (LAUGHTER) NATISSE: But like, you get trapped in, like, a - you had an anxious reaction to something that's not worthy of being anxious about. How do you ask for what you need? LEVINE: So one of the things that I have to - that I tell all my patients, it's almost like you have to - we have to stop thinking from our prefrontal cortex, really, and you have to understand that attachment has a different logic to it. It has a completely different logic. And it's not - we tend to think what's right and what's wrong, and we tend to sort of fight over the details of things. Attachment doesn't care about the explicit details. It cares about the implicit details. We don't care so much about the action of what the person does. We care about the meaning that we assign to that action. From an attachment perspective, there's not really overreacting. I've learned not to underestimate our attachment system. It's a powerful force. And if you try to go against it, it's going to win. The thing is to understand the logic, and the logic is about availability. The message should be, I'm available. I'm here for you. I love you. I don't want you to get hurt. You're safe here. But when you start telling the person, you're overreacting and you get upset about it, the attachment system gets the message, oh, my God, you're not safe here. You should... NATISSE: Right. LEVINE: ...Turn it up a notch 'cause you're not safe here. It's also important to create yourself a secure village and other secure people around you because sometimes maybe you won't get what you need from your partner, but then what you can do is you can call a secure person - not someone who's going to say, oh, yeah, my God, this person is a jerk. How can they treat you like that? How can they talk to you like that? No, no, no. You need someone who's going to really say, no, they love you so much. And, you know, here, yesterday, they brought you food, and they did this for you and that for you. And then you're like, oh, yeah, right. Yeah, I see that (laughter). And kind of like, phew, it all brings it all down. And it's a very important principle of secure priming. We can secure prime other people and ourselves. And sometimes, even just watching a movie where you can see, like, a secure relationship, that can sort of lead to secure priming. It's a very powerful thing, and it can last even for several weeks. So the one big thing is, like, thinking that we need to go it all alone. We live in such an individualized culture when we forget that we never do anything alone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) NATISSE: Yeah, that's real. I mean, I have to say my - the ways in which I've displayed protest behavior in the conflict that I've personally experienced because I didn't have this vocabulary to help me understand that, A, my reaction was normal and, B, I didn't have to be alone in it - of, like, feeling shame and like it's something I need to fix, but instead, it's something that me and my partner can discuss as something that needs to be resolved between the two of us. I mean, it's just so helpful, Dr. Levine. Thank you so much. LEVINE: Thank you. Great interview and great questions. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) NATISSE: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

     Friday, October 31, 2025 • 6:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         As the end credits began to scroll at my screening of  Bugonia , the audience sat silently in the darkness for several long seconds. Director Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film follows Teddy (Jesse Plemons), a grimy, raw-boned conspiracy theorist who, alongside his cousin Don (Aidan Delbis), kidnaps Michelle (Emma Stone) a steely Big Pharma CEO, because he's convinced himself she's an alien. It's not uncommon for a movie to lull a theater full of people into a moment of collective contemplation, of course. Such silences take various forms, depending on the film that precedes them: stunned, or thoughtful, or weighted with emotion. But  Bugonia  is a Lanthimos film. Which explains why, at its conclusion, the audience decided to take a moment to sit with it, before a lone voice pierced the gloom: \"The f***,\" it shouted, \"was  that ?\" Reader, I grinned. For those of us who count ourselves firmly in the tank for Lanthimos as a filmmaker, that cry of hapless, outraged bumfuzzlement is one reason we love seeing his stuff with a crowd. Because if it's true that art comforts the disturbed and disturbs the comfortable, the occasional plaintive cry of disturbed confusion can make the moviegoing experience that much richer and more enjoyable. Keep your Milk Duds — gimme a fellow theatergoer's indignation, in a bucket, with extra butter. Many of Lanthimos' previous films evoked similar responses, as he does tend to traffic in all things bleak and despondent. It's just who he is: What Spielberg is to childlike wonder, Lanthimos is to the abject misery of the human condition. And while he has made films that received widespread audience and critical acclaim, his core sensibility is not engineered for mainstream success, and some of us love him all the more for that. So you go into a Lanthimos film expecting some pushback from folks who just want to sit back and have a good time at the movies. But this time? That guy who shouted at my screening of  Bugonia ? He's got a point. Doing the Lanthi-most Because as enjoyable as I found the film (until its final three minutes and 37 seconds, about which more later), it only manages to qualify as mid-tier Lanthimos, chiefly because it doesn't register as a pure expression of his cinematic sensibility. The reason that some Lanthimos films —  Dogtooth  (2009),  The Killing of a Sacred Deer  (2017),  Kinds of Kindness  (2024) and especially  The Lobster  (2015) — feel so much more satisfying and essential than his Oscar-winners —  The Favourite  (2018) and  Poor Things  (2023) — is simple: He co-wrote them, with longtime collaborator Efthimis Filippou. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That's important, because whenever Lanthimos shows up as both director and (co-)writer, he brings a consistent (some would say rigid), characteristic (some would say mannered) style. This approach tends to feature deliberately and hilariously stilted dialogue delivered with a flat affect that borders on monotone, which has the net effect of rendering the characters incapable of accessing the strong emotions that are roiling just below the film's impassive surface. There's also, not for nothing, that bleakness. The abject, unutterable (and therefore  very  funny), kind of bleakness I associate with the comics of Charles Burns and Chris Ware – a bleakness that is total, and inexorable, and endlessly, hilariously resilient. Bugonia  was written by Will Tracy. Here, Lanthimos can't avail himself of his signature style — that affectless affect — because the story he's telling won't permit it. He's forced to adopt a more naturalistic approach, because he needs Emma Stone's character — the CEO trapped in Plemons' basement — to be fully, recognizably, empathetically human. He wants to place us in that basement alongside her, making the shrewd, calculating assessments of her situation that we imagine we would, if we were in her straits. Stone is dependably marvelous as a woman deftly reading her captors' moods and body language, and expertly negotiating her way towards freedom. For the film to work — and it largely does — it can't exist within the hermetically sealed bubble that typifies the films Lanthimos both directs and co-writes. It has to feel more immediate, more grounded, more real. But there's a coldness, here — a coldness that's absolutely necessary in films like  The Lobster  and  The Killing of a Sacred Deer , where it works to delineate and define the idiosyncratic world. In  Bugonia , however, that same dispassionate directorial remove feels out of place, and can't help but interpose itself between the audience and the characters, numbing our reaction to them. Ready for their close-up That distancing effect is amplified by Lanthimos' deliberate but frustrating disinclination to let his two leads truly act together, in any given scene. Bugonia  lives in a series of alternating close-ups of Stone's and Plemons' faces. We're tight on a given character while they're talking, then we cut to the other character saying their bit, then back to the other character as they resume talking. But acting, as they say, is reacting, and Lanthimos largely denies us reaction shots. It's something that you first notice unconsciously: Teddy says something provocative that we know Michelle would object to, yet we never cut away to her, we stay on Plemons' face. When he's done talking we cut to Michelle, who insults Teddy, but if it gets a rise out of him, we won't know it until it gets to be his turn again. It's a deliberate choice, or course: Lanthimos wants the film to read as a battle of wills between his leads. They are two people forcefully asserting, in turn, their clashing versions of reality, without ever listening to each other, without ceding any ground. They talk  at  each other, but nothing ever sinks in, nothing ever sways the other person even minutely; they just keep talking. (Contrast this with Delbis' character Donny, whose entire presence in the film exists as a series of reaction shots. That's intentional too — Donny is the heart of the movie, its soft chewy center; he's a sponge who absorbs absolutely everything Teddy and Michelle say to him, even though they contradict each other; he spends the entirety of the film being acted upon, ruthlessly manipulated.) The decision to bifurcate the film in this way makes sense on a technical level, I suppose, as it serves the film's themes of loneliness and alienation. But it's never anything less than frustrating to watch two of the finest film actors of the age delivering what amounts to a series of choppy mini-monologues instead of engaging in the true exchange of dialogue. Worst. Needle drop. Ever. I've now talked to several critics and non-critics about the film and a kind of consensus has evolved — several say they like the film in general, but dislike, or hate, the ending. I'll be careful here, but: When I hear that take, I always follow up with them. Do you mean the  resolution  of the film, or the  final few minutes  of the film? If they tell me they disliked how the film resolves a central question about the presence or absence of aliens, I disagree with them strongly, because I think the film's final act is kind of hilarious, and includes some terrific, grotesquely beautiful visual imagery. But if they tell me they hated those last few minutes — those last three minutes and 37 seconds, to be precise, when Marlene Dietrich's cover of \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone?\" is played? Then yeah, they're right, it's terrible. Mind-bogglingly  terrible, and a testament to the power of a single musical choice — a single, punishingly literal, ham-fisted, achingly obvious needle drop that occurs at the very, very end of a film — to poison the two hours of innovative, exciting filmmaking that precedes it. It's not just the song itself, but the fact that Lanthimos chooses to let it unspool in its entirety, all five verses. That's a serious chunk of screentime to devote to a single tune, and when you factor in that it's played over imagery that becomes thuddingly repetitive and overbearing by the two-minute mark, the choice is so mystifyingly bad that this Lanthimos devotee found himself questioning how a filmmaker he admires so much could biff the dismount in such an exhaustive and exhausting manner. When will they ever learn, indeed.

Here's what that means in your community \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Updated Thursday, October 23, 2025 • 5:24 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It's Day 23 of the federal government shutdown, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it. Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid tomorrow, the first full paycheck they'll miss as a result of the shutdown. The Senate on Thursday  failed to advance a pair of competing measures  to pay at least some federal workers. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but  the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.   The  Agriculture Department says  it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to  help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid . Read the latest on a case brought by some federal employee unions to stop the latest wave of layoffs during the shutdown. As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down?   A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.   Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer.  NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.

Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR Will active duty military receive their next paycheck?    The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members , according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month., but it only covered one pay cycle. Many are expecting their next paycheck at the end of this month.  Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month.  Some workers are fighting back in court ; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees. Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order    What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? Tens of millions of people are at risk of losing food and nutrition aid if the shutdown continues into November. That includes 7 million for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and nearly 42 million who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will  run out of money Nov. 1 . In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits \"until further notice\" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift  money from its contingency fund and other places  to keep SNAP at least partially funded. Meanwhile, WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration  shifted $300 million in tariff revenue  to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's  calling for an additional $300 million  to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some  states  could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources. —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR And what about school lunches? Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals. Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown. \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\" According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist.  —  Kadin Mills,  NPR USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.  —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler ,  NPR National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees On Monday, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.  According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\"  Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week. —  Geoff Brumfiel , NPR In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting  more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada  could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open. Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.  At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.  This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.  In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support   WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.  Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue.  But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.  In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. The report will come come out on Friday, nine days late.  Read more on  how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown  from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\"  Noem posted on X  last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, also according to a post last week  from Noem , from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. —  Ximena Bustillo , NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages  disrupt flights across the country .  Air traffic controllers  helped to end the last government shutdown , and could help end this one as well.

Read more on  what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown  from NPR's Joel Rose. The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region. Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country: Alaska The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [ Alaska Public Media ] About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states.

Turns out it's a new tyrannosaur \n         By Ari Daniel \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:04 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         It's known as the \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" fossil: A triceratops and a tyrannosaur, skeletons entangled, locked in apparent combat right up until the moment of their mutual demise. Even in the Hell Creek Formation in eastern Montana, a spot known for great finds, this specimen was, in a word, \"fantabulous,\" says  Clayton Phipps , a self-described rancher, cowboy and dinosaur hunter. That discovery in 2006 now appears to have overturned decades of dinosaur dogma about  Tyrannosaurus rex , the fearsome giant long thought to be the sole top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. In a paper in the journal  Nature , paleontologists  Lindsay Zanno  and  James Napoli  conclude that some of the bones from that specimen belong not to a teenage  T. rex , but to a fully grown individual of a different tyrannosaur species —  Nanotyrannus lancensis . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The majority of paleontologists, after some debate, had dismissed the idea that any other tyrannosaurs existed besides  T. rex . And yet, the sands of Montana seem to have disgorged a second one. In a broader analysis of other fossils, the two researchers also uncovered what they say is a third tyrannosaur species, formerly presumed to be a juvenile  T. rex . \"We knew the specimen was exceptional,\" says Zanno. \"We did not realize it would turn decades of research about  T. rex  on its head.\" \"Just insanely good\"   The Montana dig began on a breezy summer day when Phipps' friend, Mark Eatman, found an exposed pelvis and femur at the bottom of a canyon. Phipps thought maybe there was half a dinosaur hidden below. But after two weeks of digging, Phipps and his older cousin revealed that those bones belonged to a stunning triceratops. \"It was crazier than any site I've ever done before or since because every bone is in place,\" he says. \"The skeleton was just all together — just insanely good.\" Then, while excavating the light yellow sand from around the specimen, Phipps spotted something the color of chocolate. It was a claw. But triceratops didn't have claws. \"I'm like, 'What?' I start brushing and all of a sudden this arm starts to appear and part of the leg,\" he recalls. \"Oh man, my hat went in the air about 200 feet. I was like, 'No way — there's another dinosaur in here.'\" This was a bipedal,  carnivorous  dinosaur, entwined with the triceratops. \"Just laying like they died,\" says Phipps. The scientific consensus pegged this second dinosaur as a teenage  Tyrannosaurus rex  — a conclusion that would soon be overturned. Teenage angst A few years ago, the nonprofit  Friends of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences  acquired the fossils and rock they were encased in (some 30,000 pounds) from Phipps and donated them to the museum. \"They were a Christmas present waiting to be unwrapped,\" he says. Zanno, who is head of paleontology at the museum, was thrilled. \"It's one of the most incredible specimens from the late Cretaceous in North America I've ever seen,\" she says. She and the museum built  an entire wing around the dueling dinosaurs  to house a live-action research experience. \"It's the only place in the world where you get to enter the working paleo-lab without a barrier and talk to the scientific team that's working on the fossils,\" says Zanno. When that work began, Zanno also figured the carnivorous dinosaur was the world's most complete juvenile  T. rex  ever found. \"But as soon as we started actually studying this specimen, we realized there were a lot of red flags,\" she says. For context, paleontologists had previously debated whether small-bodied tyrannosaurs were teenage  T. rexes  or a different species altogether. The existence of a two-legged tyrannosaur species that lived alongside  T. rex  was proposed back in the 1940s, but had long since fallen out of favor. The consensus converged on juvenile  T. rex , \"meaning it would have been the only major predator in end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid impact,\" says Zanno. Most researchers believed that  T. rex  — which could be  12 feet high , 40 feet long and weigh around 15,000 pounds — had outcompeted all other meat-eating dinosaurs. The completeness of the new skeleton provided Zanno with the ideal specimen to test these long-standing conclusions. \"This is such a controversial topic,\" she says. \"And we don't want to write another paper that just stirs the pot. We want to write the paper that ends the debate.\" The dueling dinosaurs settle a duel One of the first of those red flags in the new specimen was the arm bones. They looked completely different than  T. rex 's puny appendages. \"We never had a complete arm of this animal,\" says Zanno. \"These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. They were using them for prey capture.\" Contrast that with  T. rex , \"an animal that's a mouth on legs.\" There were additional clues. The animal had fewer tail vertebrae and more teeth than  T. rex . Zanno and Napoli considered other lines of evidence. They created 3D models of numerous purported  T. rex es against which they compared their specimen. They looked at the growth stages of the cranial nerves and sinuses of close living relatives of dinosaurs, features that were visible in the fossilized skeleton. \"But maybe the most important and damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all,\" she says. This conclusion was based on slicing through the fossil's limb bones to examine the growth rings. That work demonstrated that this animal was mature and done growing when it died around the age of 20. \"That means it's half the size and a tenth of the mass of a full grown  Tyrannosaurus rex ,\" says Zanno. All of the results point to one conclusion, according to Zanno and Napoli. This was no teen  T. rex . This was a fully grown  Nanotyrannus lancensis  — the same species first identified in the 1940s and later largely dismissed by the paleontological community. It was \"a small, slender pursuit predator that could run under the legs of a  T. rex ,\" explains Zanno. In addition, while making models of all those other alleged  T. rex  skeletons, Zanno says they identified another new species of tyrannosaur, one they're calling  Nanotyrannus lethaeus . \"The name comes from Greco-Roman mythology for the [Lethe] River where souls used to drink and forget their prior lives and be reincarnated,\" she says. \"That's a reference to this animal having been under our nose and not recognized for what it was.\" For years, most researchers believed there was just one tyrannosaur —  rex . But now the king has been de-throned. There were at least two other tyrannosaurs holding court. \"It tells us that these end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid hit were flourishing,\" says Zanno. \"They had an abundance of different predators. And refutes this idea that dinosaurs were in decline before the asteroid struck.\" Loving being wrong Thomas Holtz , a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who wasn't involved in the research, welcomes the broader picture of tyrannosaur diversity proposed by the new study. \"I always said with sufficient evidence, I'd be happy to embrace it,\" he says. \"And now I can because there's sufficient evidence. I think they've made a very strong case.\" Though, he adds, \"We'll see if it lasts. As I like to point out, taxonomy is not permanent,\" referring to the study of how organisms are classified (and, sometimes, re-classified). Holtz argues that one consequence of the study is that paleontologists no longer know what a juvenile  T. rex  looked like — because previously assumed \"teenagers\" were likely  Nanotyrannus . That's an arena of future research and discovery, along with fleshing out the varied biologies and behaviors of this growing group of tyrannosaurs. Zanno agrees that there remains much to understand. She believes there's likely to be additional dinosaur species that have been hidden in plain sight in museums and collections across the world. \"This is why I love science,\" says Zanno. \"I have the only job in the world where my job is to second-guess myself every day and everything I think I know.\" \"When it comes to shedding doubt on research on Earth's most famous dinosaur,\" she says, referring to  T. rex , \"that's an intimidating endeavor. But this is how we grow as a profession and how we grow as scientists.\" Zanno believes this study will pave the way for paleontologists to look for more complex patterns in this and other prehistoric ecosystems. \"From here forward,\" Zanno adds, \"what I'm most thrilled about is how much we stand to learn by recognizing that we got it wrong the first time.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Think of Tyrannosaurus rex, a fearsome dinosaur and the top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. Well, a new discovery suggests T. rex likely shared its dominion with another tyrannosaur species. The king had company. Here's science reporter Ari Daniel. ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: We start with Clayton Phipps... CLAYTON PHIPPS: I'm a rancher and a cowboy and a dinosaur hunter. DANIEL: ...Whose friend had found an exposed pelvis and femur at the bottom of a canyon in eastern Montana. The bones belong to a stunning triceratops. Then after excavating for about two weeks, there in the dug-up sand, Phipps spotted something the color of chocolate - a claw. But triceratops didn't have claws. PHIPPS: I'm like, what? I start brushing, and all of a sudden this arm starts to appear and part of the leg. Oh, man, my hat went in the air about 200 feet (laughter) 'cause I was like, no way. There's another dinosaur in here. DANIEL: This was a bipedal, carnivorous tyrannosaur entwined with the triceratops. PHIPPS: Just laying like they died. DANIEL: Phipps sold the fossils to the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, where Lindsay Zanno is head of paleontology. LINDSAY ZANNO: It's one of the most incredible specimens from the late Cretaceous in North America I've ever seen. DANIEL: Zanno and the museum built an entire wing around the dueling dinosaurs to house a live-action research experience. ZANNO: It's the only place in the world where you get to enter the working paleo lab and talk to the scientific team. DANIEL: Like many of her colleagues, Zanno started out thinking the carnivorous dinosaur was a juvenile T. rex, perhaps the most complete teenage tyrannosaur ever found. ZANNO: But as soon as we started actually studying this specimen, we realized there were a lot of red flags. DANIEL: One red flag was the arm bones, which were unlike T. rex's puny appendages. ZANNO: These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. DANIEL: The animal had fewer tail vertebrae than T. rex and more teeth. ZANNO: But maybe the most damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all. DANIEL: By slicing through the limb bones to examine the growth rings, Zanno and her colleagues found this animal was done growing when it died. It all pointed to one conclusion, she says. This was no teen T. rex. This was a different tyrannosaur species whose existence was long dismissed by most paleontologists. This was a fully grown Nanotyrannus lancensis. ZANNO: A small, slender pursuit predator that could run under the legs of a T. rex. This is an animal that's using its arms to hunt prey. Tyrannosaurus rex is an animal that's a mouth on legs. DANIEL: For years, most researchers believe there was just one tyrannosaur, rex. This work dethrones the king. There were other tyrannosaurs holding court. ZANNO: It tells us that these end Cretaceous ecosystems were flourishing before the asteroid struck. DANIEL: The findings appear in the journal Nature. Thomas Holtz is a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who wasn't involved in the study. He welcomes the broader picture of tyrannosaur diversity. THOMAS HOLTZ: I always said, with sufficient evidence, I'd be happy to embrace it. And now I can. But we'll see if it lasts. As I like to point out, taxonomy is not permanent. DANIEL: The study opens up numerous research avenues about the varied biologies (ph) and behaviors of what appears to be a growing group of tyrannosaurs. Lindsay Zanno again. ZANNO: This is why I love science. What I'm most thrilled about is how much we stand to learn by recognizing that we got it wrong the first time. DANIEL: For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel.

The comet is special both because it is interstellar — meaning it came from outside our solar system — and also because nickel vapor was detected in the gas surrounding the comet. This comet,  called 3I/ATLAS , is only the third such interstellar object to enter our solar system in recorded history. Observing such a rare occurrence is \"extremely valuable for us,\" because it's the only opportunity to look at this object before it moves out of our solar system, said Darryl Z. Seligman, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University, who is coordinating international teams of scientists that are observing 3I/ATLAS. Rohan Rahatgaonkar, a Ph.D. student at the Instituto de Astrofísica-Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, and Thomas Puzia, who led the team there that made the discovery, were among the authors of a new  research paper  describing the nickel vapor detection. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The findings are notable because the nickel   gas surrounding 3I/ATLAS was detected at a huge distance from the sun (nearly four times Earth's distance from the sun) where temperatures are too cold for metals to normally vaporize, Rahatgaonkar told NPR in an interview. \"It was pretty clear that it was nickel,\" Puzia said of the data. \"So it was super, super exciting.\" Puzia cautions that there's still a lot of evidence collection and research to be done into what these findings could mean. But this study into  3I/ATLAS  opens the door for new insights into the chemistry of objects and materials that originate far outside of our solar system and are likely billions of years old, he said. The comet could be older than our solar system 3I/ATLAS was first confirmed on July 1 to be the third interstellar object known to have come into our solar system, in a sky survey by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). When Rahatgaonkar and another student, Baltasar Luco, were set to observe the comet through the Southern Astrophysical Research (or SOAR) Telescope in Chile, they were not looking for nickel vapors. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But over multiple days of observations with the Very Large Telescope in Chile and as 3I/ATLAS continued its journey closer to the sun, Rahatgaonkar and other researchers found that levels of nickel vapor continued to increase. They measured the nickel using a host of instruments including a spectrograph and by looking at characteristics of the light coming off the comet. Rahatgaonkar and Puzia also credit a team of researchers around the world, using telescopes and other instruments, for helping to observe and analyze data on the comet. The analysis of this object is far from over. As it continues its journey close to the sun, it will undergo thermodynamic changes which will cause reactions that could, hopefully, give scientists more clues about where 3I/ATLAS was formed, how it evolved, what it carries and many more potential answers, Puzia said. This particular interstellar comet \"could be maybe older than our solar system,\" Rahatgaonkar said. The chemical signatures being emitted from 3I/ATLAS \"reflect the ancient origin and its long journey through interstellar space.\" Rahatgaonkar, Puzia and Seligman emphasized how valuable interstellar objects are to understanding star systems outside of our own solar system. They offer chemical and physical details from those systems and where they formed, potentially billions of years ago. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5590818","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"13:06:00-04:00","title":"Trump says he wants to resume nuclear testing.

Here's what that would mean \n         By Geoff Brumfiel \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 1:06 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump said on Thursday that  the U.S. would begin testing nuclear weapons again  for the first time in decades. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We've halted many years ago, but with others doing testing I think it's appropriate to do so,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. Experts say that the resumption of testing would be a major escalation and could upend the nuclear balance of power. \"I think a decision to resume nuclear testing would be extremely dangerous and would do more to benefit our adversaries than the United States,\" said Corey Hinderstein, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for Nuclear Peace. Here's what a test would involve, and why the president might be calling for one now. There's currently only one place America could test a nuke — near Las Vegas, Nevada The Nevada National Security Site , approximately 60 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is currently the only place where America could test a nuclear weapon, said Robert Peters, a senior research fellow for strategic deterrence at the Heritage Foundation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Nevada site is around 1,300 square miles in size, larger than the state of Rhode Island. Starting in the 1950s, scientists conducted atmospheric nuclear tests at the site, but from 1962 to 1992, testing was done underground. Today, testing would likely be done in \"a complex of deep underground mineshafts,\" Peters said. Scientists dig a deep shaft either directly below ground or into the side of a mountain. They then put a nuclear device in a chamber at the end of the shaft and seal it up. The detonation is contained by the rock, reducing the risk of atmospheric fallout. Although underground testing is far safer than atmospheric testing, it still carries risks, said Hinderstein. In the past, some radioactive fallout has leaked from test shafts. Additionally, the test could shake buildings as far away as Las Vegas, and Hinderstein said some of the newer buildings in Vegas could even be at risk of damage. \"All of these big high-rises — including Stratosphere, including the Trump Hotel,\" she said. \"They're not designed for massive, significant seismic activity.\" America's last test in Nevada was over 30 years ago At the end of the Cold War, the world's major nuclear powers declared a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. Russia, then the Soviet Union, tested its last nuclear weapon in 1990, the U.S. conducted its final test in 1992, and China conducted its last test in 1996. The voluntary test moratorium has been in place as part of an effort to maintain nuclear stability. The U.S currently uses scientific experiments and supercomputer simulations to make sure its bombs still work. Last year, NPR was one of a handful of organizations granted  rare access  to the top-secret underground tunnels where the tests take place. Scientists working in the tunnels said they were confident they could continue to ensure the safety of America's nuclear weapons without testing. Although a full-scale nuclear detonation would be \"complementary\" to current experiments, \"our assessment is that there are no system questions that would be answered by a test, that would be worth the expense and the effort and the time,\" Don Haynes, a nuclear weapons scientist from Los Alamos National Laboratory told NPR as they walked through the tunnels. Indeed Hinderstein says, preparing for a nuclear test is no small matter. While a basic demonstration test could be done in approximately 18 months. Conducting a test that would produce scientifically useful data would likely take years. Trump's announcement is likely reacting to some recent tests by Russia On Sunday,  Russia announced  it had conducted a successful test of a new nuclear-powered cruise missile. Then on Wednesday President Vladimir Putin announced the successful test of another doomsday weapon —  a nuclear-powered underwater drone , which Russia says can be used to attack coastal cities. Trump never called out Russia by name, but he did suggest recent testing was behind the announcement. \"I see them testing,\" he said aboard Air Force One, \"and I say, 'Well if they're going to test I guess we have to test.'\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While testing nuclear-powered weapons is not the same as testing nuclear weapons themselves, Russia's tests are highly provocative. They come just months before the expiration of the last nuclear treaty between the U.S. and Russia, designed to put limits on their arsenals. The back-and-forth has all the hallmarks of the start of an arms race, noted Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation for American Scientists. \"We saw this play out throughout the Cold War through nuclear testing, nuclear deployments, nuclear investments,\" he said. Many experts warn that now is not the time to resume nuclear testing Hinderstein, who served as a deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency responsible for America's nuclear weapons, from 2021 to 2024, said that a decision to resume testing would not be in America's interests. By the end of the Cold War, the U.S. had conducted more than a thousand nuclear tests — far more than any other nation (China, by comparison, had conducted just 45). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Other nations \"have more to gain by resuming nuclear testing than the United States does,\" she said. Testing would likely be expensive, adds Paul Dean, vice president for global nuclear policy at the Nuclear Threat Initiative. \"The cost estimates I've seen have been at around, ballpark, $140 million per test,\" he said. \"It's not necessary to conduct a nuclear explosive test right now,\" agreed Robert Peters of the Heritage Foundation. But he added, \"But there could very well be compelling reasons to test in the coming months and years. That's how bad things are getting.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   It has been 33 years since the United States last tested a nuclear weapon. Now President Trump says he wants to do it again. Here he is on Air Force One earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, we have more than anybody.

So I guess my question is, who's they? BRUMFIEL: Yeah. It wasn't entirely clear from what he said, but experts I spoke to today agree it's almost certainly Russia. On Sunday, Russia announced it had successfully tested a nuclear-powered cruise missile. Then yesterday, it said it had tested a nuclear-powered torpedo. Now, nuclear-powered things obviously aren't the same as nuclear bombs, but both the missile and torpedo are designed to carry nuclear warheads. And these tests are very provocative because these devices could get around Trump's proposed Golden Dome missile defense system. SUMMERS: OK. So if the U.S. were to test a nuclear weapon, let's say, what would be involved? BRUMFIEL: Well, first of all, there's only one place they can do it, and that's in the desert outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. It's a place called the Nevada National Security Site. It's absolutely massive. I was out there last year. It's bigger than the state of Rhode Island. SUMMERS: Huh. BRUMFIEL: Basically, they dig a hole, bury the weapon thousands of feet underground, and then they detonate it. Corey Hinderstein is at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and until last year, she was high up in the agency that manages America's nuclear weapons. She told me this. COREY HINDERSTEIN: The president is talking about sending a signal. And if the goal is to shake the ground, then we could do it on the timeline that he's required. BRUMFIEL: But the test site is not ready to do a really scientific test. They don't have the experiment design. They don't have the instrumentation. That kind of test would take years to develop because the U.S. hasn't tested since 1992. SUMMERS: Well, why has it been so long since the U.S. tested a nuclear weapon? BRUMFIEL: At the end of the Cold War, the world's great nuclear powers voluntarily stopped testing kind of as a gesture of goodwill. That voluntary moratorium has held in part because the U.S. has spent billions of dollars on supercomputers to simulate nuclear weapons. They like to call it a bang in a box. And actually, many experts told me the moratorium works to the U.S.' advantage. They have data from over a thousand nuclear tests already on the books. China, by contrast, for example, has just 45. Hinderstein says America's adversaries would gain a lot more from additional testing than the U.S. would. HINDERSTEIN: While we could potentially gain incrementally - but even that is questionable - they could stand to gain a lot and not suffer the political hit by being the first to resume testing. BRUMFIEL: I should add, there are possible environmental consequences too. Radioactive material can leak from underground sometimes. And there's some concern that shaking from the test could actually damage buildings all the way in Vegas. SUMMERS: So Geoff, the Russians have tested these new weapons, and America may test a nuclear bomb for the first time in decades. So I do have to ask, is this a new arms race? BRUMFIEL: You know, the experts I spoke to were divided on that. During the Cold War, we had so many nukes, and so did the Russia. It was sort of insane. Now, things aren't as bad as they used to be, but everyone agrees these are the dynamics that drive an arms race. You know, one side does one thing, and then the other side says, I've got to look strong, so I'm going to respond with something else. So there's a lot of concern over what's happening. SUMMERS: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, thank you. BRUMFIEL: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1199885817","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-14","timeOfPublication":"10:56:00-04:00","title":"7 surprising ways the public library can save you money","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article highlights seven surprising ways public libraries can help individuals save money, including borrowing tools, video games, and seeds; accessing free tickets to museums and state parks; printing documents at low costs; receiving free tutoring and test prep; attending free fitness and language classes; enjoying free concerts; and accessing free social services such as job training, ESL classes, tax help, and legal advice.

  By Marielle Segarra, Audrey Nguyen \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, October 14, 2025 • 10:56 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on Oct. 16, 2023, and has been updated.   Everyone knows you can save money on books by checking them out at the library instead of buying them. But did you know that libraries can help you save on other things too?  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In some locations, you can borrow tools (saving a purchase at the hardware store), take free language classes and even get free tickets to local museums and attractions.  The resources that your library has to offer will depend on its size and funding, which comes in part from taxpayer dollars and donor funds. These perks are part of the public library's mission to serve the  needs of the local community , says  Joan Johnson , library director at Milwaukee Public Library. \"Libraries are one of the most important parts of the social infrastructure. The possibilities for how you explore are endless.\"  To take advantage of these money-saving benefits, sign up for a library card, says  Mychal Threets , a librarian, literacy advocate and the new host of PBS'  Reading Rainbow . Then check out the library website or simply walk into your local library and talk to a librarian.  Here are 7 surprising ways the library can help you save money.  1. Before you buy something, see if you can borrow it from the library  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Libraries offer all kinds of items on loan. \" Video games ,  musical instruments ,  board games . Some libraries have  bakeware collections  where you can get baking pans,\" says Threets. Akhila Bhat, branch manager at Harris County Public Library in Katy, Texas, says her library system has a  seed library . \"Patrons can pick up seeds to start a garden and drop off seeds for others to take home and plant.\"  Meanwhile, libraries like the Providence Public Library in Rhode Island  have tools you can check out . That includes a cordless drill, safety goggles and a laser level.  2. Reserve free tickets to local museums and attractions  In some places, you can get free or discounted tickets to local attractions in your city or town. The Nashville Public Library, for example,  offers free tickets  to the Country Music Hall of Fame (saving patrons $31.95 in admission fees). And  library card holders in California  can gain free entry to over 200 state parks,  saving patrons $20 in entry fees . 3. Print out your documents at a discount \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       You can use the computers to print out documents like plane tickets, concert tickets or shipping labels. There's usually a small fee, but it's often cheaper than printing at an office supply store or a shipping center, says Threets. For example, it costs  10 cents  to print a page in black and white at the Brooklyn Public Library in New York, and  26 cents  at Fedex.  4. Get free help with homework and standardized tests Your library card may grant you access to free  online help from expert tutors  or  Tutor.com , which offers live one-on-one homework help for students in K-12 and higher education. It's a sweet deal considering that hourly rates for a private tutor  can range from $25-80 an hour .  If you're preparing for college, check out whether your local branch has resources for standardized tests like the  SAT or ACT . Broward County Library in Florida, for example, has a free 10-hour test prep workshop for high school students  that can cost hundreds of dollars elsewhere .  Librarians can help with school projects too. If you need to research something, they can identify relevant books or order them from other branches for you. Bhat says a lot of kids come in looking for help with biographies.  5. Take free fitness, hobby and language classes  Some libraries often offer fun, free programming you'd pay money for elsewhere.  Queens Public Library  in New York offers workout classes ranging from yoga to tai chi to Zumba, saving patrons potentially hundreds of dollars in monthly class fees at a fitness studio.  Libraries can also help you find a new hobby. You can join a  knitting club , learn  photography  or  take a class with a naturalist . Some locations will even let patrons borrow the necessary gear.  Libraries in Florida  and  Philadelphia , for example, have \"birding backpacks\" that come equipped with items for  birdwatching , like binoculars and field guides to help identify local birds. And many libraries grant patrons access to  online language learning resources  such as  Mango Languages , a service that has courses for over 70 languages.  6. Attend free concerts and performances  Save money on live music by checking out what your local branch has to offer. The New York Public Library's performance art space, for example, has  upcoming concerts  featuring a choir and a quartet. And people can  attend performances  for Baroque or Peruvian music at different libraries in Los Angeles County. 7. Access free social services   In addition to recreation and entertainment, many libraries in the U.S. offer programs to support the community. People who need help finding a job can take  computer literacy courses  and get assistance with  applications  and  interview prep . Immigrants can take  English as a Second Language (ESL) classes  and  classes  to prepare them for their U.S. citizenship exam. Libraries also provide resources for practical matters. Around  tax time , check if there are  volunteer tax experts  available to give you advice and  help you file for free . You can also  book time with a lawyer  if you need legal advice.  Johnson says library resources like these aim to level the playing field. \"The hope is that people use our services to educate and inform themselves, and gain wisdom about any topic under the sun.\"  The audio was edited by Meghan Keane and Sylvie Douglis.

But the proposals prompted a flurry of activity from more than 100 lobbyists from tech companies and their trade associations trying to weigh in, according to disclosure reports. The result: All four times, the proposal failed, including just last month. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Following a long-heralded meeting between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping , the sale of U.S. technology to China remains among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces, with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake . But the tough talk about China obscures a deeper story: Even while warning about national security and human rights abuse, the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations has repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police, government agencies and surveillance companies, an Associated Press investigation has found.

For example, despite U.S. export rules around advanced chips, China bought $20.7 billion worth of chipmaking equipment from U.S. companies in 2024 to bolster its homegrown industry, a report from a congressional committee this month warned.

And in recent months, the president himself has struck grand deals with Silicon Valley firms that even more closely tie the U.S. economy to tech exports to China, giving taxpayers a direct stake in the profits for the first time. Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. Follow on In August, Trump announced a deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns from national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services. Trump said after Thursday’s meeting with Xi that China would follow up with Nvidia on the sales of chips but did not announce any resolution. Trump also has announced that the U.S. government has taken a 10 percent stake in Intel worth around $11 billion. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Longtime Chinese activist Zhou Fengsuo said the U.S. government is letting American companies set the agenda and ignoring how they help Beijing surveil and censor its own people.

An AP investigation in September found that American companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known. “It’s driven by profit, and that’s why these strategic discussions have been silenced or delayed,” Zhou said. “I’m extremely disappointed. … this is a strategic failure by the United States.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Hundreds of millions in lobbying The sale of technology to China is contentious among both Republicans and Democrats, with some arguing for a harder stance.

For example, despite U.S. sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang in 2019, Dahua and Hikvision, China’s two largest surveillance companies, use AWS to offer networked surveillance abroad , according to marketing material on the company websites . Hikvision markets a video surveillance platform called “HikCentral” to private companies overseas, which can be also deployed on Azure, according to a post on Hikvision’s website this year . Microsoft denied providing services to Hikvision or partnering with them to provide services to others. OpenAI, which provides its advanced AI models through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, said it was subject to Microsoft’s policies and doesn’t support China’s access to its services. AWS did not respond on the record to questions about the cloud services loophole. Another enduring loophole is in the restrictions passed after the Tiananmen massacre that didn’t include newer policing technologies, such as security cameras, surveillance drives, or facial recognition systems. In 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013, lawmakers introduced bills to try and close the loophole. All failed. The U.S. government under both Republican and Democratic presidents has made other attempts to regulate tech surveillance exports to China. In 2008, the Department of Commerce asked for comment on whether to include “biometric devices” and “integrated security systems” under controlled exports, but ran out of time before the next administration came in. In 2014 and 2015, it tried to tighten controls on surveillance products , but most fell through. In 2024, it sought to restrict exports of face-recognition systems and bar many more military, police, and intelligence end users from receiving U.S. goods, with no success. Some politicians on both sides of the aisle blame the failures in part on the money and political influence of tech companies. “I think we’ve been naive or complicit in the extreme,” said New Jersey GOP Rep. Chris Smith. The U.S., he said, has been “selling and conveying to a malevolent power the ability to destroy us and destroy like-minded Western democracies.” “What do all those companies all have in common? A big wallet,” said Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon. “That is as much as anything is what’s behind the fact we haven’t made as much progress.” A rickshaw driver transports wounded people, with the help of bystanders, to a nearby hospital in Beijing, on Sunday, June 4, 1989, after PLA soldiers fired rounds towards crowds gathered outside Tiananmen Square.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More A history of failures to close loopholes The first round of U.S. prohibitions on Chinese police came after the Tiananmen massacre and applied to “crime control and detection” equipment. They largely stopped U.S. companies from exporting goods to Chinese entities such as restraints, helmets, shields and batons. But the controls were narrowly confined to largely low-tech goods, leaving out advanced technologies that could be used by police and leading at times to puzzling priorities. U.S. regulators warned sex shops against shipping novelty gold handcuffs to China. At the same time, they broadly permitted Silicon Valley companies to sell routers, servers, software, and more recently, AI-powered surveillance systems to Chinese police. For example, despite explicit restrictions on fingerprint recognition systems, U.S. companies still were able to sell gear to process, store and compare fingerprints. In 2006, with bipartisan support, Smith introduced the Global Online Freedom Act to curtail the involvement of American tech companies in Chinese surveillance. Smith drew parallels with IBM’s sale of computing gear to Nazi Germany, which has been well documented by historians . IBM told AP in a follow-up statement that the claim that IBM knowingly collaborated with Nazi Germany was “false and has been rejected by credible historians.” Associations representing the tech and telecommunications industries and dozens of companies stepped up their lobbying against Smith’s proposal, disclosures show. The companies argued the computers, servers and routers they sold in China were no different from what they sold to other countries. Industry groups and individual companies also submitted hundreds of comments to regulators, hoping to influence China-related export regulations. Smith’s bill went nowhere. Rep.

Tech sales to China continued, sometimes with direct government support. Numerous archived webpages show that the U.S. Commercial Service, the export-promoting arm of the Commerce Department, played a crucial role for more than a decade in connecting U.S. vendors to Chinese security agencies and key government officials, including through its marquee Gold Key Matching service. In 2004, the Commercial Service invited American companies selling security technologies and equipment to show off their products at a Chinese security exposition. Two years later, it advertised opportunities for American firms in the “safety and security” market , followed by another publication later describing market opportunities for foreign security products such as inspection control and guard communication systems . Archived webpages also show that under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Commercial Service steadily promoted U.S. participation in policing trade shows , even those that showcased “biological identification technologies” or were initiated by the Chinese Communist Party. Under Bush, the Commerce Department in 2007 hosted a webinar about how to sell to the Chinese security market and promote surveillance tools to China’s public sector. For just $35, the federal agency could offer attendees “market entry-strategies and long-term market penetration plans,” an archived webpage shows. Jeanette Chu, who then worked at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and helped give the 2007 webinar, recalled sometimes having concerns. “I used to ask myself all the time, ‘what is the scary potential of each item?’” said Chu, now a national security and trade expert advising industry. Despite promises to nail shut Washington’s revolving door, President Barack Obama — like presidents before and after him — gave former industry lobbyists and allies top jobs, including Eric Hirschhorn in the Commerce Department, who represented a trade group that lobbied for tech companies exporting abroad. Hirschhorn wrote that Beijing’s surveillance abilities were nothing compared to the half-million surveillance cameras blanketing London. He was put in charge of the office that administers U.S. export controls.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More In an interview, Hirschhorn said export controls alone were an inefficient way to defend human rights. “You can use a computer to type an order or type a love note,” he told AP. “Are you not going to sell computers to China because one out of every 10,000 of them will be used to store data about a dissident?” In 2010, the U.S. State Department’s human rights report warned of “police surveillance, harassment and detentions of activists.” Yet U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman led a mission to promote American business interests in the far-west region of Xinjiang, where authorities had arrested thousands of ethnic Uyghurs and cut internet access after deadly unrest the year before . Huntsman did not respond to requests for comment. That same year, the Commercial Service spotlighted opportunities for U.S. companies to sell equipment directly to China’s central government “to install a city-wide infrastructure of security, surveillance, and alarm systems” on its website. A 2015 State Department draft plan for “smart city” cooperation obtained by AP proposed that China and the U.S. collaborate on joint research, such as on crime and “urban security,” and include private sector players such IBM. Additional documents AP obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request show the U.S. government also sought active counter-terrorism cooperation with China, which gave tech companies a chance for closer contact with Chinese authorities even as Beijing broadly labelled protest or dissent among Uyghurs as terrorism. Documents reviewed by the AP show how the U.S. government helped promote opportunities in the Chinese security market to American companies. (AP video Marshall Ritzel) Kevin Wolf, then an assistant secretary in charge of export controls at Commerce, said as news about human rights abuses inside China kept surfacing, he worried about U.S. innovations falling into the wrong hands. Wolf said he began drafting a rule to regulate certain surveillance gear sales in early 2016. “The problem I was struggling with was, mass surveillance can involve everyday ordinary common items: it’s cameras, it’s software, it’s facial recognition stuff and 99 percent of all of those applications are perfectly benign,” said Wolf, now a compliance attorney for industry. “So if you were to say, ban cameras that can read someone’s face, you blow up international trade.” Wolf’s colleagues told him the draft rule was too complicated, Wolf said, and it foundered. .headline {\n            font-family: \"AP\";\n            font-size: 28px;\n            color: #333;\n            text-decoration: none;\n            text-align: center;\n            display: block;\n            background-color: #ffffff;\n            padding: 5px;\n        }\n        \n        .headline:hover {\n            color: #0066cc;\n        }\n        \n        .image-link img {\n            width: auto;\n        } Photo Gallery: Life Under Surveillance In 2018, Congress passed the Export Control Reform Act, giving Commerce authority to make export control rules about advanced technologies. In 2019 and 2020, the Trump administration sanctioned some Chinese officials and surveillance firms over atrocities in Xinjiang. But sales of surveillance equipment continued, albeit at a slower pace — though references to working with the Chinese police would disappear from annual Commerce Department reports for U.S. industry. In 2021, Joe Biden put out an executive order describing Chinese surveillance tech companies as “unusual and extraordinary threats” that enabled serious human rights abuses. In his final months in office, Biden’s administration drew up sprawling rules for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop AI systems. Commerce also floated an updated version of Wolf’s draft rule to keep facial recognition and other mass surveillance tools from reaching military and intelligence agencies and companies, including in China. But once again, Washington lobbyists, lawyers and politicians pushed back. “The result would slow business considerably and likely result in the loss of customers that do not present any national security or human rights concerns,” said a Chamber of Commerce filing from late last year. The proposed rule, in the end, stalled out. Gulbahar Haitiwaji, an ethnic Uyghur living in France, says little has changed since she testified to Congress in 2023 urging the U.S. government to “stop American companies from continuing to be complicit in surveilling our people”. Gulbahar Haitiwaji, an ethnic Uyghur who wrote a book about the experience of being held in two “re-education” camps and police stations in China for more than two years, is sworn in to testify during a special House committee hearing dedicated to countering China, Thursday, March 23, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

After she was released in 2019, she still found herself living in what she calls “an open-air prison,” with every move monitored, until she finally left Xinjiang later that year. She said U.S. tech companies show little accountability. “It’s truly disappointing that the United States, one of the most powerful countries in the world, would sell such technology to China despite knowing the potential for serious consequences,” Haitiwaji said. —- Burke reported from San Francisco and Washington, Kang reported from Beijing and Tau reported from Washington.

some still see strong earnings \n         By Camila Domonoske \n        \n           Friday, October 31, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Automakers have been footing a hefty tariff bill — to the tune of $30 billion across the industry this year, according to a recent analysis from Moody's. The industry is also grappling with a shortage of semiconductors, leaving them without the chips they need to build some vehicles, as well as a  fire at an aluminum plant  that's hurting the supply chain for Ford and Stellantis. Despite those headwinds, quarterly earnings reports from automakers are so far showing resilience. General Motors reported $3.4 billion in profits last quarter and Ford brought in $2.6 billion, both beating expectations. Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, increased its revenues by 13% year over year. Hyundai, despite seeing a 29% decline in profits compared to the same quarter last year, still plans to meet its targets for the year. Volkswagen Group, on the other hand, reported a more than billion-dollar loss, as it faced the combined costs of tariffs and Porsche's pivot from electric vehicles back to gasoline. Part of the reason for automakers' positive reports is that Trump lowered tariffs on goods from  Japan  and  Europe  from 25% to 15%, and just recently announced a similar deal with  Korea . While a 15% tariff is still substantial, the changes were welcomed by automakers. Meanwhile, a  recent policy change  eased the burden of tariffs on imported parts that go into U.S.-built cars. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Automakers' bottom lines are also getting a boost from  rising car prices . Companies have been cautious about  passing tariff costs along  to consumers, in part because cars are already so expensive — over $50,000 on average, according to Kelley Blue Book. There are real questions about how much more consumers are willing or able to pay. But gradual increases are now visible. Across the industry, prices are up about .5% this year, Ford says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Meanwhile, the Trump administration's  rollback of environmental rules  is benefitting some automakers substantially — in particular, changes to  emissions requirements  that used to penalize automakers if they made too many high-polluting vehicles. Suddenly, automakers do not have to manufacture electric vehicles, which they have struggled to make profitably. And they can build as many large pickup trucks as they can sell — which are both more polluting and more profitable. That's been a boost to companies like GM, Stellantis and Ford, offsetting the costs of tariffs. Of course, that same policy change is a setback for all-electric automakers like Tesla and Rivian. Under the previous rules, automakers that wanted to make gas guzzlers could pay EV manufacturers for \"regulatory credits,\" allowing them to borrow their rivals' green halos — and comply with federal rules. Now, that revenue stream for EV makers is being eliminated. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Tesla had strong sales last quarter, helped by  the rush to buy EVs  as consumers tried to take advantage of the now-eliminated consumer EV tax credit. But profits fell. (On Tesla's quarterly call with investors, Musk,  as   usual , was less interested in talking about those EV sales and much more interested in talking about the humanoid robots that he plans to sell.) Rivian is expected to report earnings next week. Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles. GM is ending production of its electric commercial van, and Stellantis is  leaning heavily  into inefficient Hemi engines, as a new CEO pivots away from a  previous focus on electrification . But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles. \"EVs remain our North Star,\" said Mary Barra, explaining that GM will continue to work on  improved EV batteries . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly  attractive and affordable electric vehicles . But automakers also know that just as the Trump administration did a U-turn on EVs, a future administration might once again make climate change and air pollution major priorities. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We expect adoption will increase over time and the market [will] continue to evolve — and maybe even regulations evolve,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors. So Ford still plans to move forward with  a $30,000 electric pickup , despite the lack of federal tax credits or regulations that would encourage it. \"We think this product is literally at the center of the future of the EV market in the U.S.,\" Farley said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-attack-power-outages-2110169707d2d8c7757ce4fc807cff4c","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"09:37:26+00:00","title":"Russia Strikes Ukraine with Massive Drone and Missile Attack, Causing Widespread Power Outages and Civilian Casualties","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 30, 2025, Russia launched over 650 drones and more than 50 missiles targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, resulting in at least six deaths and 18 injuries, including children.

The latest in a sustained Russian campaign of massive drone and missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure brought power outages and restrictions in all the country’s regions Thursday, officials said, with the Ukrainian prime minister describing Moscow’s tactic as “systematic energy terror.” The strikes, which were the latest in Russia’s almost daily attacks on the Ukrainian power grid as bitter winter temperatures approach, killed at least six people, including a 7-year-old girl, according to authorities. Children between 2 and 16 years of age were among the 18 injured. Russian launched more than 650 drones and more than 50 missiles of various types in the attack, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukrainian cities use centralized public infrastructure to run water, sewage and heating systems, and blackouts stop them from working. Months of attacks have aimed to erode Ukrainian morale as well as disrupt weapons manufacturing and other war-related activity almost four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “Russia continues its systematic energy terror — striking at the lives, dignity, and warmth of Ukrainians on the eve of winter.

Obama's home \n         By Carrie Johnson \n        \n           Thursday, October 30, 2025 • 5:12 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A federal judge has sentenced a man to time served for making a  hoax threat  near the D.C. residence of former President Barack Obama two years ago, prompting a massive law enforcement response that included a bomb squad and sniffer dogs. Taylor Taranto, of Pasco, Wash., spent 22 months in the troubled D.C. jail facility while he waited for trial on allegations that he suggested his van was rigged with explosives.  Authorities never found any such devices, though they did recover firearms and a machete. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols noted that Taranto had no criminal history — partly because the Justice Department had previously moved to dismiss several charges related to Taranto's participation in the siege on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. President Trump  granted clemency  to Taranto and virtually every Jan. 6 defendant on the first day he returned to the White House this year. But the storming of the Capitol and the Justice Department response to it continue to reverberate, especially within the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington. Trump and his cabinet officials are trying to rewrite the history of that day, in part by firing or forcing out law enforcement officials who investigated cases related to the riot.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This week the Justice Department sidelined two veteran prosecutors who had worked on the Taranto case and took the rare step of withdrawing a sentencing memo they had filed. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro declined to comment on any personnel decisions but in a statement said \"we want to make very clear that we take violence and threats of violence against law enforcement, current or former government officials extremely seriously.\" \"We have and will continue to vigorously pursue justice against those who commit or threaten violence without regard to the political party of the offender or the target,\" Pirro said in the statement. Original sentencing memo sealed, replaced The original sentencing memo in Taranto's case detailed how a \"mob of rioters\" attacked the seat of government as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 election. It also mentioned that Taranto headed in the direction of Obama's home after Trump reposted an address of a location on social media. A replacement sentencing memo, filed by a new pair of DOJ lawyers, scrubbed both of those references. The electronic court docket last night listed the original memo as sealed. Judge Nichols said it was \"not entirely clear\" how that memo had come to be sealed and that he intended to release it unless the DOJ could justify keeping it hidden. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The judge did not press the new attorneys for details about the rare, last-minute personnel switch. But he went out of his way to praise the sidelined prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White. \"I just want to express my view that they did a commendable and excellent job in this case,\" Judge Nichols said. \"They also held the highest standards of professionalism.\" At a press conference on a D.C. crime issue, Pirro declined to answer whether she ordered the original sentencing memo in the Taranto case to be revoked. \"I think the papers speak for themselves and what goes on in this office is not something I'm going to comment on to the press,\" Pirro said. Valdivia and White listened on from the audience in the sixth floor courtroom, surrounded by some of the lawyers who had supervised hundreds of Capitol riot cases — only to be fired or forced out of the Justice Department this year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Taranto, a Navy veteran with two children, has since returned home to Washington state. He will be required to serve three years of supervised release, undergo a mental health assessment, and to avoid firearms and controlled substances. \"There's nothing that he did, in fact, that was violent,\" said defense attorney Carmen Hernandez. \"The firearms were in a locked compartment in a van.\" Taranto signaled he would appeal in the coming weeks. He used his brief time before the judge to address what he called \"deeply troubling issues concerning our founding, our history\" and \"election fraud for the 2020 election.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/black-lives-matter-fraud-doj-investigation-trump-371e3277ff3b78bc73d3467c4692c66c","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"21:26:20Z","title":"U.S. Justice Department Investigates Black Lives Matter for Possible Donor Fraud","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether leaders of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during 2020 protests over George Floyd’s murder.

The foundation said it took in over $90 million in donations following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the U.S. and around the world. Critics of the nonprofit foundation, and of the BLM movement broadly, accused organizers of not being transparent about how it was spending the donations. That criticism grew louder after BLM foundation leaders in 2022 confirmed they used donations to purchase a $6 million Los Angeles-area property that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The leaders previously denied wrongdoing and publicly released tax documents. No prior investigations into the nonprofit’s finances have yielded proof of impropriety. Leaders of the foundation have received subpoenas. In a statement emailed to the AP on Thursday, the foundation said it “is not a target of any federal criminal investigation.” “We remain committed to full transparency, accountability, and the responsible stewardship of resources dedicated to building a better future for Black communities,” the foundation said in the statement. Several localized BLM chapters, which are not affiliates of the foundation, have previously been at odds with the nonprofit over its plans for donations. Those chapters operate and fundraise independently of the foundation. The Black Lives Matter movement first emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan “Black lives matter” a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Movement founders and organizers pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters.

He was permitted to effectively remain the office’s chief prosecutor but with a different title of First Assistant United States Attorney. Essayli had previously served as a Republican assemblyman in California, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s COVID-19 restrictions.

At the time, city-sanctioned BLM murals had been painted on roadways in cities throughout the U.S. in an expression of solidarity with the racial justice movement. Essayli was quoted as telling reporters that his clients were simply expressing their political viewpoints and that they disagreed with taxpayer funds being used to “sponsor” Black Lives Matter, which he described as a “radical” group. At the height of the Floyd-sparked reckoning on racial injustice, some state officials vowed their own investigations in the foundation’s finances, citing their responsibility to protect residents who may have donated to BLM. But most of those probes were resolved without official action. In 2022, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed a lawsuit against the BLM foundation for failing to comply with an investigation into the organization’s finances. Soon after, a representative of the foundation responded with the necessary information and documentation, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said, and the lawsuit was dismissed. ___ Alana Durkin Richer in Washington, D.C., and Graham Lee Brewer in Oklahoma City contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/cempasuchil-mexico-marigol-day-of-dead-climate-997b90e2e827ad543992ec8507837b6e","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:05:37+00:00","title":"Climate Change Threatens Mexico’s Traditional Cempasuchil Flower Farming","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Farmers in Mexico, particularly in the Xochimilco region near Mexico City, are facing severe crop losses due to extreme weather events linked to climate change.

This year alone, cempasuchil producers said they lost up to half their flower crop from heavy rains and flooding. “This year, we lost a lot. We struggled to even grow the cempasuchil. There were moments in which we didn’t have the money to buy fertilizer we needed,” Ortiz said. “With the cempasuchil plants, we’ve sometimes been left with nothing.” ‘Flower of the dead’ The orange flower has become a symbol of the country’s celebrations that take place every Nov. 1 and 2. Also known as the “flower of the dead”, the cempasuchil is believed to be a point of connection between the worlds of the dead and the living, with bright petals that light the path of dead souls to the altars set out by their family. The flowers are also a crucial economic engine across Mexico, which commerce groups predict will rake in nearly 2.7 million dollars for farmers in 2025. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Ortiz and her family began growing the flower 30 years ago in their small plot of land in Xochimilco, a rural borough in the south of Mexico City where residents have continued to carry on ancient farming techniques using canals that wind through farmlands like a maze.

But they say that they’ve been dealt a heavy blow for consecutive years as heavy rains, drought, floods and other climate shifts have made it increasingly difficult to keep their crops alive. This year, torrential rains stretching on for months wiped out more than 37,000 acres of crops across the country, according to government figures. In a visit to cempasuchil fields earlier this month in Xochimilco, Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said that as many of 2 million marigold plants were put at risk. Despite that, she said that production this year simultaneously broke a record of 6 million plants as farmers ramp up to meet increasing demand even as growing the flower has become more precarious. Ortiz said the excess of rain has brought on pests, diseases and rotted the roots of her plants. She estimates she lost at least 30% of her crop, while others say they’ve lost closer to 50%. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The family has been forced to drop money on insecticides, fertilizer and more to save their crops. As they have, razor thin profit margins have turned into losses, and they’ve had to cut back on basics like beef and sweets to make ends meet. “If I were to take a hard look at all our losses, I’d be incredibly disillusioned and even not want to grow them anymore,” she said. “We’re just trying to push forward and make sure this keeps going on.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Adapting to climate change Just down the road from Ortiz’s farm, government scientists are searching for long-term solutions beyond the short-term economic relief provided by the local government. In a small seed bank known as Toxinachcal, men in white suits meticulously pick through sprouts in a lab dish. The scientists have been at work for a year and a half saving up thousands of seed variants of native plant species, including 20 variants of cempasuchil, in jars lining giant freezers in the hopes that the storage facility will be a key tool in fighting the most adverse effects of climate change. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Biologist Clara Soto Cortés, head of the seed bank, said part of the reason that the crop has been devastated is because farmers in recent years have elected to use a hybrid marigold seed variant from the United States.

But that means farmers have turned away from sturdier, native breeds, which have longer stocks and widely vary in color, size and texture. The genetic diversity of these Mexican breeds makes them more resilient to drastic climate shifts like the ones seen this year, Soto said. “These native seeds have adapted to different geographies, in high altitudes and low, in places where there’s a lot of rain or there’s none at all, or where they need to be resistant to insects,” she said. “The (hybrid) seeds have been bred for another purpose. It doesn’t have the genetic diversity needed to take on climate change.” If more climate events, like the floods that roiled producers wipe out an entire crop, Soto said the bank will make seeds available to local producers to recover their crops – this time with a more resilient variant that their ancestors have been farming for centuries. Carrying on an ancient tradition Meanwhile, growers are scrambling to bounce back in the short term, saying the losses also represent a threat to the farming tradition their families have struggled to maintain on the edge of the dense city of 23 million people. Carlos Jiménez, 61, has long worked the fields of Xochimilco, but began to grow the shorter marigold plants eight years ago when he noticed the hybrid was more marketable. As he’s lost more crops and gotten lower prices for the plants because of the mildew gathering at their roots, he said he’s begun considering ways to adapt, like building greenhouses. “The plants get sick, they rot, and our business is snuffed out,” Jiménez said. “And with it goes our tradition because it’s our economy.” Flor Jimenez waters her crop of cempasuchil flowers in preparation for Day of the Dead celebrations in Xochimilco where marigolds are grown on the outskirts of Mexico City, Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025.

She said she’s begun to look at other crops she might be able to farm that are more resilient than the crinkled orange flowers.

In a Wednesday letter to the Trump administration’s top Supreme Court litigator, D. John Sauer, Reps. Chris Smith of New Jersey and John Moolenaar of Michigan urged the administration to side with the Falun Gong plaintiffs and press the court to allow the lawsuit to go to trial. Smith co-chairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, while Moolenaar is the chairman of a special China committee set up in the House of Representatives — and both are prominent critics of Beijing’s human rights record. The letter cited an AP investigation last month that showed American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, saying it “underscore(s) the need to deter American firms from supplying technology to facilitate the CCP’s human rights abuses.” freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The decision ultimately rests with the Supreme Court whether to hear the challenge brought by Cisco arguing that U.S. law does not permit such a suit.

Follow on “The allegation that an American tech company custom-designed a tool to facilitate the violent persecution of a religious minority by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is a serious one,” the two lawmakers wrote in a letter to Sauer. “We believe the Plaintiffs deserve the chance to prove their claims.” “We have a longstanding commitment to uphold and respect human rights for all people and if the 2023 ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court stands, it opens the floodgates for suits against U.S. corporations merely for legal exports of off-the-shelf goods and services,” said a spokesperson for Cisco. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The case has a long and winding history dating back more than a decade. In 2008, documents leaked to the press showed Cisco saw the “Golden Shield” as a sales opportunity, quoting a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an “evil cult.” A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web. Other presentations reviewed by AP show that Cisco represented Falun Gong material as a “threat” and built out a national information system to track Falun Gong believers. In 2011, Falun Gong members sued Cisco, alleging the company tailored technology for Beijing that they knew would be used to track, detain and torture believers. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether an American company can be held liable under two separate laws for aiding and abetting human rights violations. Cisco argues it isn’t liable under those laws, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), but a federal appeals court rejected the company’s arguments in 2023, allowing the case to continue. Now Cisco is asking the Supreme Court to throw out that ruling and stop the lawsuit. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. In the case of Cisco, the Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco’s activities involving China took place in the United States. An AP investigation this week found that the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police and surveillance companies, even as activists warned such tools were being used to quash dissent , persecute religious groups and target minorities . freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Going into the long-heralded meeting Thursday between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping , the sale of U.S. technology to China has been among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces, with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake . Trump said after the meeting that China will speak with Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia about purchasing their computer chips. Debate over the sale of technology to China has grown heated, with some arguing for a harder stance. American companies have pushed back against restrictions, arguing it will push China to develop its own domestic supply and strengthen its position in the global race for leadership in artificial intelligence. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); But many national security experts say selling such technology could assist China’s military and intelligence services. The plaintiffs’ lawyers make a similar case, citing Cisco marketing materials in China that promoted routers for use in tanks. If the Cisco suit is successful, it would signal that American companies can be held liable in some circumstances for abuse of their technologies overseas. —- Kang reported from Beijing and Tau reported from Washington.

YORK (AP) — Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur? At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn’t settle the controversy. Now a research team said there’s new evidence that resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton — first uncovered in 2006 in Montana — that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex. The discovery “rewrites decades of research on Earth’s most famous predator,” said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Growth rings within the bones found in Montana’s Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully-fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature’s skull and an adult T. rex’s — changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses — were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.

There’s now “more support and evidence than there ever has been” that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she’s not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new. Other independent scientists also said the debate isn’t over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); There are similarities between the shape of T. rex’s skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps. “I don’t think this study settles everything,” he said. Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago — or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.

and evicted him from his royal residence after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Buckingham Palace said. After the king’s rare move, which follows years of shameful scandals, he will be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and not as a prince, and he will have to vacate his Royal Lodge mansion near Windsor Castle. Demand had been growing on the palace to oust the prince from Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title Duke of York earlier this month over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir hit bookstores last week. But the king went even further to punish him for serious lapses of judgment by removing the title of prince that he has held since birth as a child of a monarch, the late Queen Elizabeth II.

It last happened in 1919, when Prince Ernest Augustus, who was a U.K. royal and also a prince of Hanover, had his British title removed for siding with Germany during World War I. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Toppling a prince Giuffre’s brother declared victory for his sister, who died by suicide in April at the age of 41. “Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage,” her brother Skye Roberts said in a statement to the BBC. Andrew faced a new round of public outrage after emails emerged earlier this month showing he had remained in contact with Epstein longer than he previously admitted. That news was followed by publication of “Nobody’s Girl,” by Giuffre , who alleged she had sex with Andrew when she was 17. The book detailed three alleged sexual encounters with Andrew, who she said acted as if he believed “having sex with me was his birthright.” Andrew, 65, has long denied Giuffre’s claims , but stepped down from royal duties after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he attempted to rebut her allegations. Andrew paid millions in an out-of-court settlement in 2022 after Giuffre filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, he acknowledged Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); King couldn’t avoid the controversy Although Charles was involved in discussions with Andrew before he announced he would relinquish his dukedom two weeks ago, the king had largely managed to steer clear of the scandal until this week. After attending an event at Lichfield Cathedral on Monday, the king was heckled by a man who shouted questions about how long he had known about his brother and Epstein and then asked: “Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew?” The king did not respond and it wasn’t clear if he even heard the man, who was shouted down by others and eventually pulled from sight. But video of the incident made the evening news and was the source of embarrassing headlines the next morning. It’s the most dramatic royal departure since 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne so he could marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. The couple were given the titles Duke and Duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in exile outside Britain. Prince Harry, despite renouncing his royal role, feuding with his family and moving to California, remains a prince and the Duke of Sussex. The move by the king means Andrew will no longer be a prince or known as His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, Earl of Inverness or Baron Killyleagh — all titles he held until now. Also gone are honors that include Order of the Garter and status as Knight Grand Cross of the Victorian Order. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); From favored son to tabloid fodder Andrew, who was said to be his mother’s favorite child, had once been the poster boy of the royal family, and his romantic links to a number of models and starlets during his youth were widely chronicled in the British press. His star status peaked after he flew missions as a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy during the 1982 Falklands War when British forces sailed to the south Atlantic to eject the Argentine military that had invaded the U.K. overseas territories. But he has also been dogged by decades of tawdry headlines about shady business deals, inappropriate behavior and controversial friendships. Even as the Epstein scandal swirled, news broke that showed his damaged reputation and need for money led him to become entangled with a suspected Chinese spy . freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Andrew is expected to move to a property on the king’s Sandringham estate near the northeast coast and receive private financial support from his brother.

After a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said he would cut tariffs on the Asian economic giant and China would, in turn, purchase 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually for the next three years. The Republican president claimed his trade negotiations would secure “prosperity and security to millions of Americans.” But back in Washington, senators — several from Trump’s Republican Party — have demonstrated their dissent with Trump’s tariff tactics by passing a series of resolutions this week that would nullify the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify the import taxes. Already this week, the Senate approved resolutions to end tariffs imposed on Brazil and Canada. While the legislative efforts are ultimately doomed, they exposed fault lines in the GOP. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The latest resolution, which would effectively end most of Trump’s tariff policies, passed on a 51-47 vote, with four Republicans joining with all Democrats.

Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who backed Democrats on the resolutions, credited Trump for decreasing the tariffs on China, but said the result is “still much higher than we’ve had.” Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. Follow on “It still will lead to increased prices,” he said. The votes were orchestrated by Democrats using a decades-old law that allows Congress to nullify a presidential emergency. But House Republicans have instituted a new rule that allows the leadership to prevent such resolutions from coming up for a vote. Plus, Trump would surely veto legislation that inhibits his power over trade policy, meaning the legislation won’t ultimately take effect. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Democrats can force a vote but not a result But Democrats have still been able to force the Senate to take up an uncomfortable topic for their Republican colleagues. “American families are being squeezed by prices going up and up and up,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a floor speech. He added that “in many ways, red states in rural areas are being hit the hardest,” and pointed to economic strain being put on farmers and manufacturers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that Americans shouldn’t be fooled by Trump’s announcement. “Donald Trump has folded, leaving American families and farmers and small businesses to deal with the wreckage from his blunders, from his erratic on again off again tariff policies,” said the New York Democrat. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); How Republicans see Trump’s trade policy Overall, there has been little movement among Republicans to oppose Trump’s import taxes publicly. A nearly identical resolution failed in April on a tied vote after Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was absent. On Thursday, McConnell and Paul, as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted along with all Democrats to pass the resolution. Those four Republicans helped advance similar resolutions this week to end the tariffs on Brazil and Canada. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, also voted in favor of the resolution applying to Brazil , but otherwise, GOP senators have held the line this week behind the president. “I agree with my colleagues that tariffs should be more targeted to avoid harm to Americans,” said Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, in a floor speech. Yet, he added that Trump’s negotiations “are bearing fruit” and praised his announcement that Beijing would allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans again. Republicans representing farm states were especially enthused by the announcement that China would be purchasing 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually, starting with 10 million metric tons for the rest of this year. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said the deal with China “absolutely” justifies Trump’s use of tariff threats to negotiate trade policy with other nations. He called the announcement “huge news” for Kansas farmers, but also acknowledged that they would still probably need financial help as they deal with the strain of losing their biggest customer for soybeans and sorghum. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “It’s not like you can snap your finger and send over $15 billion worth of sorghum and soybeans together overnight,” he said. China had been the largest purchaser of U.S. soybeans until this year. It purchased almost 27 million metric tons in 2024 , so Trump’s negotiated deal only guarantees to return soybean exports to China to less than their previous level. Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, called the purchase agreement a “start.” Asked whether he agreed with Trump’s assessment that his meeting with Xi had been a runaway success, Cramer smiled and said the president “is nothing if not optimistic.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-us-nuclear-tests-explainer-e641db1a4c99721bbd4ecd187d7dff65","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:27:20+00:00","title":"Trump Announces Restart of U.S. Nuclear Testing Amid Global Nuclear Tensions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s announcement in October 2025 to restart U.S. nuclear weapons testing — a move that contradicts decades of policy under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty — has ignited global concern.

Here’s what to know. Stay up to date with the latest news from AP. Follow on Trump’s remarks came before meeting with China’s Xi Trump’s comments came in a post on his Truth Social website just before meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In it, Trump noted other countries testing weapons and wrote: “I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.” The president’s post raised immediate questions. America’s nuclear arsenal is maintained by the Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration, a semiautonomous agency within it — not the Defense Department. The Energy Department has overseen testing of nuclear weapons since its creation in 1977. Two other agencies before it — not the Defense Department — conducted tests. Trump also claimed the U.S. “has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country.” Russia is believed to have 5,580 nuclear warheads, according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association, while the U.S. has 5,225. Those figures include so-called “retired” warheads waiting to be dismantled. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute further breaks the warhead total down, with the U.S. having 1,770 deployed warheads with 1,930 in reserve. Russia has 1,718 deployed warheads and 2,591 in reserve. The two countries account for nearly 90% of the world’s atomic warheads. U.S. last carried out a nuclear test in 1992 From the time America conducted its “Trinity” nuclear bomb detonation in 1945 to 1992, the U.S. detonated 1,030 atomic bombs in tests — the most of any country. Those figures do not include the two nuclear weapons America used against Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. The first American tests were atmospheric, but they were then moved underground to limit nuclear fallout. Scientists have come to refer to such tests as “shots.” The last such “shot,” called Divider as part of Operation Julin, took place Sept. 23, 1992, at the Nevada National Security Sites, a sprawling compound some 105 kilometers (65 miles) from Las Vegas. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); America halted its tests for a couple of reasons. The first was the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War. The U.S. also signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty in 1996. There have been tests since the treaty, however — by India, North Korea and Pakistan, the world’s newest nuclear powers. The United Kingdom and France also have nuclear weapons, while Israel long has been suspected of possessing atomic bombs . But broadly speaking, the U.S. also had decades of data from tests, allowing it to use computer modeling and other techniques to determine whether a weapon would successfully detonate. Every president since Barack Obama has backed plans to modernize America’s nuclear arsenal, whose maintenance and upgrading will cost nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. relies on the so-called “nuclear triad” — ground-based silos, aircraft-carried bombs and nuclear-tipped missiles in submarines at sea — to deter others from launching their weapons against America. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); Restarting testing raises additional questions If the U.S. restarted nuclear weapons testing, it isn’t immediately clear what the goal would be. Nonproliferation experts have warned any scientific objective likely would be eclipsed by the backlash to a test — and possibly be a starting gun for other major nuclear powers to begin their own widespread testing. “Restarting the U.S. nuclear testing program could be one of the most consequential policy actions the Trump administration undertakes — a U.S. test could set off an uncontrolled chain of events, with other countries possibly responding with their own nuclear tests, destabilizing global security, and accelerating a new arms race,” experts warned in a February article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        }); “The goal of conducting a fast-tracked nuclear test can only be political, not scientific. ... It would give Russia, China and other nuclear powers free rein to restart their own nuclear testing programs, essentially without political and economic fallout.” Any future U.S. test likely would take place in Nevada at the testing sites, but a lot of work likely would need to go into the sites to prepare them given it’s been over 30 years since the last test. A series of slides made for a presentation at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2018 laid out the challenges, noting that in the 1960s the city of Mercury, Nevada — at the testing grounds — had been the second-largest city in Nevada. On average, 20,000 people had been on site to organize and prepare for the tests. That capacity has waned in the decades since. “One effects shot would require from two to four years to plan and execute,” the presentation reads. “These were massive undertakings.” ___ This story has been corrected to fix transposed numbers for the United States and Russia’s nuclear missile reserves. ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation .

strengthened into a major Category 4 with potentially catastrophic consequences, as it dropped torrential rain in the northern Caribbean and threatened disastrous flooding and landslides in Jamaica and southern Haiti.\n\nMelissa could intensify to a Category 5 as it nears Jamaica, forecasters said on Sunday, when making landfall in the Caribbean island in the coming day or two.\n\n“I urge Jamaicans to take this weather threat seriously,” said Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness. “Take all measures to protect yourself.”\n\nMelissa was centred about 200km (125 miles) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and about  455km (280 miles) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, late Saturday night.\n\nIt had maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour (115 miles per hour), the hurricane centre said.\n\nAuthorities in Jamaica said on Saturday that the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston will be closed. They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.\n\nMore than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.\n\nMelissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.\n\nIt should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.\n\nThe erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\n\n“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.\n\nIn Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.\n\n“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.\n\nThe storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.\n\nThe Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that mRNA vaccines used for COVID-19 may enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells, particularly in patients with 'cold' tumors.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China's Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a major advancement in its space program.

Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated the Caribbean in October 2025, killing at least 32 people across Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.

Caribbean island of Cuba after it first caused devastation in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

So many homes, so many people have been displaced,” she said.\n\n“We did prepare, but there wasn’t much that we could have done.”\n\nTrout Hall Rd,  Clarendon #TrackingMelissa   #HurricaneMelissa   #Jamaica   @CVMTV   pic.twitter.com/bTop93pOvp\n\n— Giovanni R. Dennis (@GiovanniRDennis)  October 28, 2025\n\nIn Kingston, Lisa Sangster, a 30-year-old communications specialist, said her home was devastated by the storm.\n\n“My sister … explained that parts of our roof were blown off and other parts caved in and the entire house was flooded,” she told the AFP news agency. “Outside structures like our outdoor kitchen, dog kennel and farm animal pens were also gone, destroyed.”\n\nMathue Tapper, 31, told AFP that those in the capital were “lucky”, but he feared for people in Jamaica’s more rural areas.\n\n“My heart goes out to the folks living on the western end of the island,” he said.\n\nAlthough Jamaica and Cuba are used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making the storms more severe.\n\nBritish-Jamaican climate change activist and author Mikaela Loach said in a video shared on social media that Melissa “gained energy from the extremely and unnaturally  hot seas  in the Caribbean”.\n\n“These sea temperatures are not natural,” Loach said. “They’re extremely hot because of the gases that have resulted from burning fossil fuels.”\n\n“Countries like Jamaica, countries that are most vulnerable to climate disaster, are also countries that have had their wealth and resources stripped away from them through colonial bondage,” Loach added.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting to the effects of a warming world.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"For the first time in over four decades, mosquitoes have been detected in Iceland, specifically the cold-adapted Culiseta annulata species, likely due to climate change-driven warming and glacial melting.

Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, devastated the northern Caribbean, causing at least 34 deaths across Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, with extensive damage to infrastructure, homes, and emergency services.

Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction\n\nPeople across the northern Caribbean are reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Melissa as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/trump-administration-sets-rules-to-bar-groups-it-opposes-from-loan-relief","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"23:36:04Z","title":"Trump administration sets rules to bar groups it opposes from loan relief","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Education has finalised new rules that could bar nonprofit organisations involved in immigration advocacy or transgender rights from participating in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness programme, effective July 2026.

finalised new rules that could bar nonprofits deemed to have undertaken work with a “substantial illegal purpose” from a special student loan forgiveness programme.\n\nThose rules, finalised on Thursday, appear to single out certain organisations that do work in areas that President Donald Trump politically opposes, including immigration advocacy and transgender rights.\n\nUnder the new rules, set to take effect in July 2026, the education secretary has the power to exclude groups if they engage in activities like the “chemical castration” of children, using a politically charged term for gender-affirming healthcare, including puberty-delaying medication.\n\nIt also allows the education secretary to bar groups accused of supporting undocumented immigration or “terrorist” organisations.\n\nThe Trump administration has said its decisions “will not be made based on the political views or policy preferences of the organization”.\n\nBut advocates fear the move is the administration’s latest effort to target left-leaning and liberal organisations.\n\nTrump has already  threatened  to crack down on several liberal nonprofits, which the White House has broadly accused of being part of “domestic terror networks”.\n\nThursday’s rules concern the Public Service Loan Forgiveness programme, created by an act of Congress in 2007.\n\nIn an effort to direct more graduates into public service jobs, the programme promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments.\n\nWorkers in the public sector, including teachers, medical professionals, firefighters, social service professionals and lawyers, are among those who can benefit.\n\nIn a statement, the Trump administration defended the updated rules, calling them a necessary bulwark to protect taxpayer funds.\n\nThe programme “was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service – not to subsidize organizations that violate the law, whether by harboring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex”, said Education Undersecretary Nicholas Kent.\n\nCritics, however, have denounced the administration for using false claims of “terrorism” or criminal behaviour to silence opposing views and restrict civil liberties.\n\nMichael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, said the new rules weaponised loan forgiveness.\n\nLukens explained that many of the lawyers, social workers and paralegals who work at his organisation handle cases to stop deportations and other immigration litigation.\n\nThey count on public service loan forgiveness to take jobs that pay significantly less than the private sector, he said.\n\n“All of a sudden, that’s going away,” Lukens told The Associated Press news agency. “The younger generation, I hope, will be able to wait this out for the next couple of years to see if it gets better, but if it doesn’t, we’re going to see a lot of people leave the field to go and work in a for-profit space.”\n\nOrganisations have raised concerns over the education secretary’s broad power to determine if a group should be barred. Short of a legal finding, the secretary can decide based on a “preponderance of the evidence” whether an employer is in violation.\n\nThe National Council of Nonprofits was among the associations criticising the change.\n\nIt said the rules would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules “based on their own priorities or ideology”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/acute-trauma-the-ever-present-wounds-of-gazas-children-from-israels-war","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:12:59+00:00","title":"Acute trauma: The ever-present wounds of Gaza’s children from Israel’s war","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights the profound and enduring psychological and physical trauma experienced by children in Gaza due to Israel’s prolonged military campaign.

Even if the fragile  United States-brokered ceasefire  were successful in halting deadly attacks on the besieged enclave,  which it so far has not,  loud booms would still echo in the minds of those Palestinians who survived more than two years of brutal conflict.\n\nFifteen-year-old Abed al-Aziz Abu Hawishal has seen scenes no teenager should ever witness. “We were taking refuge in a house in Gaza City when the Israeli military stormed in,” he told Al Jazeera. “They dragged me close to a tank, and one of the soldiers pointed his gun at my head.”\n\nThe memories of a “massacre” he witnessed near his home have left him withdrawn, haunted by thoughts he can’t escape. “Bodies were flying over our house. I saw a woman without a head, and I even stepped on bodies as I ran, terrified for my life,” he said.\n\nThe psychological trauma triggered a response in his body, causing high blood pressure, chronic diarrhoea, and, most recently, kidney failure.\n\nSimilarly, the psychological trauma has left visible marks on eight-year-old Lana al-Sharif. Other residents of the displacement camp in Khan Younis call her “the elderly child” as her once dark and shiny mop of hair is now tinged with grey.\n\nHer father, Khalil al-Shareef, said Lana survived an Israeli air strike that collapsed the roof of their home. She developed vitiligo, a chronic skin condition that causes the loss of skin, hair, and eye colour, as a result of exposure to the smoke and chemicals from the missiles.\n\n“Many doctors have tried to treat her, but without success,” her father said. “She panics every time she hears an explosion.”\n\nPsychologists warn that more than 80 percent of Gaza’s children now show symptoms of severe trauma.\n\nSabreen Abu Rahman, a therapist treating traumatised children, said mental trauma is often accompanied by symptoms including headaches, stomach aches, bone pain, hair loss, vitiligo, and weakened immunity.\n\nThe UN children’s agency UNICEF estimates that more than 64,000 children have been killed or injured in Gaza. Homes, hospitals and schools have been destroyed, while essential medical services have collapsed.\n\nUNICEF Middle East and North Africa Regional Director Edouard Beigbeder said “one million children have endured the daily horrors of surviving in the world’s most dangerous place to be a child, leaving them with wounds of fear, loss and grief.”\n\nSince a ceasefire took effect on October 10, Israeli attacks have  killed dozens of Palestinians  across the enclave. From Tuesday into Wednesday, the Health Ministry in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed 104 people, including 46 children and 20 women.\n\nBeigbeder said the truce “must hold and it must deliver more than calm, it must deliver action … The world cannot allow this ceasefire to fail.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/chinas-xi-defends-multilateralism-at-apec-after-striking-deal-with-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:36:22+00:00","title":"China’s Xi takes centre stage at APEC, meets leaders as Trump snubs forum","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the 2025 APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping took a leading role in promoting global economic cooperation and multilateralism, filling the diplomatic vacuum left by US President Donald Trump who skipped the event in favor of one-on-one trade negotiations.

Trump described his meeting with Xi on Thursday as a roaring success, saying Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and to start buying US soya beans in exchange for slashing tariffs.\n\nThe US president’s decision to skip APEC, a forum that represents nearly 40 percent of the world’s population and more than half of global goods trade, fits in with his well-known disdain for big, multi-nation forums that have been traditionally used to address huge global problems, with his preference for grand spectacle one-on-one meetings that generate blanket media coverage.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Jack Barton, reporting from Gyeongju, said Xi was “filling the vacuum left by Trump”.\n\nWhile on his first visit to South Korea in 11 years, Xi met Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on the sidelines of the summit on Friday. In brief opening remarks, both leaders said they would seek to advance ties.\n\nAccording to China’s official news agency Xinhua, Xi said he was ready to maintain communication with Takaichi to jointly advance China-Japan ties on the right track.\n\nBarton said the meeting with Japan’s Takaichi would be “setting the diplomatic tone for the foreseeable future”. The Japanese prime minister is described by Chinese media as a far-right nationalist who has visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine.\n\nThe site, dedicated to 2.5 million Japanese who died in wars beginning in the 19th century, is a political lightning rod in East Asia. Among those honoured are World War II leaders convicted as “Class A” war criminals, some of whom committed their atrocities under the Imperial Japan flag in China in the 20th century.\n\n“South Korea and China share some of these historical issues with Japan,” Barton said. “They came out essentially saying, we’re going to put legacy issues on one side and diplomacy on another, so there is scope for a positive outcome.”\n\nXi is scheduled to meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung to discuss denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula on Saturday.\n\nThe Chinese leader also met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday to discuss trade. In the first formal talks between the nations’ leaders since 2017, Carney accepted Xi’s invitation to visit China.\n\nThe Canadian leader pointed to “constructive and pragmatic dialogue” as a route to addressing their “current issues” and cited dialogue as a way “to help build a more sustainable, inclusive international system.”\n\nLeaders and other representatives from 21 Asian and Pacific Rim economies are attending the APEC meeting to discuss how to promote economic cooperation and tackle shared challenges.\n\nThe APEC region faces an array of issues, including strategic competition between the US and China, supply chain vulnerabilities, ageing populations and the effect of AI on jobs.\n\nSouth Korean officials said they have been communicating with other countries to prod all 21 members to adopt a joint statement at the end of the summit, so as not to repeat the failure to issue one in 2018 in Papua New Guinea due to US-China discord over trade.\n\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said last week that issuing a joint statement strongly endorsing free trade would be unlikely because of differing positions among APEC members.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Barton said the result might be a “watered-down version”.\n\n“The question really is, can APEC survive this age of US-China rivalry?” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/death-toll-from-hurricane-melissa-climbs-to-49-with-many-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:15:49+00:00","title":"Death toll from Hurricane Melissa climbs to 49, with many still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, made landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane, causing catastrophic damage, killing at least 49 people, and leaving hundreds of thousands without power.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents they are legally protected from prosecution and local officials cannot arrest them.\n\nFox News host Will Cain questioned Miller during an October 24 interview. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Cain said, “talked about interfering with, arresting, ICE agents in Illinois”.\n\nCain asked Miller under what federal authority the Trump administration could arrest Pritzker if the governor tried to arrest ICE agents.\n\n“To all ICE officers, you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties,” Miller said. “And anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony.”\n\nMiller said his answer applied to any local or state official “who conspires or engages in activity that unlawfully impedes federal law enforcement conducting their duties”.\n\nThe day before Miller’s comments, Pritzker signed an executive order establishing the Illinois Accountability Commission to document federal law enforcement actions and refer possible law violations to local and state agencies for investigation. Chicago is the latest target in the Trump administration’s  immigration crackdown , and agents have arrested more than 3,000 people there.\n\nPritzker acknowledged in an October 16 interview that “federal agents typically have federal immunity, but they’re not immune from the federal government holding them accountable and responsible”.\n\nHis statement is less sweeping than Miller’s, and Pritzker noted that the federal government can prosecute federal agents.\n\nImmigration agents, like other law enforcement officers, have broad protections when conducting official duties. That doesn’t mean they can’t be held legally accountable if they break state or federal law.\n\n“Federal officials are not categorically immune from state criminal prosecution, even while on duty,” Bryna Godar, a lawyer at the University of Wisconsin’s State Democracy Research Initiative, wrote in a July 17 report.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, the White House pointed PolitiFact to an October 23 letter that US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote to California officials.\n\n“The Department of Justice views any arrests of federal agents and officers in the performance of their official duties as both illegal and futile,” Blanche wrote.\n\nHe cited several federal laws and provisions, including the US Constitution’s Supremacy Clause. The clause limits when states can prosecute federal agents who break state law, but it does not act as blanket immunity, legal experts said.\n\nMiller’s statement is “wrong on its face”, Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown University constitutional law professor, wrote in his October 27 newsletter.\n\nFederal immigration agents can’t break the law with impunity.\n\nIn 2024, a federal judge convicted and sentenced to federal prison a US Customs and Border Protection agent for using excessive force against two people at the southern border. Department of Homeland Security watchdog officers investigated the case.\n\nThe federal government has cited its power to hold agents accountable in court arguments. After a Border Patrol agent shot and killed a 15-year-old Mexican boy at the southern border in 2010, the Justice Department said in a 2019 Supreme Court brief that the federal government investigates allegations of excessive force by agents “and may bring a federal criminal prosecution where appropriate”.\n\nNon-government organisations can also sue the federal government for its agents’ actions. Several groups in Chicago, including journalism organisations, sued the Trump administration saying federal agents are using “a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians”.\n\nIn that case, federal District Judge Sara Ellis ordered immigration agents not to use tear gas and other riot control tactics unless people are posing an immediate threat. If the agents are going to use tear gas, they are required to give a verbal warning first.\n\nAfter reports that agents weren’t following the court order, Ellis ordered Gregory Bovino, the senior Border Patrol official overseeing the federal immigration actions in Chicago, to meet with her every weeknight to report all confrontations officers have with the public. A federal appeals court has since temporarily paused Ellis’s order.\n\nVladeck wrote that even if the Trump administration does not investigate or prosecute immigration agents who might have broken the law, it doesn’t mean the federal government doesn’t have the power to do so.\n\nPritzker said his state’s commission seeks to document actions that could be prosecuted in the future.\n\nState governments can also prosecute immigration agents if they break state law. However, there is a limitation known as supremacy clause immunity, which comes from the US Constitution’s clause that says federal law supersedes conflicting state laws.\n\nProtections against state prosecution for federal agents date back to a 1890 Supreme Court decision. David Neagle, a US marshal assigned to protect a Supreme Court justice, shot and killed a man who assaulted the justice. California arrested Neagle and charged him with murder. The Supreme Court ruled that the state couldn’t prosecute Neagle because he was carrying out official duties.\n\nGenerally, federal agents are protected from state prosecution if their actions were authorised by federal law, and if the actions were “necessary and proper” for agents to fulfil their duties.\n\nA federal court ruled in 1990 that a customs agent was immune from state charges for speeding while driving during a drug operation. The agent acted under US laws and was justified in concluding speeding was necessary to fulfil his duties, the court said.\n\nBut a US marine wasn’t given immunity in 1990 after he killed a person in a car accident while he was driving in a military convoy in North Carolina.\n\n“In short, while Supremacy Clause immunity grants federal officials a partial shield from state prosecution, that immunity is not absolute,” Godar wrote.\n\nContrary to Miller’s statement, Vladeck wrote, it’s not a felony “for local or state authorities to arrest someone who they have probable cause to believe committed a state crime”.\n\nIf a state brought charges against federal immigration agents, the court would have to determine whether an officer reasonably would have thought the actions were necessary to carry out federal duties.\n\n“That’s a generous standard, to be sure,” Vladeck wrote. “But it is by no means a get-out-of-prosecution-free card.”\n\nOur ruling\n\nMiller said: “To all ICE officers, you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties.”\n\nImmigration agents, like other law enforcement officers, have broad protections when they’re conducting official duties. But they’re not immune from prosecution if they break state or federal law.\n\nThe federal government can and does prosecute federal officers who break the law.\n\nStates can’t prosecute agents for breaking state law if the agents were acting under the reasonable confines of their official duties. But those restrictions aren’t absolute.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth; federal immigration agents have some immunity from state prosecution. But the protections aren’t as sweeping as Miller made them sound, giving a different impression. Federal agents can and have been prosecuted by states.\n\nWe rate Miller’s statement  Mostly False ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/five-things-you-should-know-about-mexicos-day-of-the-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"07:07:15+00:00","title":"Five things you should know about Mexico’s Day of the Dead","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explains the cultural significance of Mexico’s Day of the Dead, detailing its roots in ancient Aztec beliefs and its evolution through Spanish colonization and Catholic traditions.

Mexico’s Day of the Dead\n\nThis week, houses and streets in Mexico have been decorated with colourful altars, marigold flowers, candles and sugar skulls.\n\nThis is because Mexicans are gearing up to celebrate El Dia de los Muertos – the Day of the Dead – the country’s most important fiesta, which begins this weekend.\n\nMexican families will gather in homes and cemeteries in memory of their family members who have departed. The day is packed with lively parades and rituals such as the decoration of altars, and sumptuous victuals including Mexican street food, a special kind of bread and hot chocolate.\n\nThe Day of the Dead, or El Dia de los Muertos, is not for mourning or grieving, but for celebrating the lives of those who have passed.\n\nIt is believed to be a time when the living and dead can connect with each other. Traditional practices, such as placing marigold flowers on altars and offering certain food items, the aroma and colour of which are thought to help spirits return to visit the living.\n\nTo commemorate the dead, people also dress up in colourful skeleton costumes.\n\nThe festival is rooted in the ancient Aztec belief that death is a continuation of life. Descendants of the Aztec people exist to this day, primarily in Mexico.\n\nThe Aztecs, who were native to central Mexico from the 14th to the 16th century, celebrated the deceased with monthlong festivities.\n\nThey also honoured the goddess of the underworld, Mictecacihuatl, and made offerings of food from the harvest and personal belongings to her during these festivals.\n\nWhen Spanish colonists arrived in Mexico from 1519, they imposed Catholicism on the Aztecs and combined these festivities with Catholic holidays – All Saints’ Day on November 1 and All Souls’ Day on November 2.\n\nEventually, these two days merged into the Day of the Dead.\n\nFamilies create altars called “ofrendas” in their homes and in cemeteries, laden with offerings to deceased loved ones and ancestors.\n\nAltars are created with two levels to symbolise heaven and Earth, three levels to include purgatory, or seven levels to signify the steps to reach heaven.\n\nItems representing the four elements are also placed on the altars: water to quench visitors’ thirst; fire in candles to guide the spirits; earth, represented by food and special items for the deceased; and air, represented by colourful paper designs. Some altars also include salt, which is believed to aid souls on their journey in the afterlife.\n\nThese altars also display pictures of the deceased, items of their favourite food, candles and marigold flowers, which are believed to help lead spirits back from the cemetery to their family’s homes.\n\nThe altars also include tongue-in-cheek poems dedicated to the deceased loved ones called “calaveras” (skulls). These poems describe interesting habits and funny stories which took place during the lives of the now deceased.\n\nSkulls, which represent the cyclical nature of life and death, are a pervasive symbol during the Day of the Dead. Sugar skulls, or “calavera de azucar” are edible and decorative skull models made with sugar, clay or papier-mache, are used to adorn altars.\n\nAnother common food item during the festival is the “bread of the dead” – “pan de muerto” – a circular loaf of bread with bone-shaped designs. The bread is typically sugar-coated, representing the tears of sorrow shed by loved ones.\n\nThe bread is baked and eaten on both days of the festival, and is also offered at the altars.\n\nWebsites such as MiAltar also allow users to create virtual altars. These can be shared on the website.\n\nLa Catrina is a tall, female skeletal figure, and she is seen everywhere during the festival.\n\nShe was a character created in the early 1900s by political cartoonist and lithographer Jose Guadalupe Posada.\n\nLa Catrina dons a fancy French hat and feathers. Posada’s work was a commentary on the aspirations of Mexicans to emulate the European elite.\n\nPosada was known for saying “we are all skeletons”, alluding to how, under the luxurious clothing, jewellery and coverings, we are all the same.\n\nIn 1947, artist Diego Rivera included Posada’s art in a mural, naming her Catrina, which means “the rich”.\n\nThe main days of celebration are November 1 and November 2. However, some parts of the world begin celebrations on October 27, when people also commemorate their dead pets. The days following this are dedicated to building altars.\n\nWhile the Day of the Dead is a Mexican festival, it is also celebrated across Latin America, in Spain, some parts of the United States with large Mexican-American populations, and the Philippines, which was colonised by Spain in 1565.\n\nNovember 1 is typically dedicated to children who have passed, referred to as “angelitos” (little angels). Their graves are decorated with toys and balloons.\n\nThe day after, also still called All Souls Day, is for adults who have departed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/iran-condemns-trumps-call-to-resume-us-nuclear-testing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:34:58+00:00","title":"Iran condemns Trump’s call to resume US nuclear testing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran has strongly condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to resume nuclear weapons testing, calling it regressive and irresponsible.

The US, China, and Iran all signed but have not ratified the original treaty, while Russia withdrew its ratification in 2023.\n\nMoscow carried out its last nuclear test in 1990 while still the Soviet Union, and China carried out its last nuclear test in 1996, according to the UN. The last nuclear test by the United Kingdom was in 1991, followed by the US in 1992 and France in 1996. North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear tests in the past two decades, with its last test in 2017.\n\nTrevor Findlay, a nuclear security expert and honorary professional fellow at the University of Melbourne, told Al Jazeera that it was unclear what type of testing Trump was referring to in his post.\n\n“My assumption is that he means missile launches of nuclear-capable missiles, as North Korea and Russia have been doing very publicly. These do not carry an actual nuclear warhead [but likely a dummy], nor do they create a nuclear explosion,” he said.\n\n“The US already tests its own missiles periodically, both existing ones and ones in development, often splashing down in the Pacific. It does announce them but tends not to make a big deal of it, like North Korea and Russia,” he said.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has called for the “total dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme and says he does not want Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon.

news operations due to Trump admin cuts\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA) will shut down its news operations on Friday, citing the government-funded news outlet’s dire financial situation caused by funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration and the ongoing US government shutdown.\n\nBay Fang, RFA’s president and CEO, said in a statement that “uncertainty about our budgetary future” means that the outlet has been “forced to suspend all remaining news content production”.\n\n“In an effort to conserve limited resources on hand and preserve the possibility of restarting operations should consistent funding become available, RFA is taking further steps to responsibly shrink its already reduced footprint,” she said on Wednesday.\n\nFang added that RFA would begin closing its overseas bureaus and would formally lay off and pay severance to furloughed staff. She said many staff members have been on unpaid leave since March, “when the US Agency for Global Media [USAGM] unlawfully terminated RFA’s Congressionally appropriated grant”.\n\nOn March 14, Trump signed an executive order effectively eliminating USAGM, an independent US government agency created in the mid-1990s to broadcast news and information to regions with poor press freedom records.\n\nAlongside RFA, USAGM also hosts sister publications Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE) and Voice of America (VOA).\n\nFollowing March’s executive order, RFA was forced to put three-quarters of its US-based employees on unpaid leave and terminate most of its overseas contractors.\n\nAnother round of mass layoffs followed in May, along with the termination of several RFA language services, including Tibetan, Burmese and Uighur.\n\nMass layoffs also took place at VOA in March when Trump  signed another executive order  placing nearly all 1,400 staff at the outlet – which he described as a “total left-wing disaster” – on paid leave. It has operated on a limited basis since then.\n\nTrump has said operations like RFA, RFE/Radio Liberty and VOA are a waste of government resources and accused them of being biased against his administration.\n\nSince its founding in 1996, RFA has reported on Asia’s most repressive regimes, providing English- and local-language online and broadcast services to citizens of authoritarian governments across the region.\n\nIts flagship projects include its Uighur service – the world’s only independent Uyghur-language outlet, covering the repressed ethnic group in western China – as well as its North Korea service, which reports on events inside the hermit state.\n\nAn announcement penned by RFA executive editor Rosa Hwang, published on the outlet’s website on Wednesday, said, “Make no mistake, authoritarian regimes are already celebrating RFA’s potential demise.”\n\n“Independent journalism is at the core of RFA. For the first time since RFA’s inception almost 30 years ago, that voice is at risk,” Hwang said.\n\n“We still believe in the urgency of that mission – and in the resilience of our extraordinary journalists. Once our funding returns, so will we,” she added.\n\nRFE/Radio Liberty, which went through its own round of furloughs earlier this year, said this week that it received its last round of federal funding in September and its news services are continuing for now.\n\n“We plan to continue reaching our audiences for the foreseeable future,” it said.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear why RFA and RFE/Radio Liberty – which share the same governing and funding structure, but are based in the US and Europe, respectively – are taking different approaches."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/jamaica-braces-as-hurricane-melissa-strengthens-offshore","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"06:45:50+00:00","title":"Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, is advancing toward Jamaica, with officials warning of a potentially catastrophic event due to its slow movement and extreme rainfall.

2025-10-27T06:45:50+00:00\n\nTitle: Officials warn Hurricane Melissa could be ‘catastrophic’ for Jamaica\n\nPeople in Jamaica have been urged to take shelter as  Hurricane Melissa  continues to strengthen offshore, with heavy rains and tropical storm-strength winds already hitting parts of the island.\n\nThe hurricane, which has intensified to a Category 5 storm, was about 160km (100 miles) south of Jamaica on Monday and on course to hit the western flanks of the island early Tuesday. Moving at just 7km/h (4mph), the storm could cut a particularly punishing path, bringing landslides and storm surges as it crawls across the country, officials warned.\n\nStill, on Monday, Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said a slight chance remained that the storm could miss the island.\n\n“Of course, all of us are hoping for that and praying for that,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, we have to be practical. Right now, the projected path takes it to the southwestern part of Jamaica, impacting either eastern Westmoreland or extreme western Saint Elizabeth.”\n\nCurrently, the storm is projected to travel northeast across the island, exiting along the coast of Saint Anne Parish, Thompson said.\n\nCategory 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with sustained winds exceeding 250km/h (157mph). Up to about one metre (40 inches) of rainfall could hit parts of Jamaica as the storm passes directly over the island, threatening flash flooding and landslides.\n\n“I don’t want to encourage fear or worry, but I do expect you to become concerned about what is taking place,” Thompson said.\n\n“If you think that you are free from [the worst of the storm], think again, because the heavy rains will affect you, the strong winds reaching tropical storm force could still continue to affect you as we go through the day on Tuesday.”\n\nIn an earlier webcast, US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said the potential for extreme rain, coupled with the slow speed of the storm, could “create a catastrophic event” in Jamaica.\n\n“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.\n\nJamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston; Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon; Old Harbour Bay in Saint Catherine; and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in Saint Andrew.\n\n“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.\n\n“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.\n\n“This is one bet you cannot win. You cannot bet against Melissa,” McKenzie warned, advising that people could go to more than 650 shelters that are open across the country.\n\nThe AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.\n\n“I lose my roof, I lose a whole lot of things,” Maxim said, adding that he was particularly worried by warnings that the storm could be worse than 1988’s Hurricane Gilbert, which left more than 40 dead in Jamaica and killed hundreds more around the Caribbean and in Mexico.\n\nJamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.\n\nAfter passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMelissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s emergency operations centre has placed nine of 31 provinces on red alert due to a risk of flash floods, rising rivers and landslides.\n\nThe Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.\n\nAlthough Jamaica is used to hurricanes,  climate change  is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.\n\nWith a population of less than three million people, Jamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the World Resources Institute. But as an island nation, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects.\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.\n\n“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration. It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nMelissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nThe last major hurricane to affect Jamaica was Beryl in early July 2024, which was an abnormally strong storm for the time of year.\n\nBeryl brought downpours and strong winds to Jamaica as it moved past the island’s southern coast, leaving at least four people dead."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/sudans-north-kordofan-deteriorating-under-rsf-as-thousands-flee","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:49:18+00:00","title":"Sudan’s North Kordofan ‘deteriorating’ under RSF as thousands flee","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 4,500 people have fled Sudan’s North Kordofan state due to escalating violence by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has recaptured the key locality of Bara after a brief SAF takeover.

state as the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) escalate their violent attacks against civilians there and in neighbouring North Darfur’s  el-Fasher , a Sudanese medical organisation says.\n\nField reports from the Sudan Doctors Network, which emerged on Friday, indicated that nearly 2,000 people have successfully travelled from the Bara locality, which the RSF recaptured last week, to the state capital of el-Obeid, about 60 kilometres (37 miles) to the south.\n\nThe rest, however, “remain en route under harsh conditions and facing severe shortages of food, water, and shelter,” the organisation said in a statement, adding that North Kordofan faces a “deteriorating security situation”.\n\nشبكة أطباء السودان: الدعم السريع يتسبب في نزوح أكثر من 4500 مواطن من بارا ووصل

government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for months. In July, the RSF raided and set fire to North Kordofan villages in an  attack that killed nearly 300  people, including children and pregnant women.\n\nSAF took control of Bara in mid-September, but by last week, it was back in the hands of the RSF.\n\nThe exodus comes as the  RSF commits a wave of atrocities  in el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state to the west of North Kordofan, including mass killings of  more than 1,500 people , summary executions and rapes.\n\nAlthough more than 36,000 people attempted to escape el-Fasher, the majority of civilians  remain trapped in the city . Survivors have  counted children killed  before their parents and their bodies strewn in the streets.\n\nAl Jazeera has  verified  multiple videos that document RSF troops standing over piles of dead bodies and executing a row of unarmed young men.\n\nExperts warn that the RSF’s seizure of el-Fasher – where the paramilitaries had cut off food and medicine access for nearly 18 months – could embolden them to commit similar atrocities in North Kordofan.\n\nBakry Eljack, a public policy professor and Sudan and South Sudan expert at Long Island University Brooklyn, told Al Jazeera that “the RSF has been out of control” and, as has been “borne multiple times, they need to control their soldiers”.\n\nRSF leader Mohamad Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo said on Wednesday he would form an inquiry committee to investigate “violations” by his soldiers in el-Fasher – a promise panned by experts.\n\n“If we don’t do anything about this, it’s not going to end in el-Fasher, it’s going to expand to North Kordofan,” Eljack said. “There’s no guarantee what we’ve seen in el-Fasher is not going to be repeated somewhere else.”\n\nThe ruinous civil war broke out in 2023, when a power struggle between the RSF forces and the SAF prompted fighting in the capital, Khartoum.\n\nSince then, the RSF has taken control of more than a third of the country in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and displaced 12 million, nearly a quarter of its population, becoming the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn an  emergency session  of the UN Security Council on Thursday, the United Nations’ assistant secretary-general for Africa, Martha Pobee, called the takeover of el-Fasher “a significant shift in the security dynamics” in the region, citing escalating fighting in North Kordofan.\n\n“The territorial scope of the conflict is broadening,” she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/trump-calls-for-senate-to-scrap-filibuster-tactic-to-end-the-govt-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:09:06+00:00","title":"Trump calls for Senate to scrap filibuster tactic to end the gov’t shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has urged the U.S. Senate to eliminate the filibuster rule to end a 31-day federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025.

President Donald Trump has called on the Senate to vote to scrap the filibuster custom so that Republicans can end a  weeks-long  federal government shutdown.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday, the US leader chastised “Crazed Lunatics” in the Democratic Party.\n\n“It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote.\n\n“WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing [end the filibuster], it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN’,” he added.\n\nThe filibuster is a longstanding Senate tactic that delays or blocks votes on legislation by keeping debate open. The Senate requires a supermajority – 60 of the chamber’s 100 members – to overcome a filibuster and pass most legislation.\n\nSenate rules, including the filibuster, can be changed by a simple majority vote at any time. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 Senate majority.\n\nSince October 1, when the new fiscal year began, Senate Democrats have voted against advancing a government bill extending funding to federal agencies.\n\nDemocrats have demanded that Republicans reverse planned sweeping cuts to Medicaid, which extends healthcare coverage to tens of millions of low-income Americans, and prevent health insurance premiums from going up.\n\nThe deadlock entered its 31st day on Friday. It is set to become the longest deadlock in history if it surpasses the 35-day lapse that took place in 2019 under the first Trump administration.\n\nFederal employees categorised as “essential” continue to work without pay during government shutdowns until they can be reimbursed when it ends.\n\nMost recently, on Tuesday, US air traffic controllers were told they would  not receive their paychecks this month , raising concerns that mounting financial stress could take a toll on the already understaffed employees who guide thousands of flights each day.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that the federal government shutdown could cost the US economy between $7bn and $14bn.\n\nTrump has just returned to the US from his Asia tour, in which he visited Qatar, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea – where he  held a major summit  with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, the US leader said that while the trip was a success, conversations had caused him to consider the filibuster issue.\n\n“The one question that kept coming up, however, was how did the Democrats SHUT DOWN the United States of America, and why did the powerful Republicans allow them to do it? The fact is, in flying back, I thought a great deal about that question, WHY?” he wrote.\n\nThe US leader continued that he believed that should the Democrats come back into power, they would “exercise their rights” and end the filibuster on the “first day they take office”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/31/live-israel-bombs-south-gaza-as-palestinians-live-ceasefire-without-peace","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:01:18+00:00","title":"Israel returns bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, some show signs of torture","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has returned the bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, some of which exhibit signs of torture, following Hamas' handover of two Israeli captives.

2025-10-31T08:49:37+00:00\n\nTitle: Opposition says ‘hundreds’ killed in Tanzania post-election protests\n\nTanzania’s main opposition party has claimed that “around 700” people were killed in protests following this week’s disputed elections, the AFP news agency is reporting.\n\n“As we speak, the number of deaths in [Dar-es-Salaam] is around 350 and there are more than 200 in Mwanza,” Chadema party spokesperson John Kitoka told AFP, referring to a city in northern Tanzania. “If we add the figures from other places in the country, we arrive at a total of around 700 deaths.”\n\nChadema said its members had toured hospitals across the country to reach the figure. AFP reported it had received “a similar toll” from a security source.\n\nThe estimated toll contrasted with that of the United Nations. In a Friday briefing, UN human rights spokesperson Seif Magango told Geneva reporters “credible sources” had indicated at least 10 deaths at the hands of security forces so far.\n\n“We call on the security forces to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force, including lethal weapons, against protesters, and to make every effort to de-escalate tensions,” Magango said in the same briefing.\n\nDemonstrations erupted on Wednesday in the commercial capital of Dar-es-Salaam, a city of more than seven million people, after  disputed and chaotic elections  that saw the two main opposition parties barred from participating.\n\nSeveral vehicles, a petrol station and police stations were set ablaze by protesters infuriated by the restricted election choices and harassment of opposition figures.\n\nThe latest developments arrived as hundreds of demonstrators squared off with police for the third day on Friday, demanding the national electoral body stop announcing electoral results. The government deployed the military onto the streets and enforced an internet shutdown.\n\nOn Thursday, protesters who defied a curfew in the Mbagala, Gongo la Mboto and Kiluvya neighbourhoods of Dar-es-Salaam were met with tear gas and the sounds of gunfire.\n\nState television was broadcasting the mainland results of Wednesday’s vote in which the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, which has governed Tanzania since independence in 1961, was seeking to extend its time in power.\n\nWednesday’s elections saw President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s  two biggest challengers excluded  from the race, infuriating citizens and rights groups that have also decried an intensifying crackdown against opposition members, activists and journalists.\n\nHassan took office in 2021 when her predecessor, John Magufuli, died in office, and has faced rising criticism for what the United Nations has called a pattern of “escalating” attacks, disappearances and torture of critics.\n\nIt is the latest election this month in Africa to stir deep-seated anger among citizens after longtime leaders in the  Ivory Coast  and  Cameroon  also sought to cling to power.\n\nOnly minor opposition figures were eligible to compete against Hassan in the elections after the Independent National Electoral Commission  disqualified  Tanzania’s main opposition party, Chadema, in April for refusing to sign an electoral code of conduct.\n\nThe move came days after party leader Tundu Lissu was arrested at a rally where he called for electoral reforms and  was charged with treason .\n\nThe commission also barred Luhaga Mpina, the candidate for the second largest opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo, after an objection from the attorney general.\n\nLocal and international watchdogs have sounded alarms over election-related violence and repression for months.\n\nIn June, a panel of nine UN experts called the government’s actions “unacceptable” and said they had tallied more than 200 disappearances since 2019.\n\nAnd in September, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had documented at least 10 recent instances of politically motivated assault, harassment, abduction and torture as well as “extensive restrictions” on media and civil society organisations.\n\nNomathamsanqa Masiko-Mpaka, HRW’s South Africa researcher, warned at the time that Tanzania’s October elections were at “great risk”.\n\n“The authorities need to stop muzzling dissenting voices and the media and instead engage in meaningful reforms to ensure free, fair and credible elections,” Masiko-Mpaka added.\n\nThe ruling CCM retained the presidential seat in the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, which remained calm on Friday with a heavy military presence.\n\nThe electoral commission in Zanzibar said on Thursday that the incumbent, President Hussein Mwinyi, had won 78.8 percent of the votes.\n\nThe opposition said there was “massive fraud” in Zanzibar’s results and announced it would reveal its next steps.\n\nThe protests have spread across the country, and the government has postponed the reopening of colleges and universities, which had been set for next Monday.\n\nThe army chief, Jacob John Mkunda, condemned the violence and said on Thursday that the military would work with other security agencies to contain the situation."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/the-new-york-city-mayoral-race-in-five-maps-and-charts","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"09:09:37+00:00","title":"The New York City mayoral race – in five maps and charts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York City is preparing for a pivotal mayoral election on November 4, 2025, with a three-way race between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

But this year’s contest is notable for its three-way dynamic, bringing progressive, establishment and conservative forces to  face off  in the country’s largest city.\n\nHere are five maps and charts to help you understand New York City and how the vote works.\n\nNew York City is the most populous city in the United States, with a population of nearly  8.5 million people as of July 2024.\n\nIt is also the most densely populated city in the country, with about 11,314 residents per square kilometre (29,303 residents per square mile).\n\nThe East Coast city comprises five boroughs, which are administrative divisions equivalent to counties.\n\nThey include:\n\nThe Bronx: The  birthplace of hip-hop  and home to Yankee Stadium. It is also home to 1.35 million people across 110sq km (42sq miles). The annual median income is $28,664, while renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,100 on average per month, making that about $25,200 annually.\n\nBrooklyn: Known for its arts scene, quirky, diverse neighbourhoods, and the Brooklyn Bridge. It is home to 2.56 million people across 180sq km (71sq miles). Brooklyn has the third-highest annual median income of the five boroughs at $41,171, and a one-bedroom apartment averages $2,800 per month, which makes $33,600 annually.\n\nManhattan: The economic and cultural centre of the city, home to Wall Street, Broadway, and Central Park, it’s a main character in many US television shows and movies. It is home to 1.59 million people across 59sq km (23sq miles). Manhattan has the highest annual median income of $61,439 but also has the highest rental rates, averaging $4,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment, which is $50,400 per year.\n\nQueens: The largest of the boroughs and home to two major airports – JFK International and LaGuardia. It is also home to 2.56 million people across 280sq km (109 sq miles). The annual median income is $40,549 and renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,700 per month on average, almost $32,400 annually.\n\nStaten Island: Accessible by ferry from Lower Manhattan, this historic suburban borough, known for its parks and historical sites, is home to nearly 500,000 people across 152sq km (59sq miles). The annual median income is the second highest at $47,218, and renting a one-bedroom apartment costs $2,000 per month on average, which is $24,000 per year.\n\nTogether, the five boroughs cover a surface area of about 778.2 square kilometres (300 square miles) which is about the same size as Memphis in Tennessee, Berlin in Germany, or Singapore.\n\nAt 38.8 years, New York City’s median age is slightly lower than the national median age of 39.2, reflecting its younger, more urban population.\n\nThe largest age group in New York City is that of 30-34 year olds (8.49 percent), followed by 25-29 year olds (8.02 percent), and 35-39 year olds (7.26 percent). Together, they make up nearly a quarter of the city’s total population.\n\nNew York City has slightly more females (4.29 million) than males (3.96 million).\n\nNew York City is widely regarded as one of the most diverse cities in the world, with residents speaking more than  200  languages.\n\nAccording to City of New York data, 37 percent of New Yorkers were born outside the United States, and as many as 49 percent speak a language other than English at home.\n\nAdditionally, almost half of the city’s businesses are owned by immigrants.\n\nAt the time of the 2020 census, 30.9 percent of New Yorkers were white, followed by Hispanics at 28.3 percent, Blacks at 20.2 percent, and Asians at 15.6 percent. Residents identifying as two or more races, or other groups, including Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Hawaiians, make up the remaining five percent of the city.\n\nThe different boroughs, however, do not replicate citywide numbers, which vary greatly, and according to the 2020 census, are as follows:\n\nBrooklyn population: 2.73 million\n\nQueens population: 2.4 million\n\nManhattan population: 1.69 million\n\nThe Bronx population: 1.47 million\n\nStaten Island population: 495,747\n\nNew York City is one of  27 US cities  holding mayoral elections on November 4.\n\nThe current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, who has been in office since January 2022,  withdrew his candidacy  earlier in the year following several controversies, most notably his federal criminal indictment on bribery and conspiracy charges, which was ultimately dismissed by a judge in April.\n\nThe last non-Democratic mayor of New York City was Republican Rudy Giuliani, who was elected in 1993 and served two terms until 2001. Since then, the city has consistently chosen Democratic mayors, including Michael Bloomberg (2002-2023), Bill de Blasio (2014-2021) and Eric Adams.\n\nFollowing primary elections within the two major parties, the three leading contenders for mayor are now: Zohran Mamdani, 34; Andrew Cuomo, 67; and Curtis Sliwa, 71.\n\nMamdani is the Democratic Party candidate and also endorsed by the progressive Working Families Party.\n\nAn immigrant, Muslim and Democratic Socialist, Mamdani’s campaign has been focused on making New York more affordable, with rent freezes, free universal childcare and lower public transport costs.\n\nMamdani has been serving as a member of the State Assembly since 2021. His popularity has risen hugely over the past year, as the mayoral campaigns have got under way and, now, as early voting has begun. Nearly 370,000 ballots have already been cast as of Thursday.\n\nThe millennial candidate has appealed greatly to younger voters. On Sunday, he addressed a crowd of 13,500 people at the Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, with a promise that “New York isn’t for sale” – meaning it should be owned by the people generally, not by corporations and the “billionaire class”. Mamdani was joined by long-term Democratic Socialist senator, Bernie Sanders, and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, New York congresswoman who won congressional elections in 2018 with record numbers.\n\nThe independent candidate was New York’s Democratic Governor from 2011-2021, and served as the attorney general of New York from 2007-2010, US secretary of housing and urban development from 1997-2001, and assistant secretary of housing and urban development from 1993-1997.\n\nThe government stalwart has decades of federal and state-level political experience, but in his last term as New York governor, he was accused by 13 women of sexual harassment and was forced to step down from office.\n\nAn independent investigation by the Office of the New York State Attorney General concluded that Cuomo had sexually harassed multiple women. This included unwanted touching, kissing and hugging, inappropriate comments, and retaliation against at least one complainant.\n\nInitially, Cuomo ran as a Democratic candidate for mayor, but lost in the primaries to Mamdani. Cuomo received 43.61 percent of the votes, and Mamdani 56.39 percent.\n\nCuomo’s political experience may resonate with older voters but, according to all the major polls, Mamdani is at least 10 points ahead of him.\n\nIn April, the New York City Campaign Finance Board (CFB), the campaign finance regulator, found Cuomo’s campaign had not provided evidence of digital donations, a requirement to qualify for public funds.\n\nCuomo’s campaign lost out on nearly $3 million in public funds as a result of this.\n\nThen, in May, the CFB fined his campaign $675,000 for “improper coordination” with a  supporting Super PAC .\n\nCuomo has been supported by billionaires William P Lauder, Barry Diller, Michael Kors and Michael Bloomberg.\n\nSince early voting began on October 25, almost 300,000 ballots have already been submitted. So far, Mamdani has maintained a 10-point lead over Cuomo, according to the Quinnipiac University Poll. The RealClearPolitics average has Mamdani leading at 46 percent, followed by Cuomo at 30.5 percent, and Sliwa trailing at 16.6 percent.\n\nUnlike in the primaries, in which voters rank their choices, New York City voters will mark just one choice for mayor. Candidates are listed by party on the ballot paper, so some appear more than once if they have been endorsed by more than one.\n\nAs of February, there were  5.1 million registered voters in New York City , of whom 65 percent were Democrats and 11 percent were Republicans. About 1.1 million voters were not registered with any party and voter registration closed on  October 25 , one week before the November 4 election.\n\nIn the last New York City mayoral election, just more than 1.1 million voters cast ballots – about 21 percent of registered voters.\n\nTo be eligible to vote, residents of New York must:\n\nPolling stations will be open between the hours of 6am (10:00 GMT) and 9pm (01:00 GMT on November 5) on November 4.\n\nTimings vary from location to location in the city, but polling stations open between 8am and 10am and close between 4pm and 9pm.\n\nEarly voting began on October 25 and will end on November 2.\n\nA full list of polling stations open for early voting is available on the Board of Elections in the City of New York  website .\n\nNew Yorkers will also cast votes for the positions of public advocate and comptroller in citywide elections. Many districts will also choose a new borough president, City Council seats, judges and other local offices.\n\nIn addition to that, voters must vote in favour of or against the following proposals on the ballot:"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/31/live-israel-bombs-south-gaza-as-palestinians-live-ceasefire-without-peace?update=4073580","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:01:18+00:00","title":"Israel returns bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, some show signs of torture","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has returned the bodies of Palestinians to Gaza, some showing signs of torture, following Hamas's handover of two Israeli captives.

Try smiling or doing a good deed to snap out of it \n         By Marielle Segarra, Margaret Cirino \n        \n           Updated Friday, January 3, 2025 • 4:09 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on Jan. 15, 2024, and has been updated.  When Jenny Taitz returned to work after giving birth to her second child, she started a bad habit. Out of anxiety, she chewed on her fingernail to the point that it got infected. And she needed emergency surgery to treat it.  If she had only paused for an emotional \"reset,\" or taken a moment to respond to her stress, she might have saved herself hours in the ER, says  Taitz, a clinical psychologist . \"Stress resets are quick ways to improve how you feel in minutes. They allow you to do things that will help you solve problems rather than make things so much worse for yourself.\"  That's the focus of Taitz's book,  Stress Resets: How to Soothe Your Body and Mind in Minutes . In it, she shares 75 science-backed techniques to help alleviate stress and anxiety in real time — \"no ponderous meditations, medications or martinis required,\" she writes.  Taitz interviewed experts and combed through the latest research to compile a comprehensive menu of resets for her book. She explains what to do if you have trouble focusing or breathing, feel stuck in a cycle of panic, or can't stop obsessing over a problem. Here are a few of our favorites.  Name that emotion Use when: You feel overwhelmed with negative emotions and you're not sure why you feel this way.  The technique:  Observe and describe the emotion passing through you and label its intensity. Maybe you're feeling dejected and you're at a 3 on a 0 to 5 scale. When you're able to observe your emotion, this can \"loosen the grip\" of your sadness, anger or stress and \"not be engulfed by them,\" says Taitz.  Researchers call this technique \" affect labeling .\" Taitz says it can disrupt the activity in your limbic system, the emotional part of the brain. It allows you to instead activate the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the more reasonable part of your brain, which reduces the intensity of your emotions.  Studies  have shown that when people viewed upsetting images and labeled their emotions, they experienced significantly less distress.  Make a pie chart of your life Use when: There's been an upsetting event and now you think everything is terrible — for example, you didn't get the job you really, really wanted.  The technique:  Grab a pen and paper and make a list of what you care most about: health, friendships, career, hobbies, family, pets. Assign each item a percentage based on how much it matters to you — then draw each segment in a pie chart.  The image should be an instant reminder that \"there are a lot of other things that matter\" in your life, says Taitz. So don't let the one thing that upsets you take up 100% of your thoughts.  The pie chart method is grounded in something called  psychological flexibility , says Taitz. This is the ability to adapt to changing surroundings smoothly. Exercises like this one can help you practice perspective.  Wear a half smile Use when: You're in a setting that is making you anxious, but you have to get through it — like when you're sitting in traffic, or about to give a big wedding speech.    The technique:  Do you tense up your face when you're stressed? If so, Taitz wants you to try a half smile.  Ever so slightly raise the upper corners of your lips. This will automatically reduce all that tension between your eyebrows and relax your face muscles, communicating to your brain that everything's OK, she says.  Taitz recommends wearing a half smile when you're in a strenuous or anxious setting. \"If you're sitting in a lot of traffic, clenching your hands on the steering wheel and tensing your face, that's not going to help you accept what is happening,\" says Taitz. \"But if you can soften your face, you're more likely to make peace\" with your situation. The half smile technique is rooted in what some researchers call the  facial feedback hypothesis , the theory that our faces influence our emotions. In one  3,800-person study  from 2022, people who changed their facial expressions to appear happier felt more positive emotions as a result.  The key is not to fake it, says Taitz. Focus on feeling tranquil both inside and out. Do a good deed Use when: You feel like you have no control over your life. Your apartment flooded, your date canceled, you lost your wallet – nothing seems to be going right! The technique:  Many of the reasons why we feel stressed \"are because we feel powerless. We're so focused on all the things going wrong,\" says Taitz.  Doing a good deed can remind you that you have the power and ability to make things better — for yourself and others. \"You can live by your values even if so much is out of your control,\" she says.  These kind acts don't have to be time-consuming, she adds. They can be small, positive actions that you can do in a pinch: Send a friend a greeting card out of the blue. Be extra kind to your neighbors. Find a volunteer opportunity that resonates with you and commit to it.  These acts may even offer positive benefits to your health. One  800-person study  of older adults found that those who did good deeds, like helping family members with errands or providing childcare, had a lower chance of dying from stress-related causes.  Taitz says all of these are actions like \"small wheels on a big suitcase.\" A tiny tool can help make a difference in carrying a huge load. So pause the next time you're feeling stressed and give yourself a reset. \"A moment of awareness and a strategy can make what feels overwhelming doable.\" The audio portion of this episode was produced by Margaret Cirino.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. Hey, everybody, it's Marielle. You ever just get completely overwhelmed? The phone is ringing nonstop. You've got dozens of unread emails just from today. Your kids are fighting over a toy. You open the mail, and you've got a huge, unexpected bill from the doctor's office. Oh, and you're hangry, so that doesn't help anything. The stress, you know, sometimes it just reaches a fever pitch that can feel terrible in our bodies. JENNY TAITZ: For some people it's very physical. SEGARRA: Jenny Taitz is a clinical psychologist, and she says stress also shows up in our thoughts and our behaviors. TAITZ: So if I'm feeling really angry, that usually includes some sort of judgment of that was really unfair. In my body, I may be feeling really tense and scowling, and my behavior may be to send an aggressive text or say something really rude or yell. SEGARRA: In these moments when we're overextended, it's hard to carve out a path forward. Jenny would like you to try something, though, called a stress reset. TAITZ: Stress resets are quick ways to improve how you feel in minutes, and that allows you, ultimately, to do things that will help you solve problems rather than make things so much worse for yourself. SEGARRA: Jenny wrote a book called \"Stress Resets: How To Soothe Your Body And Mind In Minutes.\" And on this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to give you a whole bunch of resets for your mind, your body and your behavior. You'll pick what works for you depending on what your stress feels like and how it's showing up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Jenny, in the book, you outline different types of stress resets for your mind, for your body and for your behavior. How are these different? TAITZ: So mind resets specifically target thinking in ways that don't serve us. Body resets really target our physical experience of stress and behavior resets really are meant to improve our behavior so we don't act in ways that just makes stress skyrocket. SEGARRA: So how would you know that you might need a mind reset? TAITZ: When you are really, really stuck in overthinking, thinking the worst and lacking clear perspective, and you're thinking in ways that don't inch you closer to problem solving, but you feel like you're drowning in worst-case scenario thoughts. SEGARRA: Yeah. I've been there. I guess we all have. TAITZ: We all have. SEGARRA: OK. So let's walk through a few of the mind resets from the book. I'll tell you a few of my favorites. One was name that emotion. Tell me what that one is. TAITZ: Naming your emotion, just taking a step back and observing and describing your emotion to notice I am feeling sad and then labeling its intensity, maybe you're feeling sad at a three on a zero-to-five scale, loosens the grip of sadness because when you're able to observe your emotion, this allows us to not be engulfed by them but to see them with distance and openness. And naming them technically kind of disrupts activity in your limbic system, which is the emotional part of the brain, and allows you to engage your prefrontal cortex, which is the more reasonable part of your brain. So even if this sounds very simple, it actually, physiologically, makes a really profound difference. SEGARRA: I find that it helps, too, if I say, you know, what am I feeling, and then it might be, for instance, fear. Sometimes I'll journal this and then I'll be like, of what? And then it helps just to write down what I'm actually afraid of because sometimes looking at those things, I'm like, well, those are very unlikely to happen. Or if they do happen, I am able to handle that. TAITZ: I love that. And I also love simply thinking, like, if I'm feeling sad, it's pretty likely that I am a magnet for sad thoughts. And so rather than taking them very seriously, being really aware that my thinking is governed by sadness rather than the reality at hand. SEGARRA: Yeah. OK. Another one I really liked. Another mind reset is sing your thoughts. What is this one about? TAITZ: So singing your thoughts really gets at the concept of cognitive diffusion, which means playing with your thoughts rather than taking them so seriously. And one of the funnest ways to remember this is if you know that you have a recurrent thought that's simply not true and not helpful but something that's likely to come up when you're feeling emotions intensely. Let's say you're feeling lonely on a Saturday night, and your mind tends to berate you with the thought that I'm a loser, rather than, you know, telling yourself you're not or trying to convince yourself, really seeing that for what it is. It's just noise. To remember that if you did something like saying I'm a loser to the tune of \"Do You Believe In Magic\" or - one of my clients taught me this, and I think this is, like, the best way to apply this - is even just thinking what are thoughts, like, to the Haddaway song, \"What Is Love\" love can't hurt me no more, you know, what are thoughts? Thoughts can't hurt me no more. So if your thoughts are more like Play-Doh rather than cement, they can't hold you back in your life. SEGARRA: Yeah. I will say there's one that I find pops into my head - the repeating thought, like, nobody likes you. But it also sounds like just a - such a silly thing to sing. Like, I was just listening to \"Build Me Up Buttercup,\" you know, so maybe something like that. Like, (singing) why does everyone, everyone hate me so much? (Laughter). TAITZ: That's perfect because now you're - you can't sing that without laughing. So that automatically puts your inner wisdom in the front seat and your irrational thoughts where they belong. SEGARRA: OK. TAITZ: Yeah. That's such a powerful way for people to realize if this is working or not. If you have a sense of humor rather than a sense of defeat, then that's a good clue that you're on the right track. And this is not for thoughts like I need to get my work done. This is for thoughts that are downright unhelpful and ridiculous. SEGARRA: OK. All right. So the other mind reset that I really liked was make a pie chart of your life. Can you explain this one? TAITZ: Yes. So making a pie chart is really a way to remember all of the things that matter to us. And so if we take a step back and we write down with a pen and paper all of the various domains of our lives that matter - let's say our health, our career, our friendships, our hobbies - and then visually representing them so their relative weight is aligned with how much they matter, so maybe health is, like, 30% and hobbies is 20% or, you know, you need to really do some soul searching and come up with the numbers that represent what's truest for you. And making a pie chart of our lives is such a essential way to gain perspective when something disappointing happens because it's so easy if you're doing something like interviewing for a job you really want to think that everything is terrible if you don't get that role. And of course, it's a huge disappointment, and I don't want to minimize that at all. But I also want people to realize that even if something feels like it's everything, there are a lot of other things that matter. SEGARRA: You say it's kind of like zooming out to see the full picture. TAITZ: Exactly. SEGARRA: Got it. OK. Let's talk about body resets. When would you know that you might need one of these? TAITZ: If you are feeling really physically stressed - if you're really tense, if your shoulders are up to your ears, if you're finding that you're short of breath, if you feel really distracted by your body, like you can't sit at your desk because you feel so restless or overwhelmed, physically. SEGARRA: OK. All right. So one is move your body in short, quick bursts. What might that look like? TAITZ: If you're feeling very revved up, a lot of times, people just use that as evidence that something's really wrong. And so if you, instead, do something like do some jumping jacks, and then you can attribute your physical symptoms of stress to the exercise you're doing rather than something that you're catastrophizing and feeling afraid of. SEGARRA: Another one is expand your gaze. And I have to say, I tried this the other day when I was feeling really stressed out, and I was out to lunch but thinking about and overthinking about something, and this really worked. Can you talk about what it means, expand your gaze? TAITZ: I'm so happy this really worked for you. Yeah. A lot of times, as part of our stress response, we hyperfocus or we zoom in on what it is we're stressed about. And so simply zooming out to adopt a more relaxed view. So you might notice three sights. Maybe you notice three sounds. Because when we're stressed, our pupils tend to dilate and we narrow our attention. This is part of our fight-or-flight response. But when we literally relax our gaze, it's a little easier to just realize that there's so much more than the narrow focus of our stress. SEGARRA: Yeah. I was sitting at a restaurant, the weather was still nice enough that I could be sitting outside, actually, and I had been looking at my phone, but I just put it down and put it in my bag. And then I picked my head up and I looked at what was happening across the street. I looked at somebody walking their dog. I looked at, like, a bookstore. Just different things like that. Literally, like, zooming out the camera lens in my own eyeball, you know? TAITZ: And I love that because that allows you to naturally experience gratitude. A lot of people feel like gratitude is something being forced upon them that feels fake. But when we just look a little wider and bigger, there are so many things within our periphery that allow us to genuinely experience thanks and awareness. SEGARRA: Yeah. All right, one more body reset - sigh it out. Now, let's talk about this one because I do find that this helps. But also, if you're around other people and you're deep sighing, it can make them feel a little bit uncomfortable or anxious. TAITZ: Yeah. And, Marielle, this is the reason that there's 75 options in here, because different things really work for different people. But to do this, you gently close your lips, and you inhale through your nose, then take another inhale through your nose. So - and then an extended exhale. And this is called the physiological sigh. And repeating it a couple of times is known as cyclic sighing. And researchers have found that people practicing this for five minutes a day experienced more positive emotions. And when you intentionally sigh, your lungs expand and so you release more carbon dioxide. And a lot of carbon dioxide is associated with anxiety. And so by practicing this, you can kind of reset your breathing pattern, feel a little bit more relaxed and then doing this can kind of lend itself to slowing down your breathing in general. SEGARRA: I get it. So it sounds like this is a very particular kind of breathing practice. It's not just like all right everybody, deep sigh, like, ah, you know what I mean? Like, I come from a family of deep sighers is what I'm saying. And it is often used as a tool to indicate frustration to one's family members. But this sounds like a different thing where it's kind of a private moment, and you're just inhaling through your nose and then inhaling again a little bit and then exhaling long. TAITZ: Yeah. And it doesn't need to be a grunt. I could do it right now, you know, two back-to-back inhales and a longer exhale. And that may just seem like I'm almost, like, recalibrating. SEGARRA: It does work. All right. So our last category is behavior resets. How might you know that you need one of these? TAITZ: When you are acting in ways that are almost, like, the equivalent of a high-interest credit card, where short term, you might be feeling pretty good, but long term, your behaviors are going to come back to haunt you. So oftentimes, stress isn't just a feeling but also a behavior. And it might be helpful to just take a step back and think about what are your go-to stress behaviors that you want to improve. Is it being mean to the people around you? Is it canceling plans that you actually would enjoy because you want to curl up in bed? And so the first step would be to get really clear on what you tend to do when you get stressed and know that there are a lot of ways to make this moment better that don't - aren't going to hurt us long term. SEGARRA: OK. So some examples from the book are, for instance, to build a hope kit. What would that look like? TAITZ: If you're focusing on the negative, it's really helpful to have a way to quickly lean into hope. And hope isn't just a feeling, but it's a behavior. And creating a collection of objects, pictures, other sorts of mementos that remind you of things being better can help keep you going. And if you're someone that has a really good friend group and you could look at a picture of some close friends, or if music has always been a really powerful mood boost for you, having a playlist that you go to. Remarkably, there's an app called the Virtual Hope Box app, and people that struggle with suicidal feelings who use the Virtual Hope Box app actually have a reduction in feelings of wanting to die. And again, reminding ourselves in our hardest moments that we can continue forward and things will get better and have been better is such a gift to ourselves rather than predicting and rehearsing all of the ways things will continue to be terrible. SEGARRA: Yeah. For me, it's often pictures of my family and friends and my friends' kids and dogs and, like, I'll just pull them out and look at them. Like, there's even one recent picture of my friend's daughter eating a marshmallow, and her cheeks looks so big and it's just, like, the cutest squishiest picture ever. She's a year old. Like, I've been looking at it recently when I have felt down. TAITZ: I love that. Pictures are so powerful. Like, pictures actually can reduce our experience of pain. Like, looking at uplifting pictures or pictures of people that we love. I personally love music, and I love greeting, like, cards that people have written me that I can keep handy. SEGARRA: Yeah. That's really lovely. OK. Another behavior reset is to do a good deed. What might you do? What are some examples? TAITZ: There are so many ways to do good deeds. It could be something big. It could be something small. Even just noticing someone that might not normally be noticed. Sending someone a card just out of the blue is a really sweet gesture. Then, if you want to really commit to this, even finding a volunteer opportunity could make a really big difference. And this is such a nice way to feel like you have a say in your life. A lot of the reasons that we feel stressed is because we feel powerless or we're so focused on all of the things that are going wrong, and doing something nice is a way to actually feel like you have some ability to make things better and also gives you a little bit of perspective and helps you feel like you can live by your values, even if so much is out of your control. SEGARRA: Yeah. OK. What about take one step forward? I liked this one a lot. TAITZ: Taking one step forward is about doing the thing that we can do. And so rather than feeling overwhelmed, really picking one thing that you want to try to do to move closer to your goals. And so rather than making things feel really overwhelming by being too ambitious, just being really clear on the one thing that you can do that will be realistic and within reach. And it was really amazing, Marielle, for this book, I interviewed someone named John Moynihan, who is a police officer who was really seriously injured. He was shot while working, and he was actually shot in the face. It was a very horrific injury that - and a long recovery. And I asked him how he went from being in critical care to returning to his life in so many ways. And he really walked me through. He just - he set one goal at a time. And his first goal, starting when he was in the hospital, was doing this run that he did every summer since childhood. It was a seven-mile run in Cape Cod, and that was just his goal. It wasn't how am I going to figure the rest of my life out, how am I going to fully recover, it was like, how do I, like, learn how to walk again so I could complete this run somehow, even if I'm walking it? And setting that one goal created a positive cycle where other positive, forward movement came as a result. SEGARRA: Yeah. And even that goal, I imagine, started with something even smaller, right? He probably had to go to physical therapy. So it was like make appointment with physical therapist. And that's today's task, you know, or, like, do my exercises today. TAITZ: Yeah. 'Cause it's so easy for us also to then think about the next thing. But if it's even, you know, call the physical therapist and stand up for one moment and really celebrating that rather than feeling less than for not having finished everything in its entirety. SEGARRA: OK. So these are all really helpful resets that can help us in the moment when we're feeling overwhelmed by stress. I wonder, what's the work after those moments, right? What can we do to kind of improve or change our lives so that maybe we're not experiencing as much stress? TAITZ: For most of us, mental health is really a series of behaviors, and a lot of us underestimate that our habits can be as powerful as antidepressants. And so rather than waiting to be in a really tough situation and trying to get yourself out of it, there are things we can do in advance. You know, getting a good night's sleep is a huge way to relieve stress. Exercising every day is a really powerful antidepressant. Connecting with people on a regular basis is such a powerful tool that even reduces the risk of getting a cold. And so rather than just leaning on quick things in difficult moments, we also want to set ourselves up to feel like our day-to-day life is more enjoyable and more livable and setting us up for success. And so I don't want anyone to feel like the goal of life is to build a hope kit or to sing your thoughts, but doing those things will allow us to unhook from the things that are holding us back and inch towards the things that we want our lives to stand for. SEGARRA: Wow. I feel like I could talk to you about this for days. Thank you so much. These are really helpful, Jenny. TAITZ: Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time. I want everyone to really realize that a little can go such a long way. It's like small wheels on a big suitcase. A moment of awareness and a doable strategy can make what feels overwhelming really doable. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: All right, time for a recap. If your mind is feeling all squirrely, try a mind reset. Name an emotion. Sing your thoughts. Make a pie chart of what's important in your life. Or maybe you're feeling like you need a body reset. Try moving your body, relaxing your gaze or doing some cyclic sighing. Or if you've been acting out a little bit, maybe you try a behavior reset. Put together a collection of objects that make you hopeful, do a good deed or just take one step forward towards a goal. Now, these resets aren't everything you need to know about mental health, but they will give you some space to figure out what you need and what changes you'd like to make in your life.

backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/tropical-storm-melissa-soon-a-hurricane-brings-death-floods-to-caribbean","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-25","timeOfPublication":"07:03:42+00:00","title":"Hurricane Melissa rapidly intensifies, threatening major Caribbean flooding","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa has rapidly intensified into a major storm with sustained winds of 120 km/h, threatening multiple Caribbean nations including Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

hurricane , the United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) says, as people across several Caribbean countries braced for heavy rainfall and dangerous flooding.\n\nHurricane Melissa was located about 380km (235 miles) southwest of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour, the NHC said in its latest advisory on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA hurricane warning was in place for Jamaica as the NHC said life-threatening and catastrophic flash flooding and landslides were expected in portions of southern Hispaniola island – shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic – and Jamaica into early next week.\n\nThe centre of Melissa was expected to move near or over Jamaica during the weekend and early next week, the NHC said, adding that it could be near or over eastern Cuba by the middle of next week.\n\nA hurricane watch was also in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from Port-au-Prince to the border with the Dominican Republic, according to the NHC advisory.\n\nAlready, three people have died in Haiti, including two killed in a landslide in the capital Port-au-Prince and another struck by a falling tree in Marigot, officials said.\n\nA fourth person was killed in the Dominican Republic, where another remains missing.\n\nJamaica’s Meteorological Service principal director Evan Thompson told The Gleaner that residents should brace for a “double effect” as the hurricane’s eye passes over the island, with the strongest winds hitting from opposite directions on either side of the centre.\n\nThe forecast marks a significant shift from earlier in the week, when landfall was considered only a “slim chance”.\n\nAuthorities have readied more than 650 emergency shelters across Jamaica and said airports will close once a hurricane warning is declared. Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned the public to treat the approaching storm as a serious threat. “Take all measures to protect yourself,” he said.\n\nThe storm has already wrought havoc in the Dominican Republic, where nearly 200 homes have been damaged and more than half a million people left without water.\n\nIn the Los Rios neighbourhood of the capital, Santo Domingo, families were forced to flee rising floodwaters on Thursday evening after surrounding streams burst their banks, according to the Listin Diario daily newspaper.\n\nMore than two dozen Dominican communities remain cut off by floodwaters, prompting mandatory evacuations and nationwide school closures.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for thousands displaced by gang violence in Port-au-Prince, now living in makeshift shelters with scant protection.\n\n“I’m dealing with two storms: the gangs and the weather,” Nephtali Johnson Pierre told The Associated Press news agency.\n\nMelissa is also forecast to strike eastern Cuba as a major hurricane on Wednesday."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr4qqgdlkjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"22:01:43.279+00:00","title":"Sudan war: Survivors of el-Fasher siege tell the BBC about RSF brutality","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Survivors from the el-Fasher siege in Sudan describe horrific violence perpetrated by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), including torture, mass killings, and looting, as they flee to Tawila in search of safety.

just the clothes he is wearing, Ezzeldin Hassan Musa describes the brutality of Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the wake of the paramilitary group taking control of el-Fasher city in the Darfur region.\n\nHe says its fighters tortured and murdered men trying to flee.\n\nNow in the town of Tawila, lying exhausted on a mat under a gazebo, Ezzeldin is one of several thousand people who have made it to relative safety after escaping what the UN has described as \"horrific\" violence.\n\nOn Wednesday, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\" in el-Fasher and said they would be investigated. A day later a senior UN official said the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects.\n\nAbout an 80km (50-mile) journey from el-Fasher, Tawila is one of several places where those lucky enough to escape the RSF fighters are fleeing to.\n\n\"We left el-Fasher four days ago. The suffering we encountered on the way was unimaginable,\" Ezzeldin says.\n\n\"We were divided into groups and beaten. The scenes were extremely brutal. We saw people murdered in front of us. We saw people being beaten. It was really terrible.\n\n\"I myself was hit on the head, back, and legs. They beat me with sticks. They wanted to execute us completely. But when the opportunity arose, we ran, while others in front were detained.\"\n\nEzzeldin says he joined a group of escapees who took shelter in a building, moving by night and sometimes literally crawling along the ground in an effort to remain hidden.\n\n\"Our belongings were stolen,\" he says. \"Phones, clothes - everything. Literally, even my shoes were stolen. Nothing was left.\n\n\"We went without food for three days while walking in the streets. By God's mercy, we made it through.\"\n\nThose in Tawila told the BBC that men making the journey were particularly likely to be subjected to scrutiny by the RSF, with fighters targeting anyone suspected of being a soldier.\n\nEzzeldin is one of around 5,000 people thought to have arrived in Tawila since the fall of el-Fasher on Sunday.\n\nMany have made the entire journey on foot, travelling for three or four days to flee the violence.\n\nA freelance journalist based in Tawila, working for the BBC, has conducted among the first interviews with some of those who made the journey.\n\nNear to Ezzeldin sits Ahmed Ismail Ibrahim, his body bandaged in several places.\n\nHe says his eye was injured in an artillery strike, and he left the city on Sunday after receiving treatment in hospital.\n\nHe and six other men were stopped by RSF fighters.\n\n\"Four of them - they killed them in front of us. Beat them and killed them,\" he says, adding that he was shot three times.\n\nAhmed describes how the fighters demanded to see the phones of the three who were left alive and went through them, searching their messages.\n\nOne fighter, he says, finally told them: \"OK, get up and go.\" They fled into the scrub.\n\n\"My brothers,\" he adds, \"they didn't leave me behind.\n\n\"We walked for about 10 minutes, then rested for 10 minutes, and we continued until we found peace now.\"\n\nIn the next tent in the clinic run by medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Yusra Ibrahim Mohamed describes making the decision to flee the city after her husband, a soldier with the Sudanese army, was killed.\n\n\"My husband was in the artillery,\" she says. \"He was returning home and was killed during the attacks.\n\n\"We stayed patient. Then the clashes and attacks continued. We managed to escape.\n\n\"We left three days ago,\" she says, \"moving in different directions from the artillery areas. The people guiding us didn't know what was happening.\n\n\"If someone resisted, they were beaten or robbed. They would take everything you had. People could even be executed. I saw dead bodies in the streets.\"\n\nAlfadil Dukhan works in the MSF clinic.\n\nHe and his colleagues have been providing emergency care to those who arrive - among them, he says, are 500 in need of urgent medical treatment.\n\n\"Most of the new arrivals are elders and women or children,\" the medic says.\n\n\"The wounded are suffering, and some of them they already have amputations.\n\n\"So they are really suffering a lot. And we are trying to just give them some support and some medical care.\"\n\nThose arriving this week in Tawila join hundreds of thousands there who fled previous rounds of violence in el-Fasher.\n\nBefore its seizure by the RSF on Sunday, the city had been besieged for 18 months.\n\nThose trapped inside were bombarded by a barrage of deadly artillery and air strikes as the army and the paramilitaries battled for el-Fasher.\n\nAnd they were plunged into a severe hunger crisis by an RSF blockade of supplies and aid.\n\nHundreds of thousands were displaced in April when the RSF seized control of the Zamzam camp close to the city, at the time one of the main sites housing people forced to flee fighting elsewhere.\n\nSome experts have expressed concern at the relatively low numbers arriving at places like Tawila now.\n\n\"This is actually a point of worry for us,\" says Caroline Bouvoir, who works with refugees in neighbouring Chad for the aid agency Solidarités International\n\n\"In the past few days we have about 5,000 people who have arrived, which considering we believe there were about a quarter of a million people still in the city, that is obviously not that many,\" she says.\n\n\"We see the conditions that those who have arrived are in. They are highly malnourished, highly dehydrated, or sick or injured, and they are clearly traumatised with what they have seen either in the city or on the road.\n\n\"We believe that many people are stuck currently in different locations between Tawila and el-Fasher, and unable to move forward - either because of their physical condition or because of the insecurity on the road, where militias are unfortunately attacking people who are trying to find safe haven.\"\n\nFor Ezzeldin the relief of having reached safety is tempered by the fears for those still behind him on the journey.\n\n\"My message is that public roads should be secured for citizens,\" he pleads, \"or humanitarian aid sent to the streets.\n\n\"People are in a critical state - they can't move, speak, or seek help.\n\n\"Aid should reach them, because many are missing and suffering.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qp75z3dw4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:21:33.508+00:00","title":"Buckingham Palace statement on Prince Andrew in full","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Buckingham Palace has officially removed Prince Andrew from the royal family by stripping him of his titles, including the Duke of York, and requiring him to vacate Royal Lodge.

result of Hurricane Melissa, Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon has said, as search and rescue efforts continue and authorities try to get aid to hard-hit areas.\n\nThe hurricane, one of the most powerful to strike the Caribbean, has also killed at least 30 people in Haiti, officials said.\n\nIn Jamaica, \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened\", Dixon said, adding there are \"devastating\" scenes in western regions.\n\nElectricity remains out to most of the island and as people try to salvage damaged homes and belongings from flood water and mud, many thousands are growing increasingly desperate for aid.\n\nThere are parts of the country that have been without water for several days and food is growing increasingly scarce.\n\nAid supplies are starting to arrive more rapidly with the main airport in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, largely back to normal.\n\nBut smaller regional airports, some of which are located near to where humanitarian assistance is most needed, remain only partly operational.\n\nAs such, aid agencies and the military are bringing in the urgently needed supplies from Kingston via road, many of which remain unpassable in places.\n\nA journey from Mandeville, in the centre of the country, to Black River - normally an hour - is taking eight hours because the roads are so torn up.\n\nArmy vehicles and relief convoys are struggling to get past fallen trees and poles, leaving many who live in western areas very much without the aid they need.\n\nSatellite imagery shows  nearly all buildings in some Jamaican villages  have been destroyed by the hurricane.\n\nResidents of towns in western Jamaica told the BBC on Thursday that \"words can't explain how devastating\" the storm has been for the country.\n\n\"No-one is able to get through to their loved ones,\" Trevor 'Zyanigh' Whyte told the BBC from the town of White House in Westmoreland parish.\n\n\"Everyone is just, you know, completely disconnected... Every tree is on the road, right, so you can't get too far with the cars, not even a bicycle,\" he said.\n\nOn the drive from Kingston to Falmouth towards Montego Bay, the scene worsens. Walking around, there are buildings with half a roof and people drying their mattresses by the sides of the road.\n\nPeople are struggling to get their lives back together and trying to clear the streets, as the power company is trying to get poles moved.\n\nJamaica, a very green and mountainous country, has been stripped - leaving what looks like twigs and matchsticks.\n\nIn Haiti, many of the victims in the storm died when a river overflowed in Petit-Goave. A full assessment is ongoing, as there are still areas that authorities have not been able to access.\n\nAround 15,000 people were staying in more than 120 shelters in Haiti, interim UN co-ordinator for the country Gregoire Goodstein said.\n\nIn Cuba, more than 3 million people were \"exposed to life-threatening conditions\" during the hurricane, with 735,000 people \"safely evacuated\", according to the UN's resident co-ordinator for Cuba Francisco Pichon.\n\nNo fatalities have been reported so far in Cuba, but almost 240 communities have been cut off due to flooding and landslides, Cuban authorities said.\n\nHurricane Melissa made landfall on Tuesday in Jamaica as a category five storm, packing winds of up to 185 mph (295 km/h), before impacting other countries in the Caribbean.\n\nGovernments, humanitarian organisations and individuals around the world are pledging support for the nations hardest hit by the storm.\n\nThe World Food Programme said it is collaborating with partners to coordinate logistics, cash and emergency supplies across Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe US State Department said it is deploying a disaster response team to the region to help with search and rescue operations, and assisting in efforts to provide food, water, medical supplies, hygiene kits and temporary shelters.\n\nThe UK government on Friday said it is mobilising an additional £5m ($6m) to send humanitarian supplies, including shelter kits and solar powered lanterns, to help people without power and whose homes have been damaged.\n\nThat is on top of £2.5m ($3.36m) already announced in emergency humanitarian funding to support recovery in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Foreign Office is also preparing flights to evacuate British nationals unable to come home on commercial flights.\n\nWhile Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti assessed the damage left in Melissa's wake, Bermuda braced for impact.\n\nThe Bermuda Weather Service expected Melissa to be a category two hurricane when it passed the British overseas territory on Thursday night.\n\nGovernment offices in Bermuda will close until Friday afternoon and all schools will shut on Friday.\n\n\"Until the official 'All Clear' is issued, residents are urged to stay off the roads so Government work crews can safely assess and clear debris,\" a public alert from the government said.\n\nIf you experienced the hurricane in Jamaica,  please share your story ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3mdvle78o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:11:41.551+00:00","title":"The US bet big on Argentina bailout - is it paying off?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent intervened in Argentina in mid-September 2025 by purchasing pesos and establishing a $20bn currency swap line to stabilize the economy amid a sharp 30% drop in the peso, driven by public panic and memories of past collapses.

situation, calling the country a key ally in the region.\n\nIn political terms, the US intervention - which included purchases of pesos and the establishment of a $20bn (£15bn) currency swap line that gives the Argentine central bank access to dollars - was a success for Milei.\n\nHis party not only fended off losses in the midterm elections but made inroads, strengthening his position.\n\nBut whether the US intervention in the country will be a success financially is another question.\n\nThe peso has fallen roughly 30% this year, including roughly 4% over the last month. The drop came despite the US commitments - and a modest rally after the election.\n\nIt's an indication of the ongoing risk. At the end of the day, the US could find itself holding a pile of pesos worth much less than they were originally.\n\nThe intervention in Argentina was a highly unusual move - especially from a White House known for its \"America First\" approach.\n\nMilei has endeared himself to conservatives in the US with his embrace of free-market reforms and radical spending cuts. He has met frequently with Trump, who has called him his \"favourite president\".\n\nBut the US has rarely offered financial bailouts to other countries - especially in a case that posed no wider financial stability risks - and direct purchases of a struggling emerging market currency are unprecedented, says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdding to the risk is Argentina's long history of currency devaluation and debt default, including most recently in 2020.\n\nFew are positioned to be as aware of the potential pitfalls as Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader working for George Soros.\n\nBessent famously took part in the 1992 speculation against the British pound. At that time, investors who bet that Sterling had been overvalued were said to have broken the Bank of England with their heavy selling.\n\nThis time, Bessent finds himself on the opposite side of similar gamble. He has defended his moves, invoking the spectre of fellow South American country, Venezuela, and arguing that failure to shore up Argentina as a US ally could lead to destabilisation in the region.\n\n\"These results are a clear example that the Trump Administration policy of Peace through Economic Strength is working,\" Bessent wrote on social media after the recent election in Argentina.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bessent posted again to say: \"the Argentine economic bridge has now turned a profit for the American people\".\n\nThe US Treasury Department did not respond to inquiries seeking more details.\n\nBut it has kept quiet about key information needed to assess Bessent's claims - including the timeline and scale of its peso purchases - or sales - and what, if any, other assets the Argentine government pledged in order to secure the swap deal.\n\nAnalysts have estimated the US has purchased as much as $2bn worth of pesos so far - hardly an earth-shattering figure.\n\nBut Democrats have criticised the help at a time of White House spending cuts and an ongoing government shutdown, accusing Bessent of wanting to protect finance \"buddies\" with investments in the country.\n\nEven some members of Trump's own Republican Party have questioned how the aid aligns with the president's \"America First\" goals.\n\nBessent has disputed any characterisation of the US support for Argentina as a \"bailout\", promising there will be \"no taxpayer losses\" and even declaring the peso \"undervalued\".\n\nBut while that could be true for a short-term trade, that view is not the general consensus.\n\nTo the contrary - most analysts say the peso is overvalued, but has been propped up by support from the Argentine central bank, which set trading limits for the peso in April.\n\nEconomists say maintaining such limits is not sustainable. They cite the surge in Argentines travelling to make purchases in neighbouring countries where their money travels farther as one of the signs that the peso is being held artificially high.\n\nThe Argentine central bank has insisted it is committed to the trading band, which was intended to protect the country from wild currency swings destabilising prices and support Milei's efforts to control inflation.\n\nBut it has already had to spend billions buying pesos to keep the currency steady, burning through International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding and dipping into its foreign reserves, which are key to paying its debt obligations.\n\nEconomists say they expect the bank will have to change its policy to allow the peso to fall more - or the country risks needing another bailout.\n\nThat choice presents a dilemma for Bessent, given his promises to guard the US against losses.\n\n\"Is the US willing to provide support to Argentina so that Argentina can defend the peso at this level?\" Mr Setser asks. \"Bessent has to decide in a sense whether to double down... or he has to let the peso adjust and recognise that his intervention was a bridge to the election.\"\n\nThe peso plummeted ahead of the midterms, as businesses and households in Argentina rushed to trade the currency for dollars.\n\nPeople wanted to protect themselves, remembering the way the currency collapsed in 2019   after the election loss of former president Mauricio Macri, who was also known for economic reform,   says Joaquín Bagües, managing director of Buenos Aires-based Grit Capital Group.\n\n\"Every single guy that I talked to, they wanted to buy dollars... they have very fresh memories about that,\" he said, describing the run as a \"confidence crisis.\"\n\nMr Bagües says the demand for dollars has eased since the election.\n\nBut the peso has not experienced the kind of sustained relief seen in other assets, like bonds or the stock market, which surged more than 20% the day after the election and has continued to rise.\n\nWhile Argentine companies are starting to tap international lending markets again, after being frozen out ahead of the election, analysts say they expect US banks to remain wary of lending to Argentina, despite a push by Bessent to arrange an additional $20bn in private financing.\n\nAnd Mr Bagües says there are too many policy questions ahead to predict what will happen to the peso.\n\nKathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy Funds Management, suggests that the peso could rise \"over the medium term\" if the government is able to continue advancing economic reforms.\n\nBut, she adds, \"there's a lot that needs to be done between now and then\".\n\nFor now, Anthony Simond, investment director on the emerging market debt team at Aberdeen Group, says he expects the peso has farther to fall.\n\n\"Bessent may say one thing, but I think the economic reality may force them to be a little bit more flexible in terms of currency management,\" he says."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/ngos-note-28-new-carbon-bomb-projects-since-2021","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"12:50:39+00:00","title":"NGOs note 28 new ‘carbon bomb’ projects since 2021","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A report by four environmental NGOs—Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies—details the launch of 28 new 'carbon bomb' fossil fuel projects between 2021 and 2024.

projects since 2021\n\nTwenty-eight new “carbon bomb” projects have launched across the globe over the past five years, according to a report issued by NGOs.\n\nDespite global efforts to phase out the use of fossil fuels, known to have  catastrophic climate effects , the report, published on Monday by a quartet of environmental nonprofits, details that dozens of new fossil fuel extraction projects that will pump out enormous emissions have been started since 2021.\n\nCarbon bombs were defined in a 2022 research article as oil, gas or coal facilities capable of generating more than a billion tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime.\n\nAt that time, the NGOs Lingo, Data for Good, Reclaim Finance, and Eclaircies counted 425 such projects worldwide.\n\nThe report said some 365 projects are still producing more than one billion tonnes each, with the fall from the 2021 total due to operations that have either cut their output or been re-evaluated.\n\nThat is despite the International Energy Agency having said in 2021 that launching new oil and gas projects was incompatible with reaching climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe landmark agreement reached in 2015 included the aim of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with the pre-industrial era.\n\nTwo years later, at COP28, countries around the world agreed to begin a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nDespite that, between 2021 and 2024, the world’s 65 largest banks financed more than $1.6 trillion to the companies involved in the projects pinpointed in the report.\n\nBarclays Bank is the most involved in supporting companies behind carbon bombs, providing $33.7bn to 62 companies, including Eni, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.\n\n“Major global banks are exacerbating climate change and future emissions by continuing to give carte blanche to these fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet,” said Louis-Maxence Delaporte, energy research manager at Reclaim Finance, one of the NGOs involved in the study.\n\nChina accounts for 43 percent of “carbon bombs”. Russia accounts for 9 percent, the United States for 5 percent.\n\nWestern oil majors  have the most such projects, although Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and China’s CHN Energy produce the most total emissions.\n\nThe report also identified more than 2,300 smaller extraction projects, approved or launched since 2021, whose potential emissions exceed five million tonnes of CO2 each, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city like Paris.\n\nCombined, the potential CO2 emissions from all these projects are 11 times greater than the global “carbon budget” remaining to keep global warming below 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, according to the authors’ calculations."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09x7jpvw7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"10:46:15.832+00:00","title":"Latvian MPs vote to pull out of treaty on protecting women from violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Latvian MPs have voted 56 to 32 to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention, a treaty designed to combat violence against women and domestic abuse, marking Latvia as the first EU country to do so.

India's north-eastern state of Manipur two years ago now face an uncertain future, as the government plans to shut down all temporary relief camps by December.\n\nThe violence, which erupted in May 2023 between the majority Meitei and the indigenous Kuki communities, was the worst the region had witnessed in decades.\n\nIt started after protests by the largely Christian Kuki community against the Meiteis, mostly Hindus, who were demanding official tribal status that would grant them access to the same government benefits and job quotas as other tribes, including Kukis.\n\nAt least 260 people were killed in the clashes and around 60,000 displaced people have since been living in temporary shelters.\n\nOver the past two years, the government has made repeated promises to rehabilitate the displaced, but little has changed on the ground. Many say their lives remain in a limbo - effectively homeless and without a steady source of income.\n\nAnxieties grew further in July when the state's then Chief Secretary Prashant Singh announced that all relief camps would be shut down by December and its residents would be resettled.\n\nHe added that those unable to return to their homes would be relocated to pre-fabricated housing units.\n\nThe government, however, did not clarify where these units would be - whether near the relief camps or near displaced people's original homes  - worsening their concerns about future.\n\nUncertainty grew in September when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his first visit to Manipur since the violence began, announced that 7,000 new homes would be built to resettle the displaced in \"appropriate locations\" without giving any other details.\n\nOn the ground, Manipur remains sharply divided: the Meiteis inhabit the Imphal Valley, while the Kukis live in the surrounding hill districts; and security forces continue to patrol the buffer zones that separate the two communities.\n\nA security official deployed in the area told BBC Hindi that his mandate was to \"ensure that Meiteis and Kukis remain in their respective areas and do not mix\".\n\nExperts say resettling people in their original neighbourhoods is crucial to prevent the violence from redrawing Manipur's social map.\n\n\"This is not good for a secular, democratic India. Resettling them in their original homes is most critical,\" said RK Nimai Singh, former secretary to the Manipur governor.\n\nHe added that many displaced people feared that if they left the relief camps and moved into temporary housing, they might never be able to return to their homes.\n\nIt's a thought that haunts Hatnu Haokip. For her, home means only one place - Imphal valley - and she yearns to go back.\n\n\"But that can't happen because our village is now surrounded by Meitei people,\" said the 22-year-old who is now living in a relief camp in the hilly Churachandpur region\n\nMs Haokip added that she would feel safer if Kuki leaders were given autonomy to set up a  separate federally-administered territory for the community.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by several other Kukis, who also feel apprehensive of returning to their homes.\n\nOn the other hand, most Meiteis BBC Hindi spoke to said they wanted to go back home.\n\nIrom Abung, who once ran a water supply business in Churachandpur, now lives in a relief camp near a buffer zone.\n\nHis house was damaged during the violence, but Mr Abung says he will never give up on the place he once called home.\n\n\"My land remains. I will never sell it because I know I will return one day,\" he said. \"Efforts must be made to bridge the gap between our two communities so people can go back to their lives.\"\n\nThe unease, coupled with uncertainty over where the new homes will be built, has raised doubts over whether the government would be able to close all relief camps by December.\n\nGovernment officials, however, insist that the resettlement plan is on track.\n\n\"From about 290 camps initially, we've brought the number down to around 260,\" a senior Manipur government official said.\n\n\"Eventually, we want to resettle people in the areas from where they fled, once they feel safe to return.\"\n\nThe official added that while they understood people's concerns, it was also in the state's interest for them to return home - otherwise, the divisions would only grow deeper.\n\nAs tens of thousands of people continue to live in relief camps, many complain about not getting the facilities the government promised them.\n\nNemhoichong Lhungdim, a single mother, said her 11-year-old son had suffered a debilitating eye injury a few months back and has lost sight in one eye.\n\nAfter government doctors failed to help, she borrowed money to take him to a private hospital, but was unable to afford the treatment.\n\n\"I was told it would cost about 300,000 rupees ($3,400; £2,600). I don't have that kind of money,\" she said.\n\nMs Lhungdim says the government sometimes organises health camps, but they have never treated her son. BBC Hindi has reached out to officials for a response.\n\nInside the camps, residents say prolonged displacement and uncertainty are also taking a toll on people's mental health.\n\nSalam Monika, 25, says her uncle took his own life last year after being driven to despair by a lack of livelihood opportunities. She says the family could not access medical help.\n\n\"Some mental health workers visited our camp a few times since 2023, but this year, they haven't come at all,\" she said.\n\nBBC Hindi has reached out to the government for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, those moved from camps into temporary housing say that while they now have a roof over their heads, they still struggle to make ends meet as livelihood remains a concern.\n\nChingakham Radha, one of the newly resettled residents, said she learned to make crochet dolls while living in the camp and now earns a small income from selling them. \"The money is very little, just enough to get by,\" she said.\n\nBefore the conflict, Ms Radha was a homemaker and her husband worked as a labourer. They were not wealthy, but had a happy life.\n\nThinking about those days, Ms Radha says life has become uncertain now.\n\n\"Some days my husband finds work, but other times weeks go by without any work,\" she said. \"I want to return home to Churachandpur, but those hopes are fading with time.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on  Instagram ,  YouTube,   X  and  Facebook ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62elnjnqqxo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:44:27.017+00:00","title":"Is this finally rock bottom for Mr Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Prince Andrew, formerly the Duke of York, has been stripped of all royal titles—Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killyleagh—marking the first time such a complete loss of royal status has occurred in modern history.

the titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed.\n\nThere are no modern precedents for such a colossal loss of royal status.\n\nUnlike the previous statement on his future, this was from Buckingham Palace rather than Andrew himself.\n\nIt's a ripping off the bandage moment, which the Palace will hope will finally draw a line under the endless oil slick of bad news stories about Andrew.\n\nThe sliver of dignity given to him, that he was voluntarily choosing not to use his titles, has been taken away.\n\nTitles such as Duke of York, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh will be forcibly removed.\n\nAll that remains is his place in the line of succession, and new guidance from the House of Commons Library has shown that too could be removed by Parliament, if Commonwealth realms give their consent.\n\nAfter more than a year of pressure, the so-called Siege of Royal Lodge is over, with Andrew losing his independent lease and moving to the King's estate in Sandringham. It's not revealed where exactly, but it's not Wood Farm.\n\nSandringham is privately owned by the King, ending any reliance on a Crown Estate property.\n\nHis ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is said to be making her own separate arrangements, not currently expected to be with Andrew in Norfolk.\n\nIt makes Andrew dependent on the King for his home and his money. And also it has to be said, a duty of care for his brother's welfare.\n\nThis announcement might head off the immediate threat of Parliament taking matters into its own hands and voting to strip Andrew of his titles. MPs had become increasingly vocal about debating the scandal and the Public Accounts Committee had been flexing its muscles over protecting public funding.\n\nBut it's going to be much harder for the Palace to settle an authentic feeling of public outrage. The sense of unchecked privilege surrounding Andrew has genuinely irritated the public and it will take more than taking away his titles to dispel the sense of ugly entitlement.\n\nPolling by YouGov published on Thursday showed Andrew now has the worst ever popularity ratings for a royal, with 91% holding a negative view of him.\n\nAnd the King heard that unhappiness first hand from a heckler in Lichfield this week, who shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\"\n\nFor the Palace, there will be questions about why such longstanding problems around Andrew weren't dealt with before now. So much of this has been known for so many years - the unsuitable business links, the unexplained funding, the connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The cast list changes - alleged Chinese spies or dictators' wealthy relatives - but the story has remained the same.\n\nThe unsavoury link with Epstein was being widely discussed 14 years ago when Andrew was stripped of his role as trade representative.\n\nAndrew has been losing jobs but continuing to live in a royal style for many years now and it's stretched public patience. It felt arrogant and out of touch.\n\nA few clicks on Google will find decades of stories raising doubts about his suitability, often accompanied by pictures of Andrew in a top hat, like a renegade Monopoly piece.\n\nThere might be some public fatigue around this Andrew story. People might feel they've heard enough and are sick of it. But there was also an angry public mood that expected a clearer sense of accountability.\n\nWhat remains to be seen now is whether a wider can of worms has been opened.\n\nWho knew what and when at the Palace about Andrew and Epstein? Do we need more transparency around royal property and finance? How many houses do they have up their sleeve in Windsor? And what fresh scandals about Andrew could still emerge?\n\nBut this scorched earth approach to Andrew's future might also show an unexpectedly steely side to the King.\n\nWhile other members of the Royal Family were part of the decision, including Prince William, it's understood that it was the King who made this big call on his brother's future. Whatever the grandstanding of pundits, it can't have been an easy decision.\n\nThere seemed to have been an irrevocable change of attitude when  an email from Andrew to Epstein emerged,  showing their continued contact. It seemed to destroy Andrew's promises in the Newsnight interview to have cut ties.\n\nIt no longer seemed tenable that Andrew should have the honour of being a prince and living in some splendour among the royals in Windsor.\n\nInstead the King highlighted the victims of abuse, whose stories lie at the dark heart of Epstein's circle.\n\nIt's not long since Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was grinning on the Buckingham Palace balcony, waving to the crowds. He'll wake up tomorrow morning for the first time in his life as Mr Mountbatten Windsor, private citizen.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis  every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

2025-10-31T07:24:36.459+00:00\n\nTitle: Albert Luthuli: South African court rules apartheid police assault killed Nobel laureate\n\nA South African court has ruled that Nobel laureate Albert Luthuli's 1967 death was the result of an \"assault\" by apartheid police, overturning decades of claims that it was an accident.\n\nAn inquest held under the apartheid government concluded that Luthuli, the first African to win the Nobel Peace Prize, died after being struck by a freight train while walking along a railway line.\n\nBut activists and his family had long cast doubt on the findings, and South Africa's government reopened the case this year.\n\nA judge on Thursday ruled that the anti-apartheid hero died as a result of a fractured skull and a cerebral haemorrhage associated with an assault. His family has welcomed the judgement.\n\nLuthuli, who at the time of his death was the leader of the then-banned African National Congress (ANC), won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960 for spearheading the fight against apartheid.\n\nThe ANC went on to lead the struggle against white-minority rule and came to power in 1994, following the first democratic elections.\n\nSouth Africa's National Prosecuting Authority in April  reopened fresh investigations into Luthuli's death  as family and activists suspected the apartheid authorities had killed him and covered it up.\n\nDelivering the judgment on Thursday, Judge Nompumelelo Radebe said evidence presented at the reopened inquest did not support the 1967 inquest findings.\n\n\"It is found that the deceased died as a result of a fractured skull, cerebral haemorrhage and concussion of the brain associated with an assault,\" Judge Nompumelelo ruled.\n\nThe judge said Luthuli's death was attributable to \"assault by members of the security special branch of the South African police, acting in concert and in common purpose with employees of the South African Railway Company\".\n\nShe named seven men, whose whereabouts could \"not be ascertained\", as having committed or being complicit in the murder. If found, they could face criminal charges.\n\nAfter the judgment was read out, the Luthuli family's spokesperson called it \"the first part of finally getting justice\".\n\nANC national spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu also welcomed the court's decision, which she said \"corrected a long-standing distortion of history\".\n\n\"This ruling brings justice, truth and dignity to the memory of one of South Africa's greatest sons and to all those who suffered under apartheid brutality,\" Bhengu added.\n\nThe case at the Pietermaritzburg High Court is the latest in renewed efforts by South African authorities to deliver justice for victims of apartheid-era crimes and closure for their families.\n\nLast month, South Africa prosecutors  reopened the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko , who died in police custody in 1977 after being tortured.\n\nIn May, President Cyril Ramaphosa  established a judicial commission of inquiry to look into allegations of improper influence  in delaying or hindering the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn40w7g2d2zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"08:00:12.577+00:00","title":"Russia's new nuclear weapons - do they work or is it Putin bluster?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia has announced successful tests of two advanced nuclear weapons: the Poseidon, a nuclear-powered underwater drone, and the Burevestnik, a nuclear-powered cruise missile.

veterans of the Ukraine war, President Vladimir Putin announced Russia had tested a new weapon.\n\n\"There is nothing like this,\" the Russian leader said of the Poseidon - a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable underwater drone that can be fired like a torpedo and which a senior Russian MP said could \"put entire states out of operation\".\n\nWhen it was first unveiled in 2018, Russian media said the Poseidon would be able to achieve a speed of 200km/h (120mph) and travel in a \"constantly changing route\" that would make it impossible to intercept.\n\nPutin's claim came only days after the announcement that Moscow had conducted a test of its \"unlimited-range\" Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile.\n\nIt's \"a unique product, unmatched in the world\", Putin said of the Burevestnik, noting the missile was so new \"we are yet to identify what it is, what class of weapons [it] belongs to\".\n\nIt is not unusual for Russia to test and flaunt weapons.\n\nAnd, despite the boisterous nature of Russian announcements, their military value is ambiguous.\n\n\"They are basically Armageddon weapons - too powerful to be used unless you're happy to destroy the world,\" Mark Galeotti, a Russia scholar and long-time observer of Russian politics, told the BBC.\n\nBoth the Poseidon and the Burevestnik are second-strike, retaliatory weapons, Mr Galeotti added - and not even the most rabid Kremlin propagandists are suggesting anyone is preparing to launch strikes on Russia.\n\nIt is also unclear whether the weapons are actually viable.\n\nIn 2019,  five Russian nuclear engineers died in a rocket engine explosion  which some Russian and Western experts said was linked to the Burevestnik.\n\nTwo years later, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) - a London-based think tank specialising in global conflict and security - noted that Russia faced \"considerable technical challenges\" in ensuring \"the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit\" of the missile.\n\nNeither the Poseidon nor the Burevestnik were entirely novel - both  had first been presented to the world in 2018  as part of a new array of weapons that Putin called \"invincible\".\n\nSo it is the timing of the announcements - rather than their contents - which could be noteworthy.\n\nAfter a whirlwind few months of tentative diplomacy by US President Donald Trump to try and bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Trump appears to have cooled off on the endeavour to end the war.\n\nLast week, the White House cancelled a summit between Trump and Putin, apparently after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio realised the gulf between Moscow and Washington's positions was too great for a high-level meeting to achieve meaningful results.\n\nNot only is there no suggestion of any further talks, but soon after the meeting was cancelled, Trump imposed sanctions on two of Russia's biggest oil producers as punishment for Moscow's failure to agree on a peace deal in Ukraine.\n\nAnd while his relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seems to still be fraught, it appears Trump is growing irritated with Moscow's intractability.\n\nSo Putin may be vying for Trump's attention.\n\n\"In the face of Trump blowing hot and cold with his support for Ukraine or sympathy to Russia, here is an element in which Moscow has bigger cards than Kyiv,\" Mr Galeotti argued.\n\n\"So in that context [successful weapons tests] are more about keeping him thinking Russia is indeed powerful.\"\n\nAnother clue could come from the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nThree-and-a-half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, its troops continue to merely grind on - at great cost in human life and resources - with no obvious breakthrough likely any time soon.\n\n\"We are getting towards the end of summer fighting season in Ukraine and it has not gone very well for the Russians,\" said David Heathcote, head of intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services.\n\nThe announcements about the Burevestnik and the Poseidon should be seen as a reflection of the weakness of their conventional forces, Mr Heathcote told the BBC.\n\nRussia is not formally part of any military alliances that would serve as a deterrent if it is on the back foot, and its army is tied up and under pressure in Ukraine.\n\nIn these cases, Mr Heathcote says, \"the Russians always react with unnecessary and overexaggerated sabre rattling\".\n\nWhile Moscow's decision to publicly announce the Burevestnik and Poseidon tests may have been influenced by this, it seems the claim has already had the tangible effect of provoking Trump into instructing its military to resume nuclear weapons testing.\n\nTrump justified the move as a way of keeping pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\n\n\"With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" Trump said - although it will likely take several months for the US to restart nuclear tests after a 33-year pause.\n\nThe Kremlin's reaction to Trump's statement was quick\n\nPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov questioned whether the US president had been correctly informed. The Russian tests \"cannot in any way be interpreted as a nuclear test\", Peskov said.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on the kind of tests he wanted the US to resume.\n\nIt was likely, said IISS Head of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control Dr Alexander Bollfrass, that Trump's decision was a direct response to the Russian test of the Burevestnik and that the US could be planning to conduct similar flight tests of US Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yrd6jrplo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"01:50:50.255+00:00","title":"Mississippi drug bribery sting snares 14 police officers among 20 arrested","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal investigation in Mississippi and Tennessee uncovered a years-long bribery network involving 14 current and former law-enforcement officers, including two sheriffs, who accepted bribes ranging from $20,000 to $37,000 from drug traffickers in exchange for protection.

death of Robert De Niro's grandson and two other 19 year olds.\n\nNew York authorities accuse the suspects, Bruce Epperson, Eddie Barreto, Grant McIver, John Nicolas, and Roy Nicolas, of running a fentanyl distribution network that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media to teenagers and young adults in the city.\n\nAuthorities link the network to the overdose deaths of

five used social media and encrypted messaging apps to sell thousands fentanyl-laced pills in New York between January and July 2023.\n\nThey allege that over that summer, the drugs they sold led to at least three deaths.\n\nStein was found dead 30 May after taking fentanyl-laced pills she allegedly  purchased from John and Roy Nicolas.

Charlotte, 14, who all post videos of their daily lives.\n\nIn a post, the family said they use the internet \"for good\" and the move to the UK will mean their daughter can continue to make content.\n\nAustralia's ban - touted as a world-first - will mean Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent those under 16 years from creating accounts and deactivate existing ones.\n\nThe ban is designed to protect young people from the harmful impact of social media and tech companies that do not comply risk being fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m).\n\nIt is unclear how they will implement the ban but some potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology, prompting concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software.\n\nYouTube was initially exempt from the ban but earlier this year the government reversed its decision. Teens under 16 will still be able to view videos but will not be permitted to have an account, which is required for uploading content or interacting on the platform.\n\nIn the video detailing the family's decision to move from Perth in Western Australia to London, Beck says they are not against the social media ban.\n\n\"We understand that it is protecting young people from harm on the internet but we use the internet for good,\" she said.\n\n\"We understand that there's young people that are affected negatively from social media, we're not naïve to that.\"\n\nHer concerns are that the government hasn't \"defined it exactly, of how it's going to work yet\".\n\n\"It covers us while Australia figures out the logistics of that rule because I think there's going to be a lot of hiccups and a lot of ups and downs.\"\n\nBeck's wife Bec said social media had changed so much since it first emerged and many young people were \"making a difference for good\" on platforms.\n\nThe move also came about as all the family have dual British-Australian citizenship and their daughter Charlotte recently decided to switch to online schooling, meaning they can be based anywhere.\n\nCharlotte, who posts online as Charli, has about half a million YouTube followers, about 300,000 fans on TikTok and almost 200,000 on Instagram.

lead actor Henry Cavill has been replaced as main character Geralt of Rivia by Liam Hemsworth.\n\nThe Australian has stepped in for the final two seasons of the fantasy show, based on a popular series of novels and video games.\n\nPreviously, British actor Cavill had portrayed the title character, a monster hunter with supernatural abilities known as the White Wolf.\n\nWhen he announced he was \"passing the torch\" to Hemsworth in October 2022, describing him as a \"fantastic\" actor, not all fans agreed.\n\nSome even threatened to boycott the series without, and Hemsworth has admitted Cavill is a \"daunting\" act to follow.\n\nEarly reviews have been mixed, with US magazine Variety calling season four an \" upgrade \", while the Guardian says Hemsworth is \" as charismatic as a bollard in a wig \".\n\nBBC Newsbeat caught up with professional reviewers to get their thoughts on the latest episodes - and whether the new Geralt is up to the job.\n\nHenry Cavill's love of nerd culture is well-known, and he's been vocal about his love of video games, sci-fi and fantasy.\n\nThere's been no official explanation for his departure from The Witcher, but it's been suggested creative differences played a part.\n\nHe's spoken in interviews about being \"loyal to the source material\" and the importance of keeping Geralt the same as the character in the books.\n\nSince leaving, he's landed a role as a producer and star of Amazon's upcoming  Warhammer 40,000 series  - something he's described as a dream role.\n\nSabrina Barr, TV Editor at Metro, says Henry Cavill was the \"epitome of Geralt\", and admits seeing Hemsworth in the role was \"jarring\" at first.\n\nBut she tells Newsbeat he he does a \"good job\" and is \"brave\" for taking on the character.\n\nIn her  three-and-a-half star review , Sabrina says apprehensive Witcher fans should \"give it a chance\".\n\n\"I've got to give them credit for taking a really difficult situation and deciding to run with their creative vision,\" she says.\n\n\"In my opinion, this season isn't the best of them but I still had a really good time with it. I was gripped by the very different story lines.\"\n\nSabrina tells Newsbeat it's \"extremely rare\" to change the main actor in between seasons but this, in her opinion, is an example of \"how it can work\" if there's no other choice.\n\n\"I personally would have been a lot more upset if they just cancelled the show,\" she says.\n\n\"I have to give them credit for carrying on the story, knowing full well that from the very start there would be people criticising the choice of main actor no matter who it was.\"\n\nDawson Roberts, a content creator who focuses on TV, film and gaming as DawsOnScreen, was invited to the premiere of the new season.\n\nHe agrees the actor swap is \"definitely a bit weird\" but tells Newsbeat the transition is handled well by the show's cast and crew.\n\nIn his view, Liam Hemsworth does a \"pretty good\" job in the main role.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie and say he's better than Henry Cavill,\" says Dawson.\n\n\"But I do think Liam Hemsworth does a really solid job. You get used to it really quickly. He's got the right energy.\n\n\"Losing Henry Cavill is tough but I do think they have built that trust with the audience so now it does work.\"\n\nDawson says the unsung hero of the series is actor Laurence Fishburne, who joins the cast as vampire Regis.\n\n\"People aren't giving enough credit to Laurence Fishburne,\" he says.\n\n\"He's never done a fantasy role before and I think he kills it.\"\n\nAs for Dawson's verdict, he says he's closer to \"the seven or eight out of 10 than the two-star reviews\".\n\n\"It's definitely not the best show ever,\" he says.\n\n\"But it's still really exciting to see the game world brought to life on the screen - even if it is without Henry Cavill.\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat  live  at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back  here ."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy1n438dk4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"00:33:07.377+00:00","title":"The American adoptees who fear deportation to a country they can't remember","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights the plight of American adoptees who were not granted U.S. citizenship due to outdated adoption policies, particularly those adopted before 1983.

Unable to cope, her birth mother placed her in an orphanage in the South Korean capital, Seoul.\n\n\"He abandoned us, is the nicest way I can put it,\" says Shirley, now 61.\n\nAfter around a year, Shirley was adopted by a US couple, who took her back to Texas.\n\nShirley grew up living a life similar to that of many young Americans. She went to school, got her driving licence and worked as a bartender.\n\n\"I moved and breathed and got in trouble like many teenage Americans of the 80s. I'm a child of the 80s,\" Shirley says.\n\nShirley had children, got married and became a piano teacher. Life carried on for decades with no reason to doubt her American identity.\n\nBut then in 2012, her world came crashing down.\n\nShe lost her Social Security card and needed a replacement. But when she went to her local Social Security office, Shirley was told she needed to prove her status in the country. Eventually she found out she did not have US citizenship.\n\n\"I had a little mental breakdown after finding out I wasn't a citizen,\" she says.\n\nShirley is not alone. Estimates of how many American adoptees lack citizenship  range from 18,000 to 75,000 . Some intercountry adoptees may not even know they lack US citizenship.\n\nDozens of adoptees have been deported to their countries of birth in recent years, according to the Adoptee Rights Law Center. A man born in South Korea and adopted as a child by an American family - only to be deported to his country of birth because of a criminal record - took his own life in 2017.\n\nThe reasons why so many US adoptees do not have citizenship are varied. Shirley blames her parents for failing to finalise the correct paperwork when she came to the US. She also blames the school system and the government for not highlighting that she did not have citizenship.\n\n\"I blame all the adults in my life that literally just dropped the ball and said: 'She's here in America now, she's going to be fine.'\"\n\n\"Well, am I? Am I going to be fine?\"\n\nAnother woman, who requested anonymity for fear of attracting the attention of authorities, was adopted by an American couple from Iran in 1973 when she was two years old.\n\nGrowing up in the US Midwest, she encountered some racism but generally had a happy upbringing.\n\n\"I settled into my life, always understanding that I was an American citizen. That's what I was told. I still believe that today,\" she says.\n\nBut that changed when she tried to get a passport at the age of 38 and discovered immigration authorities had lost critical documents that supported her claim to citizenship.\n\nThis has further complicated her feelings surrounding identity.\n\n\"I personally don't categorise myself as an immigrant. I didn't come here as an immigrant with a second language, a different culture, family members, ties to a country that I was born in… my culture was erased,\" she says.\n\n\"You are told that you have these rights as an American - to vote and to participate in democracy, to work, to go to school, to raise your family, to have freedoms - all these things that Americans have.\n\n\"And then all of a sudden they started pushing us into a category of immigrants, simply because they cut us from legislation. We should have all equally had citizenship rights because that was promised through adoption policies.\"\n\nFor decades, intercountry adoptions approved by courts and government agencies did not automatically guarantee US citizenship. Adoptive parents sometimes failed to secure legal status or naturalised citizenship for their children.\n\nThe Child Citizenship Act of 2000 made some headway in rectifying this, granting automatic citizenship to international adoptees. But the law only covered future adoptees or those born after February 1983. Those who arrived before then were not granted citizenship, leaving tens of thousands in limbo.\n\nAdvocates have been pushing for Congress to remove the age cut-off but these bills have failed to make it past the House.\n\nSome, like Debbie Principe, whose two adopted children have special needs, have spent decades trying to secure citizenship for their dependents.\n\nShe adopted two children from an orphanage in Romania in the 1990s after watching them on Shame of a Nation - a documentary about the neglect of children in orphanages following the 1989 Romanian Revolution, that sent shockwaves around the world when it aired.\n\nThe most recent rejection of citizenship came in May, and was followed by a notice stating that if the decision was not appealed in 30 days, she would have to turn in her daughter to Homeland Security, she said.\n\n\"We'll just be lucky if they don't get picked up and deported to another country that isn't even their country of origin,\" Ms Principe said.\n\nThose fears for adoptees and their families have risen even further since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a vow to remove \"promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of federal law\".\n\nLast month, the Trump administration said \"two million illegal aliens have left the United States in less than 250 days, including an estimated 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and more than 400,000 deportations\".\n\nWhile many Americans support deportations of illegal migrants, there has been uproar over some incidents.\n\nIn one case, 238 Venezuelans were deported by the US to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. They were accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang  despite most of them having no criminal records.\n\nLast month, US officials detained 475 people - more than 300 of them South Korean nationals - who they said were working illegally at Hyundai's battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in Georgia.  The workers were taken away in handcuffs and chains to be detained , sparking outrage in their home country.\n\nAdoptee rights groups say they have been flooded with requests for help since Trump's return and some adoptees have gone into hiding.\n\n\"When the election results came in, it started to really cascade with requests for help,\" said Greg Luce, an attorney and founder of the Adoptee Rights Law Center, adding he's had more than 275 requests for help.\n\nThe adoptee who arrived from Iran in the 1970s said she has started avoiding certain areas, like her local Iranian supermarket, and shares an app with her friends so they always have access to her location, in case she is \"swept up\".\n\n\"At the end of the day, they don't care about your back story. They don't care that you're legally here and it's just a paperwork error. I always tell people this one single piece of paper has essentially just ruined my life,\" she said.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned right now, I feel stateless.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite adoptees being left in limbo for decades, Emily Howe, a civil and human rights attorney who has worked with adoptees across the US, believes it is just a case of political will that should unite people from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"It should be a straightforward fix: adopted children should be equal to their biological siblings of parents who were US citizens at the time of birth,\" Ms Howe said.\n\n\"The applicants have two, three, or four US citizen parents, and are now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. We're talking about babies and toddlers who were shipped overseas through no fault of their own and lawfully admitted under US policy,\" she added.\n\n\"These are people who literally were promised that they were going to be Americans when they were two years old.\"\n\nShirley wishes she could get the US president into a room, so she and others like her could explain their stories.\n\n\"I would ask him to please have some compassion. We're not illegal aliens,\" she said.\n\n\"We were put on planes as little itty-bitty babies. Just please hear our story and please follow through with the promise that America gave each one of the babies that got on those planes: American citizenship.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9pn12w4n8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:08:24.346+00:00","title":"Virginia Giuffre's family celebrate Andrew's 'prince' title being stripped","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The family of Virginia Giuffre, who died in 2024 after accusing Prince Andrew of sexual abuse, has celebrated the UK royal family's decision to strip Prince Andrew of his title and honours, calling it a historic and unprecedented victory for survivors.

past\n\nIn a wood on the edge of St Petersburg they're reading out a list of names.\n\nEach name is a victim of the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's Great Terror.\n\nIn this part of Russia there are thousands of names to be read. Thousands of lives to remember on Russia's annual Remembrance Day for Victims of Political Repression.\n\nBuried in the Levashovo Wasteland are believed to be at least 20,000 people - possibly as many as 45,000 - who were denounced, shot and disposed of in mass graves; individuals, as well as whole families destroyed in the dictator's purge in the 1930s.\n\nNailed to the trunks of pine trees are portraits of the executed. Standing here you can feel the ghosts of Russia's past.\n\nBut what of the present?\n\nToday, Russian authorities speak less about Stalin's crimes against his own people, preferring to portray the dictator as a victorious wartime leader.\n\nWhat's more, in recent years a string of repressive laws has been adopted here to punish dissent and silence criticism of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nKremlin critics might not be denounced as \"enemies of the people\" like under Stalin. But increasingly they are being designated \"foreign agents\".\n\nThe authorities claim the labelling helps to protect Russia from external threats.\n\nMore than three and a half years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities have two main objectives: victory abroad and conformity at home.\n\nAnyone here who publicly challenges, questions or even hints they doubt the official narrative that, in this war Russia is in the right, risks becoming a target.\n\nAt Leninsky District Courthouse, the stairwell outside Courtroom 11 is packed with journalists. There is barely room to move.\n\nI get talking to Irina. Her daughter Diana is on her way here in a police car for a court appearance.\n\n\"This must be frightening for you,\" I say.\n\nIrina nods.\n\n\"I never thought anything like this could happen,\" says Irina softly. \"You can't imagine it. Until it happens to you.\"\n\nMinutes later, 18-year-old Diana Loginova arrives in the building guarded by three police officers. She hugs her mother and is taken into court.\n\nDiana has already spent 13 days in jail for \"organising a mass public gathering of citizens resulting in a violation of public order\".\n\nBut the charges keep coming.\n\nThe \"mass gathering\" was an improvised street concert which the authorities claim obstructed pedestrian access to a Metro station.\n\nDiana Loginova is a music student and, under the name Naoko, lead singer with the band Stoptime.\n\nOn the streets of St Petersburg, Stoptime have been performing songs by exiled Russian artists like Noize MC and Monetochka, singer-songwriters fiercely critical of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nMany of these prominent musicians, now abroad, have been officially designated foreign agents by Russian authorities.\n\nVideos posted online show that Stoptime's street concerts have been attracting quite a crowd, with dozens of mainly young people singing along and dancing to the music.\n\nWhilst it is not forbidden in Russia to sing or play songs by foreign agents, in May a Russian court banned Noize MC's track Swan Lake Cooperative, claiming it contained \"propaganda for the violent change of the constitutional order\".\n\nSwan Lake is seen by many as a symbol of political change in Russia.\n\nIn the USSR, Soviet TV often showed the ballet following the death of Soviet leaders, and it was back on Soviet TV screens in 1991 during the failed coup by communist hardliners. Lake (Ozero in Russian) is also the name of a dacha co-operative widely associated with President Putin's inner circle.\n\nA video clip of Stoptime performing the song went viral recently on social media.\n\nDiana Loginova was detained on 15 October. Police also arrested her boyfriend, guitarist Alexander Orlov, and drummer, Vladislav Leontyev.\n\nThe three band members were sentenced to between 12 and 13 days behind bars.\n\nIn Courtroom 11 Diana is facing an additional charge: discrediting the Russian armed forces. It relates to one of the songs she sang: You're a Soldier by (\"foreign agent\") Monetochka.\n\n\" You're a soldier, \" begins the chorus.\n\n\"And whatever war you are fighting,\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'll be on the other side.\"\n\nAfter a brief hearing the judge finds Diana guilty of discrediting Russia's army and fines her 30,000 roubles (£285).\n\nBut she is not free to go. The police take Diana back to the police station and prepare more charges.\n\nThe next day she and her boyfriend Alexander are brought to Smolninsky District Court. I manage to have a word with them before they enter the courtroom.\n\n\"I'm very pleased, and it's important, that people have been supporting us, that many people are on our side, on the side of truth,\" Diana tells me.\n\n\"I'm surprised by how things have been exaggerated. We've been accused of lots of things we didn't do. All we were doing was bringing the music we like to a mass audience. The power of music is very important. What's happening now proves that.\"\n\n\"I think it's not the words, it's the music that is most important,\" guitarist Alexander Orlov tells me. \"Music says everything for people. It always has.\"\n\nAlexander reveals he proposed to Diana when the police van they were being transported in stopped at a petrol station.\n\n\"I made a ring out of a tissue,\" he tells me. \"I had time to get on my knees, and she said yes.\"\n\n\"We hope we'll be back home soon,\" says Diana. \"That's what we're dreaming of most.\"\n\nThey won't be going home yet. At this latest court hearing the judge sends Diana and Alexander back to jail for another 13 days for more public order offences.\n\nCivil society in Russia is under intense pressure. Yet supporters of Diana Loginova and Stoptime are trying to make their voices heard.\n\n\"I was on the street when Diana was singing and people were singing along so beautifully,\" says Alla outside the courthouse. \"For me it was important to be here to support Diana and show her some people do care. This should not be happening.\"\n\nTo another of Diana's supporters I suggest that, in Russia now, displaying solidarity for anyone accused of discrediting the Russian army requires a degree of courage.\n\n\"It's people like Diana who are the brave ones,\" says Sasha. \"We're cowards. Some people are heroes. Others just follow behind.\"\n\n\"Some people [in Russia] are scared,\" continues Sasha. \"But others here do support the authorities and what's going on. Unfortunately, I know people like this. It came as a blow when I discovered that people I've been friends with for 40 years support what's happening. For years they've been watching Russian TV. I haven't.\"\n\nIn the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Mikhailov expressed his solidarity through music. The street musician performed songs in support of Diana Loginova. He was detained and jailed for 14 days for \"petty hooliganism\".\n\nDespite the crackdown, young street musicians in St Petersburg continue to perform music by artists labelled foreign agents by Russian authorities.\n\nIt's a chilly autumn evening. But passers-by have stopped to listen to a teenage band outside a St Petersburg Metro station. Among the songs they're performing are compositions by \"foreign agents\" Noize MC and Morgenshtern.\n\nSuddenly the police turn up. The concert is over.\n\nI look on as three band members are taken away in a police car.\n\nI go to meet someone else in St Petersburg accused of \"discreditation\".\n\nLudmila Vasilyeva, 84, was born two months before Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nShe survived the Nazi siege of Leningrad (then the name for St Petersburg) and has carried with her all her life how devastating war can be.\n\nSo, when Vladimir Putin ordered a mass invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ludmila was deeply shocked.\n\nEarlier this year, on the third anniversary of Russia's \"special military operation\", Ludmila went on to the street to express her anti-war stance.\n\n\"I wrote on my placard: 'People! Let's stop the war. We bear responsibility for peace on Planet Earth!'\"\n\nFollowing her personal protest Ludmila received a letter from the police instructing her to report to the police station.\n\n\"They told me that I had discredited our soldiers.

Multibillion-Dollar Rise\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T00:19:22-04:00\n\nSam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, says that technological revolutions are driven by more than just technology. They are also driven, he argues, by new ways of paying for them.\n\n“There is always a lot of focus on technological innovation. What really drives a lot of progress is when people also figure out how to innovate on the financial model,” he recently said at the site of a data center that OpenAI is building in Abilene, Texas.\n\nOver the last several years, Mr. Altman’s company has found unusual and creative ways of paying for the computing power needed to fuel its ambitions.\n\nMany of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services.\n\nIndustry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology.\n\nHere are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\nFrom 2019 through 2023, Microsoft was OpenAI’s primary investor. The tech giant pumped more than $13 billion into the start-up. Then OpenAI funneled most of those billions back into Microsoft, buying cloud computing power needed to fuel the development of new A.I. technologies.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)\n\nBy the summer of last year, OpenAI could not get all the computing power it wanted from Microsoft. So it started signing cloud computing contracts with other companies, including Oracle and little-known start-ups with names like CoreWeave.\n\nAcross three different deals signed this year, OpenAI agreed to pay CoreWeave, a company that builds A.I. data centers, more than $22 billion for computing power. As part of these agreements, OpenAI received $350 million in CoreWeave stock, which could ultimately help pay for this computing power.\n\nOpenAI also struggled to get the additional investment dollars it wanted from Microsoft. So, it turned to other investors. Earlier this year, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led a $40 billion investment in OpenAI.\n\nAt the same time, OpenAI has been working with various companies to build its own computing data centers, rather than rely on cloud computing deals. This also includes SoftBank, which is known for highly speculative technological bets that don’t always pay off. The company is raising $100 billion to help OpenAI build data centers in Texas and Ohio.\n\nSimilarly, Oracle, a software and cloud computing giant, has agreed to spend $300 billion building new data centers for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI will then pay Oracle roughly the same amount to use these computing facilities over the next several years.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates was part of an OpenAI’s fund-raising round in October 2024. Now, G42, a firm with close ties to the Emirati government, is building a roughly $20 billion data center complex for OpenAI in the Emirates.\n\nLast month, Nvidia announced that it intended to invest $100 billion in OpenAI over the next several years. This could help OpenAI pay for its new data centers. As OpenAI buys or leases specialized chips from Nvidia, Nvidia will pump billions back into OpenAI.\n\nTwo weeks later, OpenAI signed an agreement with AMD that allows OpenAI to buy up to 160 million shares in the chipmaker at a penny per share. That translates to roughly a 10 percent stake in the company. This stock could supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build new data centers.\n\nOpenAI pulls in billions of dollars in revenue each year from customers who pay for ChatGPT, computer programming tools and other technologies. But it still loses more money than it makes, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.\n\nIf the company can use its new data centers to significantly improve A.I. technologies and expand its revenue over the next several years, it can become a viable business, as Mr. Altman believes it will. If technology progress stalls, OpenAI – and its many partners – could lose enormous amounts of money. Smaller companies like CoreWeave, which are taking on enormous amounts of debt to build new data centers, could go bankrupt.\n\nIn some cases, companies are hedging their bets. Nvidia and AMD, for instance, have the option of reducing the cash and stock they send to OpenAI if the A.I. market does not expand as quickly as expected. But others would be left with enormous debt, which could send ripples across the larger economy.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv862r7l2ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"11:24:46.428+00:00","title":"Nvidia expands global AI rollout with bumper South Korea deals","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nvidia has announced a major global expansion of its AI chip deployment, supplying over 260,000 of its most advanced Blackwell chips to South Korea’s government and key companies including Samsung, LG, and Hyundai.

companies will all deploy the AI chips in factories to make everything from semiconductors and robots to autonomous vehicles and meant that South Korea can \"now produce intelligence as a new export,\" chief executive Jensen Huang said.\n\nMr Huang did not disclose the value of the South Korean deals.\n\nIt caps off a busy week for Nvidia, which on Wednesday became the first company to be valued at $5 trillion and on Thursday saw signs of a thaw in US-China trade relations that may mean it can export more of its chips to China .\n\nSpeaking at a CEO summit on the sidelines of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) in Gyeongju, South Korea, Mr Huang added that with the chips, companies would be able to create \"digital twins\" with other factories around the world.\n\nThese deals form part of Nvidia's latest effort to expand AI infrastructure globally, to further integrate AI into products and services.\n\nNvidia has been striking international partnerships which helped it become the  first company ever to be valued at $5tn  (£3.8tn) on Wednesday.\n\nThe South Korea deals come as Nvidia grapples with the fallout of the China-US trade war.\n\nChina made up more than a tenth of Nvidia's revenue last year, but the extent of China's access to Nvidia's chips has been a point of friction with Washington.\n\n\"We used to have 95% share of the AI business in China. Now we're at 0% share. And I'm disappointed by that,\" Huang said in Gyeongju on Friday.\n\nTrump said after his meeting with Xi  on Thursday that Beijing will hold talks with Nvidia to discuss sales of its chips in China.\n\nTrump said the talks remained between China and the US company, but that the US government will play the role of a \"referee\" of sorts.\n\nOn Friday, Huang said he would like to sell Nvidia's state-of-the-art Blackwell chips to China, although the decision needed to be made by the US President.\n\nThe US imposes export controls on sales to China of Nvidia's most-advanced AI chips.\n\nThe tech boss had no news on China sales, or the talks between the two leaders but that he hopes they'll find a way to have new policies that allow chips back into China.\n\n\"It's in the best interest of America to have the China market and it's in China's interest to have an American company bring technology to the country,\" Huang said.\n\n\"We'd like to see American technology be the global standard.\"\n\nSouth Korea - which is already home to major semiconductor companies and vehicle manufacturers - wants to become a regional AI hub.\n\nThe country is the ideal place to expand AI infrastructure, according to the Nvidia CEO, because of its access to energy and land, and its ability to construct factories.\n\nPresident Lee Jae Myung said he would prioritise AI investment after coming into office in the face of US tariffs.\n\nWith the Nvidia deal, the South Korean government plans to build computing infrastructure that it will control, a term known as \"sovereign AI\".\n\nMore than 50,000 Nvidia chips will power data centres at the National AI Computing Center and facilities owned by South Korean companies like Kakao and Naver.\n\nThe chip giant is dependent on the tightly-knit supply chains that run through the Asia Pacific region.\n\nNvidia is primarily a chip designer, and so outsources most of its physical production to manufacturers like Samsung, SK Hynix and TSMC.\n\nTSMC has been a critical partner for Nvidia, making the company's most advanced AI chips, including its flagship Blackwell series.\n\nSamsung makes parts for Nvidia's H20 chips, a scaled-down processor made for the Chinese market under US export rules.\n\nNational security experts and some politicians have long voiced concerns about the US selling AI chips to China, saying that Beijing could use them to gain an advantage in AI, as well as in military applications.\n\nAnalysts say that US efforts to block China's access to advanced computer chips have fostered innovation within China.\n\nBoth Huawei and Alibaba have unveiled their own chips that they say can rival Nvidia's products for the Chinese market.\n\nBeijing has also reportedly prohibited local firms from buying from Nvidia, urging them to buy from Chinese chipmakers to give its domestic tech industry a boost.\n\n\"We respect deeply the capabilities of China,\" Nvidia's Jensen Huang said on Friday.\n\nNvidia's share price was this week further boosted by a wave of new deals, including partnerships with the US Department of Energy, Nokia, Uber, and Stellantis - moves aimed at reassuring investors that AI investments will deliver returns.\n\nHopes of a revival in China sales, following trade talks between Presidents Trump and Xi, also lifted its share price.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/30/books/stephen-king-books-quiz.html","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Joe Hill Reflects on the Legacy of Stephen King’s 'Salem’s Lot' on the 50th Anniversary","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article celebrates the 50th anniversary of Stephen King's 'Salem’s Lot,' highlighting its lasting impact on horror fiction.

race?\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced the US will start testing nuclear weapons in what could be a radical shift in his nation's policy.\n\n\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, as he was about to meet the Chinese president  on Thursday.\n\n\"That process will begin immediately.\"\n\nThe world's nuclear-armed states - those acknowledged as belonging to the so-called nuclear club and those whose status is more ambiguous - regularly test their nuclear weapons' delivery systems, such as a missile that would carry a nuclear warhead.\n\nOnly North Korea has actually tested a nuclear weapon since the 1990s - and it has not done so since 2017.\n\nThe White House has not issued any clarifications to the commander-in-chief's announcement. So it remains unclear whether Trump means testing nuclear delivery systems or the destructive weapons themselves. In comments after his post, he said nuclear test sites would be determined later.\n\nMany of the six policy experts who spoke to the BBC said that testing nuclear weapons could raise the stakes in an already dangerous moment where all signs showed the world was heading in the direction of a nuclear arms race - even though it has not yet begun.\n\nOne of the six did not agree that Trump's comments would have a major impact - and another did not think the US was provoking a race - but all said the world faced a rising nuclear threat.\n\n\"The concern here is that, because nuclear armed states have not conducted these nuclear tests in decades - setting North Korea aside - this could create a domino effect,\" said Jamie Kwong, fellow in the nuclear policy programme at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"We're at a very concerning moment where the US, Russia and China are potentially entering this moment that could very well become an arms race.\"\n\nDarya Dolzikova, Senior Research Fellow for Proliferation and Nuclear Policy at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) - a London-based defence and security think tank - said she did not believe Trump's comments would change the situation massively.\n\nBut, she added, \"there are other dynamics globally that have raised the risks of nuclear exchange and further proliferation of nuclear weapons to levels higher than they have been in decades\".\n\nTrump's message,  she said, \"is a drop in a much larger bucket, and there are some legitimate concerns of that bucket overfilling\".\n\nThe experts pointed to escalating conflicts where one or more of the warring parties is a nuclear power - the war in Ukraine, for instance, in  which Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened at times  that he could use nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd then there were flare-ups - if not full-fledged conflicts - such as the one between Pakistan and India this year, or Israel - which has a policy of neither confirming nor denying it has nuclear weapons - attacking Iran - a country the West accuses of trying to build nuclear weapons (a charge Tehran denies).\n\nTensions on the Korean peninsula and China's ambitions in Taiwan add to the overall picture.\n\nThe last existing nuclear treaty between the US and Russia that limits their amounts of deployed nuclear arsenals - warheads ready to go - is set to expire in February next year.\n\nIn his announcement, Trump said the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country - a statement that does not match figures updated regularly by another think tank that specialises in the field, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).\n\nAccording to Sipri, Russia has 5,459 nuclear warheads followed by the US with 5,177, and China coming a distant third with 600.\n\nOther think tanks reported similar numbers.\n\nRussia announced recently it had tested new nuclear weapons delivery systems - including a missile the Kremlin said could penetrate US defences and another that could go underwater to strike the US coast.\n\nThe latter claim may have led to Trump's announcement, some of the experts suspected, even though Russia said its tests \"were not nuclear\".\n\nMeanwhile, the US has been watching China closely - with increasing concern that it will reach near-peer status, too, and posing a \"two-peer nuclear risk\", experts said.\n\nSo a resumption of US nuclear testing could prompt China and Russia to do the same.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman said that \"if someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly\".\n\nIn its response, China said it hoped the US would fulfil its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty - which both countries have signed but not ratified - and honour its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\n\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said a US resumption of nuclear weapons testing would be \"a mistake of historic international security proportions\".\n\nHe said the risk of nuclear conflict \"has been steadily rising\" over several years and, unless the US and Russia \"negotiate some form of new constraints on their arsenals, we're likely going to see an unconstained, dangerous, three-way arms race between the US, Russia and then China in the coming years\".\n\nHans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said the average person should be \"very concerned\" because there has been an increase over the past five years in nuclear warheads for the first time since the Cold War.\n\nThe last US nuclear weapons test - underground in Nevada - was in 1992.\n\nKimball said it would take at least 36 months to get the Nevada site ready for use again.\n\nThe US currently uses computer simulations and other non-explosive means to test its nuclear weapons, and therefore does not have a practical justification to detonate them, multiple experts said.\n\nKwong said there were inherent risks even with underground testing, because you must ensure there is not a radioactive leak above ground and it does not affect groundwater.\n\nWhile blaming Russia and China for ratcheting up the rhetoric, Robert Peters, senior research fellow of strategic deterrence at the conservative Heritage Foundation,  said that, while there may not be a scientific or technical reason for testing a warhead, \"the primary reason is to send a political message for your opponents\".\n\n\"It may be necessary for some president, whether it's Donald Trump or whomever, to test nuclear weapons as a demonstration of credibility\", he said, arguing it was \"not an unreasonable position to hold\" to be prepared to test.\n\nWhile many others the BBC spoke to disagreed, all offered a fairly dire assessment of the current situation.\n\n\"My sense is that, if the new nuclear arms race hasn't already begun, then we're currently heading towards the starting line,\" said Rhys Crilley, who writes on the subject at the University of Glasgow.\n\n\"I worry every day about the risks of a nuclear arms race and the increasing risk of nuclear war.\"\n\nThe US tested the first atomic bomb in July 1945 in the desert at Alamogordo, New Mexico.\n\nIt later became the only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in warfare after dropping two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of the same year during World War Two."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/science/us-nuclear-weapons-atomic-bombs.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"18:55:53-04:00","title":"Testing America’s Nuclear Bombs: What to Know","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump’s threat to restart nuclear explosive testing has reignited global concerns over nuclear proliferation and security.

Here’s what you need to know about American atomic bombs and the issues involved in whether or not to test them explosively.\n\nThe American arsenal includes roughly 3,700 warheads, with about 1,700 of them currently deployed, according to the Federation of American Scientists. The group, which has long scrutinized the highly classified topic, recently updated its estimates. Nuclear weapons can be carried on warplanes like the B-2 or B-52, launched from missiles in silos on U.S. territory, or heaved from rockets on submarines.\n\nThe United States does not have the most nuclear bombs in the world, as Mr. Trump incorrectly stated on Wednesday night. That distinction belongs to the Russian Federation.\n\nWashington is deep into a modernization program that seeks to replace every warhead with an updated version and to upgrade their carriers. The overall cost of the sprawling program over three decades is estimated at $1.7 trillion.\n\nThe same logic that applies to cars — lots of maintenance and testing, even for old models — suggests that the world’s nuclear powers have much confidence that their weapons will work, if needed.

But he had little time for them.\n\nStanding up, Abu Lulu ignored the man’s imprecations, casually shot him dead, and kept walking.\n\nThe execution, depicted in a video circulating online and verified by The New York Times, was one of numerous scenes of violence to emerge from the besieged Sudanese city of El Fasher since it was captured by paramilitaries last weekend.\n\nVideos and witness accounts show trenches filled with bodies, and fighters with the paramilitary force — the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F. — hunting down civilians as they flee.\n\nThe images of these and other atrocities have set off global outrage and stoked fears that the region of Darfur is plunging, once again, into a cycle of genocidal violence of the kind that made the Sudanese region a focus of global politics two decades ago.\n\nAt the United Nations and in Western capitals, officials issued statements on Thursday condemning the R.S.F., which has been battling Sudan’s military since the country plunged into a ruinous civil war over two years ago, and recently declared its own parallel government.\n\nSome called for punitive measures against its main foreign backer, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn Washington, congressional leaders renewed calls for a pause on arms sales to the Emirates until it stops arming the paramilitary. In London, the government faced questions about reports that British-made military equipment was being used by the R.S.F.\n\nAt an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, Tom Fletcher, the top U.N. humanitarian official, criticized member states for letting the crisis reach this point.\n\n“I have found the limits of my ability and the U.N.’s authority,” he said, calling on member states to “stop arming” the R.S.F.’s campaign, without naming the country responsible, widely assumed to be the Emirates. (The Emirates has denied backing either side in the conflict.)\n\nResponding to mounting outrage, the R.S.F. leader, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, made a speech shared on social media in which he conceded that his troops had committed some abuses, and pledged to hold responsible “any soldier or officer who committed a crime.”\n\nThe R.S.F. later said it had arrested Abu Lulu, the commander who had been filmed shooting the injured man.\n\nBut the paramilitary denied a shocking allegation from the World Health Organization, which said that 460 people had been killed at a hospital in El Fasher on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough the W.H.O. did not specify who had carried out the killings, they had occurred days after the R.S.F. seized El Fasher, breaking an 18-month siege that reduced starving residents to eating animal feed.\n\nIn a statement, the R.S.F. said it “categorically denied” those allegations, which it said were part of an “intensive propaganda campaign” with “no connection to reality.” On Thursday, the group released a video purporting to show the hospital, saying it countered claims of the attack. In the footage, not many patients can be seen in the disheveled building.\n\nMr. Fletcher’s remarks added to a pile of U.N. reports over the past 18 months about what is widely considered to be the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis — a civil war that has forced 12 million people from their homes, spread famine across the country and killed as many as 400,000 people, by some estimates.\n\nThat crisis has only intensified in El Fasher in recent days. Communications with the city were still largely cut off on Thursday. But a stream of videos, filmed by R.S.F. fighters themselves and verified by The Times and the Centre for Information Resilience, a nonprofit that documents potential war crimes, opened a window into the unfolding carnage.\n\nIn one video, fighters stepped over bodies scattered in a room in the city’s university. A survivor can be seen raising an arm, apparently calling for help, before a fighter shoots him dead.\n\nAn estimated 260,000 civilians were trapped in the city when R.S.F. troops captured the main army base on Sunday. Since then, thousands have fled. But aid groups said Thursday that only a trickle appeared to have made it to safety, and many of those who did reported passing down a road littered with the bodies of others who had died, or been killed, along the way.\n\nJust 5,000 people had reached Tawila, about 40 miles west of El Fasher, said Mathilde Vu of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which provides aid there. “People who arrived talk about dead bodies on the road and being stopped multiple times before reaching,” she said. “Men are being separated and detained.”\n\nThe journey, the group said in a statement on Thursday, is riddled with “extortion, arbitrary arrests, detention, looting, sexual violence and harassment.”\n\nThose who survive the trip are directed to overflowing camps that already hold hundreds of thousands of people, where disease outbreaks are common and there is an extreme shortage of food, water and shelters.\n\n“They are safe from shelling and attacks, but not from the suffering,” Ms. Vu said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/podcasts/the-headlines/government-shutdown-snap-benefits-air-traffic-control.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:00:05-04:00","title":"Food Stamp Funds Running Out, and Prince Andrew Loses Royal Title Amid Epstein Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers multiple breaking stories: a judge expressing skepticism over the Trump administration's decision to suspend food stamp benefits, highlighting concerns about food insecurity and government overreach; air traffic delays due to a shortage of air controllers, affecting travel in major hubs like Orlando; Trump urging Republicans to end the filibuster to avert a government shutdown; Virginia House taking steps toward redistricting; and a harrowing report from Sudan showing executions and mass casualties amid ongoing conflict.

Spending Is Accelerating (Again)\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T05:02:30-04:00\n\nFour of the tech industry’s wealthiest companies made it clear this week that their spending on artificial intelligence was not about to slow down.\n\nBut the outlays from Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon — which all raised their spending by billions of dollars, saying they needed to meet demand for A.I. — are increasingly feeding concerns that the tech industry is heading toward a dangerous bubble.\n\nArtificial intelligence remains an unproven and expensive technology that could take years to fully develop. How much companies will ultimately get back in return from A.I. products like chatbots is unclear. And smaller companies pursuing A.I. gold, financial analysts pointed out, are not nearly as wealthy.\n\nLast week, the Bank of England wrote that while the building of data centers, which provide computing power for A.I., had so far largely come from the cash produced by the biggest companies, it would increasingly involve more debt. If A.I. underwhelms — or the systems ultimately require far less computing — there could be growing risk.\n\n“This is a fast-evolving topic, and the future is highly uncertain,” the bank wrote.\n\nConcerns mushroomed this week after a series of earnings reports. On Wednesday, Google said it was increasing what it planned to spend on A.I. data center projects this year by $6 billion, after dropping nearly $64 billion on them over the past nine months.\n\nMicrosoft said it had spent $35 billion in its latest quarter, $5 billion more than what it had told investors to expect just a few months ago. And Meta raised its spending forecast to at least $70 billion by the end of the year, which would be nearly double what it spent last year.\n\nOn Thursday, Amazon also said it would be “very aggressive” in adding more data centers and would spend $125 billion this year on capital expenditures — and even more next year.\n\nGoogle, Microsoft and Amazon, which are the three largest providers of cloud computing in the United States, said they did not have enough computing power to meet customer demand. That’s despite shelling out a combined $112 billion in just the last three months on capital expenditures, which included construction of data centers. Over the last 12 months, those three and Meta totaled more than $360 billion in capital expenditures.\n\n“I thought we were going to catch up,” Amy Hood, Microsoft’s finance chief, said in a call with investors on Wednesday. “We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places.”\n\nThat same day, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, addressed concerns that the A.I. build-out was unsustainable. He said he did not believe the A.I. investments resembled the late-1990s dot-com boom. Back then, he said, there “was a clear bubble” when the businesses driving the market “were ideas rather than companies.”\n\nNow, Mr. Powell said, the largest companies behind the transformation are highly valued and largely funding their expansions from their own businesses, rather than loose lending.\n\n“I won’t go into particular names, but they have earnings, and it looks like they have business models and profit and that kind of thing, so it is really a different thing,” he said.\n\nMr. Powell did not comment on concerns that, unlike the biggest tech companies, smaller companies — often the customers and partners of those cloud computing giants — were also spending fast on A.I. projects without the safety net of enormously lucrative online advertising or software businesses.\n\nBut for the moneyed foursome that announced earnings this week, spending hundreds of billions of dollars on new data centers is not a worry — not when they churned out a combined $109 billion in operating profit, which excludes taxes and investments, in just the last quarter.\n\nMs. Hood said Microsoft had $400 billion in future sales under contract. “That’s for booked business,” she said. “Today.” The number did not include the $250 billion in computing power that OpenAI, the creator of the ChatGPT chatbot, committed to buy from Microsoft in an announcement this week.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, raised estimates for how much it planned to spend this year to at least $91 billion from $85 billion. The company is processing at least 20 times as much data through its various A.I. products as it did a year ago, the chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said.\n\nAmazon has doubled its cloud infrastructure capacity since 2022 and expects to double it again by 2027 to meet demand, its chief executive, Andy Jassy, told investors on Thursday. “As fast as we’re adding capacity right now,” he said, “we’re monetizing it.”\n\nMeta, which owns Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, also raised its spending estimate for the year, from at least $66 billion to at least $70 billion. But it made a different case for the expenditures.\n\nUnlike the large cloud providers, which have other customers that can use their data centers, Meta makes money from A.I. only when it uses the systems itself — in its core products to make digital ads more effective or its social networking products more engaging. It is also investing heavily to develop what it calls “superintelligence,” a theoretical technology where A.I. systems become smarter than humans.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, said he would rather build more and not less to be ready should superintelligence arrive quickly. “That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities,” he said.\n\nIf it takes longer, Mr. Zuckerberg said, Meta could use the infrastructure for its core business. “In the worst case,” he added, “we will just slow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build.”\n\nInvestors were less sure. Meta’s stock fell 11 percent on Thursday.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/china-trump-trade-security-chips-minerals.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:07:05-04:00","title":"With China Truce, U.S. National Security Controls Now Appear Up for Negotiation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a meeting in South Korea, U.S. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a truce that reversed key national security controls. The U.S. paused its expansion of the entity list—now covering majority-owned subsidiaries—after a rule introduced just weeks earlier, marking a significant shift in policy. China suspended its rare earth export restrictions, which had threatened global supply chains, and committed to cracking down on shipments of fentanyl precursors.

2025-10-30T17:07:05-04:00\n\nRather than advancing the U.S.-China relationship, the concessions that President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to in their meeting in South Korea on Wednesday appear to have largely rolled back the clock, returning to the terms of an earlier truce.\n\nMr. Trump agreed to reverse some of his tariffs and paused new fees on Chinese ships. China said it would suspend the rollout of rare earths restrictions introduced in October, and return to buying U.S. soybeans, in addition to a newer promise to crack down on shipments of chemicals used to make fentanyl.\n\nBut one of the reversals from the United States was more notable in the precedent it set. The Trump administration agreed to pause for one year a rule that expanded the number of Chinese companies restricted from access to advanced technology. The rule, issued just four weeks ago, extended the reach of the “entity list,” a kind of trade blacklist for foreign companies that pose a national security threat.\n\nFormer officials and analysts said Thursday that the move appeared to be one of the first concessions the United States had made on national security-related technology controls as part of a trade negotiation. They called it a potential breakthrough for the Chinese side, which has long pushed to negotiate with the United States over these types of measures, known as export controls.\n\nChristopher Padilla, who served as an export control official in the George W. Bush administration, said it was a significant shift for U.S. policy. Chinese officials have consistently asked in talks with many presidential administrations for export control measures to be rolled back, he said.\n\n“We all had the talking points,” Mr. Padilla said. “The first one is: ‘That’s a national security issue, and we’re not going to discuss it in a trade negotiation.’”\n\n“Export controls have now become a tradable item in the relationship,” Mr. Padilla added. “You’ve discarded decades of precedent.”\n\nBrett Fetterly, a principal at the Asia Group consultancy and the former national security adviser to Ben Sasse, the Republican former senator, agreed that Beijing had succeeded in this summit in its long-term goal of tying national security-focused export controls to broader trade negotiations.\n\n“Technology competition now defines the U.S.-China relationship, and on this point President Xi secured key U.S. concessions,” Mr. Fetterly said.\n\nMany business groups praised a return to greater stability in the U.S.-China relationship, which would help encourage trade and growth. But some analysts said the Trump administration may have had little choice but to roll back U.S. technology controls given China’s chokehold on critical minerals. Last December, Beijing introduced its first curbs on rare earth mineral exports, which it expanded in April and again in October in response to Mr. Trump’s trade war.\n\nChina dominates the mining and processing of rare earth minerals, and the magnets made from them that are common in batteries and motors. The Chinese curbs threatened the supply chains of global makers of cars, planes, munitions and semiconductors, and some companies were forced to halt production lines. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, had called the restrictions “a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world.”\n\nWith the renewed tensions with China this fall, industry executives say supplies of minerals and magnets have once again been running short.\n\nSome analysts say that China’s decision to limit exports of rare earths was a natural consequence of Washington’s technology controls, which used a similar global licensing system to limit China’s access to advanced chips. After so many years of being the target of restrictions, China sought to develop powerful controls of its own, they say.\n\nEmily Benson, the head of strategy at Minerva Technology Futures, a consultancy, said it was “sort of surprising” that the United States didn’t seem to anticipate that other countries would develop similar systems. She added, “It was just a matter of time.”\n\nOther have pointed fingers at the Trump administration’s behavior toward China. They say it was Mr. Trump’s aggressive threats of tariffs this spring that gave the Chinese the opportunity to try out their new approach, and the administration’s lack of a coherent strategy that gave the Chinese an opening to press for long-desired changes.\n\nSome have pointed to the waning influence of the National Security Council, which would typically coordinate strategy and policies on China. The N.S.C.’s influence has been greatly reduced in the Trump administration, after multiple officials were fired for suspicions of political disloyalty.\n\nVarious U.S. departments have sometimes appeared uncoordinated in their measures against China this year. And Chinese actions in response have seemed designed to telegraph the message that any measures taken by the United States to clamp down on China will now be aggressively matched by Beijing.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump introduced high tariffs in April and China put in place its rare earth curbs, the two countries reached a tentative truce in Geneva in May. But the day after that meeting, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued new guidance saying that the use of A.I. chips made by Chinese tech firm Huawei anywhere in the world was an export control violation. The announcement rankled China and led it to clamp down on rare earth exports again.\n\nThe countries held a series of meetings in other European capitals this summer to try to stabilize the relationship. But shortly after a phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi in September, the United States released its rule extending the impact of the entity list to majority-owned subsidiaries, and the Chinese once again responded angrily. In October, Beijing imposed expansive global controls on the trade in minerals and products made with them.\n\nChinese officials claimed that U.S. measures like the 50 percent entity list rule had violated a consensus struck in their bilateral meetings. Some U.S. officials privately grumbled about the Commerce Department’s timing and lack of coordination. But publicly, the United States insisted it had not made promises to withhold the imposition of export controls.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC last week, Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said that the Chinese were “trying out a lot of different narratives when the reality is, they just want to exert economic control on the world.”\n\n“They’re using anything else that has happened as a pretext,” he said. He added that the United States had promised to reduce its tariffs in return for China allowing the free flow of rare earths. “We kept that promise, and they have not kept theirs.”\n\nWith the president’s meeting with Mr. Xi, the U.S. side appears to have made more explicit concessions. A White House spokesman confirmed Thursday that the United States had agreed to pause the expansion of the entity list to cover majority-owned subsidiaries for one year.\n\nFor some, the move is welcome. Some tech executives and lobbyists had criticized the 50 percent rule, saying the due diligence it requires is onerous or impossible.\n\nSean Stein, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies doing business in China, said in a statement that the 50 percent rule’s reversal, and Beijing’s decision to pause its October rare earth controls, was “especially welcome news.” He also called the broader trade announcement “very encouraging.”\n\n“America’s reduction of the fentanyl-related tariffs and China’s commitment to take strong action to curb fentanyl precursors have paved the way for a reopening of China’s market for U.S. agriculture and energy and a wider, mutually beneficial trade agreement,” Mr. Stein said.\n\nThe 50 percent rule greatly expanded the reach of the entity list, freezing trade for some companies. According to Wirescreen, a data platform focused on China, the rule means that the entity list has grown from roughly 1,300 China-related parties to more than 20,000.\n\nPeople familiar with the situation said that the Commerce Department had described the change to others in the administration as correcting a loophole, and that officials in the Treasury Department and elsewhere had been surprised by the ultimate impact of the policy.\n\nSome U.S. officials and analysts argue the change has been needed to stop targets of the entity list from easily sidestepping the impact of U.S. sanctions by shifting business to their subsidiaries instead. Mr. Padilla said the standard was used for other government sanctions lists, like controls on military hardware administered by the State Department and financial sanctions administered by the Treasury Department.\n\n“If you’re going to sanction a company but you don’t at the same time sanction majority-owned subsidiaries, that doesn’t make a lot of sense,” he said. “From a practical point of view, this was a loophole that needed to be closed.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/orlando-air-traffic-control-airports-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"22:12:15-04:00","title":"Air Controller Shortage Causes Delays in Orlando and at Other Major Airports","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Air traffic controller shortages due to a government shutdown caused significant delays and operational disruptions at major U.S. airports, including Orlando International Airport, John F.

Kennedy International Airport in New York City entered a ground stop for certain flights because of insufficient air traffic staffing, capping a day of delays and suspended operations because of storms and an aircraft emergency. And controller shortages at Ronald Reagan National Airport, outside Washington, caused delays through the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe delays and their ripple effects along the East Coast followed a warning that Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had issued hours before of impending “disaster” if the government shutdown continued into November. The holiday travel season and the worsening winter weather, they argued, would increase the demands on air traffic controllers just as working without pay could become untenable.\n\n“A lot of our people can go through the miss of one paycheck,” Mr. Duffy told reporters outside the White House, following a meeting Mr. Vance hosted with industry executives. “None of them can get through two paychecks.”\n\nControllers, whose first payday without pay was Tuesday, were already overtaxed before the shutdown, as many worked overtime shifts to compensate for the around 3,000 vacant jobs in a 14,000-position work force. That preexisting staffing crunch meant that many air traffic facilities did not have enough staffing to accommodate surprise absences, whether or not they were caused by the shutdown.\n\nMr. Duffy has argued that the air travel delays are evidence that it is still safe to fly, explaining that it shows the F.A.A. is responding to so-called “staffing triggers” by managing air traffic to ensure no facility takes on a greater workload than its controllers can handle.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/trump-nuclear-testing-cold-war.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:12:41-04:00","title":"Trump’s Call to Resume Nuclear Testing After Decades Revives a Cold War Debate","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced in 2025 that he had ordered the U.S. military to resume nuclear explosive testing, a move that sparked global alarm and reignited Cold War-era fears of nuclear arms escalation.

That age supposedly ended with the arrival of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that nations agreed to in the mid-1990s. But not enough of the signatories ratified it for the treaty to formally come into force. Its objective was to starve the arms race by cutting off new tests and the cycle of retaliation they engendered.\n\nMr. Trump has now revived the debate inside the national security community over whether to break the tradition of observing that treaty, which some of his former aides have argued impedes the country’s ability to demonstrate “peace through strength.” On Air Force One, returning from Korea, the president told reporters he had made the call because of all the other countries conducting nuclear tests.\n\n“We’ve halted it years — many years — ago,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the fact that the last U.S. explosive test of a nuclear weapon was in 1992, during the George H.W. Bush administration. “But with others doing testing, I think it is appropriate that we do also.”\n\nExcept, of course, they aren’t. The only nation that has been regularly testing in the past quarter century is North Korea, and its last explosive test was in September 2017.\n\nMoscow has not conducted a test in 35 years, in the last days of the Soviet Union. Mr. Trump, however, may have been confusing nuclear weapons tests with Russia’s recent declaration that it had tested two exotic delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons: a nuclear-powered cruise missile and an undersea torpedo, called Poseidon, that could cross the Pacific and strike the West Coast of the United States. Both are designed to evade American missile defenses, which look for the warheads of intercontinental ballistic missiles as they speed through space.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters that he was not including China on that list of testing nations; its last explosive test was 29 years ago, though there is some evidence the country has made preparations at Lop Nur, where Mao first demonstrated China’s nuclear capabilities in the 1960s, in case it decides to resume.\n\nMr. Trump’s own senior official in charge of nuclear testing — Brandon Williams, a former one-term member of Congress from upstate New York — was asked point-blank during his confirmation hearing in April whether the United States needed to go back to explosive testing.\n\n“I would not advise testing, and I think we should rely on the scientific information,” Mr. Williams said, referring to such things as data gathered from supercomputer modeling. But he quickly noted the decision would be made “above my pay grade.”\n\nApparently, that is exactly what happened. In the hour before Mr. Trump met Xi Jinping, China’s leader, in South Korea on Thursday, he sent out a social media post saying he had ordered the “Department of War,” as he calls the Defense Department, to resume tests “immediately.” His qualifier that the tests would occur “on an equal basis” with U.S. rivals left many national security officials scratching their heads. (It was also puzzling because the Energy Department, not the Pentagon, is responsible for testing.)\n\nMr. Trump provided no rationale for resuming the testing, other than his incorrect statement that others were doing the same. He boasted that “the United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” which is incorrect — Russia has more. (Many of the weapons in Russia’s arsenal are small battlefield weapons of the kind American officials worried in October 2022 would be used against Ukraine.)\n\nHe said China was a “distant third” in its capabilities. That is true, but they are also growing fast. The Pentagon estimated during the Biden administration that China would have 1,000 deployed weapons by 2030 and would hit rough parity with the United States and Russia in 2035.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance said that testing the nuclear arsenal was important to make sure it “actually functions properly.”\n\n“To be clear,” he said, “we know that it does work properly, but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.” He made no reference to testing “on an equal basis” with other nations.\n\nMany experts believe that if the United States resumes testing, it would essentially give permission to other nations to do the same — roughly 100 days before the last arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, limiting the size of their arsenals, is set to expire.\n\nNuclear experts say that both Russia and China are prepared to conduct nuclear detonations at their underground test sites fairly rapidly. That is in contrast to the United States, which is seen as having made few serious preparations. Its test site is a desolate expanse of the Nevada desert bigger than the state of Rhode Island.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, he revived the possibility of new American testing. In addition to discussing a restart of underground detonations, officials called for major reductions in the preparation time for a U.S. nuclear test resumption. The federal agency in charge of the nation’s nuclear test site ordered the required time for preparations to drop from years to as few as six months.\n\nNuclear experts saw the goal as unrealistic because testing equipment at the sprawling Nevada site had fallen into disrepair, or vanished.\n\nEven so, Project 2025, the 2023 right-wing blueprint for Mr. Trump’s presidency, echoed the push for a quickening. It called on Washington to forego the lengthy period of preparation altogether and “move to immediate test readiness” in order to give the president “maximum flexibility in responding to adversary actions.”\n\nThe drumbeat continued in 2024 when Robert C. O’Brien, a former national security adviser to Mr. Trump, said in Foreign Affairs that Washington “must test new nuclear weapons for reliability and safety in the real world.” But his core argument seemed less about a scientific need for explosive testing than about a political one — to demonstrate to rising and aggressive powers that the United States, which opened the nuclear age when it dropped two atomic weapons on Japan, remained prepared to use the ultimate weapon.\n\nCritics say a testing restart would incite a global arms race. They note that directors of the national labs in charge of the nation’s atomic arsenal have repeatedly testified to Congress that the United States did not need to return to nuclear detonations.\n\nIn lieu of testing, the United States now relies on top experts and machines at the nation’s weapons labs to verify the lethality of the country’s arsenal. Today the machines include room-size supercomputers, the world’s most powerful X-ray machine and a system of lasers the size of a sports stadium. No other country has such an extensive array of nonnuclear testing tools.\n\nIn contrast to laboratory studies, nuclear testing underground in explosive detonations lets scientists uncover major flaws in prototype arms and fine-tune new weapon designs. During the Cold War, China conducted 45 test explosions at Lop Nur, its underground test site in the Western desert. In comparison, France set off 210, Russia 715 and the United States 1,030.\n\nSuch tests slowly concluded at the end of the Cold War. In 1996, the stoppage was formalized in the global test ban. The world’s atomic powers signed it as a way to curb a costly nuclear arms race that was spinning out of control. But it has been an essentially voluntary agreement, since the U.S. Senate never ratified it, and other countries held back formal approval as well.\n\nSiegfried S. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico, where the first atomic bomb was created, has long argued that the test ban favors Washington because it bars pact-abiding rivals from catching up on the huge edge the United States possesses in advanced nuclear arms.\n\n“Yes, we can learn things by nuclear testing,” Dr. Hecker said in an interview. “But when you look at the big picture, we have much more to lose by going back to testing than we have to gain.”\n\nThe test disparities give Washington a military edge because they keep other powers from making their arsenals more diverse and deadly.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/louisiana-snap-benefit-cuts.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"17:49:15-04:00","title":"The Threat of Lost Food Benefits Is Rattling the Vulnerable in Louisiana","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The federal government shutdown in October 2025 caused a one-month suspension of SNAP benefits, threatening food security for millions of Americans, including in Louisiana.

Louisiana\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T17:49:15-04:00\n\nEverything changed for Lisa Oglesbee in January, after a spinal condition left her husband in a wheelchair. Without his physical strength, she could not manage the job they had shared, cleaning commercial pizza ovens. And she could not look for another one yet, not when he needed her help to move around the house.\n\nWhen the government shut down on Oct. 1, she started to worry that his application for disability benefits would take even longer than they had been warned. Then, she began to hear that their federal food benefits — around $350 a month, she said — would not come in November.\n\n“I think they don’t care — it’s not them, it’s not their family,” Ms. Oglesbee, 42, said of lawmakers in Washington, holding back tears as she waited in line this week at a food pantry in Winnsboro, a small town in northeast Louisiana. “I hope I’m wrong about that.”\n\nWith nearly unanimous support from the Legislature, Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, said on Wednesday that the state would use about $147 million in emergency funds to keep food assistance flowing temporarily for  older residents, those who are disabled and households with children, starting Saturday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether or when the state’s intervention might be available to help other recipients. Mr. Landry said that thousands of “able-bodied” adults without young children would most likely need to turn to charity or, if unemployed, find jobs.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it would not disburse benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in November because of the shutdown, reversing its own policy that had allowed some funding to be reprogrammed during emergencies.\n\n“Without that, I don’t know how we would eat,” Ms. Oglesbee said of SNAP benefits. She added, “I didn’t realize how hard it was to get help, and I guess apparently, to keep help.”\n\nThe threat of food assistance disappearing for 42 million Americans, even for a month, has exposed how threadbare the nation’s social safety net has become at a time of persistent inflation and deep federal funding cuts. Filling the void in the coming weeks will strain many food banks and other organizations that were already stretched thin.\n\nLouisiana has one of the nation’s highest proportions of residents receiving SNAP, about one in five.\n\nThe crisis could be particularly acute in northeastern Louisiana. Nonprofit and social services groups say that poverty and hunger rates there are often higher than those in the rest of the state. Calls to 211, which connects people with social services, spiked by 40 percent this week in connection with the shutdown, according to the United Way of Northeast Louisiana.\n\n“You have a perfect storm happening even in the absence of this shutdown,” said Jan Moller, the executive director of Invest in Louisiana, a  policy research group. “When you add the uncertainty now created by the shutdown, you have a recipe for a real disaster.”\n\nAbout a dozen parishes, or counties, make up northeastern Louisiana, bounded by the Delta regions of Arkansas and Mississippi. Small, mostly rural communities are spread out over miles of farmland. Glimpses of rusting farm equipment, boarded-up windows and for-sale signs hint at how high prices and economic disinvestment have left many struggling to afford basic necessities.\n\nAshley Armstrong, a farmer in Bastrop, La., has been buffeted in recent months by rising equipment costs and canceled contracts stemming from federal cuts. But she has continued to offer a sizable discount to SNAP recipients who buy her produce, and to donate leftover produce to her church.\n\nOf federal lawmakers, she said, “I feel like they’re not really taking into consideration the everyday American and what these policy changes entail for their lives.”\n\nAt the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana, leaders have begun to stagger distribution in anticipation of more need, and are competing to buy food to supplement donations. One pantry that works with the food bank took in nearly two dozen new applications for help in one morning this week.\n\n“We cannot fill the full gap and we know that,” said Jean Toth, the food bank’s executive director. Tears welling in her eyes, she added, “It’s emotional.”\n\nInflated prices mean that for some families, the monthly SNAP allocation — about $356 per household, on average — is barely enough to cover staples like bread, milk and canned goods. When word of the looming lapse began to spread last week via text messages and social media, many families had already used up their October benefits.\n\n“I run short at the end of the month,” said Jennifer Winn, 38, who estimated she gets around $1,100 in monthly SNAP benefits for herself and five children in Monroe and had gone without meals to ensure the children could eat.\n\nIn the coming weeks, she predicted, “It’s going be more chaotic because people are tired, they’re stressed and they’re crying out for help. And they don’t know where to get it from.”\n\nEven if families get their November benefits through state funding, it is unclear what would happen should the shutdown continue into December. Complicating matters, the shutdown may require some staff members in local offices that administer SNAP benefits to be furloughed in the coming days.\n\nMr. Landry, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, blamed the shutdown on Democratic leaders in Congress, who have resisted agreeing to end it until Republicans agree to extend expiring health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans.\n\nBut in northeast Louisiana this week, most people interviewed pointed to what they saw as a broken system in Washington that felt deeply removed from their own day-to-day realities.\n\n“I feel that the government is making the poor people poorer, which I think is unfair,” said Demi Dyer, 33, who just moved with her family from Missouri to West Monroe, La.. She said she was worried that her SNAP application would take longer to be processed in her new state because of the shutdown. “We’re all human, we all struggle, we have all gone through stuff like this.”\n\nSome residents expressed frustration with President Trump’s unfulfilled promise to lower prices, as well as with assumptions that some of those dependent on food stamps had not been trying to find work.\n\n“I may have even been guilty in the past of the same, maybe, of looking at people — ‘Well, they need to get a job,’” Ms. Oglesbee said. “And some people do have jobs and still just don’t make enough money around.”\n\nSome residents of the region said they felt disillusioned to the point of not voting, because it didn’t seem to matter.\n\n“We need more people that care about folks,” said Dusty Ward, 39, who had been carefully rationing a month’s worth of food with his wife, Stephanie.\n\nAt Grace Place Ministries in Monroe, La., where dozens of people had lined up on a blustery cold morning for a hot meal, some grimly wondered whether the loss of a month’s benefits would drive the desperate to steal to stay fed. Prayer, for some, seemed like the only answer.\n\nOthers wondered if the lapse was a sign of the end times foretold in the Bible, or that all hope in government should be abandoned. Individuals and community groups that had stepped up before — after natural disasters, and during the pandemic — were preparing to do so again.\n\n“Maybe our country’s just hitting rock bottom in a way, and now it’s going to shift responsibility,” said Misty Loe, the executive director of Grace Place, comparing it to those who reach their lowest moment before improving. She was bustling around, slipping a box of cupcakes to toddlers who had come with their mother and overseeing new volunteers as they served hot dogs, fruit, salad and chips.\n\n“Ultimately, I do hope that the government goes back to stepping in where they need to — step in, step in and help feed,” Ms. Loe said. “Unless we really are going to reorganize how we do everything.”\n\nReferring to those who need the help, she added: “But I would hope that we would give them a lot more warning than this.”\n\nTony Romm and Eduardo Medina contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/nyregion/mamdani-boycott-israel.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"04:08:01-04:00","title":"If Elected, How Might Mamdani Use Mayoral Power in Ways That Affect Israel?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a prominent figure in New York politics and a leading candidate for mayor, has long advocated against Israeli settler activities in the Palestinian West Bank, notably through the 'Not On Our Dime' Act, which seeks to strip tax-exempt status from charities supporting such groups.

Area\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T18:18:43-04:00\n\nQuarters 8 at Fort McNair in Washington, situated along the Anacostia River, has traditionally been the home of the Army’s vice chief of staff. But at the beginning of President Trump’s second term, it was vacant.\n\nThe general promoted to the vice chief’s position had opted to remain on a different base nearby, across the Potomac. That provided an opening for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to claim it.\n\nAs Mr. Hegseth settled into the home, which an Army history notes is guarded by two Revolutionary War-era cannons, other Trump officials also took up residence at housing built and designed for senior admirals and generals in the Washington area.\n\nA handful of White House officials have lived in military housing in the past, but it appears to be unusual for several cabinet members and other officials to move into military quarters in such a short amount of time.\n\nThree former residents of Quarters 8 expressed frustration that a senior officer was not living at the home, which they said would cause a ripple effect and make it more difficult for admirals and generals posted in the area to find affordable housing.\n\n“It’s a great place,” said retired Army Gen. Dennis J. Reimer, who lived in Quarters 8 when he served as the Army’s vice chief of staff in the early 1990s. “It’s like one out of the movies — you have that spiral staircase and you’re right over a riverbank.”\n\nThe trend of Trump administration officials taking over military residences in the region was reported earlier by The Atlantic.\n\nSoon after he was sworn in as secretary of state, Marco Rubio moved in a couple doors down from his Pentagon counterpart. Mr. Rubio lives there mostly alone; his family has opted to stay in Florida, according to a State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, lives in “a government representation facility” owned by the Coast Guard and is “paying fair market rent,” according to Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman.\n\nDaniel P. Driscoll, the Army secretary, has also moved into military housing, as has the Navy secretary, John Phelan, whose home in Washington was damaged in a fire in May, according to a congressional staff member who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, only Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, were known to have lived for a time in military housing.\n\nThere is precedent for an elected official to take over military quarters. In 1974, Congress authorized the vice president to reside at the Naval Observatory, which for 40 years had been the official home of the chief of naval operations. (Since then, the Navy’s top admirals have typically lived in Tingey House, a historic property across town at the Washington Navy Yard.)\n\nAt McNair, the Army vice chief of staff’s residence at Quarters 8 sits in the middle of a row of 15 military homes that have long been assigned to the three-star generals on the Army’s senior staff at the Pentagon, as well as a number of generals commanding the post-Sept. 11 wars.\n\nAccording to a Defense Department official, Mr. Hegseth is paying $4,655.70 per month to live there this year.\n\nGeneral Reimer said that the residence had a brass plaque noting that the Army’s 1980s recruiting slogan — “Be All That You Can Be” — came from one of its previous occupants, Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman. Quarters 8 also had a small gravesite in the yard, he said, where General Thurman buried his dog, who died while he lived there.\n\n“I think the dog’s name was something like Fido,” General Reimer recalled. “The dog’s grave had a marker saying ‘Here lies Fido. He was all he could be.’”\n\nWhen Robert M. Gates was chosen to be President George W. Bush’s defense secretary, he did not own a home in the Washington area. He asked for government housing and moved into an old home near the State Department. Known as Navy Hill and Potomac Annex, the 12-acre site has three residences for admirals.\n\nCongress authorized Mr. Gates to live in the house while paying rent to the Pentagon.\n\nMr. Gates’s successor, Leon Panetta, was offered his predecessor’s home at Navy Hill.\n\n“I went there and checked it out,” Mr. Panetta said in an interview. “But found out that it would cost probably about $3,000 a month.”\n\nWithout his wife joining him, he added, “I certainly would not be entertaining there, so it just didn’t make a lot of sense for me to take the house.”\n\nMr. Panetta took an apartment near Capitol Hill in the same townhouse he had lived in as the director of the C.I.A.\n\nDefense Department officials installed the secure communications lines he needed to discuss sensitive and classified information away from his office.\n\nSecurity guards stood watch outside, even when he was not home.\n\nIf there were increased threats against the senior members of the Trump administration, Mr. Panetta added, the federal government could build new housing for them.\n\nIt is unclear why so many Trump administration officials have sought to live on military bases, but Mr. Panetta and his successor, Chuck Hagel, said that they faced the same kinds of security threats that any defense secretary routinely receives, and felt secure in their homes with Defense Department bodyguards posted outside.\n\nFor national security reasons, it makes sense for three- and four-star generals to live at Fort McNair, which is a short drive away from the Pentagon, Mr. Panetta said.\n\n“Any time there’s an emergency they’ve got to be able to respond quickly to whatever crisis is taking place, so that’s important,” he said. “I think that was part of the reason for having that housing close by.”\n\nMr. Mattis lived in Mr. Gates’s former home at Navy Hill during the two years he served as defense secretary under Mr. Trump. But other Pentagon chiefs, including Chuck Hagel, Mark T. Esper and Lloyd J. Austin III, stayed in the homes they owned in the Washington area, and had similar secure communication rooms installed.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Hagel recalled that it took about three days to set up when he was sworn in, and just a day to remove when he left office.\n\nGovernment employees patched the drywall, repainted and moved on.\n\nHelene Cooper, Eric Schmitt and Michael Crowley contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/world/asia/china-apec-trump-trade.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:18:54-04:00","title":"Xi Delivers Veiled Warning to Nations Not to Take the U.S.’s Side","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the APEC summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, China’s President Xi Jinping delivered a message emphasizing the importance of maintaining global supply chains tied to China, using diplomatic language to subtly counter Western efforts—particularly from the United States—to decouple economies.

It also mentioned Mr. Epstein’s wire transfers to Russian banks and sensitivities around “his relationships with two U.S. presidents.” Mr. Epstein at times was close with President Trump and former President Bill Clinton.\n\nNone of the men mentioned in the report have been charged with crimes in connection to Mr. Epstein.\n\nThe report was included in hundreds of pages of previously sealed court records that JPMorgan released on Thursday at the instruction of a federal judge, Jed S. Rakoff. He ordered the documents unsealed in response to requests from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSeveral other suspicious activity reports that JPMorgan filed in the years before Mr. Epstein’s 2019 arrest were also included in the documents released on Thursday. They notified federal regulators to some of Mr. Epstein’s voluminous cash withdrawals, which experts say are a potential hallmark of money laundering and human trafficking.\n\nYet JPMorgan continued to do business with Mr. Epstein for years. The bank lent him money, moved his funds overseas and enabled payments to some of his sex-trafficking victims, The Times reported in September. Bank employees repeatedly raised concerns about the risks of being associated with Mr. Epstein, but senior executives decided to keep his accounts open.\n\nThe 2019 suspicious activity report provided scant details about the transactions in question or why they were considered suspicious, aside from apparently being connected to Mr. Epstein.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Wexner’s trusts, it described $65 million of wire transfers from the mid-2000s that appeared to move between multiple banks. Mr. Epstein served as a trustee for some of Mr. Wexner’s trusts.\n\nFor nearly two decades, until around 2007, Mr. Epstein was a close financial adviser to Mr. Wexner, whose company controlled retailers like the Limited and Victoria’s Secret. Soon after Mr. Epstein’s death, Mr. Wexner accused him of having misappropriated “vast sums” of his money.\n\nThe suspicious activity report pointed to unidentified transactions with Mr. Black, his wife and a Black family partnership. The Times recently reported that Mr. Black had paid Mr. Epstein about $170 million and hundreds of thousands of dollars to at least three women who were associated with Mr. Epstein.\n\nMr. Epstein’s relationship with Mr. Dubin was multifaceted. Mr. Epstein helped broker the sale of Mr. Dubin’s hedge fund to JPMorgan, for which Mr. Epstein received a $15 million fee. Mr. Epstein previously dated Mr. Dubin’s wife, Eva Andersson-Dubin, and was the godfather to the Dubins’ children.\n\nThe suspicious activity report that JPMorgan disclosed on Thursday did not provide details about the transactions involving the Blacks, the Dubins or Mr. Dershowitz.\n\nDevon Spurgeon, a spokeswoman for the Dubins, said the transactions in question were “related to charitable giving, personal gifts or business matters” and unrelated to Mr. Epstein’s crimes.\n\nMr. Dershowitz, who was one of Mr. Epstein’s criminal defense lawyers, said, “The only funds I ever received from Jeffrey Epstein were payments for my legal services based on my hourly rates.”\n\nThe 2019 suspicious activity report also flagged a number of people who worked closely with Mr. Epstein over the years and several of his corporate entities.\n\nA JPMorgan spokeswoman, Patricia A. Wexler, said the documents showed that JPMorgan had repeatedly alerted regulators to red flags surrounding Mr. Epstein by filing suspicious activity reports.\n\n“It does not appear that anyone in the government or law enforcement acted on those SARs for years,” she said.\n\nIn preparing the 2019 suspicious activity report, the bank pulled together every transaction that Mr. Epstein had any involvement with or that had gone through one of his accounts, Ms. Wexler said.\n\nJPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, served Mr. Epstein for more than a decade, a period during which he is believed to have sexually abused some 200 young women and girls, some as young as 14.\n\nThe role of JPMorgan in financing Mr. Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation has drawn new scrutiny after an article in The Times detailed how the bank had repeatedly disregarded red flags about his activities, including frequent large cash withdrawals and other suspicious transactions.\n\nSome lawmakers in Congress have called for hearings into JPMorgan’s role, including demands that Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, answer written questions or testify before a Senate panel.\n\nThe financial records made public on Thursday were produced by JPMorgan during litigation in 2023 that was brought on behalf of victims of Mr. Epstein and by the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he maintained a private island residence that served as a base for most of his financial advisory businesses.\n\nIn 2023, JPMorgan agreed to pay $75 million to the Virgin Islands government to settle the litigation. The bank also paid $290 million to settle the victims’ lawsuit.\n\nJPMorgan has said it regretted its involvement with Mr. Epstein but was not aware of his sexual abuse.\n\nThe unsealed documents include emails in which Mr. Epstein helped to recruit the founders of Google to be JPMorgan clients in the early 2000s. The Times previously reported that one of the founders, Sergey Brin, ultimately put more than $4 billion into a JPMorgan account. The emails also show a JPMorgan executive discussing the potential use of complex trusts to reduce the taxes of Mr. Brin and his co-founder, Larry Page.\n\nA Google representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday night.\n\nThe documents released on Thursday shed little new light on what Mr. Dimon knew about his bank’s relationship with Mr. Epstein. Mr. Dimon has said he was not aware of the bank’s extensive work for him until 2019, though at least one top executive has said under oath that he discussed the Epstein relationship with Mr. Dimon.\n\nMr. Dimon clearly knew by the summer of 2019. On the Saturday in August that Mr. Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell. a JPMorgan employee emailed colleagues with a link to a Times article about his death. That afternoon, an employee forwarded the message to Mr. Dimon.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/nyregion/mamdanis-speech-about-being-muslim-resonates-beyond-new-york-city.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"03:00:12-04:00","title":"Mamdani’s Speech About Being Muslim Resonates Beyond New York City","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the final weeks of the New York mayoral campaign, Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic front-runner, delivered a powerful speech at the Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx in which he openly addressed Islamophobia, his own experiences of marginalization, and the fear of being silenced in politics.

City\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T03:00:12-04:00\n\nIt was a moment that some have compared to Barack Obama’s landmark 2008 speech about race, inequality and unity in American politics.\n\nIn the closing weeks of the mayoral campaign, Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic front-runner, veered off from the economic message he has clung to doggedly for more than a year.\n\n“I want to use this moment to speak to the Muslims of New York City,” he said.\n\nStanding outside the Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx, Mr. Mamdani spoke, sometimes tearfully, describing his experiences with his faith, identity and Islamophobia, and the tendency among Muslims, including himself, to feel they need to play down their identity to succeed.\n\n“No longer will I live in the shadows,” he said.\n\nFor the candidate, who would become the first Muslim mayor of New York, it was a topic he had rarely addressed since he entered the race last October.\n\nBut now, he said, he wanted to talk about what he described as anti-Muslim animus in the mayoral campaign, arguing that he had seen evidence of it in recent remarks by his two main opponents, Andrew M. Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, and by the current mayor, Eric Adams.\n\nIt is the one form of bigotry that remains largely accepted, he said.\n\n“One can incite violence against our mosques and know that condemnation will never come,” he said. “Elected officials in this city can sell T-shirts calling for my deportation without any fear of accountability.” In an era when Democrats and Republicans can agree on almost nothing, he said, one thing they share is a fear of Muslims.\n\nThe reaction from the political right was swift. The day after the speech, Vice President JD Vance taunted Mr. Mamdani on X, in a post that has received 22 million views. In The Wall Street Journal, Karl Rove, the longtime Republican strategist, wrote that the speech had revealed a “new, ugly side to his message that will likely cut his election margin.”\n\nBut for Muslims around the country, Mr. Mamdani’s speech has become both a conversation starter and a cathartic moment. With the election only days away, the brief, week-old address continues to resonate, not only in New York but well beyond.\n\n“It was really quite incredible,” said Saher Selod, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a nonprofit group that studies Muslims in America. “He’s coming out of the shadows, and he’s saying this to Muslims very publicly, that I see you, this is the experience that you’ve had, too. And so it is sending that message not just to Muslims, but to non-Muslims, which hopefully makes more visible what’s been so invisible for so long.”\n\nA video of the speech that Mr. Mamdani’s campaign posted on X continues to reach a wide audience, with views now hitting 25 million — about five times the number of Muslims in all of America.\n\n“It reminded me of Obama’s speech on race in 2008,” said Moustafa Bayoumi, an English professor at Brooklyn College and author of “How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America,” who has written extensively about Islamophobia.\n\n“He’s responding to a moment of prejudice in the campaign the way Obama did,” Mr. Bayoumi said. “Addressing it head on, instead of taking the high road of silence.”\n\nIn a heavily Muslim strip of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Zein Rimawi, who runs an adult day care center, said the speech felt like a turning point for Muslims in the city. For too long, he said, politicians have felt free to ignore or even utter anti-Muslim comments in ways that they would not with other groups.\n\n“I used to talk about before Sept. 11 and after Sept. 11,” he said, referring to the rise in anti-Muslim sentiment after the 2001 terror attacks. “Now there is ‘before Mamdani’ and ‘after Mamdani.’ People are not afraid to explain themselves and say: ‘Yes, I’m a Muslim, I’m an Arab, I’m a Palestinian. I am American. No difference, you are not better than me.’”\n\nOn the other side of the continent, Naima Ahmad, 41, a product designer who lives in San Francisco, said she was relieved Mr. Mamdani addressed a phenomenon well known within the Muslim community: Running for office anywhere in America often stirs an Islamophobic backlash. Until the speech, she said, Mr. Mamdani had tuned out “the background noise of threats and prejudice. It mattered that he brought this to light in these final days.”\n\nOthers were less struck by the speech. In Chicago, Zohreh Fanai, a 25-year-old graduate student, said her generation had not experienced the same Islamophobia as Mr. Mamdani’s, even in New York. And in Minneapolis, Kadir Abdulle, 59, a home care operator volunteering for a Muslim mayoral candidate, saw the attacks on Mr. Mamdani as par for the course for Muslim candidates. “It’s normal to me,” he said.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s candidacy has already had an effect as far away as the Deep South, said Emad Sabbah, a tech executive and board member of the Council for American-Islamic Relations in Atlanta.\n\nAcross Georgia, he noted, a record 12 Muslims are running for office this election — including Ruwa Romman, a Democratic state representative who is running for governor — and Mr. Mamdani’s political success has emboldened candidates in the deeply conservative state.\n\n“As a Georgian Muslim, Mamdani’s speech struck a deep, emotional chord,” Mr. Sabbah said. “It wasn’t just political — it felt personal. His courage in calling out Islamophobia head on, while standing firm in his principles, was both inspiring and validating.”\n\nThe speech had a particular resonance for Muslims of Mr. Mamdani’s generation, who grew up largely after the Sept. 11 attacks, said Hamza Khan, 36, an engineer in Oklahoma City.\n\nAmong his peers, Mr. Khan said, “it felt like everything he’s saying was what we all wanted to say our whole lives. We’ve been told for years to be proud of who we are, but we don’t have a lot of examples in the mainstream of people acknowledging their Muslim identity as a major part of who they are. And he called out both sides, both parties. Both can be Islamophobic.”\n\nFor Bilqees Akhtar, the speech struck a personal note. Ms. Akhtar, 56, a school administrator in Richmond Hill, Queens, began the practice of covering her head after the Sept. 11 attacks, and said she has faced abuse sometimes, even in her ethnically diverse borough. The other day her teenage daughter, who recently started covering, was on a bus in Flushing when another woman stared her down.\n\n“She had to move because she was scared the woman would spit on her,” Ms. Akhtar said.\n\nSo even after Mr. Mamdani’s speech, she said, “The fear is there. I’m glad he said something.”\n\nMs. Akhtar disagrees with many of Mr. Mamdani’s positions — “I believe in capitalism,” she said — but she voted for him, and voted early. Not because he is Muslim, she said. “Only because he stands for something.”\n\nReporting was contributed by Erin Marie Daly, Sean Keenan, Robert Chiarito and Jeff Ernst.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/us/politics/ohio-redistricting-deal.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"20:38:38-04:00","title":"Ohio Republicans Gain Ground in Push for More Seats in Congress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Ohio, Republicans are pushing to gain more congressional seats by redrawing district boundaries to create a map that gives them control of 12 of the state’s 15 congressional districts.

congressional map to boost the party’s chances of keeping control of the House of Representative in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nRepublicans, who currently hold 10 of Ohio’s 15 seats in Congress, appeared to have struck an 11th-hour deal with Democrats that would give the Republican Party much — but not all — of what it wanted: an electoral map that tilts red in 12 of the state’s 15 districts. The map is expected to be approved Friday morning by the Ohio Redistricting Commission, the last day it can approve a map before state law requires the issue to be kicked back to the Legislature.\n\nThe map was presented on Thursday afternoon at a hastily called commission meeting, during which members of the commission offered no response to more than a dozen speakers who excoriated both Republicans and Democrats  for backroom dealing that produced a map they considered rigged.\n\n“You are like foxes guarding the hen houses and Ohio voters continue to be the hens,” said Michael Ahern, who spoke to the commission wearing a baseball cap bearing the first three words of the Constitution, “We The People.” The meeting took place without Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, who holds one of the seven seats on the commission.\n\nThe map — which was not made public until after the meeting started — improves Republicans’ odds of picking up two more seats, though not the three they had set out to capture.\n\nFor the new map to pass, the two Democrats on the commission — Nickie Antonio, the Senate minority leader, and Dani Isaacsohn, the House minority leader — would have to vote in favor of it when the commission reconvenes on Friday.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And, according to a story published today, their relationship is straining.\n\nIn one camp, Justice Elena Kagan believes in building consensus and picking off conservative votes to avoid the most extreme rulings.

One side favors pragmatism — say, running pro-life Democrats to help the party retake the House. The other says anything short of confrontation will normalize unlawful or corrupt policies. It’s fascinating to know this tension exists even on the Supreme Court.\n\nJodi: Yes, and the setting intensifies it. This is a world of formality and decorum.

Can Trump Bring Them Back?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T05:00:48-04:00\n\nThe pushback began almost immediately. Buu Nygren, the leader of the Navajo Nation, posted a selfie on Facebook, beaming as he stood shoulder to shoulder with President Trump at the White House.\n\nThe U.S. president had just signed executive orders to promote coal production, and Mr. Nygren was thrilled: “The harmful policies of the past have unfairly targeted coal, but those tides are turning,” he wrote.\n\nThe angry Facebook comments rolled in: Mr. Nygren had betrayed his people and his support of coal would lead to the degradation of the land and water, they said.\n\nBut other voices surfaced, too. Stop complaining, they said. Coal meant jobs.\n\nFor decades, coal has been a divisive subject in the Navajo Nation, which spans portions of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. As an economic engine for the region, it provides well-paid jobs on the reservation, where nearly 40 percent of the residents live in poverty. But it has also used up water, polluted the air and raised health concerns.\n\nAs elsewhere, coal production and coal power generation has slowed over the years on the reservation, as companies pivoted to cheaper forms of energy, like natural gas, and Biden-era policies sought to elevate greener forms of energy, like wind and solar.\n\nWith Mr. Trump’s re-election, however, and his exhortations to “drill, baby, drill,” along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s calls to “mine, baby, mine,” coal supporters, including Mr. Nygren, see the potential to boost coal jobs — or at least slow their departure.\n\n“Without coal, a lot of Navajo families would not have had any source of income,” said Brenda Jesus, a delegate on the Navajo Nation Council who oversees a committee focused on the tribe’s resources and development.\n\nMs. Jesus voted for Mr. Trump. Now she hopes that the president can help save the Navajo Nation’s last remaining coal-fired plant, the Four Corners Power Plant.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump’s executive orders signed in April instructs federal agencies to repeal regulations that “discriminate” against coal production. With the explosion of artificial intelligence data centers, the order directed federal agencies to explore how coal generating plants might provide some of their insatiable demand for electricity.\n\nThe Four Corners plant is past its prime and was scheduled to close in 2031. But four months after Mr. Trump signed his coal orders, officials with Arizona Public Service, which owns most of the Four Corners plant, said the site would close “no later than 2038,” opening the possibility of extending its life.\n\nThat would mean keeping hundreds of jobs at the plant. It would also mean nearly a decade of continued emissions and a reliance on an industry in decline.\n\nRobyn Jackson, executive director of Diné C.A.R.E., a group that advocates environmental and social justice on the reservation, characterized the recent moves by Navajo leadership in collaboration with the White House as a deflating setback. She said tribal leaders needed to explore more economic and energy diversity, like wind and solar, on the reservation.\n\n“Coal really is not coming back,” Ms. Jackson said. “For far too long, the land has not been healthy, and it has affected our people.”\n\nBefore coal, there was uranium.\n\nThe toxic ore extracted by the U.S. government in the 1940s to build nuclear weapons left pockmarks along the high desert plateaus. Tribal members fell ill. Many died. Waste from the hundreds of abandoned uranium mines still contaminates the soil and water on and around the reservation.\n\nSo when the Four Corners plant opened in 1963, on Navajo Nation land, many in the tribe were suspicious and fearful. A decade later, a second coal-fired plant on the reservation, the Navajo Generating Station in northern Arizona, was completed. Additional plants and mines opened around the reservation, offering wages that far outpaced those from the region’s traditional work, such as farming and sheep herding.\n\nThe initial years of coal mining laid a critical economic framework for the tribe, said Andrew Curley, a professor at the University of Arizona who researches Native American advancement and is a member of the Navajo Nation.\n\n“A lot of people, young men, leaving high school and looking for jobs found them right there in the mines and coal plants,” Mr. Curley said. “So with coal, here was this new opportunity and new work — and the chance to stay on the reservation and not leave.”\n\nBut like nationwide, as newer plants using natural gas and alternative energy replace aging generating stations, two local coal-fired generating plants and their associated mines closed, in 2019 and 2022. More than 1,000 jobs were lost, along with at least an estimated $40 million in revenue to the Navajo Nation.\n\nThose closures hit hard. At one plant, the annual average pay was $86,000, based on a local study, well above most salaries on the reservation. The unemployment rate, according to the tribe, is 39 percent, and many residents live in trailers along winding dirt roads or in mobile homes without electricity or running water. The reservation of 143,000 people covers about 27,000 square miles, much of it uninhabited. Along the shoulders of two-lane highways slicing through the land, people often hitchhike in search of a ride to the nearest city.\n\nIn 2020, Arizona Public Service announced that it would close Four Corners in 2031. In a report released last year, the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, which owns mines and was established by the tribe, estimated that 500 Navajo members would lose their jobs if the Four Corners plant closed. Revenue from the plant and mine accounts for more than a third of the tribe’s budget, according to the Navajo Transitional Energy Company. The company owns a 7 percent stake in the plant. (Company representatives and Mr. Nygren declined interview requests.)\n\nOn the eve of Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January, Mr. Nygren 38, spoke to supporters at a reception in the Navajo Nation’s Washington office, which is a short walk from the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWearing his signature wide-brimmed black hat, he talked about the future of energy. “One of the priorities that I have under my administration,” he said, “is how does the Nation continue to be the forefront of energy development.”\n\nFor years, along the vast stretches of low-growing desert shrubs on the reservation, towering stacks from coal plants jutted up like skyscrapers interrupting the horizon. It was a sight that symbolized hard work for Joseph Lee.\n\nMr. Lee, a third-generation miner, worked at the mine for the San Juan Generating Station for more than two decades doing production work until it closed in 2022. He earned around $100,000 a year, a salary that helped him put three children through college.\n\nHe understands the health implications of the work, Mr. Lee said, and sees how it could be easy to pass judgment from afar about coal’s impact on climate change. But up close, what he sees are people. Other laid-off coal workers Mr. Lee knows have packed up and moved to Wyoming and Montana to find work. Many who stayed on the reservation, he said, remain jobless.\n\n“It provided a great living,” he said. “It’s rural and allows us to earn a good living close to home.”\n\nAt the union hall of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local No. 953 in Kirtland, N.M., on a recent afternoon, an event showed the hazards of making a living with coal. As a steady rain pelted down, a handful of former coal workers gathered inside to meet with health care workers from a local mobile medical clinic. They brought fliers that read, “BLACK LUNG SCREENINGS FOR ALL MINERS.”\n\nBlack lung cases, which are associated with coal mining, are underreported on the reservation, according to a 2023 study prepared for the U.S. Department of Labor, in part because of limited access to health care and a lack of trust in both researchers and the federal government.\n\nAt recent public meetings before council delegates on the Navajo Nation, residents spoke passionately about how coal production had destroyed the land and depleted water resources.\n\nMs. Jesus, the council delegate who supports coal jobs in the region, acknowledged that it was a complicated issue. She has witnessed the impact of depleted watersheds, she said, and coal workers struggling to get health care.\n\n“It’s a nuanced situation,” she said of coal work, on a recent morning outside the council chambers in the remote town of Window Rock, Ariz., the capital of the Navajo Nation. “There are definitely risks, but also opportunities for a living.”\n\nTo Joseph Franklin Hernandez, a New Mexico state representative who has lived on the Navajo Nation much of his life, the risks eclipse the benefits.\n\nHe worked at the San Juan Generating Station after high school. Every day, when he returned home from his shift, his flannel shirt would be caked in fly ash, a powdery residue that accumulates in coal plants. He had a cough that lingered for years.\n\n“There was no protection and no concerns — the company just had us work,” he said. Looking back on it years later, Mr. Hernandez worries about future health problems. His mother, who worked as a janitor at the plant for many years, had respiratory problems and died early in the pandemic from Covid-19.\n\n“I cannot help but think that working at the plant made her weaker,” he said.\n\nMr. Hernandez, who represents constituents in San Juan County, N.M., where the Four Corners plant is, has made environmental issues a top focus.\n\n“As a tribe, we need to be thinking about alternative and cleaner forms of energy,” he said. Mr. Trump and tribal leaders are misguided in continuing to focus on coal, he said. He wants to see investment in solar and expansion of broadband internet to open new opportunities for tribal members.\n\n“Enough is enough,” he said. “Coal has been declining.”\n\nMr. Hernandez often gathers to talk with constituents at his family friend’s hogan, a traditional, dome-shaped Navajo structure made of clay and wood logs whose doorway faces east to welcome the rising sun.\n\nOn a recent evening, the topic was coal. For an hour, members of the tribe shared stories about lost jobs and illnesses.\n\nLawrence Begay, a 72-year-old former miner, walked with a distinct limp and struggled to catch his breath as he described his work. For more than 20 years, he operated heavy machinery at a local mine.\n\n“Honest work,” he said, switching back and forth between English and Diné Bizaad.\n\nSince his retirement, he has farmed alfalfa and herded sheep on his land. Mr. Begay thinks it’s possible he has black lung, he said.\n\n“There could have been more warning about the harm,” he said, “but it was a job and anyone who could do it did the work.”\n\nKitty Bennett contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/nyregion/nyc-floods-brooklyn-basement-death.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"21:34:26-04:00","title":"2 Men Die in Basement Flooding as Sudden Downpour Hits New York Area","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sudden, record-breaking downpour in the New York area on October 30, 2025, caused flash flooding across Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, resulting in two deaths.

New York Area\n\nPublished: 2025-10-30T21:34:26-04:00\n\nTwo men died on Thursday when storm water inundated basements in Brooklyn and Manhattan, as sudden heavy, record-setting rains brought flash flooding to the New York area, the police said.\n\nOne man, 39, had become trapped when he went back to his basement in the Flatbush neighborhood to rescue one of his dogs, a neighbor said. A diver pulled him out, a Fire Department spokesman said. He was taken by ambulance to Kings County Hospital, where he died. Officials did not confirm whether his death was caused by flooding.\n\nThe other man, aged 43, was found in a flooded basement boiler room of a building in Washington Heights in Manhattan. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The police did not confirm the names of either man on Thursday night.\n\nThe deaths in Brooklyn and Manhattan came as between one and three inches of rain fell across the tristate area on Thursday, according to Dominic Ramunni, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The downpour broke three daily rainfall records across the metropolitan area. LaGuardia Airport recorded over two inches today, with Newark Liberty International Airport and Central Park reporting 1.9 and 1.8 inches, respectively.\n\nThe rain had been predicted to fall over a period of eight hours. Instead, much of it arrived in an intense, 20-minute downpour that began at about 3:50 p.m., said Aries Dela Cruz, a spokesman for the city’s Emergency Management agency.\n\nThe deluge fell in the midst of a drought, which had left piles of fallen leaves and trash on the streets and sidewalks. The rain swept the detritus toward sewer drains, many of which became clogged.\n\nThe worst of the flooding happened between 3 and 5 p.m., according to FloodNet, an organization that monitors more than 250 flood sensors across the city. The hardest-hit areas were Flatbush and Hollis, Queens, where there were several fatalities in 2021 after the remnants of Hurricane Ida came through. Both neighborhoods experienced floodwaters that were nearly two feet deep. Bushwick, in Brooklyn, and parts of East Flushing, in Queens, were also hard hit.\n\nThe rainstorm was torrential in places. Cars were stuck in floodwaters on city streets, a spokesman for the Fire Department said, and some floated away. Flooding forced the closing of the Long Island Expressway at Springfield Boulevard in Queens in both directions, and downed trees were reported around the city.\n\nThere were scattered subway delays because of water intrusion from the street, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The Long Island Rail Road experienced minor delays.\n\nMetro-North was not affected by flooding, although downed trees caused some delays.  NJ Transit reported delays of up to 30 minutes on rail lines because of high water near Newark Airport.\n\nAmtrak temporarily paused train service around 4 p.m. at Newark Airport because of flooding, a spokeswoman said. And regional and Acela services were delayed when a tree fell in Branford, Conn. Trains are moving again in the Northeast Corridor, she added, although there are some residual delays throughout the network.\n\nRenée Phillips, who lives next door to the man who died in Brooklyn, said he had rescued one of his dogs from the flooded basement and had then gone back to retrieve his other dog. He became trapped, she said, and both the man and his dog died.\n\n“This day has been horrific,” Ms. Phillips said.\n\nIn other parts of the borough, the rain was a nuisance but not life-threatening. Kelly Hayes, a co-owner of the Gowanus Gardens restaurant on Fourth Avenue near Carroll Street on the Park Slope-Gowanus border, a notorious flooding spot, said she had developed a routine response to downpours. As she always does, she began to pay close attention Thursday afternoon to FloodNet.\n\nThe first indication that this storm might bring flooding were the gauges near Prospect Park, which recorded a sharp increase in rain at around 4 p.m., Ms. Hayes said. Within minutes, the water had flowed downhill to Fourth Avenue, where it covered the sidewalk. The water poured into the basement, overflowing the restaurant’s grease trap.\n\n“We got a nice layer of slime all over our basement,” Ms. Hayes said. “It’s disgusting.”\n\nIn Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Andy Franklin brought his daughter to Awa Hair Braiding on Tompkins Avenue, where she wanted to get pink synthetic hair braided into her own. Awa had no pink hair in stock, so Mr. Franklin walked to another store nearby. When he returned about 10 minutes later, he found two cars floating down Tompkins Avenue in four feet of water.\n\nThe owners of Awa Hair Braiding had closed the metal security door to the shop to try to keep out the water. That meant the customers were trapped inside.\n\n“I wanted my daughter out,” said Mr. Franklin, 35. As the downpour eased, the salon’s workers opened the gate, and Mr. Franklin retrieved his daughter.\n\nThe flooding was exacerbated by blocked sewer drains, said Leandro Fernandez, manager of the Alejandro Deli Grocery, which sits across the street from Awa Hair Braiding. Mr. Fernandez and a co-worker poked the drains with broom handles, which eventually succeeded in clearing them.\n\nSimilar work happened in the store’s basement, where an employee named Peter Putter stood for two hours in knee-deep water to clear a drain by hand. At 8 p.m., police officers and workers from the city’s Department of Environmental Protection were on the block, shoveling debris away from storm drains, Mr. Franklin said.\n\nThe storm left 1,500 residents without electricity, said a spokeswoman with the Emergency Management agency. Thunderstorms and low cloud ceilings caused arrival and departure delays at all three of the region’s major airports.\n\nFlooding affected the entire region. In Bayonne, N.J., the police responded to cars trapped by water in underpasses around the city, said Edoardo Ferrante, coordinator of Bayonne’s Office of Emergency Management. In one incident that was recorded and posted to X, an S.U.V. became trapped under an overpass. A firefighter waded into the water, retrieved a 4-year-old-girl from the vehicle and helped the girl’s mother escape.\n\nAlthough the rain has left the region, a wind advisory remains in place through Friday evening, with gusts up to 50 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nMaria Cramer, Sean Piccoli and Chelsia Rose Marcius contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/opinion/trump-autocracy-democracy-report.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-04:00","title":"Are We Losing Our Democracy?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The editorial board of The Times warns that the United States is experiencing a significant regression in democratic norms, with Donald Trump's actions aligning closely with known patterns of authoritarianism.

not found\n\nDonald Trump has wielded power as no previous presidenthas, often in open defiance of the law. His actions have raiseda chilling question.\n\nBy The Editorial BoardThe editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nCountries that slide from democracy toward autocracy tend to follow similar patterns. To measure what is happening in the United States, the Times editorial board has compiled a list of 12 markers of democratic erosion, with help from scholars who have studied this phenomenon. The sobering reality is that the United States has regressed, to different degrees, on all 12.\n\nOur country is still not close to being a true autocracy, in the mold of Russia or China. But once countries begin taking steps away from democracy, the march often continues. We offer these 12 markers as a warning of how much Americans have already lost and how much more we still could lose.\n\nAn authoritarian stifles dissent and speech. Trump has started to.\n\nAuthoritarian takeovers in the modern era often do not start with a military coup. They instead involve an elected leader who uses the powers of the office to consolidate authority and make political opposition more difficult, if not impossible. Think of Vladimir Putin in Russia, Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and, to lesser degrees, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, Viktor Orban in Hungary and Narendra Modi in India. These leaders have repressed dissent and speech in heavy-handed ways.\n\nOver the past year, President Trump and his allies have impinged on free speech to a degree that the federal government has not since perhaps the Red Scare of the 1940s and 1950s. His administration pressured television stations to stop airing Jimmy Kimmel’s talk show when Mr. Kimmel criticized Trump supporters after the murder of Charlie Kirk; revoked the visas of foreign students for their views on the war in Gaza; and ordered investigations of liberal nonprofit groups. Mr. Trump so harshly criticizes people who disagree with him, including federal judges, that they become targets of harassment from his supporters.\n\nThe Bottom LineMany forms of speech and dissent remain vibrant in the United States. But the president has tried to dull them. His evident goal is to cause Americans to fear they will pay a price for criticizing him, his allies or his agenda.\n\nAn authoritarian persecutes political opponents. Trump has.\n\nIn addition to restricting speech and dissent, autocrats use the immense power of law enforcement to investigate and imprison people who have fallen out of favor. Mr. Trump’s Justice Department has become an enforcer of his personal interests, targeting people for legally dubious reasons while creating a culture in which his allies can act with impunity.\n\nFollowing the president’s demands, his appointees have secured indictments of a few critics (including Attorney General Letitia James of New York and the former F.B.I. director James Comey) and ordered investigations of others (including Senator Adam Schiff of California). Some of these appointees were once Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers. Mr. Trump has also used executive orders to go after perceived enemies, including law firms representing his critics. And he has systematically fired government employees who played roles in earlier investigations of him or his allies.\n\n“We are all afraid,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, said this spring. “It’s quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. I’ll tell you, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real.”\n\nMr. Trump has simultaneously shielded his own supporters from legal consequences for their actions, including through his blanket pardon of the Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nThe Bottom LineTrue authoritarians go much further than Mr. Trump has, but he has already targeted his opponents with legal persecution in shocking ways.\n\nAn authoritarian bypasses the legislature. Trump has started to.\n\nWhen a democracy slides toward autocracy, the leader often finds ways to neuter the legislature, turning it into a body that rubber stamps his decisions. Congress has started down this path. The Constitution makes clear, in Article I, that Congress alone has the power of the purse. Mr. Trump is undermining this system.\n\nHis administration has violated federal law at least six times by withholding funding authorized by Congress for libraries, preschools, scientific research and more, the Government Accountability Office found. He has gutted or dismantled congressionally authorized agencies like the Department of Education and U.S.A.I.D. He has also imposed new taxes — his tariffs — without congressional approval. Since the current government shutdown began, he has used donations from billionaires to pay troops and finance the construction of a ballroom at the White House.\n\nSome of the blame lies with the Republican leaders of Congress, who have failed to fight his power grabs. Their complicity does not change the fact that these power grabs have been illegal.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump has defied the Constitution by trampling on Congress’s power of the purse. In full autocracies, legislatures often formally transfer some of their authority to the executive, and some congressional Republicans have proposed such changes.\n\nAn authoritarian uses the military for domestic control.  Trump has started to.\n\nEven democracies occasionally use their militaries on home soil. The military can keep order and protect citizens after a devastating storm. In extreme and rare circumstances, troops can enforce the law when local authorities refuse to do so, as happened in the segregated South in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAuthoritarians use the military much more frequently and performatively — to suppress dissent, instill fear and convey supreme power. Mr. Trump deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles to crack down on protests, despite local officials’ insistence that they had the situation under control. He attempted the same in Portland, Ore., and Chicago, before being restrained by federal courts. He has also begun to treat the military as an extension of himself, firing several high-ranking officials without good reason and summoning hundreds of leaders to Virginia to listen to overtly political speeches by him and his appointees.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump’s use of the military for domestic control has been limited. But his willingness to use it as he has — and his threats to expand that use, through the invocation of the Insurrection Act and with troops beyond the National Guard — is extremely worrisome.\n\nAn authoritarian defies the courts. Trump has started to.\n\nWould-be authoritarians recognize that courts can keep them from consolidating power, and they often take steps to weaken or confront judges.\n\nMr. Trump has baldly defied federal judges on several occasions. In March, for instance, his administration ignored a federal judge’s order to turn around airplanes that were deporting migrants to El Salvador. More often, the Trump administration has engaged in gamesmanship, going around orders rather than directly disobeying them. One example: After a federal judge blocked his deployment of the Oregon National Guard, the administration moved to deploy National Guards from other states instead.\n\nSo far, Mr. Trump has defied no Supreme Court orders and has pledged not to. But the justices have too often played into his strategy by failing to stand up for lower courts.\n\nThe Bottom LineIt is a hopeful sign that he has not ignored the Supreme Court, and the court may yet block his most blatant power grabs. Still, the court’s reluctance to restrain him appears to have emboldened him to sidestep lower court orders he does not like.\n\nAn authoritarian declares national emergencies on false pretenses. Trump has.\n\nAuthoritarians often curtail democracy by declaring an emergency and arguing that the threat requires them to exercise unusual degrees of power.\n\nMr. Trump’s recent predecessors were not perfect on this issue. They sometimes declared questionable emergencies. He has gone to another level. He has used manufactured emergencies to sidestep Congress and impose tariffs, deregulate the energy industry, intensify immigration enforcement and send the National Guard into Washington. Chillingly, he has claimed that a Venezuelan gang invaded the United States to justify the killing of foreign civilians in international waters, in defiance of U.S. and international law.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump’s willingness to kill people without due process, through the blowing up of boats that American officials could instead stop and search, represents one of his most extreme abuses of power. It raises the prospect that he may expand the use of emergency power to other areas, including domestic law enforcement.\n\nAn authoritarian vilifies marginalized groups. Trump has.\n\nAuthoritarians tend to demean minority groups, trying to turn them into a perceived threat that provides a justification for a leader to amass power. Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested that marginalized groups are responsible for the nation’s problems.\n\nImmigrants have topped his list. Mr. Trump has blamed them for destroying communities and his administration has tried to dehumanize them by posting mocking videos of shackled immigrants. In response, many Latinos have stopped speaking Spanish in public and started carrying their passports to prove citizenship.\n\nHe has vilified transgender Americans and barred them from military service. He has fired women and people of color from leadership posts and ended programs that promote workplace diversity. His administration has attempted to erase aspects of Black history, including by removing books on slavery and segregation from military libraries and pressuring Smithsonian museums to minimize those subjects. At the same time, he has suggested that white people and Christians are victims, which echoes the autocratic habit of claiming that majority groups are in fact oppressed.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump is borrowing from the autocrats' playbook by suggesting that some citizens are legitimate and others are second-class.\n\nAn authoritarian controls information and the news media. Trump has started to.\n\nDemocratic governments prize accurate information as a guide to decision-making. Authoritarians seek to suppress inconvenient truths.\n\nMr. Trump has sought to manipulate government information in several ways. He fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after the agency reported disappointing job growth this summer. He shut down federal data collection efforts related to climate change, presumably because the information might encourage people to take action.\n\nHe has also taken steps to control the media, both traditional forms and new ones. He arranged for the sale of TikTok from a Chinese company to investors with ties to his political allies. He pushed Congress to end funding for public radio and television. He extracted multimillion-dollar payments from ABC, Paramount (which owns CBS), YouTube and Meta to settle baseless claims that he has been treated unfairly, and he is pursuing lawsuits against The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. All of these moves are meant to reduce coverage that does not parrot his views.\n\nThe Bottom LineIn place of an independent and free press, Mr. Trump evidently hopes to create a shadow ecosystem willing to promote his interests and talking points.\n\nAn authoritarian tries to take over universities. Trump has started to.\n\nAuthoritarians, recognizing that universities are hotbeds of independent thought and political dissent, often single them out for repression. Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan have closed universities. Mr. Modi’s government has arrested dissident scholars, while Mr. Orban has appointed loyalist foundations to run universities.\n\nA signature policy of Mr. Trump’s second term has been his attack on higher education. He has cut millions of dollars of research funding, tried to dictate hiring and admissions policies and forced the resignation of the University of Virginia’s president. It is a sustained campaign to weaken an influential sector home to many political progressives who do not support him — and to many young people, who typically form the crux of anti-authoritarian protest movements.\n\nThe Bottom LineBecause the federal government finances so much academic research, it has considerable power over universities. Initially, some universities seemed as if they might simply submit to Mr. Trump’s demands. More recently, several showed more willingness to resist, rejecting a proposal that would have rewarded them financially for adopting Trump-friendly policies.\n\nAn authoritarian creates a cult of personality. Trump has.\n\nEmperors and kings often glorified themselves by displaying their portraits everywhere. The American tradition has rejected that kind of hagiography for living presidents. Our leaders haven’t needed to puff themselves up this way, until now.\n\nHuge banners with Mr. Trump’s face hang from government buildings. He posts memes in which he wears a crown, including an A.I.-generated video that depicted him defecating on protesters. He held a lavish military parade on his birthday. At televised meetings, members of his cabinet gush sycophantic praise. He announced the creation of a meme coin with his likeness. To celebrate the country’s 250th birthday next year, the Treasury Department plans to put his face on a physical coin.\n\nThe Bottom LineThe Trump cult of personality plays into his claims — common among autocrats — that he possesses a unique ability to solve the country’s problems. As he put it, “I alone can fix it.” He seeks to equate himself with the federal government, as if it does not exist without him.\n\nAn authoritarian uses power for personal profit. Trump has.\n\nAuthoritarians often turn the government into a machine for enriching themselves, their families and their allies. Mr. Trump glories in his administration’s culture of corruption.\n\nHe openly uses the presidency as an opportunity to pad his bottom line, in ways that range from the comically petty (like charging the Secret Service up to $1,200 per night for rooms at his hotels) to the shamelessly greedy (like the $40 million that Amazon paid for the rights to a Melania Trump documentary or his recent demand that the government pay him $230 million because he was investigated for breaking the law). He solicits favors from foreign governments, including an airplane from Qatar. His children also profit from their father’s position, through real-estate deals, crypto, a private club in Washington and more. And he rewards those who enrich them, recently pardoning the head of a cryptocurrency firm who worked with the Trump family.\n\nIn the first six months of this year, the Trump Organization’s income soared to $864 million, up from just $51 million a year earlier, according to a recent Reuters analysis. It’s worth noting that recent Supreme Court decisions have made corruption harder to police.\n\nThe Bottom LineMr. Trump’s culture of corruption may resemble the behavior of foreign autocrats more closely than any other category on this list. He is using what rightly belongs to American citizens — the power and resources of our democratic government — to enrich himself, and he is not trying to hide it.\n\nAn authoritarian manipulates the law to stay in power. Trump has started to.\n\nAuthoritarians change election rules to help their party, and they rewrite laws — or violate their spirit — to ignore term limits.\n\nMr. Trump’s biggest attempt to follow this playbook failed, when he was unable to undo his election defeat to Joe Biden in 2020. But that effort showed Mr. Trump’s willingness to break the law to remain in power.\n\nIn his second term, he has shown worrisome signs of using his power to entrench the Republican Party’s hold on the government. He has pressed Republicans to take gerrymandering to a new extreme. He issued an executive order in March that seeks to interfere with how states run their elections. These moves increase the chances that Republicans will keep control of Congress even if most voters want to oust them.\n\nMr. Trump has not taken concrete steps to remain in power for a third term, which the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution was written to forbid. He has alternated between floating the idea and suggesting he understands that he must leave the presidency for good on Jan. 20, 2029.\n\nThe Bottom LineEven if he backs away from any scheme to serve more than two presidential terms, Mr. Trump’s attempts to tilt the electoral field in favor of Republicans is anti-democratic and could pervert American elections for years.\n\nThe clearest sign that a democracy has died is that a leader and his party make it impossible for their opponents to win an election and hold power. Once that stage is reached, however, the change is extremely difficult to reverse. And aspiring authoritarians use other excesses, like a cowed legislature and judiciary, to lock in their power.\n\nThe United States is not an autocracy today. It still has a mostly free press and independent judiciary, and millions of Americans recently attended the “No Kings” protests. But it has started down an anti-democratic path, and many Americans — including people in positions of power — remain far too complacent about the threat.\n\nThe 12 benchmarks in this editorial offer a way to understand and measure how much further Mr. Trump goes in the months and years ahead. We plan to update this index in 2026.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/us/politics/ken-paxton.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"05:01:59-04:00","title":"A Legal Blizzard in Texas Targets Democrats and Promotes Ken Paxton","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched a widespread and aggressive legal campaign targeting political opponents, immigrant rights organizations, and progressive groups across Texas.

A Legal Blizzard in Texas Targets Democrats and Promotes Ken Paxton\n\nPublished: 2025-10-31T05:01:59-04:00\n\nWhen Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, announced he had sued the makers of Tylenol over a connection to autism that’s never been proven, he got exactly what he wanted — headlines from coast to coast.\n\nThe move was the latest in a rash of lawsuits, investigations and threatening letters from Mr. Paxton aimed at establishing his firm alignment with President Trump — who has publicly connected autism with Tylenol use during pregnancy — and crushing political opponents, immigrant rights groups and progressive organizers.\n\nThe actions, including a new crop of hostile letters targeting Texas towns that have recently moved to raise taxes, have an added advantage. They have kept Mr. Paxton front and center as he seeks to defeat Texas’ senior senator, John Cornyn, in next year’s Republican primary.\n\n“I know it’s political,” said Phil Harris, the city administrator of the small, mostly Republican town of Whitesboro, Texas, which received one of the attorney general’s letters on tax increases. “I wish Ken Paxton wasn’t running for Senate. I think it impacts his decision making.”\n\nMr. Paxton, a darling of hard-line Texas conservatives now in his third term, has always spearheaded conservative litigation, supporting Mr. Trump and challenging the Biden administration for four years. But in recent months, Mr. Paxton has broadened the range and escalated the pace of his legal actions.\n\nIn March, he charged a midwife in the Houston area with providing illegal abortions, then expanded the indictments this month to include her staff. In June, he worked with the Trump administration to help strike down a law, signed under Gov. Rick Perry, a fellow Republican, that offered in-state college tuition to undocumented immigrants in Texas.\n\nHe secured indictments in May against Hispanic Democrats in one rural county over allegations they broke Texas election laws by helping older voters cast their ballots.\n\nAnd he has tried to bankrupt former Representative Beto O’Rourke’s political organization and crush its efforts to register Democrats in Texas to vote.\n\n“He effectively froze our ability to fund-raise,” said Mr. O’Rourke in an interview, recounting the legal back-and-forth with Mr. Paxton’s office. “It definitely interrupted our organizing program.”\n\nTaken together, the headline-grabbing actions — including an announcement of an undercover operation by his office to “infiltrate leftist terror cells” — have positioned Mr. Paxton as the one of the most aggressively partisan state law enforcement leaders in the nation. If that means crippling the Democratic Party of Texas as it struggles to its feet, so be it, supporters say.\n\n“Paxton has represented what I consider the Texan spirit,” said Larry Parr of the Waller County Patriots, a local Christian conservative group east of Houston. “You don’t settle, you don’t bend, you don’t kneel.”\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Paxton declined to make him available or provide comment for this article.\n\nTo his allies, Mr. Paxton’s moves are a welcome extension of the Trump administration’s aggressive use of its law enforcement powers against political opponents.\n\nTo his critics, and to those caught in the cross hairs, it can feel like the weaponization of a powerful state law enforcement office, with hundreds of lawyers, in the service of enforcing one particular political vision of Republican rule in the nation’s second-largest state.\n\n“We don’t break any laws, but obviously, that’s not their concern here,” said Katherine Fischer, who leads Texas Majority PAC, which aims to elect Democrats and has received funding from the liberal billionaire George Soros and has been a target of Mr. Paxton’s office. “Their concern is the prosecution of political enemies.”\n\nLast month, seemingly aware that the sheer number of actions, investigations and lawsuits might be making it hard for each to get attention, the attorney general’s office issued a news release summarizing its previous months’ news releases under the banner of  “victory after victory.”\n\nDemocratic attorneys general have frequently sued the Trump administration, noted Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. What’s unique in Texas is the large number of lawsuits filed by Mr. Paxton against targets within his state, Dr. Blackman said. That is driven by the political dynamic in Texas, with so many large Democratic cities in a firmly Republican-led state.\n\nIn Mr. Paxton’s case, what constitutes a “victory” can be malleable. Many of the cases he has touted are ongoing and, like the Tylenol litigation, are unlikely to be resolved before Mr. Paxton’s term expires next year.\n\nSome have not moved beyond the initial announcement. Ms. Fischer, for example, said Texas Majority PAC had not gotten any follow-up after the news release announcing the group was in the attorney general’s sights.\n\n“We have not been served,” she said, though the group is prepared just in case. “If you’re on the receiving end, you have an obligation to take it seriously.”\n\nWhile the attorney general in Texas has limited jurisdiction over criminal matters, Mr. Paxton has made frequent and occasionally novel use of the powers of his office to enforce civil laws, including those around consumer protection and nonprofits.\n\nMr. Paxton has begun investigations into nonprofits that offer care and assistance to migrants, including a Catholic shelter along the border with Mexico in El Paso. He has also filed suit seeking to revoke the charter of FIEL Houston, a nonprofit organization that supports immigrants. Mr. Paxton accused it of illegally engaging in politics and of aiming to “destroy our country and flood our nation with foreign invaders.”\n\nIn recent days he sent a letter seeking documents from a homeless services nonprofit in Austin, claiming that it had violated state law by supporting a voter proposition on the ballot next week that would raise city taxes.\n\nHis suit against Mr. O’Rourke accused the former El Paso congressman and his political organizing group, Powered by People, of violating consumer protection laws — by raising money to support Democratic lawmakers during the political fight over congressional redistricting.\n\n“When you have the most powerful law enforcement official in the state of Texas and his taxpayer-funded office coming at you, you have to respond,” Mr. O’Rourke said. “The point is to cause you to go out of business, or to throw in the towel, and to send the message to other progressive organizations across Texas that they shouldn’t be so bold.”\n\nThe flurry of activity may also be a means of distracting from what has been a tough summer of headlines for Mr. Paxton, said Chad Wilbanks, a Republican political consultant and former executive director of the Republican Party of Texas. Mr. Paxton’s wife, Angela Paxton, a state senator, announced in July that she was divorcing him “on biblical grounds,” cited extramarital affairs and said the couple had not been living together in over a year. Mr. Paxton at the time asked for “prayers and privacy.”\n\nMr. Cornyn’s campaign, flush with campaign cash, has levied a series of attacks on the character of Mr. Paxton, including that he may have violated the law related to his mortgages on several homes.\n\nMr. Paxton is “trying to change the narrative for the fall from how bad it was in the summer,” said Mr. Wilbanks, who has raised money for Mr. Cornyn in the past.\n\nAt a news conference in Houston this month, Mr. Cornyn said that federal legislation he proposed to enhance criminal penalties for elected officials who commit bank, mortgage, credit and tax fraud — aimed at political adversaries of Mr. Trump like New York’s attorney general, Letitia James — could also apply to Mr. Paxton.\n\nMr. Paxton, who survived an impeachment trial over corruption allegations in the Texas Legislature in 2023, has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn addition to targeting Democratic organizations, Mr. Paxton has also taken action against small- and medium-sized cities in conservative areas that recently voted to increase taxes. He sent letters to at least four towns accusing them of violating a new state law requiring municipal audits and ordering them not to raise taxes.\n\n“It seems like we’re being hit unfairly,” said Cal Hendrick, who was recently elected mayor of Odessa, a conservative West Texas oil country town that received one of the letters from Mr. Paxton.\n\nMr. Hendrick, a lifelong Republican, said he was trying to clean up an auditing mess from a prior administration, and that the new revenue would go to city services. “We’re trying to fix it,” he said. “And at the same time, we’re being punished.”\n\nThe town of Whitesboro, with a population of 4,000 people who overwhelmingly supported Mr. Trump, received a similar letter from Mr. Paxton after its City Council voted for a tax increase.\n\nThe city administrator, Mr. Harris, once worked at the accounting firm Ernst & Young and said the city believed it was on firm legal ground.\n\nAs for that letter, Mr. Harris added, “I thought it was very aggressive when it didn’t need to be.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/arts/television/tim-meadows-just-wants-to-keep-showing-up-to-be-funny.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"05:02:25-04:00","title":"Tim Meadows Just Wants to Keep Showing Up to Be Funny","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tim Meadows, a veteran comedian and former main cast member of 'Saturday Night Live', has carved out a unique place in comedy as a dry, grounded, and consistently reliable performer.

2025-10-30T05:02:25-04:00\n\nTim Meadows was in the main cast of the short-lived NBC sitcom “The Michael Richards Show,” in 2000, when he encountered an older character actor with a big white mustache. The actor was Bill Erwin, who had hundreds of acting credits including “Home Alone,” “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” and dozens of one-off roles in sitcoms — like this ill-fated one with Meadows.\n\nBut if “The Michael Richards Show” proved ultimately to be forgettable, the interaction with Erwin did not.\n\n“I said, ‘You had a long career; I’ve seen you in everything,’” Meadows recalled telling him. “He goes: ‘Yep, I’ve been around for a long time. My secret for success? I always want to play the neighbor who comes in, says something funny and leaves.’”\n\nMeadows chuckled to himself. “That’s my hero,” he said. “I want to be that dude when I’m 70, 75 years old.”\n\nHe is coming pretty close. Since leaving the cast of “Saturday Night Live” a quarter-century ago, he has made a career of being the kind of performer who is never top of the marquee but always vital to the comic alchemy, providing quotable lines and memorable expressions whenever he appears onscreen.\n\n“Tim has a flawless dry delivery — like Bob Newhart,” Tina Fey, a longtime collaborator, wrote in an email. The two performed together for several seasons on “S.N.L.,” and Fey has tapped him for roles ever since, notably as the exasperated principal in “Mean Girls.” He is, Fey added, the “perfect, put-upon ‘voice of reason.’”\n\nMeadows, 64, has been a steady presence in movies and television since his first “S.N.L.” episode in 1991, but this fall has been particularly fruitful. He just finished a run in Season 2 of the HBO Max superhero series “Peacemaker,” in which he played a government agent with a fictitious ailment that prevents him from distinguishing between birds. And earlier this month, CBS premiered “DMV,” a workplace sitcom set at a Los Angeles branch of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Reviews have been mixed, but Meadows’s mordant performance has been widely praised.\n\nMeadows plays Gregg, a surly employee constantly bemoaning his life. The DMV isn’t a steppingstone for him; it’s a last resort. The show’s creator, Dana Klein, said she had Meadows in mind even before she started writing the pilot.\n\n“I mean, he can get a laugh on the word ‘no,’” Klein said in a video interview. “I don’t know how he does it.”\n\nMeadows is not the biggest star to emerge from his era of “S.N.L.” — he never had the movie career of, say, Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler — but he has never been far from the spotlight. He appears to be content with his place in the industry, though lately his brand of acerbic wit seems to be in demand. Asked whether he feels that there is new momentum in his career, Meadows responded in with a laid-back air of self-deprecation.\n\n“If there is, I’m suppressing it,” he said. “I’m not going to get caught up in it. When I watch the Emmys and the Academy Awards, I feel like I’m in a different business.”\n\nWhen we met earlier this month for lunch, Meadows was in New York for a quick trip to promote “DMV” before returning to Montreal to finish shooting Season 1. He suggested we meet at the storied White Horse Tavern, in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan, near where he used to live during his time in “S.N.L.” In person, he was warm and reflective, at ease in the dim light of the historic bar.\n\nHe still feels a connection to the West Village and keeps an apartment in Venice Beach, in Los Angeles. But these days he spends most of the year in his hometown, Detroit, where he bought a house in 2017.\n\nThe son of a janitor and a nurse’s assistant, Meadows grew up there as the youngest of six siblings. As a young man, he kept the idea of pursuing comedy a “secret,” he said, and enrolled at Wayne State University, in Detroit, where he studied TV and radio broadcasting. Then he saw a newspaper article about local improv classes. He signed up and discovered quickly that the “yes, and” life suited him. He quit school before his junior year and moved to Chicago in the mid-1980s.\n\nSuccess came relatively quickly. Within a few years of relocating, he was hired to the main stage of Second City, performing alongside the likes of Chris Farley and Bob Odenkirk. It wasn’t long before Meadows caught the eye of Lorne Michaels, who had visited Second City specifically to consider recruiting Farley to “S.N.L.” Michaels brought Farley on in 1990; Meadows debuted the year after.\n\nMeadows became an “S.N.L.” mainstay, remaining in the cast for 10 seasons — a record until he was passed by Darrell Hammond, who finished with 14. (The current record-holder is Kenan Thompson, at 22 and counting.) Like many an “S.N.L.” cast member, he was encouraged to parlay one of his most popular characters — in his case, the lisping radio host Leon Phelps, otherwise known as “The Ladies Man” — into a starring role in a feature film. But “The Ladies Man,” from 2000, which Meadows’s co-wrote, was a critical and commercial flop.\n\n“It slowed my career down,” Meadows said. “It slowed everything down.”\n\nMeadows, however, said he doesn’t resent the fact that some of his peers have had greater box office success.\n\n“I can honestly say, lie detector, I have no jealousy or anything with anybody I’ve worked with that went on to do well,” he said. “I’m really happy, because it feels like somebody I love.”\n\nMeadows also just enjoys working. His “DMV” co-star Harriet Dyer described him as perpetually calm on set, eager to talk about his children. One of Meadows’s two kids is a senior in college; the other recently graduated. He is relieved they have no interest in pursuing comedy.\n\nHe said this with no hesitation. As his friend and former castmate Molly Shannon said in a phone interview, Meadows can also “be deadly serious in the greatest way.”\n\n“There are some comedians that have to be on and are doing bits all the time and are joking, which sometimes can be a way to push people away,” she added. “Tim is much more real, wants to get very down to serious business, deep conversation very, very quickly.”\n\nIn recent years, Meadows has begun touring as a standup act for the first time — an experience he found “humbling in the beginning,” he said. It is a way, he added, to have an audience “validate something stupid” he thought up in his car. But it is also a backup plan in case the TV jobs suddenly dry up.\n\nConceivably, “Peacemaker” could lead to an expanded role in the DC Comics universe — his character is part of a new crime-fighting team established in the finale. That would be “very exciting,” Meadows said, but he isn’t counting on it. Similarly, “DMV” could take up the next 10 years of his life, or it could become like “The Michael Richards Show,” which ran a mere eight episodes. (“DMV,” at least, has been ordered for a full season.)\n\nMeadows is prepared for any outcome. For now, he seems content to be a Bill Erwin type, who knows exactly where he fits.\n\n“I owe that guy,” he said. “I’m glad I had that conversation with him.”\n\nVideo camera operating by Yazz Jansen.\n\n"}]}
