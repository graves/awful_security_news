flights at dozens of major airports as early as Friday if no  shutdown deal  is reached, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced at a news conference Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Ten percent of air traffic at 40 busy airports would be cut, potentially impacting thousands of flights, though the details of how many and which specific airports will be cut was not announced.\n \n\n   \n  “As we start to implement this draw down in service, it will be restricted to these 40 high volume traffic markets,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. “We’re going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules.”\n \n\n   \n  The announcement comes as  air traffic controller staffing shortages  during the shutdown are delaying an increasing number of flights throughout the country. Controllers will miss their second full paycheck next week and some are taking second jobs to make ends meet or calling in sick in protest.\n \n\n   \n  Controllers, like Transportation Security Administration screeners, are considered essential employees and must work during the shutdown, but are not being paid.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA will meet with the airlines to discuss implementation of the new plan Wednesday night. Bedford called the change “prescriptive” and “surgical.”\n \n\n   \n  “We are going to proactively make decisions that keep the airspace safe,” Duffy said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have asked (air traffic controllers) to show up for work, but I’m not naive to understand that they’re trying to figure out how they meet their daily obligations,” Duffy said. “Because of that, we have seen staffing pressures throughout our airspace. Those who travel will see that we’ve had more delays. We’ve had more cancelations.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 400 staffing shortages have been reported at FAA facilites since the start of the shutdown, according to a CNN analysis. The number is more than four times what was seen on the same days last year.\n \n\n   \n  The airlines were notified of the plan only about an hour before it was announced, an airline source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working with the federal government to understand all details of the new reduction mandate and will strive to mitigate impacts to passengers and shippers,” Airlines for America, the industry trade group, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Bedford said the new measures would also go beyond commercial airspace and include restrictions on space launches and small aircraft traffic in certain markets.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to applaud the controllers who continue to come to work on a daily basis keeping our system safe,” Bedford said. “But I also want to recognize the fact that the data is telling us we need to do more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/us/chicago-immigration-facility-improvements-ordered","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"19:38:00Z","title":"Judge orders improvements at a Chicago-area immigration facility after claims of inhumane conditions","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge in Chicago ordered immediate improvements at an ICE detention facility in Broadview, including clean bedding, proper sleeping space, hygiene supplies, and access to legal representation, after detainees alleged inhumane conditions like overflowing toilets and no beds.

It requires officials to provide detainees at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the west Chicago suburb of Broadview with a clean bedding mat and sufficient space to sleep, soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste, menstrual products and prescribed medications.\n \n\n   \n  “People shouldn’t be sleeping next to overflowing toilets,” US District Judge Robert Gettleman said. “They should not be sleeping on top of each other.”\n \n\n   \n  The order says the holding rooms at the facility must be cleaned twice a day. Detainees must be allowed to shower at least every other day and should have three full meals and bottled water upon request.\n \n\n   \n  Gettleman required authorities to allow detainees to call lawyers in private with no cost and provide them with a list of pro bono attorneys in English and Spanish. Agents are also barred from misrepresenting documents provided to detainees to sign.\n \n\n   \n  The judge had called the alleged conditions “unnecessarily cruel” after a hearing Tuesday about overflowing toilets, crowded cells, no beds and water that “tasted like sewer.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he found the witnesses “highly credible,” adding he was moved by the seriousness of the conditions.\n \n\n   \n  Gettleman requested a status report by noon Friday on how authorities are fulfilling the requirements.\n \n\n   \n  A message left Wednesday for Immigration and Customs Enforcement wasn’t immediately returned.\n \n\n   \n    Officer defends use of force\n \n\n   \n  In another Chicago courtroom, Senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino defended the use of force by agents accused of using pepper balls, tear gas and other tactics against people protesting federal immigration policies and the detaining of immigrants in the area.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino made the statement in a deposition — a private interview with lawyers from both sides — given last week. It was brought into evidence during a preliminary injunction hearing Wednesday  in a lawsuit  filed by news outlets and protesters.\n \n\n   \n  In the deposition, Bovino said he does not remember the name of a Chicago-area pastor who claims to have been struck in the head by pepper balls as he prayed outside the Broadview ICE facility.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know what the use of force was here, and I can’t make a judgment either way because I don’t know,” Bovino said after viewing footage of the Rev. David Black being shot with the chemical agents.\n \n\n   \n  Black testified earlier that he and others were not threatening agents and that protesters had been hit with pepper balls and tear gas. Agents did not warn protesters before using the chemicals, Black said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the plaintiffs also played a clip of Bovino grabbing and tackling a man to the ground during one demonstration outside the Broadview facility.\n \n\n   \n  Oak Park Township Trustee Juan Munoz said he was standing beside the man and was also knocked down and pinned by Bovino during the chaos. Munoz said Bovino also smacked his phone from his hands.\n \n\n   \n  Munoz said he was arrested and detained in the Broadview facility for eight hours. He has not returned to the facility to protest, Munoz added.\n \n\n   \n  After attorneys played footage of Munoz’s arrest, Bovino repeatedly denied during the deposition that he tackled “an older gentleman” in the video and dodged questions on whether he used force.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino acknowledged that he made physical contact with the man, but denied that he applied force, saying it was not “reportable use of force.”\n \n\n   \n    Excessive force claims dog ICE agents\n \n\n   \n  US District  Judge Sara Ellis  has already ordered agents to wear badges and banned them from using certain  riot-control techniques , such as tear gas, against peaceful protesters and journalists. After repeatedly chastising federal officials for not following her previous orders, she added a requirement for body cameras.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis will weigh how to respond to allegations that federal immigration agents in the Chicago area have  used excessive force , following a surge of recent court filings detailing tense encounters  between agents and residents .\n \n\n   \n  Craig Futterman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, noted recent examples of agents using tear gas on Chicago-area residents, including at a Halloween parade and outside a grocery store. He said Bovino, himself, has been  filmed throwing tear gas canisters  at protesters. A video of Bovino throwing a canister was played during Wednesday’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department lawyer Sarmad Khojasteh accused many protesters of threatening to kill law enforcement officers, impeding their duties and throwing rocks and other objects at agents.\n \n\n   \n  “Such conduct must be rejected,” he said. “To what extent does the freedom of speech protect individuals in obstructing and/or threatening conduct — throwing rocks, bottles, fireworks, surrounding and pinning down law enforcement officials?”\n \n\n   \n  But witnesses say the actions by agents have been unprovoked.\n \n\n   \n    Witnesses say ICE actions not called for\n \n\n   \n  Leslie Cortez, a youth organizer, said she was recording and explaining rights in Spanish to day laborers being arrested by ICE agents outside a Home Depot when one agent pointed a gun at her.\n \n\n   \n  “I could see inside the barrel,” Cortez testified. “My heart accelerated. I was nervous they were going to shoot.”\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Newspaper Guild Executive Director Emily Steelhammer also took the stand, recounting how members of the union said they were hit with rubber bullets, pepper balls and chemical weapons, including tear gas. The incidents mostly occurred in Broadview, but also took place at other Chicago-area demonstrations, she said.\n \n\n   \n  In his deposition, Bovino denied allegations of excessive use of force, saying, “I have not seen our men or women deploy force against protesters.”\n \n\n   \n  When asked by attorneys if a peaceful protester who refuses an instruction from law enforcement would be considered a violent or “assaultive subject,” Bovino said it is an indicator that someone is “potentially on that road” to obstructing agents.\n \n\n   \n  “Not following instructions is certainly one indication of someone that’s, that’s already ready to break the law, be where they’re not supposed to be,” Bovino said.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s hearing follows Ellis’ questioning of Bovino at a public hearing last week, where she took the rare step of ordering him to brief her each evening on the federal immigration crackdown in Chicago. That move was swiftly blocked by an appeals court.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/business/nvidia-palantir-michael-burry-stock","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"Michael Burry of ‘The Big Short’ is back with cryptic messages — and two massive bets","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michael Burry, the investor behind 'The Big Short,' has returned to public discourse by betting against two top AI stocks — Nvidia and Palantir — through bearish put options.

back with cryptic messages — and two massive bets \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:40 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Michael Burry, the famed investor behind “The Big Short,” is betting artificial intelligence is more of a bubble than a revolution.\n \n\n   \n  Burry’s fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed on Monday that it bought puts — bets that share prices will fall — on two stars of the AI wave: Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Palantir ( PLTR ). Scion bought roughly $187.6 million in puts on Nvidia and $912 million in puts on Palantir, according to Securities and Exchange Commission  filings .\n \n\n   \n  Burry is known for his prophetic call that the US housing market would collapse in 2008. He was profiled in the 2010 book “The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,” by Michael Lewis, and portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2015 film adaptation.\n \n\n   \n  Now Burry is betting against the hottest AI stocks on the market at a time when concerns are mounting about a bubble. Tech and AI stocks have carried the market in recent months.  The S&P 500, which is increasingly concentrated in tech companies, is trading at historically expensive levels.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the  circular financing  of AI deals has raised eyebrows on Wall Street, with many tech companies entwined in a massive web of deals with each other. Some investors are also skeptical whether future profit growth will continue to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place.\n \n\n   \n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.04% on Tuesday, posting its worst day since August. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 1.17%.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Sometimes, we see bubbles’\n \n\n   \n  Burry made a splash among investors on Thursday, when he posted on X for the first time since 2023. In his post, he shared a photo of Bale portraying him in “The Big Short” and wrote: “Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.”\n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Burry’s fund disclosed its bearish positions in Nvidia and Palantir. The SEC filings are for the third quarter of this year. Scion Asset Management did not respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research, said a pullback in tech stocks was overdue, given how far they have rallied in recent months. He said Burry’s comments likely exacerbated concerns.\n \n\n   \n  Burry has made public calls about the market in the years since “The Big Short.” He has not always been correct. The hedge fund manager in January 2023 infamously posted on X, “Sell,” before posting two months later, “I was wrong to say sell.”\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, his words carry weight on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  Burry’s return to social media comes at a time when investors have voiced concerns about expensive valuations, a market concentrated on a handful of large companies and rising investor expectations.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Palantir beat Wall Street forecasts in earnings reported Monday.

Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani: Talk to the man who  helped bring Detroit back from the dead .\n \n\n   \n  Dimon, who has been  critical of Mamdani , suggested the incoming New York City mayor could learn a lot from  outgoing Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. \n \n\n   \n  “I hope he calls up…this mayor because that’s the way you learn. You say, ‘How did you do it? What did you do?’” Dimon told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Wednesday during a live interview alongside Duggan, who is stepping down from office next year and running for governor of Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  The JPMorgan CEO said he considers himself “patriotic” and is willing to help “any mayor, any governor.” Dimon is among the business leaders whose companies invested in Detroit when it was in dire straits.\n \n\n   \n  But Dimon suggested the jury is still out on whether Mamdani will succeed – and the key will be how he executes his vision.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve seen a lot of mayors and governors, political leaders. Some grow into the job. …They fix the life, they fix the crime, they fix the hospitals. They fix the ambulance times,” Dimon said.\n \n\n   \n  On the other hand, Dimon said some mayors get overwhelmed by the job.\n \n\n   \n  “They never get around to it. They’re so befuddled with politics and ideology,” he said. “I’ve seen a lot of people when it comes to the execution part, they fall down so flat that it doesn’t matter where the heart is, they will fail to accomplish their goals.”\n \n\n   \n  Duggan, who has been credited with helping to revive Detroit after its 2013 bankruptcy, said he has not talked to Mamdani yet but was impressed by the enthusiasm in New York City on Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  “I happened to be in New York yesterday and saw a lot of young people very energized. Clearly dissatisfied. People want change, and now you have a new mayor who has a chance to deliver change,” Duggan told CNN. “I think he ought to be judged on what he does.”\n \n\n   \n  The Detroit mayor argued city leaders must be willing to work alongside business leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “I embraced Jamie Dimon at a time when people said this was maybe politically risky,” Duggan said, adding the way JPMorgan provided low-income housing and job training programs helped win over the public. “There is a way to embrace a partner that the community buys into. And that’s what we did.”\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan announced Wednesday that its investment in Detroit has now surpassed $2 billion, and the bank’s main presence in the city is moving to Hudson’s Detroit, a new complex downtown.\n \n\n   \n    Trade and tariffs\n \n\n   \n  Duggan, a former Democrat now running as an independent, criticized  President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade agenda, which the White House says is meant to help American factory workers who have been hurt by jobs shipped overseas.\n \n\n   \n  “I live in Detroit. You don’t have to explain anything to Detroiters about bad trade agreements America has made over the years. They’ve emptied out the manufacturing industry in Michigan, and I think the right tariffs on Mexico and Canada could have helped,” Duggan said.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the Detroit mayor argued Trump’s tariffs on Canada are backfiring because of how closely intertwined the North American supply chain has become. He noted Canadian auto supplier plants, located right across the river from Detroit, send parts to his city’s three manufacturing plants.\n \n\n   \n  “When you put a tax on Canada, you put a tax on Michigan cars. I do think the Canadian tariffs need to be addressed, because it is starting to hurt the Michigan economy,” Duggan said.\n \n\n   \n  The comments came hours after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on   a case challenging Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs. Most justices  appeared deeply concerned  with Trump’s reliance on a vague federal law to impose the duties.\n \n\n   \n  Trump argued in a social media post on Tuesday that the case is “literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country” because without the emergency powers the United States would be “virtually defenseless against other Countries.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if the Supreme Court case is a matter of life or death, Dimon said: “I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   \n  Dimon said tariffs are “a factor,” but “may not be the deciding factor” in growing the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  The JPMorgan CEO did, however, credit Trump officials with “starting to do a better job” on trade by examining “what’s working, what’s not working and making adjustments.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/democrats-shutdown-deal-elections","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"Democrats emboldened by election results mobilize against centrists’ emerging shutdown deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following decisive Democratic victories in the recent midterms, including in Virginia, Senate leaders and House Democrats are pressuring centrist Democrats to reject a potential shutdown deal that would only provide a non-binding vote on extending enhanced Obamacare subsidies.

shutdown deal \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Manu Raju, Adam Cancryn, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:26 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hours before the first major elections since  President Donald Trump’s  win last November, Sen. Bernie Sanders offered a stern warning for Democrats about the party’s closed-door talks to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Inside a tense, three-hour meeting at the Capitol on Tuesday, a fiery Sanders urged Democrats not to yield to Republicans without a real victory on health care. The Vermont independent was armed with fresh polling from a Democratic-aligned firm that showed voters would punish the party for giving up with nothing in return, according to a person familiar with his remarks.\n \n\n   \n  By Wednesday morning, Sanders and his colleagues in Congress pointed to Democrats’  blow-out victories  — including in Virginia, a state with thousands of furloughed federal workers — as the most powerful evidence yet they needed to keep fighting.\n \n\n   \n  “It would be very strange if on the heels of the American people rewarding Democrats for standing up and fighting, we surrendered without getting anything,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said. “I think we are in an enormously strong position right now.”\n \n\n   \n  During a private call of House Democrats on Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers, including senior Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, urged each other to call their centrist Senate colleagues directly to make the case against the emerging deal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries signaled on the call that he was keeping the pressure on his Senate counterpart, according to two people familiar with the discussion. Outside Democratic groups, too, have swiftly mobilized to ramp up pressure on centrists.\n \n\n   \n  Emboldened Hill Democrats pointed to  jitters from Trump  himself, who privately told a group of Senate Republicans that their party was being “killed” politically by the shutdown. Trump said publicly that “the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of his GOP allies in Congress agreed. Asked if he believed the shutdown hurt Republicans in the elections, Sen. Jim Justice told CNN: “Look, if you didn’t, you’re living in a cave. That’s all there’s to it. Of course, it did.” Justice added that everyday Americans are sitting there watching the shutdown saying, “‘You people are in control. Fix it.’”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats’ election night romp has further scrambled Washington’s shutdown politics, with leaders of both parties now cautiously assessing their next steps as the pain continues to grow for millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Yet it’s not clear if it will substantively shift the strategy of either side, including among the dozen or so centrist Democrats who are still actively engaging in talks with Republicans in a bid to end the record 36-day standoff before the election, potentially without the kind of clear commitment on health care that some Democrats are seeking.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have made a push to extend soon-to-expire enhanced Affordable Care Act subsides central to the shutdown fight. The fear among some in the party now is that centrists will cut a deal with Republicans that won’t lock in an extension and will only provide for a vote over the issue with no guaranteed outcome.\n \n\n   \n  “Last night was a good night but it was one night of the year,” Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told CNN when asked about the elections, not answering directly if he would accept a promise of a health care vote. He noted that Democrats are discussing a “reasonable path forward” with the GOP.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Gary Peters, the retiring Democrat from Michigan, added that many in the party are “feeling very good that the messaging is getting through and Republicans are in a much weaker position today than they were yesterday.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t feel (it) changed a lot,” added Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, referring to the outcome of Tuesday’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday night, roughly a dozen Senate Democratic centrists had privately signaled they were open to the GOP’s proposed shutdown offramp — which includes a future vote on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. That group, along with a handful of Republicans, met all morning Wednesday and are still in intense negotiations over a deal that could lead to reopening the government, according to sources familiar with the effort. The timing of when a deal would be announced, and when any votes would occur, is still unclear.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada stressed to CNN that there was “no deal” yet and that discussions were ongoing on health care, adding there are also serious talks about constraining Trump on spending cuts. Party leadership, she said, is not directly involved in the talks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it has to be part of the discussion,” Cortez Masto, a member of appropriations panel, said of a push to restrain Trump’s ability to interfere with Congress’s power of the purse.\n \n\n   \n  There was at least some post-election movement: Some Senate Democrats involved in talks to end the shutdown sought to use their momentum — as well as Trump’s shutdown comments at the White House — to spur their Republican colleagues to support a compromise framework that would temporarily extend enhanced Obamacare subsidies with some reforms to reopen the government, two Democrats involved in the talks told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “With that it ends fast; without we stare at each other another week,” one of the sources said of the Obamacare compromise proposal.\n \n\n   \n  But that outcome, too, is unclear, with Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team fiercely resistant to the idea, according to multiple House GOP sources.\n \n\n   \n  The pressure is now — again — on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who’s been mum on his own stance in the talks. To increase that pressure, Sanders showed up Wednesday morning to Schumer’s press conference to listen in. Instead, he ended up taking the podium before the New York Democrat’s arrival to insist that the party take the right message away from election night.\n \n\n   \n  “What people want is that the Democrats stand up and continue to fight,” Sanders said at his own impromptu press conference. He stressed that Schumer and Democrats can’t simply accept a promise: “There has to be a commitment that the President of the United States is prepared to sign the bill.”\n \n\n   \n  Minutes later, when Schumer was pressed on whether he agrees with Sanders’ position, he would not state his own, saying he isn’t going to negotiate in public.\n \n\n   \n  “We want, we must address the health care needs of the American people, the Republicans ‘gotta sit down and talk to us about it, and I agree with Bernie Sanders, the way to solve this is for Trump to sit down with Jeffries and I,” said Schumer, who also did not express a preference in Tuesday’s marathon lunch meeting of Senate Democrats, according to people familiar with the gathering.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also not yet clear if Trump’s frustration with the off-year elections will change his own strategy on the shutdown. Despite the president’s evident annoyance with the electoral outcomes, he’s signaled no new appetite for granting Democrats any additional concessions — insisting instead that Senate Republicans should simply abolish the filibuster. GOP leaders have deemed that idea a nonstarter, in a rare split with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Among more circumspect Trump advisers, there remained an overriding belief that moderate Democrats’ desire to find an off-ramp would ultimately outweigh progressives’ will to keep fighting.\n \n\n   \n  At most, one person close to the process predicted, Democrats would hold out long enough to take a final victory lap on the Sunday political shows before agreeing to a deal early next week.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Republicans acknowledged, the GOP is under increasing pressure to find a resolution as the real-world pain piles up — and Trump presses in harsher terms for the party to go nuclear.\n \n\n   \n  “A winning Trump is less dangerous than a losing Trump. People forget this. If Rs look they they’ll lose midterms, his pressure on filibuster to pass agenda before he leaves office will be insane,” one Senate GOP aide said in a text to CNN. “Trump is about to throw everything at Congress. Especially if he doesn’t get his way on tariffs.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/us/teacher-shot-abby-zwerner-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"17:25:00Z","title":"Deliberations to resume Thursday in lawsuit filed by Virginia teacher shot by 6-year-old student","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A civil lawsuit filed by Virginia teacher Abby Zwerner, who was shot in January 2023 by a 6-year-old student at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, is now in the midst of jury deliberations.

You get to the bottom of it,” attorney Kevin Biniazan continued. “You get to the bottom of that backpack. You get to the bottom of his pockets, whatever it is. You get to the bottom of it to know whether that gun is real and on campus so you can deal with it.\n \n\n   \n  “But that’s not what happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner is suing Parker, who is accused of neglecting to act on  concerns  the student had a gun in January 2023 at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\n \n\n   \n  Parker’s attorneys have argued no one could fathom a child so young would bring a gun to school and carry out a shooting. Parker did not take the stand during the trial that began last week but was in court through it.\n \n\n   \n  “You will be able to judge for yourself whether or not this was foreseeable. That’s the heart of this case,” Parker’s attorney, Daniel Hogan,  said earlier  in the trial.\n \n\n   \n  In his closing argument, Biniazan challenged that position.\n \n\n   \n  “You cannot stick your head in the sand and then come into court and say, ‘I didn’t have the information,’ when it was your job to find it,” Zwerner’s lawyer said Wednesday. “Every second that a gun is in the possession of a 6-year-old, who I agree, has totally unpredictable behavior … All the more reason to find the gun.”\n \n\n   \n  At the center of the lawsuit is who gets the blame when children have access to guns and carry out school shootings, which continue to plague the country. As of last week, there were  64 US school shootings  this year, 27 of them on K-12 school grounds.\n \n\n   \n  “Parker did not have a legal duty to protect Miss Zwerner,” Sandra Douglas, one of Parker’s attorneys said in her closing argument. “She did not volunteer to protect Miss Zwerner.”\n \n\n   \n  Douglas sought to discredit the testimony of the plaintiff’s witnesses, recounting the school’s reading specialist was the first to hear the student might have a gun, and she and the school guidance counselor did not remove the student or his backpack from the room.\n \n\n   \n  Douglas said the reading specialist previously said she thought there might be a toy gun, but testified during the trial she told Parker students had told her the boy had a gun. She texted Parker two days later saying she should have removed the student from the class herself.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re the judges of the credibility of these witnesses,” Douglas said.\n \n\n   \n  She argued Zwerner should have talked to Parker herself, and she had discussions with Parker about the student’s behavior during lunch, but not about a report of the gun.\n \n\n   \n  “It was largely unthinkable and certainly unprecedented. Your job is to consider only what Dr. Parker knew at the time,” Douglas said.\n \n\n   \n  The defense attorney challenged the testimony that Zwerner was unable to fully use her hand because she graduated cosmetology school. And she challenged that while witnesses testified Zwerner had trouble leaving the house, she went to concerts in the months after the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not minimizing what happened to Miss Zwerner,” Douglas said. “I’m not doing that.”\n \n\n   \n  In rebuttal, Biniazan characterized the defense argument as “everyone is lying” and pointed out they didn’t call any witnesses from the school.\n \n\n   \n  “The only people they called as an expert were the people that they paid to come into this courtroom,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The civil trial offers a window to some of the key details that will be presented during the criminal case next month against Parker, who faces  eight counts  of felony child neglect. Filing charges against school officials in the aftermath of a school shooting is rare.\n \n\n   \n  In instructions given to the jury Wednesday, the judge told jurors they’d be deciding whether Parker was grossly negligent and whether her negligence caused Zwerner’s injury and damages. Jurors were also tasked with deciding whether Zwerner was negligent and caused any of her own damages; if so, she would be barred from recovering any money from Parker, the judge instructed the jury.\n \n\n   \n    Injured teacher shared emotional testimony\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner testified about the physical and emotional consequences wrought by the shooting. After she was shot in the chest and hand while sitting at a reading table, Zwerner thought she had died and gone to heaven.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought I was dying. I thought I had died,” she  said last week .\n \n\n   \n  The teacher now says she’s more reserved and sometimes gets overwhelmed at the thought of going out in public.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner’s twin sister, Hannah, also testified how Abby’s demeanor changed after the shooting: She was full of light, outgoing and silly, but now “she’s just not the person that she was,” Hannah said during her emotional testimony.\n \n\n   \n  Zwerner has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the shooting, psychiatrist Dr. Clarence Watson testified last week. And Zwerner’s devastating hand injury has left her unable to perform daily activities.\n \n\n   \n  Despite six surgeries, Zwerner’s hand will never be normal, an orthopedic surgeon testified earlier in the trial.\n \n\n   \n  Previous testimony from doctors on her care team revealed Zwerner’s injuries were life-threatening after a bullet narrowly missed her heart. And the impacts extended beyond the physical damage, she testified.\n \n\n   \n  During cross-examination, an attorney for Parker worked to undermine Zwerner’s claims the shooting had limited her willingness to go out in public, saying she was emotionally ready to attend concerts like Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour.\n \n\n   \n  The attorney also sought to undermine claims Zwerner is physically hindered by her wounds, asking how she successfully attended and graduated from cosmetology school, worked and frequented a gym if she had physical limitations.\n \n\n   \n    Assistant principal did not act with indifference, expert testifies\n \n\n   \n  An expert for the defense  testified Monday  the assistant principal did not breach professional standards or act with indifference.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Amy Klinger, an expert in education administration and school safety, said it would have been difficult for anyone to foresee the incident and testified the assistant principal’s role is collaborative and school safety is a shared responsibility among all staff.\n \n\n   \n  “No one is the sole person responsible for school safety,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Parker did not breach professional standards or act with indifference, Klinger said, and it would have been difficult for anyone to foresee the incident.\n \n\n   \n  This case could set a precedent for future events, said Darryl K. Brown, a law professor at the University of Virginia, adding the civil trial could be a “dry run” for what’s to come in the criminal case.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone on both sides the prosecution and the defense should have a very clear idea of what the evidence is going to be and what the witnesses are going to say,” the professor said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/trump-republicans-messaging-2025-elections","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump Wants GOP to Focus More on Economic Achievements, But Often Changes the Subject","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is urging the Republican Party to focus more on economic achievements from his administration—such as new factory construction and job creation—as a way to counter the party’s recent electoral losses and regain public trust.

more on his economic achievements. But he’s often changing the subject. \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:19 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  spent the morning after a  terrible election night  for Republicans publicly processing the results, and arrived at several conclusions.\n \n\n   \n  First, he determined his party was losing the messaging battle over the now-record-length  government shutdown , and told GOP senators so in no uncertain terms over coffee and orange juice in the State Dining Room.\n \n\n   \n  Second, he adopted the view that any election where he’s not on the ballot will be a struggle for his party, notwithstanding the fact he’s unlikely to appear on a ballot ever again.\n \n\n   \n  And third, he deemed his party just too quiet about the economic accomplishments of his term so far, including how many new factories are being built or jobs being created.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell Republicans, you want to win elections, you got to talk about these facts,” he told a financial conference in Miami, where he flew after his breakfast session with senators. “You know, it’s really easy to win elections when you talk about the facts.”\n \n\n   \n  In determining Republicans have been insufficient in their promotion of his policy accomplishments, Trump arrived at the same conclusion many presidents before him have when confronted with stiff political headwinds. If only the people knew what he was doing, the thinking goes, the political blessings will follow.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t just happen. You have to tell them,” Trump said in his speech, sounding a little like Joe Biden bemoaning how no one understood his sweeping economic agenda or Barack Obama regretting not better explaining the Affordable Care Act.\n \n\n   \n  But it can often be Trump himself obscuring his policy achievements. Even in his speech Wednesday — billed as a “major economic address” on the one-year anniversary of his 2024 victory — Trump meandered well outside the economic realm.\n \n\n   \n  Among the topics touched on: transgender weightlifters, the teleprompter that  malfunctioned at the United Nations  six weeks ago, his decision to rename Denali to Mount McKinley, whether South Africa should remain a member of the G20, the liquid wealth held by Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States, and the time he worked a drive-thru window at McDonald’s during last year’s campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “I guess there’s something about McDonald’s, right?” he reflected.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, it was the election that took place 365 days ago that received far more time in Wednesday’s speech than the vote that occurred a day earlier. Trump was in a nostalgic mood, perhaps because the results this week were vastly more disappointing for the GOP than those a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  “On November 5, 2024, the American people reclaimed our government, we restored our sovereignty – we lost a little bit of sovereignty last night in New York, but we’ll take care of it,” Trump said at the start of his address, referring to the success of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. “Don’t worry about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump did test drive a new political construction that seems destined to reappear after the the democratic socialist’s victory.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a choice between communism and common sense,” he said. “Does that make sense to you?” In all, Trump said the words “communist” or “communism” 14 times in his speech, while naming Mamdani only once.\n \n\n   \n  Still, for all his barbed attacks on Democrats’ economic policies, Trump encouraging his fellow Republicans to focus more on the economy seemed an acknowledgment, however tacit, that the longtime edge he and the GOP have long held on economic matters has mostly disappeared.\n \n\n   \n  “They have this new word called affordability, and they don’t talk about it enough. The Democrats did. And the Democrats make it up – because we took over a mess. … As a Republican, you have to let people know that,” he told Fox News’ Bret Baier in an interview later Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Winning Democratic candidates in New Jersey, Virginia and New York all made the cost of living central to their campaigns, holding out Trump’s policies as a reason why things like groceries and electricity are becoming more expensive, despite his promises of an economic turnaround.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s aides have signaled that economic issues will be central for the president ahead of critical midterm elections that will determine the balance of power in Congress for the remainder of his term.\n \n\n   \n  “The president is very keyed into what’s going on, and he recognizes, like anybody, that it takes time to do an economic turnaround, but all the fundamentals are there, and I think you’ll see him be very, very focused on prices and cost of living,” James Blair, the political director for Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and now a deputy White House chief of staff, told Politico on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s first nine months, economic matters have not always been at the center of his agenda. He has spent an outsized amount of time on foreign affairs, sometimes meeting multiple world leaders at the White House per week and working to broker peace agreements (his count is seven or eight).\n \n\n   \n  He’s also been focused on his White House renovations, including during the shutdown, by tearing down the East Wing to make way for a 90,000 square-foot ballroom, renovating a guest bathroom in the residence and covering the Oval Office in gold fixtures. Trump often talks about his projects as major successes of his presidency so far.\n \n\n   \n  When he does discuss the economy, Trump can sometimes sound dismissive of ongoing cost-of-living concerns. He has insisted there is no inflation when there is. And he insists grocery prices are down when they’re up. And he’s  kept up his own travel and golf schedule  during a shutdown that’s snarled airline travel and slowed food stamp benefits for millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Denying economic realities that people are experiencing﻿ in their everyday lives is a political pitfall Democrats have been eager to seize upon, particularly as polls show Americans souring on Trump’s economic performance.\n \n\n   \n   A CNN survey  this week showed Americans broadly dissatisfied with the state of the country — 68% said things are going badly — and the economy, with 72% saying it’s in poor shape, and 47% calling the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the US. About 6 in 10 (61%) said Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the US.\n \n\n   \n  How much Trump can shift his economic messaging over the next year remains to be seen. What is clear is that his fellow Republicans, who mostly avoided pointing any fingers in Trump’s direction after Tuesday’s losses, will be relying on him and his political impulses to avoid another decisive defeat.\n \n\n   \n  “He is, in a very real sense, on the ballot. He’s fiercely committed to us winning. He is going to help,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said on the steps of the Capitol. He said he’d received assurances in private from Trump that he would take an active role in campaigning ahead of the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s offered to do rallies and the tele-town halls and all the things,” Johnson said, adding later: “He is very much engaged, very dialed in, and he understands the stakes. President Trump is on the ballot in 2026, and we’re looking forward to that contest.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/business/ups-crash-old-jet","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"18:54:00-05:00","title":"Why UPS was still flying the 34-year-old MD-11 plane that crashed","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the fatal crash of a 34-year-old McDonnell Douglas MD-11 freighter operated by UPS in Louisville, Kentucky, on November 5, 2025.

Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The UPS freighter that crashed in Louisville was a 34-year old jet. While that’s old for a passenger plane, that’s not so unusual in the world of air cargo.\n \n\n   \n  There are no initial indications that the age of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was in any way a factor in the  fatal crash  that killed at least 12 people shortly after take off from Louisville, Kentucky Tuesday evening. The cause is still under investigation and will be for some time.\n \n\n   \n  But the crash does highlight how planes, can have a much longer long lifespan than the average flyer realizes. That’s because older planes are often retired due to fuel economy, rather than wear-and-tear on the aircraft itself. If a plane isn’t flying as much, fuel economy isn’t as large a concern.\n \n\n   \n  And cargo jets fly about 30% less than passenger jets.\n \n\n   \n  The problem of fuel efficiency is especially true in the case of the MD-11, which has a third engine embedded in the tail, as opposed to the majority of passenger jets flying over American skies today, which only have two. The MD-11 was created in a time when companies sought out three-engine aircraft for range and reliability reasons, as planes with three engines were seen as safer than planes with only two, should an engine go out while flying over the open ocean.\n \n\n   \n  But as twin-engine jets became more reliable, that became less of an issue. The MD-11, with its three thirsty engines, became an anachronism almost as soon as it was introduced.\n \n\n   \n  Even before the crash, UPS had  announced plans  to phase out the MD-11 for more fuel efficient, newer freighters.\n \n\n   \n  UPS has 25 other MD-11s in service, according to data from aviation analytics firm Cirium, and another six that have been in storage for at least the last three months. FedEx, which has been phasing out its MD-11s, has 38 in service, and 34 in storage. And cargo carrier Western Global Airlines has four in service and 12 in storage.\n \n\n   \n  And while there are still MD-11’s flying cargo, the last passenger flight for the jet came more than a decade ago, on a KLM flight from Montreal to Amsterdam in October 2014.\n \n\n   \n  McDonnell Douglas ended up building only 200 of the jets, and took its last orders for the plane in 1998 from cargo carriers FedEx and Lufthansa Cargo. By then the company had already merged with Boeing. And it didn’t take long for most of the passenger versions of the MD-11 to be converted to freighters.\n \n\n   \n  The MD-11 that crashed was initially delivered to Thai Airlines the first year the plane was put into service in 1991. It was sold to UPS and converted to a freighter in 2006.\n \n\n   \n  At that point it essentially became a new airplane, undergoing a complete overhaul.\n \n\n   \n  Aircraft also undergo overhauls even if they continue in passenger service, being stripped down to their bare frames for inspections, maintenance and upgrades in what is known in the industry as a “D-check.”\n \n\n   \n  “An airliner is only as old, basically, as its last D-check,” aviation consultant Mike Boyd said Wednesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Boyd said there as a number of old passenger plane models still in use. American, Delta and United airlines each fly hundreds of planes models which have an average age of between 20 to 30 years, according to company reports. Southwest has more than 300 737-700s with an average age of 19 years.\n \n\n   \n  “At UPS, I would not be concerned about airplane age. The main issue for operators is increasing maintenance costs, which US carriers don’t take lightly, and fuel burn.”\n \n\n   \n  But despite those costs, the MD-11 has still found a useful life as cargo carriers, long after the production of the planes came to a halt and passengers airlines stopped flying them.\n \n\n   \n   – CNN’s Aaron Cooper contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/americas/mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-groping-incident-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"17:17:00Z","title":"Mexico’s President Sheinbaum Takes Legal Action After Groping Incident","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mexico’s first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has filed legal charges against a man who allegedly groped her in the Zócalo square of Mexico City during a public event.

November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Mexico’s President  Claudia Sheinbaum  is pressing charges against a man who she said was “drunk” and harassed her on Tuesday, calling the incident “an assault on all women.”\n \n\n   \n  The man was arrested overnight, according to Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada, and is in custody at the Sex Crimes Investigation Unit.\n \n\n   \n  The incident took place on Tuesday when a man broke through a crowd of people greeting  Sheinbaum  in Mexico City and appeared to grope her, according to viral footage of the incident.\n \n\n   \n  The  video showed  a man approach Sheinbaum. He appeared to touch her breast, and attempt to kiss her while bystanders in the central neighborhood of Zócalo watched. The incident ended when one of her top aides, Juan José Ramírez Mendoza, intervened.\n \n\n   \n  The episode has sparked outrage online and renewed a debate over harassment and the safety of women in public life.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico City police said preliminary findings link the individual to the alleged harassment of two other women that same day. CNN is attempting to determine if the man has legal representation to receive comment.\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum, who is Mexico’s first female president, announced Wednesday that she was motivated to take legal action against the man, who she described as “completely drunk.”\n \n\n   \n  “I decided to press charges because this is something I experienced as a woman — something all women in our country experience,” she said. “No man has the right to violate that space,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She added that this was not the first time she had experienced harassment. Throughout her career, Sheinbaum has been candid about the harassment she experienced in the past. In 2021, as Mexico City mayor,  she shared a video  for International Women’s Day in which she recalls being harassed on public transportation at the age of 12 and being harassed by a professor when she was a student.\n \n\n   \n    Security concerns\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s incident has raised questions about Sheinbaum’s security. It comes just days after the brutal assassination of Uruapan Mayor  Carlos Manzo  during a public event for the Day of the Dead, raising questions about the level of security scrutiny needed for public officials.\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum, like her predecessor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has chosen not to maintain a Presidential Guard,  which was dissolved in 2018 .\n \n\n   \n  Security analyst Raúl Benítez-Manaut told CNN en Español that the decision left a gap in high-level protection: “After the dissolution of the Presidential Guard, no specialized protection system was rebuilt. Sheinbaum relies on a small team of aides, not a professional perimeter security unit.”\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum defended her approach on Wednesday. “We can’t stay far from the people — that would deny who we are. Our aides will continue to accompany us, but we must remain close to citizens,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The Secretariat for Women, part of Sheinbaum’s administration, condemned the incident  on Tuesday , saying proximity to the public “cannot be used as an excuse to invade someone’s personal space or make physical contact without consent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, no woman is exempt from sexual harassment in our country,” the ministry said. “It’s crucial for men to understand that these acts are not only violent but criminal.”\n \n\n   \n  The office urged victims to report incidents rather than dismiss them.  “ These forms of violence must not be trivialized; denouncing them is fundamental to justice and cultural change,” it wrote.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A call to confront misogyny head-on’\n \n\n   \n  The incident involving Mexico’s head of state underscores a wider problem for women in public life.  The National Electoral Institute (INE) has recorded 516 recorded cases  of violence against women in political positions from September 2020 to July 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico City’s mayor echoed Sheinbaum’s own campaign message about women’s representation, saying the event shows why “being the first woman president is not just symbolic — it’s a call to confront misogyny head-on.”\n \n\n   \n  The occurrence on Tuesday points to a deep-rooted national problem. According to Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography’s (INEGI) 2021 national survey, 70.1% of Mexican women aged 15 and older have experienced at least one form of violence, with 49.1% of those women reporting sexual violence.\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum said Wednesday she will work with the Secretariat for Women to review whether harassment is criminalized in all Mexican states and launch a national campaign against harassment.\n \n\n   \n  “There must be respect for women in every sense,” she said. “Harassment is a crime — and it’s time everyone in this country understands that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/elections-reaction-midterms-republicans-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"16:57:00Z","title":"Warning signs for the GOP, lessons for Democrats: How Tuesday’s results will shape the 2026 midterms","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tuesday’s elections delivered a major victory for Democrats, with wins across a broad ideological spectrum, including progressive and moderate candidates in key states like New York, Virginia, and New Jersey.

      4:57 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democrats’ dominance  in Tuesday’s elections  reset expectations ahead of next year’s midterm battle for House and Senate control, reinvigorating a party that has been in the political wilderness and leaving Republicans lamenting that the gains President Donald Trump made a year ago with key portions of the electorate all but evaporated.\n \n\n   \n  “Last night, if that wasn’t a message to all Republicans, then we’ve got our head jammed in the ground,” said West Virginia GOP Sen. Jim Justice.\n \n\n   \n  The list of Democratic winners spanned the party’s ideological spectrum — from Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist elected mayor of New York City, to Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, the moderates with strong national security credentials elected governors of Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Their wins could rally Democrats in competitive House, Senate and governor’s races next year around a message all three made central to their campaigns, in different forms: pledges to reduce the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  But the playing field won’t be easy for Democrats. Strategists in both parties agree that control of the House will be in play, but the net effect of redistricting moves around the country — particularly if the  Supreme Court decides  to weaken the Voting Rights Act — could leave fewer competitive seats for Democrats. And the 2026 Senate map includes only a handful of GOP-held seats that appear to be in play and multiple seats Democrats will have to defend.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Tuesday’s results may embolden Democrats to continue their strategy in the  ongoing government shutdown,  while igniting new debates over what kinds of candidates can win, and where.\n \n\n   \n  Margie Omero, a Democratic pollster, said the elections should be viewed within the broader context of a year in which the party’s voters have packed town halls and rallies, won key races like the Wisconsin Supreme Court contest in the spring and a slew of special elections, and scored candidate recruitment victories for next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “Take the whole year into account and it tells a pretty similar story, which is that Democrats are motivated and Republicans are less motivated,” Omero said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, she said, “lost popularity and he’s lost altitude on all of his top issues, like the economy and immigration.”\n \n\n   \n  “Where does that leave his supporters in a midterm or off-year election?” Omero said. “What are they coming out for, if he’s less popular and his policies are less popular and his agenda’s less popular?”\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the wins in governor’s races and mayoral elections, and a critical victory in a statewide vote to green-light a redistricting effort to add five more seats that favor Democrats in California, the party also scored a long list of lower-profile victories on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  They broke the GOP’s supermajority in the Mississippi state Senate. They flipped two seats on Georgia’s Public Service Commission. They defeated a voter identification ballot initiative in Maine. Their incumbent Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices prevailed in retention votes.\n \n\n   \n  The results showed that many of the gains Trump had made in 2024 have evaporated. In New Jersey, Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli couldn’t match Trump’s support levels with Latino and Black voters. In Virginia, Spanberger notched the most impressive Democratic performance in recent years — besting the margins of the party’s last two presidential nominees and carrying a scandal-plagued nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, to victory on her coattails.\n \n\n   \n  For the GOP, the fallout could come in a number of forms — including altering the party’s push for redistricting to add winnable congressional seats in deep-red states, and changing how Republicans in competitive midterm races approach Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “The picture is pretty clear,” said Republican pollster Whit Ayres. “It is not a muddled message.”\n \n\n   \n  Ayres pointed to several lessons Republicans should take from Tuesday’s results. In Virginia and New Jersey, two states Trump lost in all three of his presidential runs, Republican gubernatorial candidates tied themselves to the president, a “losing strategy from the start,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans might also be inclined to rethink their strategy on redistricting, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Given the Democratic margins yesterday, about the last thing you want to do if you want to hold on to the House is weaken Republican incumbent House members, and that’s exactly what will happen if you’re trying to carve out more Republican districts,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Trump world deflects blame\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Trump and his top allies publicly downplayed the election results, with the president noting on social media that he wasn’t on the ballot. He partially blamed the ongoing federal government shutdown,  telling Republican lawmakers  in a closed-door session Wednesday morning that they are getting “killed” politically by the impasse, a source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Vice President JD Vance said that “it’s idiotic to overreact to a couple of elections in blue states.” But he also warned that the GOP needs “to do better at turning out voters than we have in the past.”\n \n\n   \n  “I said it in 2022, and I’ve said it repeatedly since: our coalition is ‘lower propensity’ and that means we have to do better at turning out voters than we have in the past,” Vance said Wednesday morning on X.\n \n\n   \n  Vance also urged Republicans to focus on affordability. He said the Trump administration “inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn’t built in a day.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump adviser Alex Bruesewitz called the election results a “great lesson for the Republican Party,” blaming the losing Virginia gubernatorial nominee, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for failing to excite Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement.\n \n\n   \n  “Your candidate needs to be able to turn out ALL FACTIONS of our party, and they do that by being MAGA all the way,” he  wrote on X .\n \n\n   \n  Though Tuesday’s GOP losses were wide-ranging, Republicans focused on elevating one Democratic winner: Mamdani, the 34-year-old Muslim and democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City.\n \n\n   \n  House Majority Leader Steve Scalise called Mamdani “the new leader of the Democrat Party.”\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is “apparently a socialist now,” since Jeffries endorsed Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n    Democratic ideological rifts remain\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York City emboldened the left wing of the Democratic Party. Usamah Andrabi, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, a group created to oust “corporate Democrats” and elect progressives, said Mamdani’s win marks a “turning point” for their movement and shows the importance of competitive races.\n \n\n   \n  One long-simmering debate Tuesday’s results didn’t settle is the ideological battle within the Democratic Party over the way forward, with a host of competitive House and Senate primaries just months away and the 2028 presidential primary already looming large.\n \n\n   \n  “Democratic primaries can and should be the battleground for the control of our party’s direction,” Andrabi said.\n \n\n   \n  However, in New Jersey and Virginia, the winning Democratic candidates are moderates with strong national security credentials. Spanberger, the Virginia governor-elect,  criticized Mamdani  in an interview with CNN just days before the election, suggesting his proposals aimed at reducing the cost of living will ultimately disappoint his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to settle,” said Omero, the Democratic pollster. “We’re able to have more moderate candidates in some places and more progressive candidates in some places. That feels like an important lesson.”\n \n\n   \n  One area where Democrats appeared broadly on the same page Wednesday is the ongoing government shutdown — fueled in part by Democrats’ demand that Republicans make concessions on health care funding in order to pass a measure that would fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy wrote on X that it is “not a coincidence these big wins came at the exact moment when Democrats are using our power to stand for something and be strong. A huge risk to not learn that lesson.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/us/new-jersey-terror-plot-probe-arrests","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00-05:00","title":"Two New Jersey Men Arrested in Terror Plot Probe on Heels of Michigan Arrests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two New Jersey men, Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, were arrested in a terror plot allegedly inspired by ISIS, following similar arrests in Michigan.

\nUpdated: \n        7:58 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two New Jersey men were arrested in a terror plot probe on the heels of  arrests in Michigan  in an alleged ISIS-inspired terrorist plot, said Alina Habba, acting US attorney for New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  The two men are said to have been part of the same online communication group as the ones who hatched the alleged plot in Michigan, a law enforcement official close to the investigation said Wednesday. The forum was not necessarily to discuss and participate in the same plot, but to discuss their own separate schemes, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  One suspect is charged with conspiring to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization, while the other is charged with transmitting violent antisemitic threats across the internet to people in New Jersey and beyond, said Habba.\n \n\n   \n  Using encrypted messaging applications, the suspects discussed “detailed travel plans,” including physical training, weapons such as firearms and improvised explosive devices, and methods to avoid law enforcement detection, Habba said.\n \n\n   \n  One of the suspects, a 19-year-old man from New Jersey, was taken into custody at Newark Liberty International Airport on Tuesday morning, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities had been monitoring his movements and arrested him once they noticed he moved up his flight to Turkey, the official said. The act of going to the airport was seen as a move to further his plot, triggering the arrest, the official said. Authorities routinely make these types of arrests after monitoring online chatter from targets they are zeroing in on, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The suspect ultimately planned to travel from Turkey to Syria, where he would attempt to join ISIS, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The second suspect, a 20-year-old New Jersey man who was arrested at his home, had planned to travel to Syria with the other suspect, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Habba said the two New Jersey suspects “pledged themselves to ISIS and were plotting acts of terrorism in our country.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI declined comment.\n \n\n   \n  The two men were scheduled to make their initial appearances in federal court in New Jersey on Wednesday, Habba said. “We will continue to move swiftly and decisively whenever terrorism or hate threatens our communities,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  A series of encrypted phone calls – secretly recorded by a confidential FBI source – tipped off federal agents that a group was allegedly planning to carry out a  terrorist attack  in Michigan on behalf of ISIS, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali, 20, and Majed Mahmoud, 20, were each charged with “receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  A third person, Ayob Nasser, 19, was arrested on the same charge Wednesday, the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.\n \n\n   \n  All three men also were each charged with conspiring to provide material support resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, according to an amended complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Nasser had viewed videos that depicted several mass shootings in the days leading up to Halloween, including the 2023 shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, and the 2022 shooting at Tops Supermarket in Buffalo, New York, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The complaint also alleges that Nasser and another individual made two separate trips to an amusement park that they appeared to be scouting as a possible attack location.\n \n\n   \n  The attorneys representing Ali and Mahmoud declined comment on Wednesday. CNN has reached out to Nasser’s attorney for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials have yet to charge a juvenile described throughout the complaint unsealed Monday as Person 1 in connection with the alleged plot.\n \n\n   \n  But the complaint details how agents doggedly surveilled the alleged co-conspirators for two months as they visited multiple gun ranges and held late-night meetings in local parks during what authorities allege was preparation for a possible terrorist attack.\n \n\n   \n  Then, based on what they believed to be references to a possible attack on Halloween, agents swooped in to seize the weapons and take Ali and Mahmoud into custody in the predawn hours of October 31.\n \n\n   \n  According to an FBI affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, the agency began surveilling a man, described as “co-conspirator 1,” in 2024 as he traveled in the US and overseas.\n \n\n   \n  In June, agents allegedly tracked the man’s phone to Dearborn, Michigan, and physical surveillance led them to Ali’s home there, where he stayed for two nights.\n \n\n   \n  The following month, according to the FBI, the man joined a group call from overseas with five others – including an FBI confidential source, who recorded the meeting. Person 1, Mahmoud and Ali do not appear to have been part of this call.\n \n\n   \n  During the call, the group allegedly discussed “traveling together to Syria to join ISIS” and co-conspirator 1 said they were “gonna die there … unless,” he told the group, “the Amir sends you to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  A review of co-conspirator 1’s cellphone allegedly revealed he had “Person 1’s phone number saved in his phone under ‘Athari’ and ALI’s phone number saved in his phone as ‘Bukhari.’”\n \n\n   \n  According to the complaint, one of the participants on the call also stated, “Athari and Bukhari said they were going to stay back and do the ‘same thing as France.’”\n \n\n   \n  “Knowing Athari, it’s (the attack) probably going to be at like a club, a disco,” co-conspirator 1 said, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The reference to Paris stood out to FBI counterterrorism experts. They concluded it was a thinly veiled nod to the coordinated ISIS-linked terrorist attacks that unfolded across Paris in  November 2015 . More than 130 people were killed in the attacks and scores more were wounded.\n \n\n   \n  After studying the call, the FBI concluded an attack could be imminent and began keeping close tabs on Ali and Mahmoud.\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of October 31, FBI agents descended on the Detroit suburb where the men lived and detonated smoke bombs before storming into their homes. Both Ali and Mahmoud were arrested.\n \n\n   \n  A detention hearing for them is scheduled for Monday.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/jared-golden-retirement-maine-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"16:47:00Z","title":"Maine Rep.

Jared Golden of Maine announced Wednesday that he would not seek reelection in 2026, putting pressure on his party to hold one of the toughest seats in the country for them next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t fear losing. What has become apparent to me is that I now dread the prospect of winning,” Golden wrote in  The Bangor Daily News . “Simply put, what I could accomplish in this increasingly unproductive Congress pales in comparison to what I could do in that time as a husband, a father and a son.”\n \n\n   \n  Golden’s decision robs Democrats of the advantage of incumbency in one of the country’s top battleground districts, which Golden won by less than 1 point last year while Trump carried it by roughly 10 points.\n \n\n   \n  The Marine veteran, who was first elected to Congress in 2018, has defended Maine’s sprawling, rural 2nd District as President Donald Trump has done well there. But even as Golden’s been key to bolstering numbers in the House Democratic Caucus, he’s long bucked party leadership in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Golden on Wednesday pointed to the record-breaking length of the government shutdown, writing that “the nonstop, hyperbolic accusations and recriminations by both sides reveal just how broken Congress has become.” His simmering frustration with party politics in Washington was apparent last month when he castigated members of his own party over the shutdown, which he wrote was “driven by demands, from some in the Democrats’ base and far-left groups, for the party to visibly ‘fight’ Donald Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Amid the backbiting, Golden drew a primary challenge from Maine state Auditor Matthew Dunlap, who criticized the moderate congressman for his series of high-profile breaks with Democrats since entering Congress in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  In announcing his retirement from Congress, Golden expressed skepticism about his challengers including Dunlap and former Republican Gov. Paul LePage.\n \n\n   \n  “My sincere hope is that by creating an open seat, my departure makes space for a competitive primary for both Democrats and Republicans, as Paul LePage and Matt Dunlap are a far cry from being standard bearers of the generations that will inherit the legacy of today’s Congress,” Golden said.\n \n\n   \n  The four-term congressman and father of young children also invoked recent high-profile episodes of political violence and threats against his own family in explaining his decision — including, he wrote, one that saw his family “sitting in a hotel room on Thanksgiving last year after yet another threat against our home.”\n \n\n   \n  Golden insisted the electoral challenge of defending his seat wasn’t part of his calculus.\n \n\n   \n  “I know that if I were to continue my campaign, I would prevail. My record of winning the most challenging district held by any Democrat — of outperforming the top and bottom of the ticket four times — speaks for itself,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Suzan DelBene praised Golden while pointing to Tuesday night’s election results as a hopeful sign for the party in the 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “His efforts to revitalize the Blue Dog Coalition have helped to grow our party, and his willingness to cross the aisle and find bipartisan solutions was deservedly rewarded time and time again by his constituents who continued to re-elect him despite bruising campaigns,” the Washington state Democrat said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “Last night’s election results make clear that voters are ready to elect a Democratic majority that keeps its promise to lower costs and fight for everyday people,” she added, committing “everything necessary” to keep Maine’s 2nd District blue.\n \n\n   \n  But Golden on Wednesday offered a warning to members of his party, whom he cautioned are “allowing the most extreme, pugilistic elements of our party to call the shots.”\n \n\n   \n  “This year, reeling from the losses of the last election, too many Democrats have given into demands that we use the same no-holds barred, obstructionary tactics as the GOP,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/middleeast/israel-hostage-body-wednesday-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"16:29:00Z","title":"Israel receives body said to be deceased hostage while gathering intel on longest-held remains","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has received a body believed to be that of a deceased hostage from Gaza, via the Red Cross, marking the third such transfer in a week.

to Brazil ahead of the  COP30 climate summit  to unveil the finalists of his prestigious Earthshot Prize – said young people needed to see climate “solutions” to give them hope for the future.\n \n\n   \n  “Climate anxiety is a real thing. I hear about it wherever I go now, lots of (the) younger generation are saying, ‘Well what kind of a planet are we going to inherit?’” the prince said Wednesday, at an event in Rio de Janeiro. “The younger generations need to be heard more.”\n \n\n   \n  William said he is glad that he can tell his children – Prince George, 12; Princess Charlotte, 10; and Prince Louis, 7 – that climate progress is being made, thanks in part to some of the work championed by the Earthshot Prize.\n \n\n   \n  “For my children particularly, knowing that the planet is going to be in a healthier, better state because of the brilliant people in this room, is something that I love to tell them when they go to bed: ‘It’s going to be great.

the first trillionaire – or prompt him to leave Tesla \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:22 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tesla shareholders could soon give CEO Elon Musk, already the wealthiest person on the planet, the chance to become the world’s first trillionaire – or risk him walking away entirely.\n \n\n   \n  Musk’s new pay package is the key measure that will be up for a vote at Tesla’s annual meeting Thursday afternoon. Shareholders have widely approved Musk’s pay packages in the past, but this year holds an added risk – the company warned in September that Musk “raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests” should it be denied.\n \n\n   \n  The compensation would come in the form of a stock grant that would give Musk as much as 423.7 million additional shares of Tesla stock over the next 10 years. Those shares would be worth about $1 trillion, assuming the company reaches the $8.5 trillion market cap needed to have Musk qualify for the full potential payout.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to increasing the Tesla’s market cap over this ten-year period, Tesla would also need to achieve a series of either operational or financial targets for him to get the full options.\n \n\n   \n  For Tesla to reach $8.5 trillion in market value, it would need an increase of 466% from today’s stock price. That’s also about 70% higher than the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia, which hit a record  $5 trillion market cap  last week.\n \n\n   \n  However the company has had rocky financial performance so far this year that saw sales and profits plunge in the first half of the year, and strong financial headwinds going forward from the loss of US government support for EV sales.\n \n\n   \n  But Musk and Tesla executives dismiss those problems, saying Tesla is shifting focus from merely selling electric vehicles to selling self-driving cars, including a fleet of “robotaxis,” as well as humanoid robots.\n \n\n   \n  Those products and concepts are still under development and haven’t gone on sale, however. So even if the pay package passes, it’s not certain that Musk will ever see any of its potential hundreds of millions of shares. He will need to straighten out the problems the company faces first, and start living up the big promises that he’s made for the future.\n \n\n   \n  But Musk, as well as some Wall Street analysts and investors, think that the company is on course to reach that $8.5 trillion target and beyond, by shifting focus from merely selling electric vehicles to selling self-driving cars as well as humanoid robots as well as rides in a fleet of “robotaxis.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Musk’s fans insist he is pivotal to the future, which makes them more certain the package needs to pass.\n \n\n   \n  “Shareholders are going to support this overwhelmingly, because Musk is the key asset for Tesla,” said Dan Ives, analyst for Wedbush Securities and one of the biggest Tesla bulls on Wall Street. “Tesla needs Musk to take it into the autonomous driving, robotic future.”\n \n\n   \n  Even those who don’t support Musk’s vision say they have little doubt the pay package will pass. In the most recent vote on his pay, 84% of shares were voted to approve the package.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it passes no matter what,” said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, who was an early major shareholder of Tesla, but is now a harsh critic of Musk and the company.\n \n\n   \n    $275 million a day\n \n\n   \n  Gerber describes some of the operational and financial targets tied to the pay package as “softball.” He also questions the size of the pay package, no matter how well the company and its stock price might do going forward.\n \n\n   \n  “So if you get a trillion dollars over 10 years, that’s $275 million a day,” he said,   calculating how much Musk would earn daily, on average, if the package pays off as planned.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t know in the world anybody thinks of that as fair to shareholders,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Numerous investment funds have already announced they’re voting against the package, including Norges Bank Investment Management, which is Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund. Some US public pension funds in California, New York, and elsewhere have also come out against the package and urged others to vote no. Some of those have voted no in the past.\n \n\n   \n  Influential advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS have also recommended that institutional investors vote against the package, arguing that the options that Musk could be granted would dilute shareholders’ stakes.\n \n\n   \n  “The performance targets included in the (Musk’s proposed pay package) are in many cases vague, undemanding, and subject to significant discretion by the board,” said Glass Lewis in a note that recommends voting against the package.\n \n\n   \n  Musk attacked both firms during Tesla’s recent investor call, calling them “corporate terrorists.” He added that their influence over some investor firms that hold shares and vote is the reason he needs a greater stake in the company.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” Musk said on the call. “There needs to be enough voting control to give (me) a strong influence – but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/takeaways-supreme-court-tariffs-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"15:12:00Z","title":"Takeaways from Trump’s Rocky Supreme Court Arguments Over Global Tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court held a pivotal hearing on President Donald Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose global tariffs, with justices—particularly Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh—expressing skepticism about the administration’s interpretation of 'regulate importation' as allowing broad tariff authority.

In case after case, the court has blessed the administration’s boundary-pushing policies on immigration, spending and independent agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the key takeaways from Wednesday’s arguments:\n \n\n   \n    Roberts and Barrett pile on fast\n \n\n   \n  The arguments were lengthy, but some signals about how the justices are thinking about the appeal were clear almost immediately.\n \n\n   \n  Roberts, who is  without a question a key vote , noted that the 1970s law the administration has relied on to levy the tariffs has never before been used for that purpose, and also pointed out that Congress has explicitly authorized presidents to raise tariffs in other laws  but did not do so in the law raised in the case.\n \n\n   \n  “Correct me on this if I’m not right about it,” Roberts said, but the justification is being used for “a power to impose tariffs on any product, from any country, in any amount, for any length of time.”\n \n\n   \n  At one point, Roberts said the basis for that claim “seemed to be misfit.”\n \n\n   \n   The International Emergency Economic Powers Act,  or IEEPA, gives a president power to “regulate … importation” during emergencies. US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate attorney, argued that word plainly includes the power to impose tariffs, since tariffs are the most common way a government regulates imports. But the businesses challenging the duties have balked at that reading of the law.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was Trump’s final nominee to the high court, also had questions on that point.\n \n\n   \n  “Can you point to any other place in the code – or any other time in history – where that phrase, together, ‘regulate importation’ has been used to confer tariff imposing authority,” Barrett said during one of the more important moments in the argument.\n \n\n   \n  Sauer reached for a case involving President Richard Nixon’s administration.\n \n\n   \n  Barrett quickly interrupted, framing that case as involving “an intermediate appellate court,” by which she meant: not the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n    Kavanaugh focuses on Nixon\n \n\n   \n  Justice Brett Kavanaugh emerged as perhaps the most important – and hardest to read – justice on the court Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s second nominee to the Supreme Court repeatedly returned to an argument the Trump administration raised about Nixon. In 1971, Nixon imposed a 10% tariff on all imports – which the administration later justified under the Trading with the Enemy Act, a precursor to IEEPA. Notably, that law used identical language to give the president authority to “regulate” imports.\n \n\n   \n  A federal court upheld Nixon’s tariffs, and Congress enacted IEEPA with the understanding that it had done so. Sauer’s argument is that if Congress had a problem with presidents imposing tariffs based on the “regulate” language, it would have adjusted those words when it enacted IEEPA.\n \n\n   \n  “President Nixon announced those tariffs in a nationwide prime-time speech, 10% across the board in August 1971, it was not some kind of little piece of paper, so it was well known,” Kavanaugh pressed Neal Katyal, the veteran Supreme Court attorney representing the small- and medium-sized businesses challenging the law.\n \n\n   \n  The question, Kavanaugh said of Congress, is “why didn’t they change the language? Why didn’t they say regulate but not tariffs?”\n \n\n   \n  Katyal noted that Nixon did not immediately rely on the precursor to IEEPA to impose those tariffs – only later, when the tariffs were challenged in court.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘mess’ of potential tariff refunds\n \n\n   \n  A significant question looming over the arguments was whether businesses would be entitled to tariff payment refunds if the justices rule against the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  The federal government has collected nearly $90 billion in revenue from the tariffs being challenged, according to United States Customs and Border Protection data as of September 23.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Trump said in an interview with Fox Business that if the Supreme Court ruled against him, “we’d have to pay back money.”\n \n\n   \n  Barrett asked Katyal how that process could work – a signal that she may have concerns with the practical implications of ruling against the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “Would it be a complete mess?” she asked.\n \n\n   \n  Katyal said the businesses he’s representing should undeniably be entitled to a refund if the justices rule in their favor, but for other businesses he said it would be “a very complicated thing.”\n \n\n   \n  “So, a mess,” Barrett interjected.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s difficult, absolutely, we don’t deny that,” Katyal responded.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Samuel Alito, another member of the court’s conservative bloc, seemed to suggest an appetite for resolving the refunds matter sooner rather than later since waiting would only increase the amount of tariff revenue collected and the complexity of it. While every lower court to consider the tariffs ruled against them, they allowed the duties to remain in place for now.\n \n\n   \n  Trade lawyers  previously told CNN  that the justices would likely be tasked with deciding who is entitled to a tariff refund if they rule against the president.\n \n\n   \n    Liberals pile on\n \n\n   \n  While several members of the court’s conservative supermajority gave mixed signals of how they may ultimately rule, the court’s three liberal justices made clear that they weren’t buying the arguments the Trump administration was attempting to sell.\n \n\n   \n  Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson were reliable foes of Trump’s arguments during the hearing, repeatedly pushing back on Sauer’s arguments in defense of the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  At one point, Jackson, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, said in a testy exchange with Sauer that Congress enacted the IEEPA in an effort to “constrain,” not expand, presidential power.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s pretty clear that Congress was trying to constrain the emergency powers of the president in IEEPA,” she said. “So it seems a little inconsistent to say that we have to interpret a statute that was designed to constrain presidential authority consistent with an understanding that Congress wanted the president to have essentially unlimited authority.”\n \n\n   \n  Kagan, meanwhile, seemed especially peeved by Trump’s repeated decision this year to declare emergencies to advance various controversial policies, including tariffs. Trump has said that trade imbalances and trafficking of fentanyl are the emergencies that justify the tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Though the emergencies Trump declared earlier this year to justify his sweeping tariffs were not directly at issue, Kagan noted that the administration has consistently argued in a variety of other cases that courts are powerless to review a president’s decisions around national emergencies.\n \n\n   \n  “And in fact, you know, we’ve had cases recently which deal with the president’s emergency powers,” said Kagan, nominated by former President Barack Obama. “And it turns out we’re in emergencies - everything all the time, about, like, half the world.”\n \n\n   \n    For consistency’s sake\n \n\n   \n  The case is about Trump, but Biden hung over the arguments from the start.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court was clear in several high-profile cases during Biden’s term that administrations can’t read broad authority into vague legal language. This became known as the “major questions doctrine,” or the idea that the administration must point to clear, specific language in the law when exercising policies that involve “major” political or economic questions.\n \n\n   \n  Two years ago, the court’s conservative majority relied on what’s known as the “major questions doctrine” to block  Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan . A year earlier, the court stopped Biden’s vaccine and testing requirement for 84 million Americans, concluding that Congress never explicitly gave the government the power to demand those measures during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Katyal, arguing for the businesses affected by the tariffs, repeatedly returned to the idea that the same doctrine should apply when it comes to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Didn’t we, in the Biden case, recently say an emergency can’t make clear what’s ambiguous?” asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor, an Obama nominee.\n \n\n   \n  Sauer parried with one of the administration’s central arguments: the major questions doctrine hasn’t been used before in the foreign policy context. Presidents, it is widely assumed, are due deference from the other branches of government when it comes to foreign affairs.\n \n\n   \n  “Counsel,” Sotomayor shot back. “We have never applied it to foreign affairs, but this is a tariff. This is a tax.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Austin Culpepper contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/mamdani-transition-team-nyc","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"16:25:00Z","title":"Zohran Mamdani Announces All-Female Leadership Team for NYC Transition Including Lina Khan","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has announced an all-female transition leadership team, including former FTC Chair Lina Khan, former deputy mayor Maria Torres-Springer, United Way head Grace Bonilla, former deputy mayor for health and human services Melanie Hartzog, and political consultant Elana Leopold.

Is it so bad that it’s good? \n       \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:13 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “All’s Fair,” the new  Ryan Murphy drama  starring Kim Kardashian, Niecy Nash and Naomi Watts on Hulu, is getting a ton of buzz. But buzz is not always a good thing.\n \n\n   \n  Or maybe it is? After all, 30 years have passed since the film “ Showgirls ” was loudly and frequently trashed upon its release. Now it’s hailed as  “insanely rewatchable”  and considered a prime example of the “so bad it’s good” category.\n \n\n   \n  We can’t rule out the idea that “All’s Fair” is actually bad on purpose. In the age of the hate-watch, the truly terrible and the seriously campy can do numbers.\n \n\n   \n  That view may be the only positive thought about the sleek-looking legal melodrama “All’s Fair,” which follows a female-led law firm that tries to give off all the girl-boss vibes.\n \n\n   \n  Released on November 4, the 10-episode series was immediately slammed by critics, clocking a flat  0%  on Rotten Tomatoes.\n \n\n   \n  The Times of London  gave the series a zero star review ,” describing the show as “preening Insta boasts” strung together “into a clumsy, haphazard whole.”  The Wrap  called it a “stock caricature from a man’s idea of a woman’s drama” and “a cavalcade of wigs and screeching in search of truth.” USA Today cut right to the point with  their story’s  headline: “Kim Kardashian’s ‘All’s Fair’ is the worst TV show of the year.”\n \n\n   \n  That Kardashian’s name is so prominent in the reviews is to be expected.\n \n\n   \n  While the reality star and Skims magnate had a role in Murphy’s FX series “American Horror Story: Delicate” in 2023, Kardashian definitely shows as the rookie opposite established actors like Glenn Close and Sarah Paulson.\n \n\n   \n  Murphy appears to have been fascinated by Kardashian long before she started starring in his projects.\n \n\n   \n  The first season of his “American Crime Story” anthology was 2016’s Emmy-winning “The People v. O. J. Simpson,” which starred David Schwimmer as her father, attorney Robert Kardashian, who represented Simpson in his 1995 murder trial.\n \n\n   \n  Murphy made sure to include the characters of Kim Kardashian and her sisters as youngsters growing up during the trial; in the show, they are seen watching their father on TV. The series’ showrunners, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski,  talked to Vanity Fair  at the time and explained the decision, saying they wanted to highlight the beginning of the 24-hour news cycle and the creation of reality TV, and how it might have “affected the future Kardashian empire.” When “all this media frenzy was going on, how would that affect you?” they asked. One way or another, Kardashian as an adult became the master of the medium.\n \n\n   \n  Murhpy’s fascination seems not to have successfully translated into a convincing big-budget Kardashian star vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Variety’s Alison Herman  noted in her review that “All’s Fair” reminds her “of nothing so much as another unscripted series shot in the Los Angeles area,” alluding to Kardashian’s reality show “The Kardashians,” which also airs on Hulu.\n \n\n   \n  “Kardashian doesn’t embarrass herself, because her role doesn’t ask much of her to begin with,” Herman wrote. Her character “exists to embody all the laziest stereotypes of what makes a strong woman” — like “getting revenge fillers and, in one particularly cringey fantasy sequence, donning a Beyoncé-esque yellow dress to go full ‘Lemonade’ on another woman’s car.”\n \n\n   \n  All these little Instagrammable moments — maybe that was Murphy’s game here all along, to build a camp classic for the modern moment? The shareable nuggets, the bling and opulence, plus the stunt casting of his reality show muse all suggest there’s something to that theory.\n \n\n   \n  Now it’s everyone’s turn to decide. So far, the reviews of nonprofessional watchers are mixed but tend to be far kinder. “It’s an ostentatious display of wealth and beauty and we love it,” wrote one commenter on Rotten Tomatoes. “Some scenes were🤨🙄 but it gives a goofy side. Entertaining like a soap opera.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/james-comey-justice-department-evidence","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"12:40:00-04:00","title":"Federal Judge Warns Justice Department It May Be Veering Close to Mishandling Evidence in Comey Case","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal judge, William Fitzpatrick, has raised serious concerns that the Justice Department is mishandling evidence in its criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey, who is accused of making a false statement to Congress about a leak investigation involving his lawyer Daniel Richman.

Five years on, archaeologists are spilling more of the monumental structure’s secrets.\n \n\n   \n  The artificial plateau made from earth, with connecting causeways, canals and corridors, was built in southeastern Mexico 3,050 years ago and used for around 300 years. Called Aguada Fénix, it forms the oldest and largest architectural site in the area occupied by the ancient Maya civilization — bigger than later Mesoamerican cities such as  Tikal  and  Teotihuacán  although without their distinctive stone pyramids.\n \n\n   \n  The design of the site was a representation of how the community conceived the universe, according to new research published Wednesday in the  journal Science Advances . The site features crosses of increasing sizes with a cruciform pit containing precious ritual artifacts at its center.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like a model of the cosmos or universe. They thought that basically the universe is ordered based on this cruciform pattern, and then that’s tied to the order of time,” said Takeshi Inomata, Regents Professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona and lead author of the study.\n \n\n   \n  The archaeological site was built during the beginnings of Maya civilization, which reached its height between AD 400 and 900, predominantly in modern-day Mexico and Guatemala. It was a time of development, with the construction of temples, roads, stone pyramids and other monuments, and developed complex systems of writing, mathematics and astronomy.\n \n\n   \n  “Before this site there’s no substantial construction. There’s really nothing archaeologically; they were not even using ceramics,” Inomata said.\n \n\n   \n  The team excavated several key places on the site, studied cores of soil and conducted an additional LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging, survey of the area. The remote sensing technique, which can produce detailed models of any terrain, has revolutionized archaeology in recent years, revealing ancient structures covered by vegetation and trees, particularly in Central America.\n \n\n   \n  The site is not immediately obvious on the ground, although the main platform would have once been almost 15 meters (50 feet) high, said Verónica Vazquez Lopez, a lecturer in Mesoamerican archaeology at University College London and coauthor of the study. The builders didn’t use stone, and it’s easy to confuse their creation with a natural hill, she added.\n \n\n   \n  “Most of the platform is used nowadays for agricultural activities,” she said. “It’s very subtle, and you don’t see it from the ground. That’s why it was only identified with LiDAR.”\n \n\n   \n    Ancient calendar\n \n\n   \n  The center of the site is a large, raised rectangular platform or plaza with room for more than 1,000 people to gather. It is situated at the intersection of two long thoroughfares — one that runs north to south and a second that runs east to west — which might have been used as processional routes.\n \n\n   \n  At the middle of the raised plaza, the archaeologists unearthed a cruciform-shaped pit that had stepped access from the platform above. Within it sat a smaller pit that contained a cache of jade artifacts, also arranged in the shape of a cross.\n \n\n   \n  “There we found pigments tied to specific directions, blue to the north, green to the east, yellow to the south. West, we don’t know, but there’s a red shell so it might be red,” Inomata said.\n \n\n   \n  The east-west axis of the monumental structure was aligned with the direction of the sunrise on October 17 and February 24, leading Inomata to think that the monument might have acted as a ritual site during important days of the Maya calendar year.\n \n\n   \n  “The interval is 130 days. That’s half of 260, and that’s the main ritual calendar of the Mesoamerican people,” he said. “These directions and this kind of order was important to them, and they put in an enormous amount work to represent it on the ground.”\n \n\n   \n  Inomata and his colleagues also believe that the site would have been built by willing participants, not compulsory labor used to construct many ancient wonders such as Egypt’s pyramids and later Maya cities. Their excavations revealed no signs of a social hierarchy, such as statues of specific individuals.\n \n\n   \n  “If you have a king or rulers, often in Mesoamerica that’s represented in sculpture or painting, and then usually you find big buildings or palaces where those powerful people lived. And we don’t have that at Aguada Fénix,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Inomata said the dwellings they have uncovered at the site suggest it wouldn’t have been permanently occupied by a large number of people and was perhaps used as a place to gather and worship in the dry season.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers estimated that more than 1,000 people would have been needed to build the site, spending a few months every year for several years. The canals and pond, which were aggregately 193,000 cubic meters in volume and appear to have no practical purpose, would have taken 255,000 days of labor by a single individual. The main plateau, which has a volume of 3.6 million cubic meters, would have required 10.8 million days of labor, the study reported. The canals did not appear to have been finished, Inomata added.\n \n\n   \n  “We have this perception that to do a big thing, you have to have hierarchical organization and that’s the way it happened in the past. But now we are getting an image of the past which is different,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “People also did big things by organizing themselves, getting together and working together,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The research was thrilling and of great interest to archaeologists everywhere, according to Stephen Houston, a professor of anthropology at Brown University in Rhode Island.\n \n\n   \n  “The finding here is that a common theme in Mesoamerican societies — situating the world according to ritual directions and colors attached to them — are laid out explicitly, and at an early date, at Aguada Fénix,” Houston said.\n \n\n   \n  “This research is part of a larger intellectual movement in archaeology, to show that large constructions can take place in situations of relative equality.”\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Scherer, a professor of archaeology and the ancient world, also at Brown, said the sheer size of the earthworks, their early age and the lack of a significant social hierarchy made the site particularly interesting.\n \n\n   \n  “There was a tremendous amount of labor invested at Aguada Fenix — in not only raising its earthworks but also in importing and carving a large number of greenstone objects — and in no instance is there a clear case of something built or manufactured to celebrate a ruler or a particular subset of individuals,” he said via email.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a time period that remains poorly understood in the history of Mesoamerica and so the latest finds reported by … (the) team are of utmost importance in making sense of this murky time period.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/business/detroit-bankruptcy-jpmorgan-rocket-mortgage","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"16:03:00Z","title":"Detroit Is Back from the Dead — But Not Everyone Is Feeling It","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Detroit, once a symbol of American industrial power and now a city that filed for bankruptcy in 2013, is experiencing a remarkable economic revival.

back from the dead. But not everyone is feeling it \n       \n  By Nathaniel Meyersohn, Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:03 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Hudson’s Detroit, the Motor City’s first new skyscraper in nearly half a century, is a symbol of Detroit’s transformation from bankruptcy to boomtown.\n \n\n   \n  The $1.4 billion project includes a recently opened office building as well as retail on the site of the former J.L. Hudson’s department store and a skyscraper that will eventually feature high-end condos and a five-star hotel.\n \n\n   \n  Detroit “was probably at the bottom of the barrel in this country – from crime and unemployment to everything in between,” Dan Gilbert, the billionaire who has helped catalyze Detroit’s revival, said in an interview with CNN. “It’s been a 180-degree comeback.” Gilbert’s real estate company developed the complex at the former Hudson’s, a shopping mecca for generations that closed in 1983.\n \n\n   \n  Detroit’s population is  growing for the first time in nearly 60 years . General Motors is moving its headquarters to Hudson’s. JPMorgan is moving there too, having announced a big push to invest $100 million in the city more than a decade ago. On Wednesday, JPMorgan said its investment in Detroit had surpassed $2 billion.\n \n\n   \n  But Detroit’s improbable comeback remains incomplete. Its downtown has made a remarkable recovery from the city’s 2013 bankruptcy – the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history. Meanwhile, some parts of the city have been left behind. Others are still vacant.\n \n\n   \n    Detroit’s rise and fall\n \n\n   \n  Detroit was once the fourth-largest city in the country, home to America’s automobile industry. In 1950, Detroit’s population topped 1.8 million.\n \n\n   \n  By 2013, Detroit’s population had fallen to 700,000.\n \n\n   \n  Numerous factors  hurt Detroit  over many years, including a shrinking tax base, high unemployment and poverty, and rising health care and pension costs for city employees. Detroit’s reliance on the auto industry hurt the city as free trade agreements, automation and incentives from southern states sent jobs away.\n \n\n   \n  People with resources also left Detroit for the suburbs. Detroit’s population  declined  roughly 28% between 2000 and 2015, while the population in the surrounding six counties grew 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Detroit’s financial woes led to steep cuts in basic city services like trash pickup and snow plowing. An estimated 40% of street lights were  not functioning  by the time Detroit filed for bankruptcy in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  During the financial crisis in 2009, Detroit’s unemployment rate  skyrocketed to 29%  as the auto industry teetered on the brink of collapse. The average price of a home in Detroit stood at just $7,500.\n \n\n   \n  In bankruptcy, the state took over control of local government, and a state-appointed manager oversaw city spending and operations. Detroit shed $7 billion in debt and thousands of retired city workers were forced to take pension cuts.\n \n\n   \n  The city exited bankruptcy after a year and has rebounded over the past decade, thanks in part to investments from JPMorgan, Gilbert’s Bedrock and other companies and philanthropic organizations.\n \n\n   \n    Downtown vs. neighborhoods\n \n\n   \n  Gilbert, the co-founder of Rocket Mortgage and owner of the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers, went all-in on Detroit when many left the city for dead.\n \n\n   \n  After moving his mortgage lender’s offices downtown, Gilbert went on to buy more than 100 downtown properties, spending $7 billion along the way.\n \n\n   \n  “We certainly jump-started it,” Gilbert said. “A lot of businesses followed from suburbs and other parts of the country.”\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan, which had a long-standing relationship with Detroit, later stepped up its investment in the city in what has become a model for corporate investment in underserved communities.\n \n\n   \n  Leveraging data and research, JPMorgan’s  years-long effort  has helped tens of thousands of Detroiters get apprenticeships or jobs, led to the creation of preservation of thousands of affordable housing units and provided aid to countless small businesses, according to the bank. In 2021, JPMorgan opened one of its first community branches in  Corktown , Detroit’s oldest neighborhood. The following year, JPMorgan launched a  virtual call center  in Detroit.\n \n\n   \n  In January, General Motors is scheduled to move its global headquarters to Hudson’s Detroit. The move comes 16 years after the bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler that intensified Detroit’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  “GM and the Detroit’s DNA are interwoven. The two things just go together,” said Dave Massaron, GM’s vice president of infrastructure and corporate citizenship. “The city is on an upward trajectory for the first time in my lifetime. It’s a great time to be here.”\n \n\n   \n  But Peter Hammer, a law professor at Wayne State University, said that corporate and philanthropic investments have been concentrated downtown and have not done enough to help the neighborhoods that need it most.\n \n\n   \n  A report  last year  commissioned by the Detroit City Council that private investments downtown “have not lifted the city to share in any levels of prosperity.”\n \n\n   \n  The city has experienced an influx of White, Hispanic and Asian residents over the last decade. But Detroit, long a majority Black city, has seen its Black population has decline. Since 2013, the largest loss in population has been among Black residents, with 72,000 fewer over that span.\n \n\n   \n  The median income in Detroit is $38,000, half the median income of its broader region. Only 26% of Detroit’s households are middle class, compared to 39% in the region. And 18 out of Detroit’s 139 square miles of land are still vacant, according to  Detroit Future City , a nonprofit organization.\n \n\n   \n  High-paying jobs are often held by people who live in the suburbs and commute into Detroit — while the salaries of Detroit residents, regardless of where they work, are  lower . Nearly 70% of Detroit-resident workers traveled outside the city for jobs.\n \n\n   \n  “Overall, we have seen fairly widespread increases in both housing wealth and income,” said Sam Stragand of the Detroit Partnership on Economic Mobility at the University of Michigan’s Poverty Solutions. “There are still pockets of the city with little activity in the mortgage market” and lagging areas in housing wealth, home repairs and high vacancies.\n \n\n   \n    New mayor\n \n\n   \n  Hudson’s opens at a moment of major change in Detroit. The city will have a new mayor for the first time since it filed for bankruptcy.\n \n\n   \n   Mike Duggan , who was elected mayor in 2013 as a write-in candidate and was the first White mayor in a city that was 80% Black, stepped down after three terms to run for governor of Michigan as an independent.\n \n\n   \n  “I ran and said, ‘we’re going to end this Black versus White, city versus suburban politics that had taken Detroit down for years.’ And the people of Detroit voted for me and expected me to do that,” Duggan said in an interview Wednesday with CNN’s Erin Burnett and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\n \n\n   \n  Detroit has passed 11 consecutive balanced budgets under Duggan, who has won praise from business leaders like Dimon.\n \n\n   \n  Duggan “got everyone to work and help lift up (Detroit) with good collaboration, good policy,” Dimon said.\n \n\n   \n  Mary Sheffield, president of the City Council,  won the mayoral election  Tuesday to succeed Duggan, making history as the first woman to lead the city. She has been a strong ally of Duggan’s and ran on a platform of expanding the city’s economic recovery.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a really critical moment for Detroit to make sure we can sustain the momentum we are on,” said Ashley Williams Clark, vice president of Detroit Future City. “We need to ensure that growth is not just in real estate and physical development, but paychecks and increased home ownership rates.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/entertainment/jimmy-kimmel-food-insecurity","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"13:48:00-05:00","title":"Jimmy Kimmel Leading Celebs in Addressing Food Insecurity","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to a government shutdown that led to a partial cut of SNAP benefits, celebrities and public figures like Jimmy Kimmel, Keith Lee, and Wanda Sykes have mobilized to combat rising food insecurity.

election \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:39 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Americans  cast ballots  at polling places across the country on Tuesday, which means we have a bunch of data on voters voting — rather than just pre-election polls of a hypothetical electorate.\n \n\n   \n  So what did we learn from that data?\n \n\n   \n  Here are some of the most striking statistics.\n \n\n   \n   68%-31%:  Democratic New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s advantage among Latino voters, according to  CNN’s exit poll , which combines pre-election interviews with those conducted at polling places (Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger won this demographic by a similar margin.) President Donald Trump had significantly closed the gap with Latino voters in the 2024 election, winning 46% of them nationally. But Tuesday’s results — albeit in states that Trump lost last year — appear much more in line with how this demographic previously voted.\n \n\n   \n   17 and 14 points:  Spanberger’s and Sherrill’s respective advantages among young men under the age of 30. Trump had also made big gains nationally with this demographic in 2024, when young male voters were close to evenly split.\n \n\n   \n   1961:  The last time Democrats won a Virginia governor’s race by more than Spanberger’s current 15-point margin.\n \n\n   \n   1965:  The last time New Jersey elected the same party to the governor’s mansion in three straight elections. Sherrill will succeed two-term Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n \n\n   \n   78%, 82%:  Spanberger’s and Sherrill’s respective vote shares among voters who disliked both major political parties. Some Democrats fear that their party’s historic unpopularity will hurt their ability to win anti-Trump voters. At least on Tuesday, though, the so-called “ double-haters ” swung hard for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n   2006:  The last time Democrats won a non-federal statewide race in Georgia, before they  won a pair of Public Service Commission races  on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n   26 points:  The margin by which Democrats won each of those races, defeating a pair of GOP incumbents.\n \n\n   \n   41%:  The percentage of Virginia voters who said Democratic Attorney General-elect Jay Jones’  violent text messages  were “disqualifying.”\n \n\n   \n   9%:  The percentage of those voters who voted for Jones anyway.\n \n\n   \n   50%:  The percentage of Virginia voters who agreed that support for transgender rights in society has “gone too far.” Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears made trans issues a huge focal point of her attacks on Spanberger.\n \n\n   \n   23%:  The percentage of those voters who voted for Spanberger anyway.\n \n\n   \n   320,000:  The difference between Spanberger’s current raw vote total (about 1.92 million) and 2021 Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe’s raw vote total (about 1.6 million). About 20% more people turned out to vote for her than voted for McAuliffe four years ago.\n \n\n   \n   50.4%:  New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s current vote share, with about 91% of the vote counted. Getting a majority would put to rest any talk about Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa having been a “spoiler” in the race with former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent.\n \n\n   \n   73%:  The percentage of GOP voters in that New York race who voted for Cuomo — whom Republicans, including Trump, wound up rallying around as a Mamdani alternative.\n \n\n   \n   32%:  The percentage of Jewish voters who voted for Mamdani, who will become New York City’s first Muslim mayor. Trump on Tuesday called any Jewish people who voted for Mamdani “stupid.”\n \n\n   \n   13%:  The percentage of California  Republican voters  who voted for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ballot measure to allow the state government to draw more Democratic congressional districts. Newsom launched the effort to retaliate against Texas Republicans’ move to draw more GOP districts in that state. And his argument that this tit-for-tat move was warranted clearly proved compelling to voters, given it’s currently passing 64%-36%.\n \n\n   \n   7%, 13% and 16%:  The percentages of voters in California, New Jersey and Virginia, respectively, who said their vote was meant to support Trump. In each case, many more voters said their vote was meant to oppose Trump: 52% in California, 41% in New Jersey and 38% in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with updated exit poll numbers.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/fact-check-trump-groceries-identification","dateOfPublication":"1216-11-05","timeOfPublication":"12:16:00-05:00","title":"Trump revives his false claim that Americans have to show ID to buy groceries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has revived a false claim from his 2018 and 2019 campaigns, asserting that Americans must show identification to buy groceries or fuel, despite no evidence supporting such a requirement.

But he said it again  in 2023  as he ran for president, then said it once more on Wednesday morning while baselessly questioning the legitimacy of US elections in the wake of  Republican defeats in various state and local elections  the day prior.\n \n\n   \n  “All we want is voter ID. You go to a grocery store, you have to give ID. You go to a gas station, you give ID,” Trump  said  Wednesday at a breakfast with Republican senators.\n \n\n   \n  Americans obviously do not need to provide identification to buy groceries or gas.\n \n\n   \n  Grocery stores generally require identification for purchases of alcohol or tobacco, purchases of  certain medications  and for the small percentage of purchases made by personal check. Stores may occasionally ask for ID under other circumstances.\n \n\n   \n  But these are exceptions rather than the rule. Contrary to Trump’s claims, Americans generally buy groceries without ever having to tell anyone who they are. Similarly, millions of Americans every day buy gas without ever showing identification; many of them do not even interact with a person while paying at the pump.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, when Trump’s then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about Trump’s initial false claim that photo identification was needed to buy groceries, she  suggested  he was referring specifically to purchases of beer or wine.\n \n\n   \n  But he soon made clear he was actually talking about food, specifically mentioning “a box of cereal” in an  interview  three months later. In 2023, he falsely  claimed  identification was needed “if you buy a loaf of bread.”\n \n\n   \n    Trump repeats other false claims about elections\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Trump  repeated  his false claim that “if you have mail-in ballots,” an election is “automatically corrupt.”\n \n\n   \n  It simply isn’t. Mail-in voting is a legitimate method used by legitimate voters to cast legitimate ballots. Elections experts  say  the incidence of fraud tends to be marginally higher with mail-in ballots than with in-person ballots – but also that fraud rates in major US elections are tiny even with mail-in ballots. There is no evidence that the elections held Tuesday were anything other than free and fair.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also repeated his false claim that a commission led by former President Jimmy Carter “said about mail-in ballots: ‘If there is mail-in ballots, there will definitely be corruption.’”\n \n\n   \n  That’s not what Carter or the commission said. Trump has  repeatedly misstated  the commission’s conclusions.\n \n\n   \n  It’s true that the commission Carter co-chaired two decades ago was generally skeptical of voting by mail. Its 2005 report  said  that “absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud” and are “vulnerable to abuse in several ways.”\n \n\n   \n  But the report did not say that “there will definitely be corruption” in elections where mail-in ballots are used. In fact, the report highlighted an example of successful mail-only elections, saying that Oregon, a state that has been conducting elections exclusively by mail-in  voting since the late 1990s , “appears to have avoided significant fraud in its vote-by-mail elections by introducing safeguards to protect ballot integrity, including signature verification.”\n \n\n   \n  The report also offered some recommendations for making the use of mail-in ballots more secure and called for “further research on the pros and cons” of voting by mail.\n \n\n   \n  Carter, who died in 2024,  said  in a 2020 statement: “I approve the use of absentee ballots and have been using them for more than five years.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/obesity-drugs-trump-pharmaceutical-companies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"12:23:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump Administration Nears Deals with Pharmaceutical Companies to Offer Obesity Drugs for $149 a Month","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is nearing agreements with pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to offer obesity drugs like Wegovy, Zepbound, and Ozempic at as low as $149 per month, a dramatic reduction from their current list prices of $1,000 to $1,350.

The list price of the drugs range from roughly $1,000 to $1,350, though the price consumers pay depends on their insurance and on discounts.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump is expected to announce the deals as soon as Thursday, though the people familiar with the negotiations cautioned that they are not finalized and that officials are still working through key policy details.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that “discussion about deals that have not been officially announced by the administration should be regarded as speculation.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday declined to confirm the planned announcement, but said a deal that cuts the cost of the obesity drugs was “something that the administration has been engaged and looking into.”\n \n\n   \n  The negotiations over Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk’s obesity drugs represent perhaps the highest-profile element of a broader White House push to cut drug prices by striking individual deals with pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n \n\n   \n  The “Most Favored Nation” initiative has so far resulted in agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and other companies to sell certain products directly to consumers at a reduced price — often in exchange for relief from the threat of targeted tariffs.  Eli Lilly  and  Novo Nordisk  already provide their weight loss drugs at a discount directly to consumers who pay cash.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has fixated in particular on striking a deal for GLP-1 medications that have exploded in popularity in recent years for helping with weight loss and a range of chronic conditions. The president has referred to them in both public and private as the “fat-loss drug.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to be paying, instead of $1,300, you’ll be paying about $150,” Trump said of the GLP-1 drugs during a mid-October event highlighting a separate drug price deal, prompting US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Mehmet Oz to jump in and emphasize that the negotiations were still ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  Endpoints News first  reported  that deals were approaching the finish line.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear exactly which of the companies’ drugs will be sold for $149 and whether there will be restrictions on consumers’ access to them. The deals are related to a pilot program that CMS is in the final stages of developing aimed at capping the cost of the obesity drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries, one of the people familiar with the negotiations said.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been in dialogue with President Trump’s administration for a long time now, and our aim is exactly the same: provide affordable access to as many people as possible,” said Mike Doustdar, Novo Nordisk’s chief executive, in an interview with CNN Wednesday morning after the company reported quarterly earnings. “Hopefully we’ll be able to solve the solution where there is better access than today.”\n \n\n   \n  Doustdar noted the negotiations are ongoing, and didn’t comment on any specific details. He said the company’s  cash-pay  option for Ozempic and Wegovy, at $499 a month for patients outside of insurance, is “the channel that’s right now growing the most.” Lilly also offers cash-pay  options  for its weight-loss drug Zepbound that start at $349 a month.\n \n\n   \n  Weight-loss drugs, Doustdar added, increasingly resemble a consumer market – one more driven by new product updates that he compared to iPhones, rather than a more traditional pharmaceutical market like for insulin, where patients find a version that works for them and usually go through insurance.\n \n\n   \n  “Within obesity care, we have seen that patients – customers – get excited about that next best thing,” Doustdar said.\n \n\n   \n  The expected deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk follow a yearslong debate on both sides of the aisle over whether Medicare and Medicaid should cover the pricey drugs. The Biden administration last year officially proposed expanding coverage of them, though the plan was not finalized before Trump took office. The Trump administration said in April that it was  halting  the proposal but left the door open to consider future policy options for covering the drugs.\n \n\n   \n  Also, notably, Ozempic and Wegovy were selected in January for second round of  Medicare drug price negotiations , which is expected to result in savings for the program and, possibly, for enrollees depending on their drug coverage.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., vehemently opposed efforts to make the medications more accessible, telling Fox News  ahead of last November’s election  that Novo Nordisk — which makes Ozempic — was “counting on selling it to Americans because we are so stupid and so addicted to drugs.” But since joining the administration, he has struck a far more accommodating tone, expressing openness to patients using them if prior efforts to improve their health have failed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/spanberger-sherrill-roommates-similar-paths-to-office","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:23:00-05:00","title":"Spanberger and Sherrill Make History as First Female Governors of Virginia and New Jersey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, former roommates and centrist Democratic congresswomen, have made history by becoming the first female governors of Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.

They’re now making history in their states \n       \n  By Arit John, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:23 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Six years ago,  Abigail Spanberger  and  Mikie Sherrill  were roommates and freshman members of Congress, part of a record-breaking wave of women who helped Democrats win back the US House.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the two made history once more. CNN projected that Spanberger will be Virginia’s first female governor and Sherrill will be the first Democratic woman elected as governor of New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Their wins come at a time when Democrats are navigating difficult questions over who the next leaders of the party should be and what messages will work to win over voters who shifted toward President Donald Trump last year.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger and Sherrill’s victories offer at least one path forward for Democrats. Both ran aggressively on affordability issues and promises to lower health care, housing and utility costs. It appears to have resonated with voters: Spanberger and Sherrill both surpassed the total number of votes their predecessors won in 2021 before votes were fully tallied in their states.\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight we sent a message,” Spanberger told supporters at her election night rally. “We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, a former CIA officer, and Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot, both won Republican-held seats in 2018 by running as national security-minded centrists. In Congress, they – along with Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and former Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia – formed the Mod Squad, a more centrist version of the progressive Squad.\n \n\n   \n  Years after they ran and won their first races, the two newest members of the Democratic Governors Association will enter this next phase of their careers side-by-side as well. Spanberger described the feeling of running in one of this year’s few competitive races alongside her friend as “amusing.”\n \n\n   \n  “Being able to compare notes has been fun,” she told CNN recently. “But I think what I’m most excited about is just — I know what I’m about to say sounds cheesy, but I mean it sincerely — how hardworking she is … I think there will be some really interesting value in thinking through different issues or different challenges because we’re aligned in many places, but we get to the same place from different directions.”\n \n\n   \n  The two attempted to call and congratulate each other Tuesday night, Sherrill told CNN’s John Berman Wednesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “I actually ended up calling her when she was on the stage giving her acceptance speech,” Sherrill said. “Then she called me when I happened to be on the stage giving my acceptance speech. So we’ve texted, but we owe each other a good call.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, 46, and Sherrill, 53, moved in with each other after growing tired of living on Capitol Hill on their own. The pair ate dinner off Sherrill’s gold-rimmed wedding china and sat on a two-decade-old couch Spanberger brought out of storage,  they told the Washington Post last year .\n \n\n   \n  They’re both eldest of three girls. They both have multiple children – Spanberger has three kids, Sherrill has four. The Virginia governor-elect was born in New Jersey, while the incoming New Jersey governor grew up in northern Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think either of us thought we were going to run for office until in 2018 we felt called to serve again and have been in it ever since,”  Sherrill told CNN last month .\n \n\n   \n  During a campaign event this summer, Spanberger told reporters they were both eager to meet voters across their districts when they challenged longtime incumbent Republicans in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “I maintain my friendship with her, so I know a bit about what she’s been doing across the campaign trail, and she’s been traveling everywhere in New Jersey,” Spanberger said. “The common thread is that we’re relentlessly focused on the issues that people across our communities bring to us.”\n \n\n   \n  After their races were called, the two governors-elect also reflected on the historic nature of their wins. Sherrill mentioned “the little girls who come up to me and say they’re going to be a governor, or they’re going to be a president.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger noted that her husband had told their three daughters minutes earlier that their mother would be the state’s next governor.\n \n\n   \n  “And I can guarantee that those words have never been spoken in Virginia ever before,” she said. “The history Virginia is making tonight is yours.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/europe/putin-nuclear-weapons-test-russia-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00-05:00","title":"Putin floats the possibility of fresh nuclear tests following Trump comments","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following Donald Trump’s announcement that the US would begin nuclear testing in response to global developments, Russian President Vladimir Putin has floated the possibility of Russia conducting its own nuclear tests, asserting that such a move would be ‘proportional and appropriate’ if the US or other CTBT signatories initiate testing.

\nUpdated: \n        11:00 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin says his country will explore the possibility of carrying out fresh nuclear tests after US President Donald Trump  said last week  that Washington would begin nuclear testing programs.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia has always strictly adhered and continues to adhere to its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), and we have no plans to deviate from these commitments,” Putin said at a meeting with members of Russia’s Security Council Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, however, should the US or other countries who are  signatories of the CTBT  begin to conduct nuclear weapons tests, “Russia would also have to take appropriate and proportionate responsive measures,” Putin added.\n \n\n   \n  The Russian leader said he had asked government ministries and other agencies to “submit coordinated proposals regarding the possible commencement of work to prepare for nuclear weapons testing.”\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stressed that nothing had been decided yet.\n \n\n   \n  “We are just investigating whether it is necessary to start preparations,” he told CNN. “We are still bound by our obligations on the overall ban of nuclear tests.”\n \n\n   \n  Last week, Putin  caused shockwaves  when he announced that his country had successfully tested an experimental nuclear-powered underwater torpedo called the Poseidon, which military analysts suggest may have a range of more than 6,000 miles (9,650 kilometers).\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, Trump took to social media to announce that, “because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  Neither Russia nor the US have tested nuclear weapons since the 1990s, and are both signatories of the CTBT, which bans all nuclear test explosions, no matter their purpose.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s last nuclear weapons test was in October 1990, after which it pledged to uphold a moratorium on this testing, according to the nonprofit  Nuclear Threat Initiative  (NTI). The US has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1992,  the NTI said. \n \n\n   \n  Russia’s defense minister Andrey Belousov said Wednesday that, even without Trump’s latest announcement on nuclear weapons testing, it was clear to him that the US is “actively increasing its strategic offensive capabilities.”\n \n\n   \n  “We must, of course, focus not only – or even primarily – on statements and remarks made by American politicians and officials, but above all on the actual actions of the United States of America,” he told the Security Council, citing the US’ withdrawal from several arms limitation agreements, as well as its reported development of a number of weapons, as proof of this.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s nuclear deterrent must be prepared to face any threat, Belousov said, pointing out that his country’s central test site Novaya Zemlya is ready for any nuclear tests.\n \n\n   \n  Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s chief of the general staff, told Wednesday’s Security Council meeting that the US had “not provided official explanations” regarding Trump’s statement last week, which means that Russia has “no reason to believe that the United States will refrain from preparing for, and subsequently conducting, such tests in the near future.”\n \n\n   \n  “The American side may continue to avoid giving official explanations, but this changes nothing, because if we do not take appropriate measures now, time and opportunities for timely response to US actions will be lost,” he said, noting that the preparation period for nuclear tests can range “from several months to several years.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/economy/us-jobs-private-sector-adp-october","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:06:00-05:00","title":"US Economy Adds 42,000 Private-Sector Jobs in October, Amid Data Gaps and Concerns Over Consumer Demand","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, the US private sector added 42,000 jobs, a recovery after two consecutive months of job losses, according to ADP’s payroll estimates.

snapshot of the labor market that has become more closely watched in the  absence of official federal jobs data .\n \n\n   \n  Payroll processing company ADP on Wednesday estimated that private-sector businesses added an estimated 42,000 jobs last month, a swing into positive territory after back-to-back months of job losses.\n \n\n   \n  While October marked a return to job growth, ADP’s chief economist cautioned that the pace of hiring is running far slower than earlier this year and far more concentrated in a few sectors.\n \n\n   \n  “That recovery is tepid, and it is not broad-based,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said during a call with reporters on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n    Where jobs were gained and lost\n \n\n   \n  The largest job gains were spread across industries such as trade, transportation and utilities (+47,000 jobs); education and health services (+26,000); and financial activities (+11,000), ADP reported.\n \n\n   \n  Those posting the biggest job losses were information (17,000 jobs lost), professional and business services (15,000 jobs lost), and leisure and hospitality (6,000 jobs lost).\n \n\n   \n  “The most concerning trend would be that drop in leisure and hospitality, because that points swiftly back to the consumer and how healthy and resilient the consumer will be,” Richardson said. “In the last three months of the year, we’ve seen consumer resiliency push up employment in that sector, so this negative number is something to watch as we go into the holiday season.”\n \n\n   \n  Richardson also flagged that hiring softness among small businesses could be another concerning sign as to the health of the economy, noting smaller companies’ outsized share of employment.\n \n\n   \n    A rebound after back-to-back losses\n \n\n   \n  ADP’s monthly tally has shown a significant slowdown in the job market since the summer, with net losses for September and August. Following revisions released Wednesday, there weren’t as many jobs shed in September as ADP initially estimated. September’s losses now sit at 29,000 jobs (versus a 32,000-job loss) and 3,000 positions were shed in August.\n \n\n   \n  Still, a bounce-back was expected for October. Last week, ADP launched a weekly “pulse” report of employment estimates. That report showed that private employers added an average of 14,250 jobs per week during the four weeks that ended October 11.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s job gains came in stronger than the 37,500 jobs added that economists expected, according to FactSet.\n \n\n   \n  The pulse report was launched to “meet the moment,” Richardson said, noting the federal government shutdown’s resulting black hole of employment and other data.\n \n\n   \n    Shutdown ‘clouding’ the economic outlook\n \n\n   \n  While ADP’s estimates have always functioned as a proxy for the official monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics – which is typically released two days afterwards – the two sets of numbers don’t always track.\n \n\n   \n  However, with no jobs report last month nor expected this month due to the shutdown, ADP’s data has taken on an outsized role for economists and investors looking to gauge the health of the economy.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the lack of government data is “clouding” the central bank’s view of economic activity and that a decision on a rate cut next month is not a “foregone conclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re driving in the fog, you slow down,” Powell said at a press conference following the October rate-setting committee meeting. “We’re going to have to do our jobs one way or the other. I hope by the time of the December meeting, we’re getting a better flow of data.”\n \n\n   \n  The Fed implemented a quarter-point rate cut last week in order to shore up a softening labor market, but Fed Governor Lisa Cook this week said she sees more urgency for the central bank to  focus on stubborn inflation  rather than on unemployment.\n \n\n   \n  The latest Consumer Price Index report showed annual inflation  reached 3% last month,  the highest level since January. The most recent jobs report the BLS produced showed  unemployment crept up to 4.3%  in August and the economy added just 22,000 jobs that month. And, for the first time in several years, there are  not enough jobs  for everyone seeking employment, with roughly 7.2 million open roles but around 7.4 million unemployed people.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/entertainment/brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz-mummy-reunion-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"10:39:00.000Z","title":"Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz reportedly in talks for ‘The Mummy 4’ reunion","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are reportedly in talks to reunite for a new installment of 'The Mummy' franchise, following their roles in the original 1999 film and its sequel.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:17 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In front of Martha Stewart is a perfectly set table, complete with silverware rolled into cloth napkins, matching blue glasses, and three picturesque floral arrangements at the center. Plates of fruit sit on a table behind her, and at the center is the face that would launch a thousand cookbooks, tableware collections, lifestyle magazines, bedding sets and fabulously-hosted gatherings.\n \n\n   \n  Dressed in an  angelic all-white ensemble , Stewart’s hair is longer than most would recognize now and slightly curled. This is Martha before the magazine and the product lines, before the Snoop Dogg friendship and the  pouty lips .\n \n\n   \n  This is the cover of Stewart’s first cookbook, “Entertaining,” first published in 1982 and reissued this week, exactly the same as the original. Its reprint is both a testament to Stewart’s timelessness and the book’s longstanding appeal. But this isn’t an ordinary cookbook, one with 30-minute recipes and sensible serving sizes. When Stewart says “Entertaining,” she truly means  entertaining . Ever wanted to host a cocktail party for 200 people? What about an omelet brunch for 60, or a country pie party for 50? Look no further.\n \n\n   \n  Before publishing over 100 books and becoming  the  homemaking icon, Stewart ran a successful catering business which eventually grew into a $1-million enterprise, according to a 1991 profile in New York Magazine. The business was contracted to cater a book release party, where she met Alan Mirken, then the head of Crown Publishing. He was so impressed with her catering that he asked her  to write a cookbook  — and that book became “Entertaining.”   \n \n\n   \n    Stewart showed readers how presentation can be as important as the food itself\n \n\n   \n  “Entertaining” goes beyond recipes. Entertaining is a discipline, one worthy of study, and this is its textbook. In a section on how to set a table, Stewart references the Japanese sculptor Sofu and writes “The table can establish or augment a mood, for it is in fact a stage set and should be so considered.”\n \n\n   \n  This is not the “Everyone can cook!” mentality from “Ratatouille.” Nor is it the easy, thrown-together, vibe-driven, no-fuss approach that brought modern stars like  Alison Roman  to fame. Stewart means business.\n \n\n   \n  In “Entertaining,” presentation is just as important as the food itself. There are instructions on making food look beautiful, another on organization — in which she advocates for the importance of making lists — and another on drink garnishes (“It is important to have lemon peel and olives,” she writes).\n \n\n   \n  Entertaining takes planning, the book seems to say. It’s work. But it’s work that, at least theoretically, anyone could do.\n \n\n   \n  “(The book) is not intended only for the culinary elite … but especially for all those people who regard cooking as ‘preparing meals,’ as drudgery or duty – and entertaining as an even greater worry,” she writes. “For them, I hope to show that there are many ways of entertaining and that each ultimately depends not on pomp or show or elaborate technique, but on thought, effort, and caring.”\n \n\n   \n    The book’s recipes reflect ’80s cooking\n \n\n   \n  While “Entertaining” is considered timeless by its many devotees — it’s still in print, after all — it is still an artifact of ‘80s cooking.\n \n\n   \n  In the era of soft-as-baby-food vegetables, Stewart calls for boiling a pound of whole Brussels sprouts before baking with butter; for green beans and baby carrots she steams, then tosses with butter. She does, thank goodness, call for salt and pepper, and even some nutmeg in the case of the carrots.\n \n\n   \n  A recipe for salmon mousse calls for mayonnaise, heavy cream AND sour cream, to be served in the shape of a fish. Stewart is precise in her directions, instructing us to “mix together gently but thoroughly.”\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s the carrot and squash puree, essentially mashed potatoes without the potatoes, but with the cream and butter. A part of Stewart’s Thanksgiving menu, this mash is served alongside yellow onions stuffed with Swiss chard, surely providing guests with their daily recommended portion of vegetables.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also sour cream raisin pie, which is unfortunately exactly what it sounds like.\n \n\n   \n    But it also contains some surprisingly modern ideas\n \n\n   \n  And still, some parts of the book definitely stand the test of time.\n \n\n   \n  Her recipe for tabbouleh, a Middle Eastern salad of chopped parsley and bulgur, seems to be before its time, and could easily be on any given food blog today.\n \n\n   \n  In a “Russian Buffet for Twenty-four,” a situation for which surely everyone must be prepared, Stewart freezes bottles of vodka in a block of water with flowers, resulting in a stunning floral ice block that doubles as a centerpiece, a trick seemingly created for Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  One section is dedicated to pulling off a tempura party, and contains both a history of the technique (brought to Japan by Portuguese missionaries, Martha says) and a helpful guide to deep frying (she includes sesame oil in the frying oil and uses cake flour in the batter). Here, Stewart instructs: “Serve guests as you cook, taking orders for special items.”\n \n\n   \n  The idea, even now, seems surprising in its simplicity, yet genius in its execution — who  wouldn’t  be delighted to attend a tempura party?\n \n\n   \n    Four decades later, the book is still considered an entertaining must-have\n \n\n   \n  Though “Entertaining” kicked off Stewart’s career from local caterer to nationally known hostess, its release was not without controversy. According to the 1991 New York Magazine profile, some recipes were found to be from fellow culinary icon Julia Child. Chef and writer Barbara Tropp, whose work focused on Chinese food, accused Stewart of stealing some of her recipes. Even Stewart’s former business partner, Norma Collier, told the magazine, “a lot of her recipes were mine.” Still, it didn’t stop the book’s success, or Stewart’s iconic career.\n \n\n   \n  While many Martha books, magazines, blogs and media ventures came in the decades after “Entertaining” was first published, there’s still something special about this homemaking ur-text.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018, Bon Appétit named the book as part of  its monthly cookbook club , praising its ability to “stand the test of time.” Meanwhile, Amazon and Goodreads reviews from as recently as this year praise the book’s photos and attention to detail. One writer said the book  changed her life .\n \n\n   \n  So why not plan a wedding luncheon for 270 people, or a Hawaiian luau for 20? These are the recipes that launched a cultural revolution and created a mogul out of a one-woman catering business. Surely, they’re good enough for any table.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/americas/venezuela-maduro-app-spy-us-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"10:48:00-05:00","title":"Venezuela’s Maduro, fearing US attack, promotes app to report suspect behavior","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to fears of a U.S.-led military intervention, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has repurposed the VenApp — originally a utility reporting tool — into a surveillance platform where citizens are encouraged to report suspicious activities, including political dissent or foreign presence.

10:48 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Faced with the prospect of  armed conflict  with the United States, Venezuela’s government seems to be encouraging citizens to spy on each other by using a revamped mobile application to report suspicious people or activities.\n \n\n   \n  The software, called VenApp, was originally launched by Venezuelan President  Nicolás Maduro  in 2022 as a hybrid application, integrating a messaging service with a helpline for people to report issues with utility services, such as power outages and water disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  Now it is being used as a tool for Venezuelans to inform the government of anything that it might consider seditious or disloyal, raising alarm among Maduro opponents and human rights groups about a possible surge in political detentions.\n \n\n   \n  “This initiative represents a serious concern for privacy, freedom of expression, and security, because it promotes a system of social vigilance and the militarization of public order,” the online activist group Venezuela Sin Filtro wrote in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Venezuelan Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on criticism of the app.\n \n\n   \n  Fearing that US pressure, including President Donald Trump’s recent authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela, could stir upheaval in his country, Maduro last month invited the armed forces to oversee the creation of “a new app, so that the people can safely report everything they hear, everything they read.”\n \n\n   \n  Within a week, the update was made.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the government’s anxieties that the United States may be pursuing “regime change” in the South American nation, the US military is deploying warships, fighter jets, and up to 10,000 troops to the southern Caribbean Sea, allegedly to combat drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  The operations, which the Trump administration claims have killed  more than 60 alleged “narcoterrorists,”  have been criticized by the United Nations and some US lawmakers, as well as several governments in the region. They are concerned about the abuse of presidential powers in committing what they say are extrajudicial killings without disclosing any proof of guilt.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has ruled Venezuela with an iron fist since 2013 and has clung to power despite an apparently decisive loss in the 2024 presidential election. The country’s electoral authority, stacked with Maduro sympathizers, proclaimed him the winner amid allegations of vote-rigging, which the government denied.\n \n\n   \n  When widespread street protests erupted after that election, Maduro invited citizens to use VenApp to report opposition activities. Human Rights groups such as Amnesty International then weighed in. Amnesty warned that the app could be used “to not only limit people’s right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, but also potentially contribute to unlawful arrests, detention, and other serious human rights abuses.”\n \n\n   \n  The furor prompted Apple and Google to remove VenApp from their play stores.\n \n\n   \n  But even though it could no longer be downloaded, the app never stopped working: Those who had VenApp before August 2024 can access it on their smartphones, and the government also created and sponsored a mobile version that runs in browsers.\n \n\n   \n  In the capital, Caracas, CNN took a rare look at the application.\n \n\n   \n  Citizens were invited to inform the government if they see drones or the presence of “suspicious people” in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Human rights organizations have renewed their criticism, airing concerns about the persecution of dissent in a country where more than 800 people are behind bars for political reasons, according to the legal rights organization Foro Penal. The government denies holding political prisoners.\n \n\n   \n  Among VenApp users who support the government’s aims is a resident of a slum on the outskirts of Caracas who spoke anonymously, fearing government retaliation for speaking to a foreign journalist and retribution from neighbors who oppose Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  The app worked beautifully to resolve public utility hiccups, he told CNN, and he would not hesitate to use it to inform on other Venezuelans if he felt the country was under attack from foreign forces.\n \n\n   \n  “We are prepared to defend the fatherland, our country, as the good revolutionaries we are!” said the man, who is in his 50s and does odd jobs in Venezuela’s vast “informal economy.”\n \n\n   \n  It is hard to quantify how many other Venezuelans support Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  According to electoral tallies collected by the opposition, which CNN’s analysis found to be legitimate, Maduro won about 30% of the vote in last year’s election. The European Union and independent electoral monitoring organizations such as the Carter Center and the Colombian Electoral Mission also backed the opposition’s claim.\n \n\n   \n  It is similarly difficult to gauge the support that a US offensive on Venezuelan territory would receive. Most Venezuelans who spoke to CNN in Caracas were wary of sharing their opinions publicly.\n \n\n   \n  VenApp could be part of the reason.\n \n\n   \n  “I would never even dream of downloading it. It’s scary that there’s now an app for citizens to denounce each other,” one opposition supporter told CNN, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  “On top of that, how do we know that the app is not spying on you?” said the woman, who is in her 40s and works for a private media company. “This is a government that spies on its people.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/shein-fast-fashion-sex-dolls-france-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:51:00-05:00","title":"Shein to be suspended in France following uproar over sales of ‘childlike’ sex dolls","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"France has suspended Shein’s access to its online market following revelations that its platform allowed the sale of 'childlike' sex dolls, which authorities branded as 'pedo-criminal.'

November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  France has said it will suspend Shein’s access to the French market following a headline-grabbing scandal over sales of “childlike” sex dolls.\n \n\n   \n  The government started proceedings Wednesday to ban Shein’s French website “for the time necessary for the platform to show to the authorities that all of its products are finally in conformity with our laws and regulations,” the finance ministry said.\n \n\n   \n  Over the weekend the country’s anti-fraud office accused the Chinese-founded e-commerce giant of allowing third-party sellers to hawk “childlike sex dolls” on its French platform.\n \n\n   \n  Shein said Wednesday that it was suspending sales of all third-party products in France to “guarantee the full respect of French law and the highest standards of consumer protections.” The company said it had taken the decision independently of the government move to ban its site.\n \n\n   \n  That move came just as the company opened a brick-and-mortar store in Paris, its first in the world, amid a storm of outrage in France over the scandal and the platform’s reputation for throwaway fashion.\n \n\n   \n  Shein set up shop in BHV, one of the French capital’s most famous department stores, and will later roll out its clothing range in five of France’s well-known Galeries Lafayette malls. Galeries Lafayette and BHV both belong to the Société des Grands Magasins (SGM) group.\n \n\n   \n  The opening Wednesday was marred by protests but also saw large numbers of people queuing to get their hands on Shein’s products.\n \n\n   \n  “The city of Paris reaffirms that Shein is contrary to its values,” Paris Deputy Mayor Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj told journalists outside BHV Tuesday before the planned suspension. “We ask the Minister of the Economy to go further than just making threats and to ban the Shein platform in France.”\n \n\n   \n  Such is the strength of feeling around Shein’s touchdown in France that Galeries Lafayette published a statement in late October slamming SGM’s decision to force Shein – a brand “in contradiction with their offer and their values” – upon them.\n \n\n   \n  In retaliation, SGM Tuesday ordered five of the Galeries Lafayette malls to rebrand as BHV, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, dealing a crippling blow to a household name brand in France.\n \n\n   \n  “Our capital cannot become the showcase for disposable goods and exploitation,” Ian Brossat, a senator for Paris from the French Communist Party, said in a  statement  Monday. “This partnership goes against all the commitments taken by France and Paris to more firmly regulate the fashion industry.”\n \n\n   \n  This week, Frédéric Merlin, head of SGM, pushed back against criticism of the deal with Shein, pointing to its popularity with consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re speaking of a brand that is regularly bought by 25 million French customers, who are today considered bad people because they buy from this platform?” he said in an interview Tuesday with RTL radio.\n \n\n   \n  But critics believe that Paris’ reputation for haute couture, bespoke elegance and exclusive design couldn’t be further from the disposable culture epitomized by Shein’s ultra-low-price, accessible-to-all clothing.\n \n\n   \n  Some see a double irony in Shein making landfall in Paris, home to the eponymous landmark climate agreement signed in 2016, given  wide concerns  over its environmental impact.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese platform has become the bogeyman figurehead of the  fast-fashion industry , accused of paying scant regard to sustainable manufacturing and the environmental costs of mass global shipping. Shein, however, says its model allows it to avoid waste and overproduction.\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, Paris has sought to make itself a leader on “green” issues, championing bicycle travel and low-carbon business practices, and making sustainability a key pillar of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n \n\n   \n    Evacuate the building\n \n\n   \n  In response to Shein’s arrival, 12 brands have already announced they will remove their products from BHV’s shelves, among them prominent French clothes makers like Figaret and Armor Lux, known for their rootedness in French design and manufacturing.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the biggest name to distance itself from BHV is Disney, with Disneyland Paris abandoning plans to design BHV’s famous Christmas window displays this year, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, BHV director Karl-Stéphane Cottendin played down the significance of the brands’ departure from a flock of “more than 2,000 brands” in BHV’s stable. “Everyone is free to make their own decisions,” he said in an interview with BFMTV. “We have no problem at all with that.”\n \n\n   \n  Opposition to Shein’s arrival in Paris was clear from the earliest announcement of its partnership with BHV. But the mall’s boss has looked to exploit the controversy.\n \n\n   \n  A storeys-high poster showing SMG president and BHV owner Merlin with Shein boss Donald Tang was hung on the BHV façade in Paris last week, emblazoned with the words: “The poster that we shouldn’t have made?”\n \n\n   \n  The taunting nature of the poster was only heightened by its location, flying literally in the face of Paris’ city hall – one of the most vocal opponents to Shein’s arrival – which sits across the street from BHV.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Pedo-criminal dolls’\n \n\n   \n  Shein’s touchdown in Paris was almost scuppered by the weekend revelations. The French finance minister threated Monday to ban the platform from the country after it came to light that childlike sex dolls were being sold on the e-commerce site.\n \n\n   \n  French law allows the government to target websites peddling pedophilic content but this wouldn’t necessarily threaten Shein’s physical store.\n \n\n   \n  SGM’s Merlin said he had had “very firm” discussions with Shein leadership Wednesday regarding the French government decision to suspend Shein’s online access to the French market. “I am proud of that quality and provenance of the products we sell here (in store),” he added.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, France’s High Commissioner for Children Sarah El-Haïry slammed the availability of the products on Shein’s site. “No one has the right to buy pedo-criminal dolls. These are deliberate miniature copies of children that hold teddy bears, that wear children’s clothing,” she said, branding the buyers as “potential predators.”\n \n\n   \n  Also on Monday, French authorities launched investigations into Shein, Temu, AliExpress and Wish for allegedly disseminating “violent, pornographic, or degrading messages accessible to a minor,” as well as further investigations into Shein and AliExpress for allegedly spreading “images or depictions of minors of a pornographic nature,” according to the Paris Prosecutor’s office.\n \n\n   \n  Online retail site Temu told CNN in a statement: “We are currently working with the (French anti-fraud office) to reinforce our protections for children.”\n \n\n   \n  AliExpress, meanwhile, said it had removed all the offending products from sale. “We are taking this matter very seriously,” its statement said. “We are putting everything in place to guarantee the continued respect of our policies across our entire platform.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN also   reached out to Wish for comment on the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN Monday, Shein’s executive chairman Tang said that, while “every seller is responsible for their own listings,” the company had banned all sales of sex dolls  and upped its internal protections. Shein will cooperate with the official investigation, the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  SGM chief Merlin told RTL radio Tuesday that he had been preparing to cancel the partnership with Shein following news of the sex doll sales. Shein’s moves to ban them saved the launch, he said.\n \n\n   \n  BHV leaders doubled down on their welcome for Shein, with Cottendin telling journalists Monday: “I believe that what is happening, which we condemn, reminds of the necessity of a store, because in a physical store these types of situations would never have taken place.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/media/mamdani-election-spanberger-sherrill-media","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"12:20:00.000-05:00","title":"Big media takeaways from Mamdani’s victory and the Democratic sweep","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes the significance of Zohran Mamdani’s unexpected victory in New York City as a symbol of grassroots political power and a shift in media representation.

\nUpdated: \n        12:20 PM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can  sign up for free here . \n \n\n   \n  From time to time, news outlet leaders should look around and ask: Do our stories reflect the current state of political discourse? Do our segments represent the voices of all voters?\n \n\n   \n  I found myself thinking about this on Tuesday evening as Zohran Mamdani talked about “the working people of New York,” whom he credited with his victory. “Fingers bruised from lifting boxes on the warehouse floor, palms calloused from delivery bike handlebars, knuckles scarred with kitchen burns: These are not hands that have been allowed to hold power,” he said. “And yet, over the last 12 months, you have dared to reach for something greater.”\n \n\n   \n  I love a good TV panel discussion. But it’s worth asking if the typical one actually includes, or even channels the views of, people like the ones Mamdani described.\n \n\n   \n  As David Axelrod acknowledged during one of CNN’s panels late last night, “Everyone at this table is going to go home to great comfort.” But “there are a lot of people in this city, there are a lot of people in this country, who have to worry every single day about how they’re going to meet their bills. And that is a crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  That disconnect — between who we invite to talk about politics and who is actually shaping it on the ground — is a gap that journalists, especially on TV, constantly have to work hard to close.\n \n\n   \n  Thus, my favorite day-after story is by CNN’s Aditi Sangal, who spent the evening at Kabab King, the mayor-elect’s go-to biryani spot in Jackson Heights.  Check out what she heard here .\n \n\n   \n    Progressive columnists celebrate\n \n\n   \n  In the same way that media outlets sought out Trump-supporting talking heads in 2015 and 2016, it’s crucial to seek out commentators who speak for a new, younger generation of Democratic voters.\n \n\n   \n  For example, The Free Press election night live stream last night hosted Bhaskar Sunkara, president of The Nation magazine and founding editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin.\n \n\n   \n  “This wasn’t supposed to happen,” Eric Blanc wrote  in an essay  that led Jacobin’s website last night and this morning. Blanc conveyed the improbability of Mamdani’s victory, then warned, “turning Zohran’s vision into a reality won’t be easy. Some of the most powerful people and institutions in the world are going to do everything to stop us. But transforming our city is possible, if large numbers of everyday New Yorkers join the fight. America’s oligarchs are right to be worried.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nation’s editor Katrina vanden Heuvel and executive editor John Nichols published a similar  editorial  last night. Mamdani “has no higher responsibility than to be a great mayor of New York City,” they wrote. In success, he “has the potential to transform not just a city but the politics of a nation that desperately needs a robust antidote to Donald Trump’s oppressions.”\n \n\n   \n    From fringe to media frenzy\n \n\n   \n  Just eight months ago,  in March,  Mamdani held a press conference in Manhattan with barely any journalists in attendance. Now, he is constantly surrounded by cameras. Mamdani comms aide Lekha Sunder  posted  March and November photos side by side with the caption, “How far we’ve come.”\n \n\n   \n  The campaign received more than 400 press RSVPs for Tuesday night’s victory party, including some from international media outlets, according to CNN’s Gloria Pazmino. Many “voices on the left” were there too, “including Drop Site News’ Ryan Grim and Democracy Now’s Amy Goodman,” along with live-streaming star Hasan Piker, who drew a crowd of his own, TheWrap’s Michael Calderone  wrote here .\n \n\n   \n  Commentators emphasized Mamdani’s media savvy as well as his message  consistency . Maybe it doesn’t matter so much “how you use Instagram and TikTok,” Errol Louis said last night on NY1. “What really  does  matter is going to people and saying, ‘What are the issues that most concern you?’ — writing down what they say; then making that your program; and not talking about anything else.”\n \n\n   \n  As journalism professor Jay Rosen has argued over the years, this “ citizens agenda ” concept also applies well to news coverage.\n \n\n   \n    What the polls missed in NJ\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, the governor’s race was expected to be a nail-biter. Why? In part because of the polls showing Sherrill with only a slight lead over Jack Ciattarelli. The RCP  average  of recent polls had Sherrill with just a 3.3% edge. But she ultimately won 56% to 42%. Polls “said it was too close to call, and she just absolutely thumped” Ciattarelli, Joe Scarborough said on MSNBC this morning.\n \n\n   \n  In retrospect, the “tell” was that Sherrill was ahead in  every  pre-election poll, even though most of the polls overstated support for her rival.\n \n\n   \n    How Fox News handled it all\n \n\n   \n  Because the key races were all called before Fox’s special coverage started at 10 p.m., we got to watch MAGA devotees Jesse Watters and Sean Hannity cope in real time. Both hosts tried to spin away any suggestion that the losses were a repudiation of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  After calling Abigail Spanberger’s victory in Virginia, Watters declared, “The Democrats are going to spin this: ‘This is a referendum on Trump.’ I mean, these are all blue states.” That particular line continued into Hannity’s hour. Hannity also said his phone was blowing up with texts from friends in New York who were “depressed and scared.” Fox’s shows leaned hard into “socialism” fears all night long.\n \n\n   \n    Taunting the TV president\n \n\n   \n  Here’s an interesting argument  from  conservative writer Sohrab Ahmari: “The sheer cartoonishness of the Right’s attacks rendered (Mamdani) more sympathetic.” (The aforementioned Michael Calderone compiled all the recent NY Post front pages  here .)\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani alluded to that “prism of misinformation” last night, and he also presaged the Mamdani-Trump feedback loop that we can expect to see a lot next year. He leaned into Trump’s TV obsession with a big, headline-generating taunt: “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.”\n \n\n   \n  And Trump likely  was  watching, because Fox News carried Mamdani’s speech in full. Anchor Trace Gallagher invited Trump to call in immediately afterward, but no such luck.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking of feedback loops: During Hannity’s show, GOP pollster Matt Towery blamed the losses on the shutdown and the fact that Trump’s name wasn’t on the ballot. Just eight minutes later, Matt Gertz  noted , Trump posted that same exact argument to Truth Social.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/world/tanzania-election-protest-deaths-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"10:29:00-05:00","title":"Tanzanian police disposed of bodies after election violence, opposition alleges","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a disputed election in which Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan won by a landslide, widespread protests erupted, resulting in clashes with police and a reported death toll of 2,000 documented by the opposition Chadema party.

 \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  California voters have approved redrawing the state’s congressional map — a move which Democratic leaders  hope will help their party  win five more seats.\n \n\n   \n  The map is the first major response from Democrats against  unprecedented Republican efforts , led by President Donald Trump, to redraw congressional maps this year to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/submit-your-questions-for-gobble-gobble-gone-wrong-thanksgiving-cooking-nightmares","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"09:23:00-05:00","title":"Gobble, Gobble Gone Wrong: Thanksgiving Cooking Nightmares","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CNN is airing a special titled 'Gobble, Gobble Gone Wrong: Thanksgiving Cooking Nightmares' on Thanksgiving Day 2025, featuring journalist Harry Enten who will answer viewer questions about common Thanksgiving cooking disasters.

So lonely was Trump that he took to waving forlornly out the window at machine gun-toting guards patrolling the White House grounds (“They don’t, like, wave,” he observed).\n \n\n   \n  Back then, Trump seemed aware that weekly visits to his seaside mansion or lengthy trips overseas might appear insensitive as federal workers went without pay and government services ground to a halt. He called off a trip to Switzerland for the glittering World Economic Forum in Davos, but did make a surprise stop in Iraq to greet troops around Christmas.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a different story this year. Trump has spent two weekends at Mar-a-Lago since the shutdown began on October 1, and played a round of golf at his club in Virginia. On Wednesday — as the  shutdown becomes the longest  in American history, and as Trump ramps up his calls for Republicans to shift course — he will travel to Miami for a speech to a financial conference. He’s expected back at his Palm Beach estate by Friday evening.\n \n\n   \n  He’s also made two separate trips abroad: to  Israel and Egypt , to preside over the Gaza ceasefire he helped broker; and a three-nation swing through Asia, where he brokered several trade deals while being met with lavish receptions and  golden tributes , including an ancient Korean crown and a brownie.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump is concerned about appearing disconnected from the struggles of furloughed workers, stranded travelers or worried  food stamp beneficiaries , there isn’t much evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Before leaving for Florida last week, Trump posted 24 photos of a  guest bathroom  he renovated in the White House residence, capturing details like a gold hand shower, crystal chandelier and terrycloth bathrobe embroidered with the presidential seal, all encased in “highly polished statuary marble.” From the window, one could glimpse the  torn-apart East Wing , whose demolition to make way for Trump’s long-desired 90,000-square-foot ballroom began a few weeks into the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  A few hours later, he was walking into the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago for a “Great Gatsby”-themed Halloween party, where dancers in beaded fringe performed atop oversized champagne coupes. If F. Scott Fitzgerald’s disillusioned narrative of Jazz Age hedonism struck any of the guests as odd on the day food stamps were set to expire, they didn’t show it. “A little party never killed nobody” was the theme, apparently devised without reaching the end of the novel.\n \n\n   \n  Before leaving Florida last weekend, Trump made a detour at the airport to inspect his private black-and-red Boeing 757, which he used to travel the country during his presidential campaign last year. The jet is upholstered in cream leather; its seatbelt buckles are plated in 24-carat gold.\n \n\n   \n  Back aboard the comparatively un-golden Air Force One, Trump departed Palm Beach on schedule. Around the rest of the country on Sunday, more than 5,000 flights traveling from and to US airports were delayed, in part because of staffing shortages among  unpaid air traffic controllers .\n \n\n   \n  The White House didn’t offer an exact explanation for why Trump’s approach to travel had changed since the last government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “While Democrats shut down the government to use struggling American families — by their own admission — as ‘leverage’ for their radical political agenda, President Trump is continuing to work night and day on behalf of American people,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. “Whether it be ensuring troops were paid, forging historic peace deals, removing dangerous criminals from the streets, lowering prices, or securing more investments for America, President Trump will never stop delivering.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not only his own past practice Trump is shrugging off by maintaining his regular routine. Other presidents have canceled plans when government funding lapsed, including President Barack Obama’s decision to scrap a trip to South Asia in 2013 and President Bill Clinton’s cancellation of a trip to Japan in 1995.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s memories of his self-imposed isolation in the last shutdown could be informing his decisions this time around. As that shutdown neared its end, the president’s cabin fever was evident, according to aides. He started several meetings muttering, “Welcome to paradise.”\n \n\n   \n  By the time it was over, it wasn’t clear what if anything Trump had gained from the ordeal, aside from most Americans’ blame. His decision to forgo weekends in Florida didn’t appear to yield much political benefit. He agreed to reopen the government having secured none of the border wall funding he was demanding.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Trump’s aides were eager to portray the president tapping his toe, waiting around the White House for Democrats to return for talks to end the funding impasse.\n \n\n   \n  Now, it is Democrats who say they are waiting for Trump to engage in negotiations to reopen the federal government. They have insisted health care programs be addressed as part of any funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  “If the president engages, we will find a deal I think within hours,” Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n \n\n   \n   Quiet discussions  this week between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have led to some optimism the shutdown may be approaching its end.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, however, has shown little willingness to negotiate. He told “60 Minutes” he won’t be “extorted” by Democrats. And he’s insisted the quickest way to end the shutdown is for Senate Republicans to  jettison the filibuster  and reopen the government without Democrats’ help, calls he escalated after Republican losses in Tuesday’s off-year elections.\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t terminate the filibuster, you’ll be in bad shape. We won’t pass any legislation,” he said during a somewhat sullen breakfast meeting with Republican senators at the White House on Wednesday morning before departing for Miami.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has brushed off  resistance from Republican leaders  who worry eliminating the 60-vote threshold for passing legislation might come back to haunt them if Democrats regain the majority. At the breakfast, with a stone-faced Senate Majority Leader John Thune sitting nearby , he acknowledged there were differences of opinion: “I’m gonna go by your wishes. You’re very smart people, we’re good friends. But I think it’s a tremendous mistake, really,” Trump said.\n \n\n   \n  Before Tuesday, the president appeared convinced Democrats would catch the blame for the shutdown, though polls show Americans  mostly holding him  and the Republican Party responsible.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday was a different story.\n \n\n   \n  “I think if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor,” he said, a tacit acknowledgement the Republican strategy had been unpopular with voters.\n \n\n   \n  His strategy has focused, in part, on maximizing the pain in the hopes Democrats will relent, including by  attempting to  permanently lay off federal employees, threatening to  withhold back pay  for workers once the shutdown ends and halting funding for certain projects in Democratic-led states.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump and his budget officials have found pots of money to keep military service personnel paid, he initially resisted tapping into contingency funds to sustain food assistance programs, which 42 million low-income Americans benefit from.\n \n\n   \n  After two federal judges found fault in the administration’s refusal to fund the benefits, the administration  said it would do so .\n \n\n   \n  As he was flying to Florida Friday, Trump maintained he wouldn’t meet Democrats until they voted with Republicans to fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll meet very quickly, but they have to open up the country. It’s their fault. Everything is their fault. It’s so easily solved,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Before then, however, the Mar-a-Lago ballroom beckoned.\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight, we have a big celebration of Halloween,” he said, “and I’ll see you later.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional comments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/gop-post-trump-problem-2025-elections","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"10:18:00-05:00","title":"The 2025 Election Crystallized the GOP’s Post-Trump Problem","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 U.S. election revealed a deep crisis within the Republican Party: its electoral strength is heavily reliant on Donald Trump’s presence on the ballot.

He posted a quote Tuesday night that he attributed to unspecified “pollsters” –  apparently  ones he was watching on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,” the quote  read .\n \n\n   \n  Trump echoed those comments when speaking to GOP senators Wednesday morning, again pointing to the shutdown and adding, “They say that I wasn’t on the ballot was the biggest factor.”\n \n\n   \n  That shutdown’s impact on the elections is debatable. It didn’t seem to be a major subplot in the races Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  But the other part – Trump not being on the ballot – is actually very important when it comes to assessing the fallout from Tuesday. Indeed, it crystallizes the GOP’s problem moving forward.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because term limits make it so Trump  can never be on the ballot again,  despite his sometimes musing about the possibility.\n \n\n   \n  And Tuesday’s results reinforced how the GOP really needs to figure out what to do about that.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has demonstrated a talent for bringing out casual voters to vote for him. But if those low-propensity voters don’t show up or don’t vote Republican when he’s not on the ballot – like he won’t be in 2026, 2028 or any other election – it’s a big problem to be so reliant upon them.\n \n\n   \n  The question now is whether Republicans start recognizing the need to chart a new course and treat Trump as more of a lame duck. Tuesday won’t settle that debate, but it does inject it with new urgency.\n \n\n   \n  “Lame duck status is going to come even faster now,”  predicted  conservative commentator Erick Erickson. “Trump cannot turn out the vote unless he is on the ballot, and that is never happening again.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have shown that they  almost always do quite poorly  when Trump’s name doesn’t grace the top of the ticket.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the biggest exception to that was the 2021 elections in the same states that voted Tuesday, when Americans seemed to vote for checks on then-President Joe Biden and the Democrats. But by 2022, Republicans reverted to form, having one of the worst midterm elections for an opposition party in a very long time. The opposition party – i.e. the one that doesn’t hold the White House – almost always wins midterms; the GOP somehow didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  (Part of the GOP’s poor performance seemed to owe to  Trump elevating flawed candidates ; the GOP also struggled after the Supreme Court overturned  Roe v. Wade  – a decision made possible by Trump-appointed  justices.)\n \n\n   \n  What stings about Tuesday for Republicans is that there was some thought that the 2024 election opened a new era – one in which Trump had recast our political landscape and coalitions in a more lasting way.\n \n\n   \n  No, Trump’s 2024 win wasn’t nearly as resounding as he bills it; he failed to win a majority of the popular vote. But he did win a plurality and sweep the swing states. Latino voters swung hard in his direction. And he made significant headway in states like New Jersey, which went from a 16-point Trump loss in 2020 to just a 6-point Trump loss in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  But those swings swung back on Tuesday, pretty hard.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill won Latinos by more than a 2-to-1 margin, 68%-31%, according to  CNN’s exit poll . Sherrill is winning that race overall by a surprisingly wide 13-point margin.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger is winning her race by 15 points, the largest margin for a Democrat in the commonwealth since 1961.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats also easily won the other much-watched elections Tuesday. That includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s contentious redistricting ballot measure passing with more than 60% of the vote and Pennsylvania voters retaining a trio of Democratic state Supreme Court justices by 20-plus-point margins.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats even won big in a pair of statewide races in Georgia, both for the state’s Public Service Commission. Those are the first statewide constitutional offices Democrats  have won in the state since 2006 , and they’re currently winning both races by 26 points.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats even managed to win the Virginia attorney general’s race, despite nominee Jay Jones’  violent text messages  about his political opponent and his opponent’s children. Polls showed a competitive race; Jones is winning by more than 7 points.\n \n\n   \n  In one way, it’s not at all surprising that Democrats would win the 2025 off-year election. The party that doesn’t hold the White House usually does, just like it usually wins the midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  But the resounding nature of the results has to register with Republicans and instill them with at least some fear about what their post-Trump future portends. What happens if the party really has become all about Trump, and their base doesn’t vote Republican when he’s gone?\n \n\n   \n  We’ve already seen what can happen to a party that becomes so defined by one man and then struggles to figure out what comes next or who will lead it; that’s what happened with Democrats at the end of the Barack Obama era.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s even more pronounced with Trump, who is the singular figure in the GOP – the sun around which everything orbits.\n \n\n   \n  That doesn’t mean Republicans are going to start ditching Trump en masse; That’s not feasible in a party that has become so defined by fealty to him.\n \n\n   \n  But it does matter if they start distancing themselves from him around the margins.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because so much of Trump’s current project – his rapid expansion of presidential power – is built on acquiescence. Republicans didn’t like the tariffs, but they’ve tolerated them even as they’ve jeopardized the economy. The GOP has  largely looked the other way as Trump has done a  bevy of things that have proven to be pretty unpopular .\n \n\n   \n  Trump has done a ton of things that rather transparently make it more difficult for his party over the long term. Republicans have either lost the will to resist him or decided to just give him boatloads of slack.\n \n\n   \n  But nothing gets lawmakers’ attention like worrying about their own jobs and majorities. And now Republicans have very good reason to start worrying about those things.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/us/ups-louisville-plane-crash-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"10:01:00.000Z","title":"UPS cargo plane crash devastates Louisville, where ties to the shipping giant run deep","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on November 5, 2025, killing at least nine people, including all three crew members.

AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the sun set and businesses started to close in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday, the evening calm was suddenly shattered by  a giant explosion  near the city’s airport.\n \n\n   \n  A UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport –– ripping through several businesses, including a waste recycling company that keeps storage tanks of oil and propane.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 38,000 gallons of fuel on board the cargo flight bound for Hawaii, the crash created a massive ball of fire – punctuated by smaller explosions from flammable material on the ground – and sent a towering plume of thick black smoke into the sky.\n \n\n   \n  At least  nine people have died , Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told CNN on Wednesday morning, warning the numbers could climb as the investigation continues.  Earlier , officials said at least seven were killed and 11 injured.\n \n\n   \n  The only three people on the flight –– all crew members –– are presumed dead, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  A ground crew member told CNN she got word of an explosion on the UPS side of the airport and ran over to see what was happening. Once she was there, she heard several more explosions while watching the smoke grow.\n \n\n   \n  “I kept looking for the firefighters and the first responders and couldn’t breathe until I saw those flashing emergency lights, the fire trucks pulling up,” said the crew member, who asked to remain anonymous.\n \n\n   \n  Five miles from the airport, Louisville resident Amanda Rhye was at a grocery store when she saw the smoke and immediately knew “it had to be something major,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone else around me realized it too. A couple of dozen people all stopped what they were doing and stared as the cloud quickly grew … within 20 minutes, the massive black cloud was over us in the sky,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of firefighters were deployed to contain the fire and search the surrounding area for victims, Louisville Fire Department Chief Brian O’Neill said at the Tuesday briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “When you have such a large-scale incident and fire that spread over such a massive area, we have to use hundreds of personnel to surround it, contain it, and then slowly bring it in,” O’Neill said, adding the site is now safe enough for crews to put out remaining spot fires and “create a formal grid” to search the surroundings.\n \n\n   \n  “These are trained firefighters from all around the region that are handling this to search, grid by grid, very carefully to make sure we can find any other victims,” the chief said.\n \n\n   \n    How the crash unfolded\n \n\n   \n  Josh Mitcham had just boarded a flight at the Louisville airport when he looked out the window and saw a dark cloud of smoke emerging into the sky.\n \n\n   \n  “We didn’t really know what happened,” Mitcham told CNN. “The captain came over and said that there had been an accident and that it wasn’t good and that they recommended that we go ahead and get off the plane.”\n \n\n   \n  The UPS cargo flight MD-11 crashed shortly after 5 p.m. after taking off on its way to Honolulu, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA is investigating the cause of the crash alongside the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  In audio from Louisville firefighters, a dispatcher tries to remain calm as initial details came in about a “possible explosion.” When one person asks how many buildings are on fire, someone responds that it’s at least two structures.\n \n\n   \n  Gov. Beshear later said at least two businesses were hit: an auto parts store and Kentucky Petroleum Recycling. A nearby Ford Motor plant also lost power after the plane crash, Beshear said.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill said the crash ruptured some tanks at the recycling facility and sparked “secondary explosions.” He noted some of what might have sounded like explosions were actually relief valves releasing pressure as they’re designed to do.\n \n\n   \n  The fire from the crash is largely “controlled and contained” but the area around the facility is “still going to be a mess … because of the fuel leaks and the oil,” O’Neill said.\n \n\n   \n  The plane was not carrying any hazardous cargo that would “create an environmental issue,” Beshear said. Still, officials are monitoring Louisville’s air quality in the wake of the crash, the mayor said.\n \n\n   \n  A shelter-in-place order was initially issued for all locations within five miles of the airport but was later reduced to a one-mile radius, emergency officials said.\n \n\n   \n  After the crash, Louisville resident Justin Dunn and his son watched as what appeared to be debris fell out of the sky.\n \n\n   \n  “My son was like, ‘Hey, look in the sky,’ and it was coming down out of the sky and he picked it up,” Dunn told  CNN affiliate WAVE , holding up a piece of paper he said was among the debris.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s definitely debris all through here, probably within 10 miles,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are asking residents not to touch any debris they find and to take a picture and report it to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Because of the shelter-in-place order, Louisville’s Jefferson County Public Schools – the largest school district in Kentucky – will be closed Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The Louisville airport shut down after the crash but is expected to reopen Wednesday, according to the mayor.\n \n\n   \n    “This is a UPS town”\n \n\n   \n  Louisville hosts UPS’s worldwide air hub, called Worldport, which serves as a cornerstone to the city’s economy. More than 12,000 employees process over 22 million packages daily, according to the company.\n \n\n   \n  “Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved. UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities we serve. This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers,” UPS said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Big Four Bridge connecting Louisville and Jeffersonville, Indiana, over the Ohio River, was lit up in yellow lights Tuesday night in honor of the crashed UPS flight Greenberg  said  on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “This tragedy has touched every corner of our city. As Louisville’s skyline glows in yellow, we’re thinking of the lives lost, the families forever changed, and the entire community that calls Louisville home,” he wrote, accompanying a picture of the bridge.\n \n\n   \n  Louisville “is a UPS town,” city councilwoman Betsy Ruhe said at a news conference Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “My cousin’s a UPS pilot. My aide’s tennis partner is a UPS pilot. The intern in my office works overnight at UPS to pay for college,” Ruhe said.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know somebody who works at UPS –– and they’re all texting their friends, their family, trying to make sure everyone is safe. Sadly, some of those texts are probably going to go unanswered,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Kentucky state Sen. Keturah Herron described the accident as “jarring” after hitting “so close to home.”\n \n\n   \n  “To happen in a place where many of us frequent on a regular basis, that many of us watch our family members and loved ones pass through on a regular basis … it’s very hurtful,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Dunn, the Louisville resident who found some of the plane’s debris, said he hadn’t been able to make contact with his friends who work for UPS. “I just hope everyone made it out of it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Teamsters union, which counts UPS as its  single-largest employer in the country , issued a statement saying it was monitoring developments from the crash.\n \n\n   \n  “As this horrific scene is being investigated, prayers on behalf of our entire International Union are with those killed, injured, and affected, including their families, co-workers, and loved ones,” the union  wrote on X .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/europe/oleron-french-island-car-ramming-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"09:47:00-05:00","title":"Car ramming injures 10 people on French island, interior minister says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A motorist on the French island of Oléron rammed pedestrians and cyclists in a violent incident, injuring 10 people, including two seriously wounded individuals.

nation.\n \n\n   \n  Bare-chested men, twirling their shirts over their heads. Hundreds of them. Thousands of them in places.\n \n\n   \n  It started during another dismal loss in a dismal year for Oklahoma State. The viral images from “Section 2-No-Shirty-1” inspired legions of copycats. Colorado, UCLA, Utah, Clemson, Indiana, North Texas, Iowa State and more.\n \n\n   \n  With the calendar flipping into November, there’s no sign that the shirts are going to stay on for the rest of the season. And it all started with a bet that turned into a viral moment.\n \n\n   \n  Oklahoma State fan Trent Eaton  told USA Today  that his sister said she’d give him $10 if he walked to an empty section of T. Boone Pickens Stadium during the October 11 loss to Houston, took off his shirt and waved it.\n \n\n   \n  What happened next is among the most indelible images of this college football season. One fan joined Eaton. Then another. Then another. Then hundreds more. A steady stream of dudes heading to Section 231 to take off their shirts and whirl them over their heads like helicopters.\n \n\n   \n  The OK State Cowboys got smoked in that game. They had just fired coach Mike Gundy and the program was in the dumps. But for a glorious period, all that mattered were the dudes being dudes.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to say how awesome it was… I don’t know who those kids were up there with their shirts off, but it was awesome,” said interim coach Dough Meacham  after the game. \n \n\n   \n  He added, “It was phenomenal because it’s human nature to pout and go home when things aren’t going the way you hoped, our guys definitely felt it and you don’t see that too often. … I appreciate our students hanging in there with us and giving us something to play for.”\n \n\n   \n  OK State linebacker Malik Charles added, “I saw it at first with the one or two guys up there, then it was three. I put my helmet on and was about to go on the field, and the next thing I know, it’s (the videoboard) is saying world record, and I was like, ‘Man there’s a lot of people up there!’ It’s honestly really cool, it’s nice to know that we still have a lot of supporters and a lot of people that come out and love Cowboy Football.”\n \n\n   \n  The videos, showing a steady stream of men walking to the section of the stadium  now officially christened “2-No-Shirty-1”  and then joyously taking their tops   off, went wild on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, fans from around the country have followed the Cowboy fans’ lead to entertain themselves in the waning stages of blowouts.\n \n\n   \n  Colorado fans could have chosen to sulk when their team went down by multiple scores to Arizona on Saturday.  Instead, tarps off. \n \n\n   \n  Boise State fans could have been upset when they were upset at home by Fresno State as their season continued to slide away from them.  Instead, tarps off. \n \n\n   \n  Clemson fans needed to help rally their Tigers against Duke as the Blue Devils were in the lead. How’d they do it?  Tarps off. \n \n\n   \n  Sometimes victorious fans are doing it too, and not exactly in the balmiest places.  Oregon ,  Indiana ,  Florida State ,  Georgia Tech  and  North Texas  fans have all gotten in on it in the last few weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The best thing about college football is the sense of community the sport inspires. The ritual of gathering on the campus of old alma mater a few Saturdays a year to sing the same songs, cheer the same cheers and lament the same old shortcomings with tens of thousands of other folks with the same experiences – it’s unlike anything else in sports.\n \n\n   \n  That sense of community is how Section 2-No-Shirty-1 began – a bunch of guys having a laugh amid their football team’s disastrous season. That sense of joy and community, and the truly incredible sight of people flocking to certain sections so they can join in the fun, is a sign of college football’s importance at a time of reckoning for the sport’s big-money problems.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/asia/typhoon-kalmaegi-deaths-philippines-cebu-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"09:08:00-05:00","title":"Typhoon Kalmaegi kills at least 85 in the Philippines, heads toward Vietnam","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi, known locally as Tino, devastated central and southern regions of the Philippines, killing at least 85 people and leaving 75 missing, with widespread flooding and over 200,000 evacuations.

 The city of  Paris  has announced a lottery with a twist: Instead of a cash prize, entrants can instead win the chance to be buried in one of the French capital’s most celebrated  cemeteries .\n \n\n   \n  The unusual plan aims to restore   tombs that have fallen into disrepair, while also giving Paris residents a rare opportunity to secure one of the sought-after plots, the city hall said in a statement published Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Cemeteries within the city walls have been almost full since the beginning of the 20th century, with the clearing of abandoned tombs complicated by local regulations, the authority explained.\n \n\n   \n  But now, winners of the lottery will be granted the opportunity to buy and restore one of 30 tombs in three different cemeteries, with city hall agreeing to lease the corresponding burial plot   to those who meet certain standards.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent decades, cemetery visitors throughout France have expressed an interest in restoring a historic funerary monument in order to obtain a burial plot concession in return,” city hall said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  However, giving them a chance to do so has been complicated by the laws governing the land on which a tomb is located, which is owned by the state, and concessions, under which a family rents the plot for a defined period of time.\n \n\n   \n  Now, city hall hopes to have found a solution, with 10 plots up for grabs in Père-Lachaise cemetery, which counts “The Doors” frontman Jim Morrison, playwright Oscar Wilde and singer Édith Piaf among its illustrious residents.\n \n\n   \n  There are also 10 plots in Montparnasse cemetery, home to writers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Susan Sontag, as well as 10 more in Montmartre cemetery, where painter Edgar Degas, author Émile Zola and dancer Vaslav Nijinsky are all buried.\n \n\n   \n  Each existing tomb will be available to buy for 4,000 euros ($4,600), with the winners also on the hook for restoration costs.\n \n\n   \n  They will then be able to buy a lease, the cost of which starts at 976 euros ($1,120) for a 10-year contract and increases to 17,668 euros ($20,290) for the right to rest there in perpetuity.\n \n\n   \n  Applications to the lottery opened on Monday and will close on December 31, according to city hall, with each entrant subject to a 125-euro ($144) registration fee.\n \n\n

This front will push farther south and east through the weekend, and temperatures could drop 10 to 15 degrees below normal almost everywhere east of the Rockies by Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  These winter-like conditions — with the coldest temperatures of the season — could make it as far south as the Gulf Coast early next week.\n \n\n   \n  The brief   pattern flip could also potentially switch on the  lake-effect snow  machine for the first time this season and bring some measurable snow downwind of the Great Lakes.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how this chilly change-up will play out.\n \n\n   \n    A winter-like weekend for some\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest will be first in line for plummeting temperatures starting Saturday. This temperature drop could also be accompanied by a wintry mix for some.\n \n\n   \n  Minneapolis will likely have a near-normal high temperature in the mid to upper 40s on Friday, but will barely hit the upper 30s by Saturday. A mix of rain and snow is possible throughout Saturday. The city usually has its first measurable snow — defined as at least 0.1 inches — by November 3, but that has not happened yet and it isn’t likely to Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  December-like chill will expand into much more of the country on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The day will start with low temperatures in the 20s or lower for much of the central US and stay frigid. Temperatures could end up 15 degrees below average for much of the Plains, Midwest and portions of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.\n \n\n   \n  The high temperature in Chicago will likely struggle to reach around 40 degrees Sunday, which is 10 degrees colder than normal. St. Louis will also be 10 degrees colder than it should be with a high in the mid-40s.\n \n\n   \n    Coldest air since spring to start the week\n \n\n   \n  Monday morning will be the coldest since spring for tens of millions of people east of the Rockies. Low temperatures at or below freezing – 32 degrees – are possible as far south as Texas and as far east as the Appalachians.\n \n\n   \n  Buffalo, New York, could drop into the 20s on Monday morning and only reach the upper 30s by the afternoon. A normal early November high for the city is about 50 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Monday will likely be the coldest day of the wintry blast for much of the eastern two-thirds of the US, but the Southeast will be the epicenter for some of the coldest air relative to normal.\n \n\n   \n  Nashville, Tennessee, will likely have a high in the mid 40s on Monday, after temperatures drop below freezing early in the morning. That high is almost 20 degrees below normal– 63 degrees would be normal on Monday’s date.\n \n\n   \n  Monday will also feature a dramatic temperature drop for Atlanta. Sunday’s high in the city is expected to be around 70 degrees, but temperatures will struggle to reach 50 degrees on Monday. Temperatures could tumble to near-freezing by Tuesday morning, which could end up being Atlanta’s coldest morning since February.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the East will remain quite chilly on Tuesday. It’s likely to be the coldest day of the stretch for Washington, DC, and New York City. High temperatures in both cities could be about 15 degrees below normal, with Washington, DC, in the mid-40s and New York City in the low-40s.\n \n\n   \n  This cold snap won’t stick around long though: Temperatures in much of the central US will quickly rebound to near or even above normal on Tuesday and most of the East will follow suit on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n    Snow chances still hazy\n \n\n   \n  The blast of Arctic air could set up some places to get their first measurable snow event of the year, but exactly where – and how much – is still coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  The typical snow belts downwind of the Great Lakes are so far the most likely to achieve this feat later this weekend into next week, with lake-effect possible after the cold front swings over the lakes   on Sunday. Some snow could accumulate in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York through Monday night.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the possibility that the same storminess that’s likely to bring some sloppy weather to Minneapolis at the start of the weekend organizes into a storm that could drop a quick stripe of snow through the Midwest early next week. It’s looking less likely than the chances for lake-effect snow, but still bears watching in the coming days.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/science/full-moon-southern-taurid-meteor-shower","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"08:18:00.000-05:00","title":"Fireballs and a full moon.

Here’s how to see two celestial events this week \n       \n  By Gina Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:18 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Get ready for a double celestial event this week.\n \n\n   \n  November’s full beaver supermoon will peak at 8:19 a.m. ET Wednesday, according to  The Old Farmer’s Almanac . But the silvery orb will be below the horizon at that time, so take the time to look outside during the evening hours for the best view.\n \n\n   \n  The moniker  beaver moon  marks the time of year when beavers begin preparing for the winter by fortifying dams and lodges and stocking up on food. This full moon is also referred to as the digging moon by the Tlingit people, deer rutting moon by the Dakota and frost moon by the Cree, according to the almanac.\n \n\n   \n  This lunar event will be the second of three back-to-back supermoons this year. A supermoon happens when the moon reaches perigee, or its  nearest point  to our planet, making it appear larger and fuller.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so subtle that the human eye does not pick up the superness of it. But we still give it a fun name, I guess, to indicate that technically, this is the moon at its biggest and brightest, just not that much bigger on average than it usually is,” said Dr. Alissa Bans, director of undergraduate studies of Emory University’s department of physics.\n \n\n   \n  If clouds obscure the view in your area, the Virtual Telescope Project will share a  livestream of the full moon  over Manciano, Italy, beginning at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n    Keep an eye out for fireballs\n \n\n   \n  The second celestial event this week is the Southern Taurid meteor shower, which will peak at 8 a.m. ET Wednesday, according to  EarthSky .\n \n\n   \n  This meteor shower does not have a strong peak — there may only be five meteors an hour, said Robert Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the American Meteorological Society. “But anytime it’s dark in that period (October through early November), you’ll be able to see these slow meteors coming from the constellation of Aries in October and Taurids in November.”\n \n\n   \n  The Taurids are the result of Earth’s passing through debris left by the small comet  2P/Encke . It has the shortest orbit of any comet that’s been discovered — just 3.3 years, compared with long-period comets that have orbits lasting between 200 and 1,000 years. In previous years, this meteor shower has produced fireballs during Halloween, so they’ve also been called the “Halloween fireballs.”\n \n\n   \n  “The entire encounter with Taurids this year is special because we’re predicted to encounter some fresh material that’s a little bit larger than your average Taurid meteor. And these tend to cause fireballs,” Lunsford said.\n \n\n   \n  For those planning to look for these meteors, they may be difficult to spot since the moonlight will drown out most activity, but there is still a chance to see a fireball, Lunsford said.\n \n\n   \n  For best viewing, find an area with clear skies away from tall buildings and bright lights. You should aim to be outside any time after the sun sets and before the moon reaches its highest point Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “They slightly favor the Northern Hemisphere, but they are visible in both (hemispheres). Your only problem down in Australia or South Africa is the radiant is lower in the sky, so more of the Taurid meteors will be obscured by the horizon,” Lunsford said.\n \n\n   \n    Upcoming meteor showers\n \n\n   \n  Here are the peak dates of other meteor showers anticipated this year, according to the  American Meteor Society  and  EarthSky . \n \n\n   \n    Upcoming supermoons\n \n\n   \n  Look out for  the last full supermoon  this year:\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/jay-jones-wins-virginia-ag","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:17:00-05:00","title":"Jay Jones will become Virginia’s next attorney general, overcoming disclosure of violent text messages","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jay Jones, a Democrat, won the Virginia attorney general election by overcoming public backlash over text messages in which he suggested that a former legislative colleague, Todd Gilbert, should be shot and made offensive comparisons to dictators.

Gov.  Winsome Earle-Sears  after running a campaign focused on affordability and addressing  local concerns about the impact of federal job cuts and the government shutdown  on a state with more than 300,000 US government employees. Spanberger also frequently tied Earle-Sears to President Donald Trump, labeling the Republican as a Trump acolyte  even though the president didn’t endorse her .\n \n\n   \n  Her victory will flip control from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and gives national Democrats a boost as they try to respond to the second Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also a boost for centrists in the Democratic Party who have fought to establish themselves as a key part of the Democratic coalition due to their ability to win in swing districts and purple states. Along with Mikie Sherrill, who CNN projected won the race for New Jersey governor on Tuesday, Spanberger represents what many Democratic leaders believe is a model for reversing Trump’s gains by running more moderate candidates with backgrounds in national security and public service.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger’s victory came as Democrats swept all three statewide positions up in this year’s election. CNN projected  Ghazala Hashmi  as the winner of Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, putting her on a path to become the nation’s first Muslim woman elected to statewide office. And in the attorney general’s race,  Jay Jones  overcame the disclosure of text messages in which he suggested a former legislative colleague should be shot, and CNN projected he will unseat incumbent Jason Miyares.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, 46, is a mother of three who served in law enforcement and the CIA before entering politics. She was first elected to Virginia’s 7th Congressional District after  beating former Rep. Dave Brat , who shocked onetime House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary, and served three terms before leaving the House this year.\n \n\n   \n  She came out to huge cheers from her supporters at her election night event Tuesday night after CNN projected the Democrat would win Virginia’s governor race.\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight we sent a message,” she said. “We sent a message to every corner of the commonwealth, a message to our neighbors and our fellow Americans across the country. We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship.”\n \n\n   \n  The first woman governor-elect said, “A few minutes ago, Adam said to our daughters, ‘Your mom’s going to be the governor of Virginia,’ and I can guarantee those words have never been spoken in Virginia ever before.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is a big deal that the girls and the young women I have met along the campaign trail now know with certainty that they can achieve anything,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In campaign messaging, Spanberger frequently touted her desire to bring people together and keep communities safe. Her law enforcement background led her to receive the coveted endorsement of Virginia’s Police Benevolent Association, even though the same group endorsed the Republican ticket four years ago. The Virginia PBA this year endorsed Republicans for lieutenant governor and attorney general.\n \n\n   \n  She remained a  disciplined messenger , focusing on economic issues while hitting Earle-Sears on social issues such as abortion access and same-sex marriage. Her ads aimed to portray Earle-Sears as a strident, inflexible conservative and often used versions of the same clip of Earle-Sears telling an unruly crowd, “I am speaking!”\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears tried to recreate  Youngkin’s winning playbook  from four years ago against Democrat Terry McAuliffe, emphasizing deregulatory initiatives that would expand Virginia’s workforce. But she faced doubts from members of her own party throughout the contest about her campaign strategy and was running in a year when a Republican leads the White House. Historically, the party that doesn’t control Washington most often prevails in Virginia’s gubernatorial election.\n \n\n   \n  An immigrant from Jamaica who served in the Marines, Earle-Sears holds socially conservative views on abortion and same-sex marriage. She made transgender youths’ participation in sports and policies around their use of public-school bathrooms a core focus, frequently appearing alongside concerned parents at news conferences across the state.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger declined repeatedly to get into specifics on these issues, saying she preferred local schools and districts enact their own policies.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/election-takeaways-new-york-new-jersey-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:51:00.000-05:00","title":"Takeaways from Tuesday’s elections: Democrats win across the spectrum as voters reject Trump","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a sweeping victory across the East Coast, Democrats defeated President Donald Trump’s influence in key states including Virginia, New Jersey, New York, and California.

Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:51 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Voters up and down the East Coast  delivered Democrats a sweep  on Tuesday, electing candidates across the party’s ideological spectrum in a vivid show of discontent with President Donald Trump nearly a year into his second term.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, moderate former Rep.  Abigail Spanberger  turned in the strongest Democratic performance in the state’s recent history as she coasted to victory. And in New Jersey, another moderate, Rep.  Mikie Sherrill , busted apart the coalition Trump and her Republican rival, former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli, had put together to close the Garden State’s gap in recent elections.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, democratic socialist  Zohran Mamdani’s win  marked the second time this year he’d defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo — first in the Democratic primary, and then in the general election, with Cuomo running as an independent backed by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic wins by candidates with sharp ideological differences will do little to settle the party’s long-raging internal debate about its way forward, with a host of competitive midterm primaries just months away and the 2028 presidential primary already looming.\n \n\n   \n  But their campaigns had some things in common. Though their solutions were different, the candidates focused on the issue of affordability. And they were all fiercely critical of Trump’s performance.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not just a message about Democrats; it’s a message about our entire country. I think Americans are appalled by what they are seeing coming out of this administration,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN from Mamdani’s victory party.\n \n\n   \n  In California,  voters approved  by a wide margin a redistricting ballot measure intended to boost Democrats’ chances in next year’s battle for control of the House. And in Pennsylvania, Democratic state Supreme Court justices won their retention votes, allowing Democrats to keep their majority on the high court in a perennial battleground state where legal challenges over voting rules are all but certain.\n \n\n   \n  Here are six initial takeaways from Tuesday’s elections:\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani defeats Cuomo — again\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani drew immense national attention over his progressive ideology and his courtship of voters who were eager for a fresh face. But in New York City, his relentless focus on driving down costs might have proven more persuasive — and voters were on course to give his forthcoming efforts a boost by also approving a series of ballot measures intended to reduce red tape on building affordable housing.\n \n\n   \n  If he delivers on his promises, it would turn New York City into a blueprint for cities across the country where the cost of living has soared. If Mamdani fails, he could be used as a warning against progressives more broadly as the 2028 presidential primary approaches.\n \n\n   \n  For Cuomo, who was attempting a political comeback after resigning from the governor’s office in 2021, the outcome was an embarrassment. It was also a failure for Trump, who late in the race supported Cuomo rather than Republican Curtis Sliwa, saying Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that “if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time.”\n \n\n   \n    A big suburban swing\n \n\n   \n  The first big win for Democrats on Tuesday came in Virginia, where Spanberger, a former CIA officer who had won a competitive congressional district in 2018 and held it until retiring this year to focus on the governor’s race, pulled away from Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n \n\n   \n  One window into her dominance came in Loudoun County — a closely-watched mix of suburbs and exurbs in Northern Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  With most of the expected vote counted there at 9 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday, Spanberger had more than 64% of the vote there. That was 8 percentage points better than former Vice President Kamala Harris did in the 2024 presidential election, and 9 points better than the party’s losing 2021 gubernatorial nominee, Terry McAuliffe. Spanberger was nearly 5 points ahead of former Gov. Ralph Northam’s performance in Loudoun County in 2017 — a big Democratic win in Trump’s first term that presaged the party’s strong 2018 midterm performance.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger outperformed recent Democratic candidates across the map in Virginia, likely fueled in part by the Trump administration’s gutting of the federal workforce. Thousands of current and former federal workers live throughout the region.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s exit poll found that Spanberger won 61% of the vote of those who have a federal worker or federal contractor in their household, compared to 52% support from those who do not.\n \n\n   \n  Her margins were large enough to pull Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general who was rocked by the disclosure of text messages in which he suggested a former legislative colleague should be shot, across the finish line, even though he lagged Spanberger by about 5 points. Jones defeated Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.\n \n\n   \n    A barrier falls in Virginia\n \n\n   \n  No matter the outcome, Virginia’s election was going to make history: The winner would become the first woman to serve as its governor.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger noted that history, relaying to supporters that her husband had told their children that their mother would become the governor of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “I can guarantee, those words have never been spoken in Virginia before,” she said. “It’s a big deal that the girls and young women I have met along the campaign trail now know with certainty they can achieve anything.”\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey reveals anti-Trump sentiment\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, candidate quality was a factor in the outcome, as Republicans grumbled for months about their nominee, Earle-Sears.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey was a different story.\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli had a strong statewide performance under his belt after his near-miss in the 2021 governor’s race. He also had his own brand — a “Jersey guy” appeal that he hoped would give him some separation from Trump, despite the president’s endorsement, Ciattarelli’s praise for his performance in office and Democrats’ relentless advertising campaign tying him to Trump in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000.\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, those realities made New Jersey the better barometer of anti-Trump sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  One key question was whether Ciattarelli could replicate Trump’s performance with Latino voters: They swung hard in the GOP’s favor nationally last November, with the president winning 46% support to Harris’ 51% with Latinos, CNN’s exit poll found. On Tuesday in New Jersey, the answer was no: Sherrill won 64% of Latino voters to Ciattarelli’s 32%, per CNN’s exit poll.\n \n\n   \n  She also won 91% of Black voters. And she won independents by a 7-point margin. Moderates backed Sherrill, 58% to 39%.\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli won handily among the 34% of voters who said taxes was the most important issue facing New Jersey. But 32% said the economy — which Republicans had hoped would be a strength, since the state is currently controlled by Democrats — was the most important issue, and those voters backed Sherrill, 61% to 37%, according to CNN’s exit poll.\n \n\n   \n    Newsom’s big redistricting moment\n \n\n   \n  California voters gave Democrats’ hopes of winning a House majority in next year’s midterms a massive boost on Tuesday — and gave Gov. Gavin Newsom  a signature moment  on the national stage, demonstrating to Democratic voters that he can stand up to Trump ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s voters approved a ballot measure that would scrap the current congressional district boundaries drawn by an independent commission in favor of new maps that would hand Democrats five more favorable districts.\n \n\n   \n  The mid-decade redistricting is Newsom’s answer to Texas, which redrew its maps in an effort to hand the GOP five more winnable districts at Trump’s behest as the president searched for ways to retain the GOP’s narrow House majority next year.\n \n\n   \n  Amid a short but pitched advertising battle ahead of the vote, Newsom made himself the face of the redistricting effort. He raised $108 million for the effort, and appeared in advertisements backing it. He pitched it in a series of interviews and podcast appearances.\n \n\n   \n  “With Prop 50, The Election Rigging Response Act, we can stop Trump cold,” Newsom said in one spot, standing in front of an American flag. National audiences may be seeing him a lot more in the years to come.\n \n\n   \n    Down-ballot Democratic wins\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the big-ticket victories in Virginia, New Jersey, New York and California, Democrats won lower-profile contests that could pay dividends in the years to come.\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Supreme Court justices retained their seats for new 10-year terms — preserving the party’s court majority in a state where presidential elections can be won and lost, and voting rules are regularly challenged.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s elections also had ramifications for the national redistricting arms race. Democrats are on track to expand their narrow majority in the Virginia House of Delegates, clearing the way for the party to pursue a constitutional amendment that would allow them to draw new congressional maps.\n \n\n   \n  And in Maine, a critical state in next year’s battle for Senate control, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have required voters to present photo identification at the polls and when requesting absentee ballots, among other restrictive measures.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/pennsylvania-supreme-court-retention-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:23:00+00:00","title":"Democrats defend Pennsylvania Supreme Court majority in a race with 2028 implications","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pennsylvania Democrats successfully retained a liberal majority on the state Supreme Court in a high-stakes retention vote, preventing a Republican shift in the 5-2 ideological balance.

 7:28 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Zohran Mamdani, the  34-year-old democratic socialist  whose focus on working-class issues and personal magnetism attracted a diverse coalition of supporters to propel a  once-underdog campaign , has won New York City’s general election race for mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani beat former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for a second time, shattering the political scion’s hopes of a comeback after his loss to Mamdani in the June Democratic primary. Also  running in the general election  was Republican Curtis Sliwa, who refused to end his campaign despite pressure from Cuomo and his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Coming out to cheers at his election night event in Brooklyn, Mamdani told his supporters they have ushered in a “new age” of politics in the city.\n \n\n   \n  “For as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well connected that power does not belong in their hands, fingers bruised from lifting boxes on the warehouse floor,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Palms calloused from delivery by candle bars. Knuckles scarred with kitchen burns. These are not hands that have been allowed to hold power. And yet, over the last 12 months, you have dared to reach for something greater,” Mamdani said. “Tonight, against all odds, we have grasped it.”\n \n\n   \n  He told supporters they “have toppled a political dynasty,” referring to Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  “I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life,” Mamdani said. “But let tonight be the final time I utter his name.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s win marks a victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party at a time when national Democrats are divided over how to counter President Donald Trump. The president is himself a native New Yorker who has falsely derided Mamdani as a “communist” and suggested he’d “take over” the city if he is elected.\n \n\n   \n  “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him, and if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power,” Mamdani said after his victory. “This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one.”\n \n\n   \n  The results are likely to echo far beyond New York City, elevating both Mamdani’s profile and platform, including his proposals to freeze the rent for New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments, make public buses free to ride and provide universal childcare by taxing the wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s win completes a meteoric rise a year after the state assemblyman launched his bid for mayor, promising to make the most expensive city in the country affordable for its working class.\n \n\n   \n    Who is Zohran Mamdani?\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani is a three-term state assemblyman who entered the mayor’s race as one of several apparent also-rans to what appeared to be Cuomo’s race to lose.\n \n\n   \n  Born in Uganda and first raised in Cape Town, South Africa, Mamdani moved to New York City when he was 7. He attended the prestigious Bronx High School of Science and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bowdoin College. He is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker whose credits include “Mississippi Masala” and “Monsoon Wedding.”\n \n\n   \n  Before becoming an assemblyman, Mamdani was a housing counselor and self-described C-list rapper who went by the name “Mr. Cardamom.” His short-lived music career was sometimes front and center in his opponent’s attack ads.\n \n\n   \n  The music video for “Nani,” a rap song where Mamdani pays homage to his grandma and New York City’s South Asian culture, also shows him shirtless, donning only an apron, looking directly at the camera while he rocks side to side. The image was plastered across anti-Mamdani campaign ads to poke fun at his past music career and his lack of governmental experience.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Epstein, a campaign aide, noted that Mamdani’s rapping career helped him indirectly in his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “An incredible asset for anybody seeking to run for office is bravery in the face of embarrassment and being able to push through the natural inclination many of us have not to kind of introduce themselves to strangers or do things in a kind of silly way in front of them,” Epstein told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Mamdani made a steady climb in the mayor’s race by producing a constant stream of social media videos, including interviews with voters who had supported Trump in 2024 due to the high cost of living. He ran a groundbreaking digital campaign in which he spoke in multiple languages and connected with supporters with a message anchored to affordability.  During the campaign, Mamdani, who natively speaks Urdu, released campaign videos in Bangla, Spanish, and Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  One of his most memorable viral videos tackled what the candidate referred to as “halal-flation.” He set out to interview street meat vendors about the high cost of running a street food business in New York City. With a mouthful of rice and halal meat, Mamdani detailed how an arcane permit system in the city is in part to blame for the prices of what should be cheap street food.\n \n\n   \n  “This was one of the coldest nights of the year, bitterly cold,” Epstein recalled recently. “We were downtown by Zuccotti Park near Wall Street and Zohran just asking people on the street, ‘Would you rather pay $10 or $8 for halal?’ People were pushing through trying to get home, you know, it was rejection over and over and over and over again, but it never fazed him.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani was cutting into Cuomo’s lead in public polling by the June primary. The city’s traditional power brokers, including the real estate and business sectors concerned with Mamdani’s democratic socialist identity, banded together in support of Cuomo and donated millions of dollars to anti-Mamdani super PACs. Business leaders argued Mamdani would drive wealthy New Yorkers out and discourage businesses from operating in the nation’s financial capital.\n \n\n   \n  Their push ultimately helped Mamdani cast his campaign as a fight between working-class people and billionaires.\n \n\n   \n  Still, his primary victory shocked much of the political world.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think the line is so much between progressives and moderates. It’s between fighters and fakers,” said city comptroller Brad Lander, who ran against Mamdani but allied with him under the primary’s ranked-choice voting system. “What Zohran is showing is that it’s worth putting up big bold ideas for change, standing up and fighting for them, and that’s pretty hopeful. Yes, he’s a democratic socialist, but he had a bold vision for the future of the city and that excited people.”\n \n\n   \n    The general election campaign\n \n\n   \n  After taking a vacation in Uganda to celebrate his wedding, Mamdani returned to a city mourning the deaths of New York police officer Didarul Islam and three others in a Midtown Manhattan shooting. He was confronted with his years of tweets criticizing the police, including references to law enforcement as racist and wicked and calling for them to be defunded.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not defunding the police. I am not running to defund the police,” he would tell reporters after meeting with Islam’s family, part of an overall shift away from anti-police rhetoric that culminated in recent weeks with his commitment to retain the current police commissioner, Jessica Tisch.\n \n\n   \n  He also reached out to New York’s Jewish community, roiled by his criticisms of Israel’s government and questions about democratic socialism. Mamdani is an outspoken advocate for  Palestinian rights, a supporter of the movement to boycott and divest from Israel and a fierce critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  “I hate my choices,” said Cydney Schwartz, a 33-year-old liberal Democrat who has lived in Israel and was in line to cast an early vote. She declined to say who she chose.\n \n\n   \n    The last days of the campaign\n \n\n   \n  In the closing days of the campaign, Mamdani referred to the race as a choice between “oligarchy and democracy.”  His omnipresence on the campaign trail was on display during the last days of the race and in the lead-up to the last weekend of early voting in the city.\n \n\n   \n  As more than half a million New Yorkers turned out to cast their votes early, Mamdani was everywhere: He was in church in the morning, calling into radio shows midday, stopping into ethnic supermarkets in the outer boroughs, popping up on influencer live streams, joining a Union Square freestyle rap battle and capping off his Saturday with a whirlwind tour of the city’s nightclub scene.\n \n\n   \n  Paying homage to the city that never sleeps, Mamdani appeared to hardly do so either, stopping at six nightclubs in Brooklyn just to do it all over again on the last Sunday of early voting. He attended a church service with his parents, met campaign volunteers before stopping on the sidelines of the New York City Marathon, went to Queens for a meet-up with Gov. Kathy Hochul to cheer on the Buffalo Bills, and popped up in the nosebleeds of Madison Square Garden for a New York Knicks game.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo also campaigned across the city. Notably, he tried to cut into Mamdani’s core support of South Asian and Muslim voters by highlighting Mamdani’s opposition to criminal penalties for prostitution. He also laughed when a radio host suggested Mamdani would cheer another 9/11 attack, drawing allegations from Mamdani and others that he was playing to Islamophobia. Cuomo denied he was doing so.\n \n\n   \n  Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams ended his independent bid and endorsed Cuomo. But Cuomo was unable to push Sliwa, the Republican nominee, out of the race, denying anti-Mamdani voters the chance to consolidate behind one opponent. Sliwa repeatedly and colorfully vowed he would die before making way for Cuomo, arguing he owed it to his supporters to keep running.\n \n\n   \n  For Cuomo, Tuesday’s results are likely a coda to a long and eventful political career. He was governor of New York for nearly 11 years before resigning in 2021 after he was accused of sexual harassment, allegations he has denied, and amid criticism of how his administration handled Covid-19 cases in nursing homes. Running for mayor, Cuomo leaned into his executive experience, often pointing out Mamdani’s short career in politics and relative lack of work history.\n \n\n   \n  He relaunched his mayoral bid as an independent after losing to Mamdani in June. He remained focused on public safety, promising to hire additional police officers and build more housing. Cuomo, who has a longstanding relationship with Trump, also sought to portray himself as the better candidate to fend off the president’s attacks on New York City.\n \n\n   \n    A history-making mayor\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani will be inaugurated on January 1, 2026. He inherits a deeply complex city home to 8.5 million people, a large bureaucracy, a municipal workforce of roughly 300,000 and a city budget of $115 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani will make history as New York City’s first Muslim mayor, the first South Asian to hold the office and one of the youngest mayors elected in modern times. He recently married Rama Duwaji, an artist of Syrian descent who was born in Texas and moved to New York City to complete a master’s degree in illustration. Duwaji skipped traditional campaigning alongside her husband on the trail and while it remains unclear whether she will have any role in his administration, at 28, she will be the first member of Gen Z to serve as New York City’s first lady.\n \n\n   \n  While Mamdani’s identity as both an immigrant and a South Asian New Yorker was central to his campaign, his connection to that community began to take shape long before he launched his run for City Hall. He first made national headlines in 2021 when he joined New York City cab drivers on a 15-day hunger strike seeking relief from excessive debt.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has a strong connection to the cab driver community in New York City, which is largely made up of immigrants, including thousands of South Asians who were among his fiercest supporters. In the last days of the campaign, Mamdani made a stop at LaGuardia Airport’s taxi stand at midnight, catching cabbies at shift change.\n \n\n   \n  “Without the night shift, there is no morning,” Mamdani told them.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/ghazala-hashmi-virginia-lt-governor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:15:00-04:00","title":"Ghazala Hashmi wins Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming first Muslim woman elected statewide","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ghazala Hashmi, a Richmond-area state senator and Democrat, has won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming the nation’s first Muslim woman elected to a statewide office and Virginia’s first Indian American in that role.

Ghazala Hashmi wins Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming first Muslim woman elected statewide \n       \n  By Eva McKend, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:15 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming the nation’s first Muslim woman elected to statewide office.\n \n\n   \n  Hashmi will defeat Republican John Reid, a former conservative talk show host and the state’s first gay statewide nominee. As lieutenant governor, she will preside over the state Senate and be able to break ties in the chamber. The role could be crucial because with her seat vacant, Democrats will have a narrow 20-19 advantage with Hashmi leaving the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  A Richmond-area state senator who helped flip the chamber in 2019, Hashmi campaigned on promises to stand up to the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  She is also Virginia’s first Indian American elected statewide.\n \n\n   \n  Virginia is one of  17 states  where lieutenant governors are elected separately from governors, though it’s been 20 years since different parties won the offices.\n \n\n   \n  Lieutenant governors – including current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears – have used the position as a springboard for gubernatorial campaigns in a state where governors are barred from serving consecutive terms.\n \n\n   \n  Hashmi defeated five primary challengers in June, narrowly winning the nomination with 28% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  She’s since campaigned with the others on the Democratic ticket, gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger and candidate for attorney general Jay Jones. After  news  of Jones’ violent text messages broke, she condemned the messages but like most other Democrats stopped short of telling him to drop out.\n \n\n   \n  She largely ignored her opponent’s regular attacks and accusations that she was ducking debates with him. The two never met in a face-to-face moderated debate, prompting Reid to  debate an AI representation  of her in October.\n \n\n   \n  Elected in 2019 to the state senate, Hashmi defeated a Republican incumbent and helped flip the chamber, becoming the chamber’s first Muslim and Indian American in the process.\n \n\n   \n  In that first campaign, she cited the first Trump administration’s Muslim ban as a motivator to run for office.\n \n\n   \n  Reid made cultural issues around education and transgender students central to his campaign, playing off Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s success on a parents’ rights platform. He also announced a plan to help laid-off federal workers and promised to preserve Virginia’s so-called Right to Work law prohibiting workplaces from requiring their employees to join their union. While Reid has supported President Donald Trump, he never received Trump’s endorsement.\n \n\n   \n   The headline has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/pentagon-civilians-pay-stress","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00Z","title":"Civilians at the Pentagon Continue Missing Paychecks While Working Alongside Troops Getting Paid","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a record-breaking government shutdown in 2025, civilians in the Defense Department — many of whom are veterans or military family members — are struggling with unpaid paychecks, furloughs, and deteriorating morale.

the Pentagon continue missing paychecks while working alongside troops getting paid \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the US  passes the record  for the longest government shutdown in history on Wednesday, civilian employees of the Defense Department — many of whom are veterans and military family members — are questioning how the agency is treating their federal service as some struggle to make ends meet amid missed paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Eight Defense Department civilians, stationed everywhere from Hawaii to Germany, told CNN morale is low and falling fast as the government shutdown drags on with no clear end in sight. Several said they and others they know are actively looking to leave federal service after years or even decades of prior commitment, while others said they feel a responsibility to stay despite the increasingly hostile environment they find themselves in.\n \n\n   \n  Almost all of the civilians who spoke to CNN are veterans themselves. As of 2021, nearly half of the Pentagon’s civilian employees were veterans. That can add an additional layer of frustration to how civilians have been spoken about and treated as they work side by side with those in uniform keeping the Defense Department running.\n \n\n   \n  “Me and my veteran friends are like, do they not know? When you disrespect the civilians who are working in federal service, do they not know that so many of them are actually veterans?” one Navy veteran who is a Defense Department civilian in Hawaii told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a slap in the face,” said another civilian who works in human resources overseas, and who is a military spouse and parent.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense Department employs nearly a million civilian employees, more than half of whom are continuing to work during the shutdown. A majority of those who are still working aren’t getting paid. Hundreds of thousands more – 334,900 according to agency contingency plans – have been furloughed and aren’t working nor receiving paychecks while the government lacks spending authority.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, despite a lack of Congressional action to provide funding, the Trump administration has  moved money between accounts  to pay service members in uniform during the shutdown, though it’s unclear where funds will come from for future paychecks. Unpaid civilians have in at least some cases also been the ones processing payment for their military counterparts, the civilian working in HR said.\n \n\n   \n  Each of the civilians who spoke to CNN said they find great value and pride in their work for the US military; several described a deep commitment to serving their country as a civilian after leaving their own time in uniform. DoD civilians serve as medical professionals at military hospitals, firefighters on military bases, intelligence analysts and teachers at on-base schools for military children, among other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  But they said the rhetoric around government civilians throughout this year by the Trump administration, and the seemingly constant efforts to cut down the civilian workforce, has left them feeling abandoned by leaders they say don’t understand the critical nature of their work.\n \n\n   \n  One civilian – a military veteran – described concerns for US national security the longer the shutdown drags on. A person’s debt and financial concerns are a key question in the process to get a security clearance, they explained, and many civilians are being forced to take out loans to stay afloat while missing paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the things we look for when it comes to counterintelligence threats, insider threats, is financial hardship,” the civilian said. “And I am in a building surrounded by super top-secret operations, and people who are running the f**k out of money.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to an email outlining the concerns civilians voiced in this article, Pentagon press secretary Kinglsey Wilson said the reporting was a “completely off base and partisan story devoid of facts.”\n \n\n   \n  “If [Defense Department] civilians are upset about anything, it’s the Democrats voting over a dozen times to withhold their pay, making it hard for our federal workers and uniformed servicemembers to pay rent, enjoy Thanksgiving, and buy Christmas presents for their children,” Wilson said.\n \n\n   \n  Several civilians who spoke to CNN expressed exhaustion at what has been a year full of hurdles for those who just want to do their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Being in human resources, the civilian working in HR overseas and their coworkers have become counselors at times, they told CNN, as people have been repeatedly pushed to tears navigating the stress of wondering how to pay rent or their child’s college tuition back home. Suicide “has come up several times,” the civilian said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s humiliating,” the civilian said bluntly. “As much as I love my country, as much as I love my Department of Defense and Department of the Army, I have never felt so humiliated and degraded in my life.”\n \n\n   \n  While several civilians said they are actively looking to leave federal service to find more stability there is also a sense of anxiety with how their replacements might respond to the current pressures of working for the Pentagon.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m nervous about how they will behave when told to do something that maybe they shouldn’t do,” a senior Army veteran-turned-civilian said. “I have the luxury that if I’m given an order that I feel is illegal, unethical, or immoral, saying f**k you I’m not doing that. I don’t know if the next person will feel that way.”\n \n\n   \n    Months of pressure\n \n\n   \n  Almost from the very start of the Trump administration, many of the civilians who spoke to CNN said, they felt their value being diminished.\n \n\n   \n  Federal agencies began pushing buyouts and delayed resignation programs in an attempt to shrink the civilian workforce, leaving many angry and confused. Wilson said in her statement to CNN that civilians who took the delayed resignation opportunity, a key feature of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency effort that aimed to find massive cost saving across government, “are happy because they got a great deal.”\n \n\n   \n  Employees also began receiving instructions to send in five bullet points explaining what they’d done that week, with little to no clarity on where those lists were going, who would be reviewing them, or what it was exactly that they wanted to see.\n \n\n   \n  In her statement, Wilson said that in “all jobs, whether government or not, tracking metrics and submitting reports is the norm.” But the Navy veteran-turned-civilian employee in Hawaii rejected the idea that the five-bullet-points ask was standard, if only because there was so little clarity on how the reports would be used.\n \n\n   \n  “We had seen how our peers were getting let go from their jobs for seemingly not big deals, it put all of us on notice. The rhetoric in which they were talking about civilian service put all of us on notice – that we were replaceable, our service didn’t matter,” the civilian said. “So sure, [the five bullet points] wasn’t a big deal, but they had already proven that tasks that were not a big deal were fireable offenses.”\n \n\n   \n  Several civilians working outside of the continental US told CNN a deep sense of anxiety and distrust set in after watching counterparts at USAID, for example, get abruptly laid off and left to facilitate and fund their own move back to the US on short notice. CNN  reported in February  that scores of USAID employees around the globe — some in dangerous areas — were left scrambling and in shock as they were abruptly locked out of secure systems and left to manage the next steps alone.\n \n\n   \n  Another DOD civilian, also a Navy veteran who is serving overseas, told CNN that watching the dismantling of USAID was “terrifying,” particularly given the surprising nature of so many announcements at the beginning of the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “That really set the tone for a lot of us overseas, in a no-shit panic,” the civilian said, adding that panic has “ebbed and flowed” ever since.\n \n\n   \n  In February, the Pentagon began requiring supervisors to submit lists of probationary civilian employees for potential termination, while some defense officials started raising concerns that the broad firings could harm US military readiness and even break the law. Officials scrambled to create lists of workers who should be exempted from the firings because of their crucial roles in intelligence, cyber security operations or other important national security issues.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon eventually announced its intention to fire 5-8% of its civilian workforce, and thus far the agency has reduced its payrolls by more than 50,000 employees mainly by not backfilling when civilians have retired or otherwise left federal service.\n \n\n   \n  The civilians who spoke to CNN described what they see as both a total lack of understanding – and lack of interest in learning – what civilians do for the US military. One explained that civilians make up the majority of the military intelligence workforce; another, who is also an Army veteran, recalled civilians regularly being alongside him during combat deployments over the last two decades.\n \n\n   \n  The US military would “grind to a halt” without DOD civilians, a second Army veteran-turned-DOD civilian said.\n \n\n   \n  “You will not have intelligence feeding operations the way it’s supposed to, you will not have operations planned so that people are where they need to be at the right time, you will not have products and materiel where it should be in order to engage in a fight,” they added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/nj-governor-mikie-sherrill-wins","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:01:00-05:00","title":"Democrat Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor’s race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democrat Mikie Sherrill has won the 2025 New Jersey governor’s race, becoming the first female Democratic governor in the state’s history and marking a significant Democratic resurgence one year after Trump narrowed his margin of defeat in the state.

AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democratic Rep.  Mikie Sherrill  won the race for governor in New Jersey, maintaining Democratic control of the seat one year after the state showed signs of shifting toward President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill, who will be the first female Democratic governor in the state’s history, defeated Republican nominee  Jack Ciattarelli , a former state assemblyman and Trump ally making his third run for governor. She is set to follow the term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, marking the first time a party has held the governor’s office in New Jersey for more than two full consecutive terms in the last 50 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s victory likely will be viewed as a repudiation of Trump’s first year in office and demonstrates the Democratic Party’s staying power in New Jersey even as it rebuilds on the national level.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill put opposition to Trump and his agenda at the center of her campaign messaging, often linking Ciattarelli to the Republican president. She hewed to moderate policies and prioritized cost-of-living concerns, including rolling out plans to address  skyrocketing utility costs  in the state.\n \n\n   \n  Along with Abigail Spanberger, who won the race for Virginia governor on Tuesday, Sherrill represents what many Democratic leaders believe is a model for reversing Trump’s gains by running more moderate candidates with backgrounds in national security and public service.\n \n\n   \n  Her win comes a year after Trump made significant gains in the state in the 2024 election. Trump lost New Jersey by 6 points to former Vice President Kamala Harris but reduced his margin of defeat by 10 points compared with 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Polling leading up to the race showed Sherrill with a narrow edge over Ciattarelli, but she eventually won the race by a margin of double digits.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill, a 53-year-old attorney and mother of four, was first elected to Congress in 2018 as part of a blue wave in Trump’s first term in office. A former Navy helicopter pilot, Sherrill featured her military experience in her campaign advertisements, saying in one TV spot, “I know the world feels like it is on fire right now, but I was trained in the Navy that in a crisis, you run to the fight.”\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli, meanwhile, sought to tie Sherrill to the outgoing Democratic administration in Trenton, which he blamed for high energy costs, and to progressive Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City. Ciattarelli, a former critic of Trump, embraced the president throughout much of his campaign,  saying in one debate  that Trump’s second-term performance deserved an “A” grade.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill held a slight edge in public polling over Ciattarelli for most of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch, the candidates traded increasingly personal and heated attacks.\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli  amplified a story  about Sherrill not walking at her graduation from the Naval Academy as punishment connected to a massive cheating scandal, prompting the New Jersey Democrat to defend her military service. Sherrill’s unredacted military records were also mistakenly released by a branch of the National Archives, prompting calls for investigations from her Democratic allies.\n \n\n   \n  In their final debate, Sherrill attempted to blame Ciattarelli for “tens of thousands” of opioid deaths in New Jersey, arguing that his medical publishing company produced materials misleading people about the risks of opioid abuse. Ciattarelli’s campaign strongly pushed back on the claim, at one point threatening to sue Sherrill.\n \n\n   \n  Outside Democratic and Republican groups poured millions of dollars into the race, making it the most expensive gubernatorial contest in New Jersey history. High-profile surrogates campaigned for the candidates in the final stretch.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/health/covid-vaccine-federal-recommendations-kff-health-news","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Conflicting advice on Covid shots likely to ding already low vaccine rates, experts warn","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite the significant public health risks posed by covid, vaccination rates in the U.S. have dropped sharply, especially among young adults, Hispanic and Black populations, and those in Republican-leaning states.

About 75% of Americans had received  at least one dose  of the first versions of the vaccine by early 2022, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. But only about 23% of American adults got a covid shot during the 2024-25 virus season, well below the 47% of American adults who got a flu shot. The vaccination rates for  flu ,  measles , and tetanus are also going down.\n \n\n   \n  Yet covid remains a serious, potentially deadly health risk, listed as the primary cause of death on roughly 31,400 death certificates last year. By comparison, flu killed  about 6,500  people and pneumonia, a common complication of the flu, killed  an additional 41,600 ,  CDC data shows .\n \n\n   \n  As millions of Americans decide whether to get a covid shot this season, public health researchers worry vaccination rates will slide further, especially because Hispanic and Black Americans and those under 30 have lower rates, exposing them to serious complications such as long covid. Under the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the federal government has narrowed its recommendations on the covid vaccine, leading to a hodgepodge of rules on pharmacy access, with Americans living in Republican states often facing more barriers to getting a shot.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of misinformation is going around regarding covid,” said  Alein Haro-Ramos , an assistant professor of health, society, and behavior at the University of California-Irvine. “Vaccine hesitancy is going to increase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Food and Drug Administration  narrowed approval  for covid vaccines to those 65 or older and to adults and children with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for serious complications from covid.\n \n\n   \n  A month later, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  voted to recommend  “shared clinical decision-making” on the vaccine, pulling back from advising all adults to get vaccinated. The committee advised doctors to emphasize to adults under 65 and children that the benefits of the vaccine are greatest for those with underlying health conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance is rebutted by infectious disease experts who say most adults and children should get both the flu and covid vaccines, which are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. Several independent medical organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics have reiterated their support for broad adoption of covid vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen states have taken steps to ensure most people can get a covid shot at the pharmacy without a prescription, with many states tying their policies to the advice given by medical organizations. And many of those states require insurers to cover vaccines at no cost, according to  a KFF analysis . In several other states, predominantly Republican, pharmacy access to vaccines may require a prescription.\n \n\n   \n  Among the most commonly cited reasons for covid vaccine hesitation are fears about side effects, long-term health consequences, the effectiveness of the vaccine, and mistrust of pharmaceutical corporations and government officials, according to  a 2024 review  of multiple studies, published in the journal Vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  Covid vaccine hesitancy in the 2024-25 virus season was higher among Latinos; African Americans; men; uninsured people; and people living in Republican-leaning states, CDC data shows.\n \n\n   \n  Latino adults were significantly less likely than adults from most other racial and ethnic groups to get a covid shot last season, with a vaccination rate around 15%.\n \n\n   \n  Same of that may be due to age: A  disproportionate share  of Latinos are young. But public policy actions may also be a factor. The first Trump administration, for example, tied Medicaid to “public charge,” a rule allowing the federal government to deny an immigrant a green card or visa based on their dependence on taxpayer-funded programs. Some Latinos may be afraid to sign up for social services even after the Biden administration reversed those first-term Trump actions.\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos co-authored  a study  published in 2024 that found many Latinos were hesitant to get vaccinated because of fears about their immigration status, and that experiencing health discrimination like care denials or delays increased their vaccine hesitancy.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you trust the health care system, broadly speaking? Do you want to provide your information — your name, your address?” Haro-Ramos said. “Trust is critical.”\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos said the problem has likely worsened since her study was published. The Trump administration  revealed this summer  that it would give the personal information of Medicaid enrollees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many Latinos are  canceling doctor appointments  to head off possible confrontation with immigration enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  “People are avoiding leaving their homes at all costs,” Haro-Ramos said.\n \n\n   \n   Janani Rajbhandari-Thapa , an associate professor at the University of Georgia College of Public Health, recently  co-authored a study  of covid vaccination among nearly 1,500 African Americans living in south Georgia. The study found that participants were more likely to listen to their health care providers than faith leaders or co-workers when seeking advice on getting vaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of those studied had received at least one dose of the vaccine, but those who were unvaccinated were more likely to agree with false statements that tied vaccines to miscarriages, components’ remaining in the body for a long time, or even to the conspiracy that they implant a computer chip in the body.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the clinicians who can take the messages about vaccination — that these are myths,” Rajbhandari-Thapa said.\n \n\n   \n  Even though covid hospitalization and death rates have fallen dramatically since the worst days of the pandemic, fatal complications related to covid remain most common among older people.  Around 89%  of U.S. covid deaths last year were among people 65 and older, compared with  about 81%  of flu and pneumonia deaths.\n \n\n   \n  As the pandemic falls into the rearview, young people have developed a sense of invincibility. Only 11% of Americans 18 to 29 received a vaccine during the 2024-25 virus season, the lowest vaccination rate among adult age groups. That’s far below the  70% of young adults  who got at least one dose of the initial covid vaccines by November 2023.\n \n\n   \n  While many people get covid after receiving a covid shot, because the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection wears off pretty fast, some misunderstand the purpose of the shot, said  Otto Yang , an infectious disease specialist at UCLA Health.\n \n\n   \n  “They think, ‘Well, the vaccine didn’t prevent me from getting covid, so the vaccine didn’t work,’” Yang said. “And what they’re not seeing is that the vaccine prevented them from getting severely ill, which is ultimately the most important thing.”\n \n\n   \n  And the vaccine can help prevent long covid, which is a problem for all ages, Yang said. A recent Northwestern University study  found that  younger adults suffer worse symptoms of long covid than older adults.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Yang said, it is not a consistent choice to get a flu vaccine but forgo a covid vaccine, since both are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. It is clear, he added, that people with compromised immune systems and those at higher risk should get a covid shot. The decision is “a little bit less clear” for others but “probably most adults should be getting vaccinated, just like it’s recommended for the flu vaccine, as well as most children.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/economy/government-shutdown-economy-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"The government shutdown is now the longest - and likely the most damaging in US history","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown, which began on October 1, 2025, and lasted 36 days, is the longest in American history and is projected to be the most damaging due to its breadth and timing.

likely the most damaging in US history \n       \n  By Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The ongoing government shutdown isn’t just the longest in American history. It’s likely the most damaging, too.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, the economic damage from shutdowns is fleeting, quickly reversing when the government reopens. However, the 36-day lapse in funding that began on October 1 is already dealing a significant – albeit temporary – blow to the world’s largest economy.\n \n\n   \n  Millions of Americans are  not getting food stamp benefits  needed to feed their families. Roughly 1.4 million federal employees  haven’t been paid  – even though many are still working. And investors and policymakers are  in the dark about what’s happening  in the US economy because the release of government data has stalled.\n \n\n   \n  “The current shutdown looks likely to have the greatest economic impact of any shutdown on record,” Alec Phillips, chief political economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the shutdown ends by next week, it will likely slow down the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) — the broadest measure of economic output, without considering inflation — by 1.15 percentage points during the fourth quarter, according to Goldman Sachs.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the shutdown will reduce GDP by one to two percentage points.\n \n\n   \n  “Those effects will intensify the longer the shutdown lasts,” the CBO wrote in a  letter  last week.\n \n\n   \n  Although “most of that decline” will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates between $7 billion and $14 billion will be permanently lost during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n    In 2025, a ‘much greater hit’ to US economy\n \n\n   \n  Goldman Sachs is now penciling in weaker fourth-quarter GDP growth of just 1%. That would represent a significant slowdown from the 3%  or even 4% growth  that was projected for the third quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Phillips wrote that the current shutdown is expected to result in a “much greater hit to growth than any prior shutdown” because it’s the longest on record and is much broader than previous shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  The 2018-2019 shutdown, previously the longest on record at 35 days, was only a partial shutdown, impacting just 10% of government spending, according to Goldman Sachs. The 2025 shutdown, by comparison, has derailed 100% of appropriations.\n \n\n   \n  The current shutdown also comes at a bad time, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management: “The economy was already going to slow down, and this just made it worse.”   \n \n\n   \n  Kelly cited a range of factors slowing the economy in the fourth quarter, including historically high tariffs, low immigration and the return of student debt payments.\n \n\n   \n  He added that it’s “shocking” to see “how much public pain (Democrats and Republicans) are willing to inflict just to get a political gain.”\n \n\n   \n    Economic data blackout\n \n\n   \n  The precise economic damage from the shutdown is difficult to measure, in part because of the information blackout caused by the shutdown itself.\n \n\n   \n  “We are flying blind in this economy,” Kelly said.\n \n\n   \n  Only one major economic report has been released by the federal government during the shutdown: the September  consumer price index  (CPI), the  final piece of data required  to determine annual cost of living adjustments for Social Security benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Other data releases, including the all-important monthly jobs report and the Fed’s go-to inflation metric as well as key insights on consumer spending, have been sidelined.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a major shift from the 2018-2019 shutdown, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics still received funding. That allowed the agency to continue collecting and releasing key economic data.\n \n\n   \n  Policymakers have been forced to make decisions with limited information. Last week, for the first time ever, the Federal Reserve  decided on interest rates without the monthly jobs report .\n \n\n   \n  If the government shutdown continues to limit Fed officials’ visibility, it could persuade the central bank to forgo cutting rates at the December policy meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” Fed Chair  Jerome Powell said  during a press conference last week. “I’m not committing to that, I’m just saying it’s certainly a possible that you would say, ‘We really can’t see, so let’s slow down.’”\n \n\n   \n  Even after the government reopens, the quality of economic data could be eroded by the fact the BLS was unable to conduct critical surveys of businesses and consumers during the shutdown period.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown will also likely inflate the unemployment rate for the month of October because the BLS typically counts furloughed workers as unemployed unless they find work elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n     A bounce-back in 2026? \n \n\n   \n  The good news is most of the shutdown-induced damage to the economy is expected to quickly unwind after the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Goldman Sachs expects the shutdown effect to “more than reverse” in the first quarter, boosting GDP by 1.3 percentage points as furloughed workers return and delayed federal spending recovers. The bank expects that reversal to lift first-quarter GDP growth to a solid pace of 3.1%.\n \n\n   \n  The CBO estimated that some of the output lost due to employee furloughs would be permanently lost, costing the economy up to 14 billion in an eight-week shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, those forecasts for a rebound hinge on a key element of shutdowns: Federal workers are repaid once the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  However, President Donald Trump has questioned the policy of paying furloughed workers – despite signing a law during his first term that has been widely interpreted as guaranteeing back pay for furloughed workers.\n \n\n   \n  The White House on Tuesday  would not commit to paying furloughed workers  at the end of the shutdown, raising the risk of lasting economic damage.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/middleeast/israel-receives-hostage-remains-gaza-hamas-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:31:00-04:00","title":"Hostage remains handed over Tuesday are those of dual US-Israeli citizen Itay Chen, Israel says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel confirmed on November 5, 2025, that it received the remains of Itay Chen, a dual US-Israeli citizen and former Israeli soldier, as part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal.

Last night, we received the bittersweet news of his return home to Israel,” his family said in a statement. The family also said the bodies of the remaining hostages held in Gaza “must be brought back.”\n \n\n   \n  Chen, a staff sergeant who served in the Armored Corps, had been stationed at the Gaza border on October 7. His remains were taken into Gaza after he was killed, the Israel Defense Forces said.\n \n\n   \n  Chen was the second of three sons, a former Boy Scout and an avid basketball player, his father Ruby Chen previously told CNN. Friends described him “as the center of attention wherever he went, always cheerful and full of jokes,” according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\n \n\n   \n  The office of the Israeli prime minister said the government “shares in the deep sorrow of the Chen family and of all the families of the fallen hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer comes after Hamas handed over the bodies of three deceased hostages on Sunday. US President Donald Trump confirmed one of them was Omer Neutra, an Israeli-American dual national killed in the initial Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Last Thursday, Hamas released the remains of two other hostages, identified as Amiram Cooper, 84, and Sahar Baruch, 25.\n \n\n   \n  The solidity of the Trump-brokered ceasefire had previously been tested   after Hamas said it handed over the remains of three deceased individuals on October 28, but Israeli authorities were unable to identify them as belonging to any of the hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was resorting to “pathetic attempts to deceive us, the United States, and the world” and instructed the military to carry out “immediate, powerful strikes” in Gaza. Those strikes killed at least 104 Palestinians, including dozens of children, in what was the deadliest day since the beginning of the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, however, the releases of the remains of hostages have proceeded as planned, and the ceasefire has largely held. In an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday, Trump said the ceasefire he helped broker is “not fragile” and was “very solid,” warning that “Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don’t behave.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Israel has been rocked by a  scandal  surrounding Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, the military’s top lawyer tasked with enforcing the rule of law within the armed forces. She has been placed under arrest as part of a criminal investigation into the leak of a video showing the alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of Palestinian detainees in Israel’s notorious Sde Teiman military prison.\n \n\n   \n  The video was first aired by Israel’s Channel 12 in August 2024. In May of that year, CNN spoke to three whistleblowers who detailed allegations of abuse at the prison. A month later, Israel said it would begin phasing out the facility.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/historic-firss-tuesday-election-winners","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"22:02:00Z","title":"The Historic Firsts of Tuesday’s Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tuesday’s U.S. state and local elections marked several historic firsts, including Abigail Spanberger becoming Virginia’s first female governor, Mikie Sherrill becoming New Jersey’s first Democratic female governor, Ghazala Hashmi becoming the first Muslim American woman elected to statewide office in the United States, Zohran Mamdani becoming New York City’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, and Mary Sheffield becoming Detroit’s first female and Black female mayor.

space station to a new crew –– but their journey home was postponed due to a suspected impact on their Shenzhou-20 spaceship, China’s National Space Administration said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “The impact analysis and risk assessment are under way,” the space agency said, without specifying details of any damage or how long it might take to check the ship.\n \n\n   \n  No alternative dates have been given for the return of the trio of taikonauts – Chinese astronauts – who blasted off from the country’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in April.\n \n\n   \n  The news came just days after China, which has rapidly ramped up its space ambition in recent years, celebrated the successful launch of Shenzhou-21.\n \n\n   \n  The newer model spacecraft successfully ferried the next batch of astronauts to China’s space station Tiangong – or “Heavenly Palace” in Chinese. Among the new cohort was Wu Fei, 32, feverishly touted by local media as  China’s youngest astronaut  ever to make it to space.\n \n\n   \n  On arrival, state-owned CCTV aired a handover ceremony involving the crews of both ships huddling in a narrow compartment to sign documents on a floating board.\n \n\n   \n  “We are about to return to Earth, and now I am handing over the hatch key that symbolizes the right to maintain operations on this Chinese space station to you,” said Chen Dong.

The dining cutlery that was clanking away just moments before fell silent.\n \n\n   \n  “New York City, breathe this moment in,”  Mamdani said .\n \n\n   \n  Locals had flocked to the mayor-elect’s go-to biryani spot in the  Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens  hoping that he might show up — he has made the venue a frequent campaign stop — or just to celebrate the longtime neighborhood institution where biryani and kebabs are on virtually every table.\n \n\n   \n  “Most people think this is a hole in the wall, but he comes here,” says Lakshmi Shubha, a Roosevelt Island resident, who came to Kabab King with two of her friends.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after being elected New York City’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, Mamdani gave a speech in neighboring Brooklyn heavy on the  biography on which he campaigned  and the homages he has long given to his roots.\n \n\n   \n  “New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant!” Mamdani hailed in his victory speech.\n \n\n   \n  Viewers in the restaurant clapped and cheered in that moment.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been saying Mamdani Mubarak!” said Shahrukh Ali, the owner of Kabab King.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a people’s person for sure. He reminds me what New York City is all about,” said 21-year-old Mamdani voter Sameha Jamal. “It’s nice to embrace that again.”\n \n\n   \n  Jamal’s father, who also voted for Mamdani, said most of the democratic socialist’s  proposals  appealed to him, but as a homeowner, he wanted to see more specifics about Mamdani’s plan to freeze hikes on rent-stabilized apartments. He rents out part of his multi-story family home and hopes that the rent freeze does not affect small homeowners like him. Otherwise, he said he won’t vote for Mamdani in the next election.\n \n\n   \n  Other diners spoke about seeing someone who reflects their identity on the national political stage.

Bush during Operation Desert Storm. He was vice president under the younger Bush during the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Dick Cheney, who  passed away  Tuesday at the age of 84, was arguably one of the most powerful and influential US vice presidents in history.\n \n\n   \n   Cheney  was, it was said again and again on the day of his passing, President George W. Bush’s chief operating officer.\n \n\n   \n  And as COO, he was one of the most forceful and outspoken proponents for regime change in Iraq – perhaps his most lasting, and darkest, legacy.\n \n\n   \n  “Simply stated,” he said at the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in August 2002, “there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has  weapons of mass destruction . There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.”\n \n\n   \n  Simply stated, the Iraqi president  didn’t  have any weapons of mass destruction. He was not amassing them to use against anyone. Yet those mythical “WMDs” were the pretext for a war and subsequent costly, clumsy, and heavy-handed occupation that opened a Pandora’s box of bloodshed, displacement, terrorism and tyranny. The box is still open.\n \n\n   \n  The US-led military campaign, which Cheney helped plan, was brilliant from a US perspective. Fast and decisive, it took just 20 days for American and coalition troops to invade Iraq and reach Baghdad.\n \n\n   \n  The occupation, for which Cheney must also bear some responsibility, was a catastrophe.\n \n\n   \n  Within weeks of Hussein’s fall in April 2003, trouble began in cities like Fallujah and Ramadi and after a few months the US-led coalition was struggling, and in many areas failing, to maintain order.\n \n\n   \n  The failures of that occupation were many, relating to security, governance, the economy, and provision of basic municipal services.\n \n\n   \n  Simply put, the Americans had willingly stumbled into a situation where they were largely clueless (or, critics would argue, willingly indifferent) to the complexities of an ancient society.\n \n\n   \n  “Saddam knew his opponents, and killed them,” Baghdad shop owner Abu Kazim told me a year after the US-led invasion. “But the Americans, even if they don’t mean it, don’t know who is who. They’ve put us all in danger.”\n \n\n   \n  This was also when a torture scandal emerged at Baghdad’s Abu Ghraib prison. Images of Iraqi detainees being stripped naked and abused, published by the media, shocked the world.\n \n\n   \n  “They were cursing at us. ‘Shut up! F**k you! Shut the f**k up!” Haydar Sabbar Ali told me.\n \n\n   \n  Haydar was prisoner 13077 at Abu Ghraib, one of those photographed by the American army prison guards in various positions of agony.\n \n\n   \n  “If you talked, they hit you hard in sensitive places, in the kidney, in the chest, in the throat,” Haydar told me in April 2004. “Our bodies were full of bruises.”\n \n\n   \n  A traffic policeman during Hussein’s rule, Haydar was never charged, and in early 2004 was released.\n \n\n   \n  Then Vice President Cheney condemned those behind the torture scandal, while at the same time defending water-boarding as a useful means of extracting vital intelligence (many intelligence experts say water-boarding is torture, and its victims will say anything to avoid further abuse).\n \n\n   \n  Today, Iraq has stabilized. Baghdad is no longer a war zone. The country is still crippled by corruption, and it was only a few years ago that it managed (with US and coalition help) after several years of war, to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), itself a direct result of the US invasion and occupation. Iran, Baghdad’s arch enemy during Hussein’s rule, now enjoys significant influence in Iraq – another direct result of the US invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Apart from the moral morass and human cost of America’s foreign military misadventures, there is the lasting economic damage of the wars of which Cheney was such an avid advocate. According to Brown University’s Costs of War Project, post September 11, 2001, conflicts cost the United States  8 trillion dollars .\n \n\n   \n  The post 9/11 blunders in which Cheney played a part can be tied to the rise of ISIS, perennial instability in the Middle East, the migrant crisis and the crushing debt burden ($38 trillion and counting) that looms over the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  It would be unfair to blame Iraq’s plight, and the broader plight of the Middle East, on Cheney alone. After all, he is just one in a long line of American leaders who has played fast and loose in the region with dire consequences and left the United States in an ever more precarious state.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/exit-polls-nyc-nj-virginia-california-elections","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00.000Z","title":"CNN exit polls: Voters’ dissatisfaction with Trump helped fuel Democratic wins in key races","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A CNN exit poll conducted from October 22 to November 4, 2025, reveals widespread voter dissatisfaction with Donald Trump’s job performance, which helped fuel Democratic victories in key races across Virginia, New Jersey, California, and New York City.

A year later   CNN exit polling finds voters expressing similar pessimism and anti-incumbent sentiments — this time, helping to fuel a sweep of Democratic victories in some of the first  major electoral tests  of the second Trump presidency.\n \n\n   \n  Across four  closely watched contests  — the governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey, the mayoral race in New York City and the redistricting-related Proposition 50 in California — majorities of voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance. In Virginia, New Jersey and California, more than half of the electorate sees their vote as sending a  message to Trump . That message, largely one of opposition, helped to propel Democratic gubernatorial wins by Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia. In California, it helped seal support for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s push to redraw the state’s congressional maps.\n \n\n   \n  Democrat Zohran Mamdani’s win in New York City’s mayoral race, meanwhile, may owe more to local concerns about issues like cost of living. But it also reflects a loss for former governor Andrew Cuomo, whom  Trump endorsed at the last minute .\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s Democratic victories come despite middling ratings for the Democratic Party, with Spanberger, Sherrill and Mamdani winning 16% to 33% of the vote among voters who dislike their party.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City, voters call economic issues – taxes, cost of living or the economy as a whole – their top concern. Only voters in Virginia see their state’s economy as excellent or good, while those in California, New York City and New Jersey take a more pessimistic view of their state or city’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  CNN Exit Polls are from the Voter Poll conducted by SSRS, which combines thousands of pre-election interviews with those conducted at polling places to reflect the opinions of the full electorate. That scope makes them a powerful tool for understanding the demographic profile and political views of voters in this year’s election. And their findings will eventually be weighted against the ultimate benchmark: the results of the elections themselves. Even so, exit polls are still polls, with margins for error — which means they’re most useful when treated as estimates, rather than precise measurements. That’s particularly true for the earliest numbers, which haven’t yet been adjusted to match final election results. Learn more about how this year’s surveys were conducted  here .\n \n\n   \n  Even in a political environment with sharply national overtones, tonight’s results also reflect factors deeply specific to each election. Here’s a closer look at each of these key races:\n \n\n   \n    Virginia\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, Spanberger’s victory in the governor’s race was powered in significant part by unhappiness with the state of the nation. A majority of voters said they disapproved of Trump — and roughly 9 in 10 of those voters supported Spanberger over her rival, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears.\n \n\n   \n  Closer to home, voters give Glenn Youngkin, the state’s outgoing Republican governor, majority approval. But Earle-Sears wasn’t able to hold onto enough of his supporters: Roughly one-quarter of voters who think he did a good job as governor still backed Spanberger to succeed him.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a similar pattern when it comes to key issues in the state. While about half of voters said that societal support for transgender rights has gone too far, more than one-fifth in that group still support Spanberger over Earle-Sears, who made attacks on transgender rights a cornerstone of her campaign. By contrast, just over half of voters also say that the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far — and Spanberger won more than 9 in 10 of them.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger won among voters who identify as political independents — a group that makes up roughly a third of this year’s electorate — and among female voters, voters with college degrees and the majority of voters in the state who say abortion should be legal in most or all cases. She also notched a significant advantage among voters from households where someone worked this year as a federal employee or was employed as a federal contractor.\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears did win among the roughly 45% of voters who say that  texts sent  by Democratic state attorney general nominee Jay Jones are disqualifying — although Spanberger did get the votes of about 20% in that group. Spanberger denounced the texts but did not call for Jones to drop out.\n \n\n   \n  Downballot, about 41% of voters said that  texts sent  by Jones were disqualifying, with 37% calling them concerning but not disqualifying or describing them as not a concern, and 18% saying they hadn’t heard enough to say. Jones also won his race, as did the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, Ghazala Hashmi.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s victory over Republican Jack Ciattarelli took place in the shadow of two unpopular incumbents: Trump’s approval rating stands at about 42% among voters in this year’s election, with the state’s outgoing Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, also seeing an approval rating that’s slightly underwater.\n \n\n   \n  Those factors map closely onto Tuesday’s race: Roughly 9 in 10 voters who disapprove of Trump cast their vote for Sherrill, while roughly 8 in 10 who disapprove of Murphy backing the Republican to replace him.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s favorability rating is about 10 points higher than Ciattarelli’s, and about half say her campaign against him was mostly fair, while voters are split on the fairness of Ciattarelli’s campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 7 in 10 voters say that property tax rates are a major problem where they live, and about 6 in 10 say the same of electricity costs. More than half also call political corruption in the state a major problem.\n \n\n   \n  Most voters who call the economy or health care the top issue in the state backed Sherrill, while voters who are more focused on taxes or immigration largely supported Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n    New York City\n \n\n   \n  New York City’s multi-candidate  mayoral race  was marked by sharp demographic divides.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani won with a coalition that included majority support among voters younger than 45, college graduates, first-time voters and renters. He also won most of the city’s Democratic voters.\n \n\n   \n  Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo won a majority of Jewish voters. He also outpaced Mamdani among older voters, those without a college degree and those born in the city. Independents in the city, meanwhile, were closely split between Mamdani and Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  There were also big differences between the bases of support for Mamdani and Cuomo. Nearly 90% of Mamdani’s supporters say their vote is to support him, rather than to oppose his rivals. (Republican Curtis Sliwa’s voters also saw their ballot as a statement of support.) By contrast, Cuomo’s voters are closely split between voting to support him and voting to oppose the other candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani voters overwhelmingly called cost of living the top issue facing the city, while Cuomo voters were divided between cost of living and crime. And a plurality of Mamdani’s supporters say it was most important either that their candidate would bring needed change, while Cuomo’s supporters broadly say they were looking for the candidate with the right experience.\n \n\n   \n  Although most voters say they’re holding steady or getting ahead financially, nearly 60% call cost of living the city’s most important issue. And more than 7 in 10 say the cost of housing where they live is a major problem, compared to just about one-third who say crime is a major problem. About 4 in 10 call the candidates’ positions on Israel a major factor in their vote.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani won a majority of that big swath of voters who said they were highly concerned with housing costs, while those highly concerned about the candidates’ positions on Israel split about evenly between him and Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n    California\n \n\n   \n  California voters were keenly aware of the stakes of Proposition 50, the ballot measure to temporarily enact a new congressional map drawn by Democrats in response to Republican-driven  redistricting in other states . Roughly two-thirds who voted said that it’s very important to them which party controls Congress, rising to about 76% among “yes” voters.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of California voters — including those who backed Proposition 50 — say they’d generally prefer state congressional district lines to be drawn by a non-partisan commission than the party in power. But the majority who voted “yes” on the measure also see it as a response to GOP-led redistricting elsewhere: around 82% say they see it as a way to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, rather than the best way of drawing congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, about half of California voters say that neither party is handling the redrawing of congressional district lines fairly, with the rest more likely to say that only the Democrats are taking a fair approach than that only the Republicans are.\n \n\n   \n  Around three-quarters of California voters say they’re dissatisfied with or angry about the way things are going in the U.S., and about half say they view their vote as a way to oppose Trump. More than 6 in 10 say that the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far, and most say the governor should not cooperate with the Trump administration on its enforcement efforts. A majority also oppose the idea of the federal government sending the National Guard into major cities in California.\n \n\n   \n  More than 80% say that the cost of living in their area is unaffordable, and the economy far outpaces immigration, health care, crime or climate change as the top issue facing the state.\n \n\n   \n   The CNN Voter Poll conducted by SSRS was conducted from October 22nd -November 4th, and includes representative samples of 4,490 voters in California, 4,336 voters in New Jersey, 4,522 voters in Virginia and 4,447 voters in New York City. The Voter Poll combines data collected from verified registered voters online and by telephone, with data collected in-person from Election Day voters at 30 precincts each in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City. Respondents could complete the poll in English or Spanish. The overall margin of sampling error for voters, accounting for design effects, is approximately plus or minus 2.1 percentage points in California, 2.0 percentage points in New Jersey, 2.2 percentage points in New York City, and 2.0 percentage points in Virginia. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/himalaya-peak-avalanche-nepal-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"13:05:00-04:00","title":"Foreign climbers and Nepali guides among 7 killed in avalanche on Nepal mountain","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche on Mount Yalung Ri in Nepal killed at least seven people, including five foreign climbers from France, Germany, Canada, and Italy, and two Nepali guides.

NASA after previously pulling nomination \n       \n  By Alejandra Jaramillo, Kristen Holmes, Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:22 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump is nominating tech billionaire Jared Isaacman for a second time to serve as administrator of NASA, he announced on social media Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman, an Elon Musk associate who has twice traveled to space on private SpaceX missions, was  previously tapped for the position  before Trump unexpectedly  withdrew his nomination  earlier this year, citing a “thorough review of prior associations.”\n \n\n   \n  “This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday. “Jared’s passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  previously reported  that Trump and Isaacman reopened lines of communication over the summer and it soon became clear to officials that Isaacman was not only back in the mix to lead NASA, but a frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the president’s post, Isaacman thanked Trump and pledged to uphold the agency’s mission to “inspire the world once again.”’\n \n\n   \n  “To the innovators building the orbital economy, to the scientists pursuing breakthrough discoveries and to dreamers across the world eager for a return to the Moon and the grand journey beyond–these are the most exciting times since the dawn of the space age– and I truly believe the future we have all been waiting for will soon become reality,” he said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s announcement came as some Trump officials have in recent weeks expressed frustration with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who has been serving as NASA’s acting administrator, with internal wrangling over who will lead the agency spilling into public view, two sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy had said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently and fold NASA into the Department of Transportation, one source said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the secretary told CNN he said that “NASA might benefit from being part of the Cabinet, maybe even within the Department of Transportation,” but denied Duffy said he wanted to keep the NASA administrator job.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy on Tuesday congratulated Isaacman on his nomination and praised the work the agency has done under his interim leadership.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve made giant leaps in our mission to return to the Moon before China. It’s critical for our national security and national pride that we win the next space race,” he said on X. “Congratulations to  @rookisaacman  . I wish him all the success and will ensure the transition is seamless.”\n \n\n   \n  The abrupt withdrawal of Isaacman earlier this year left a bad taste in the mouths of many within the White House, with some pointing fingers at a top Trump aide for convincing the president that Isaacman’s past Democratic donations disqualified him.\n \n\n   \n  That frustration only grew when the decision was announced as Trump and Musk kicked off a messy, monthslong feud.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN previously  reported , Sergio Gor, a longtime Trump ally, moved to oust Isaacman after Musk left his brief, unofficial role in Washington several months ago, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s departure, which came when he was presumably days away from being confirmed for the NASA job by the Senate, was an act of retribution against Musk who had “rubbed a couple people wrong,” the source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    NASA’s looming moon race\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s reinstatement comes as NASA is headed for a crucial few years. The space agency is racing to return astronauts to the moon amid a geopolitical standoff with China, which aims to send its taikonauts there by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s moon landing plan, called Artemis, is currently at an inflection point. Recently, Duffy suggested he and the space agency may  sideline  SpaceX from its roster of private-sector partners for the lunar touchdown mission, called Artemis III.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy’s team said it intended to send a “Request for Information,” or RFI, to the space industry when the government shutdown concludes. The request would ask companies to detail how they may rapidly produce a lunar lander vehicle and get NASA astronauts to the moon quicker than SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear if NASA will move forward with the RFI. Isaacman is viewed as a close ally of Musk and SpaceX, though he has emphasized that he intends to foster competition across the commercial space industry as head of NASA.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman would also take on the top job as NASA’s workforce is showing signs of discontent amid job cuts and looming budget reductions — including a proposed 47% cut to the agency’s science budget mapped out in Trump’s budget request earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has called those proposed cuts suboptimal.\n \n\n   \n  During an April  confirmation hearing , Isaacman faced wide-ranging questions about how NASA’s priorities might change under his leadership and signaled an interest in Mars — the longtime focus of Musk and SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman faced questioning from national security hawks who raised concerns that relinquishing NASA’s focus on the moon could cede ground to China. In response, Isaacman had struck a conciliatory tone, saying, “We don’t have to make a binary decision of Moon versus Mars.”\n \n\n   \n  After the confirmation hearing, Isaacman’s remarks were met with praise throughout the space industry — as well as skepticism about how NASA would pay for such bold ambitions as the Trump administration seeks to tighten federal spending.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/europe/drones-close-brussels-liege-airports-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:21:00-05:00","title":"Drone sightings close Brussels, Liege airports","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Belgium’s Brussels and Liege airports were closed on November 4, 2025, after drone sightings triggered security concerns.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:46 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Violent protests have broken out in the  Mexican  state of Michoacán over the murder of  an outspoken anti-crime mayor , who was killed over the weekend while taking part in a Day of the Dead celebration.\n \n\n   \n  The protests  began on Sunday   in the state capital Morelia under the slogan “enough of abuses and omissions.” The demonstration turned violent, and some people stormed Morelia’s Government Palace. Local authorities confirmed the arrest of eight people.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, authorities in the city of Apatzingán confirmed that people had set fire to the city hall saying in a Facebook post that the violence was carried out by “shock groups whose objectives are far from the true construction of peace.”\n \n\n   \n  The shocking murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, on Saturday was one of the episodes of violence that sparked these protests in the state. There was also latent anger over the murder of Bernardo Bravo Manríquez, the head of a local citrus growers association in Apatzingán, who was found dead in October just days after calling for tighter security for agriculture workers.\n \n\n   \n  The back-to-back killings of both men, who occupied different sectors of society, showed how violence has touched every part of Michoacán life, David Mora, senior Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The protests are “an honest reaction of the citizens of Michoacán… who for many years have been living under a context of extreme insecurity and high violence,” Mora said.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s murder of Manzo  adds to the wave of violence  affecting the southwestern Mexican state, where in December 2006 then-President Felipe Calderón launched what he called a “war” on organized crime. Since then, despite changes in government at the state and federal levels, violence has persisted.\n \n\n   \n  Instability has forced residents of some towns in Michoacán and neighboring Jalisco to abandon their homes completely, creating numerous “ghost towns” in the rural areas between the two states.\n \n\n   \n  Demonstrators referenced both Manzo and Bravo at this week’s protests.\n \n\n   \n  “For my family, for you, for Mexico, for Carlos, for Bernardo, for all who have fallen, sons of bitches!” one man shouted in a video taken by Reuters  on Monday. Other clips from protests across Michoacán, show many wearing cowboy-style hats as a nod to the late mayor’s sartorial style.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters who spoke with Reuters railed against the extortion and violence common in Michoacán, where lemon and avocado farmers are often forced to pay exorbitant bribes to drug trafficking groups.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re tired as a people,” one protester said. \n \n\n   \n     A ‘plan for peace’ \n \n\n   \n  Manzo was attacked at an event for the Day of the Dead on Saturday shortly after finishing  a livestream  on social media. The suspected attacker, who was killed at the scene but has not been identified, is a teenager believed to be between the ages of 17 and 19, Michoacan’s attorney general said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The official added that authorities believe the crime was planned by an organized crime group, but did not offer further details.\n \n\n   \n  Manzo was a popular figure in local politics in Michoacán, who was elected on a tough-on-crime platform.\n \n\n   \n  In a typical video posted on social media  in May , Manzo addressed local police while wearing a bullet-proof vest and his signature cowboy hat, warning them against providing criminals with “leniency.”\n \n\n   \n  “Any criminal you encounter who is armed and resists arrest or attacks citizens, if you detect them during operations, you must take them down; there should be no leniency with them,” Manzo said.\n \n\n   \n  The late mayor was also a fierce critic of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and her party’s approach to the country’s security issues. Manzo often posted announcements of new arrests on his  Facebook page , along with pleas to Sheinbaum’s government for better security in the face of crime and extortion in his city.\n \n\n   \n  One recent post, which Manzo implored his followers to share widely, demanded that Sheinbaum “not leave Uruapan alone in the fight against federal crimes, which are the responsibility of the federation to address.” CNN reached out to Sheinbaum’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Sheinbaum spent most of her morning press conference addressing Manzo’s death and her government’s “plan for peace and justice” in Michoacán.\n \n\n   \n  “Our commitment is to get to the truth and do justice in the case of the cowardly murder of Carlos Manzo,” Sheinbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum said her plan would take aim at the roots of crime through strategic investments in education, living wages for farm workers, and strengthening rural infrastructure. The plan also includes “strengthening the presence of federal forces in Michoacán,” according to a document released by the president’s office after the press conference.\n \n\n   \n  Mora does not see much new in Sheinbaum’s proposal, particularly around more federal troops in Michoacán.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s doubling down on things that we’ve seen are not necessarily working in other states, in other parts of Mexico,” Mora said. “She’s sending more troops in, and that’s basically what they have been doing in Sinaloa for the past year.”\n \n\n   \n  He said the presence of troops in Sinaloa, home to Mexico’s  oldest and most  violent criminal organizations, has not reduced the crime and murder rate.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at the homicide numbers and other crimes,” Mora continued, “there’s not a direct connection between the presence of federal forces in the state and the lower numbers of murders and other crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  Mora pointed out that violence is not new in Michoacán, either. Between January and September of this year, official data shows 1,024 intentional homicides in Michoacán, placing it as  the seventh highest Mexican state for homicides in 2025 .\n \n\n   \n  The figures are lower than those of 2024, although there are no details on how many are directly linked to organized crime. Civil society organizations believe the true figure to be much higher.\n \n\n   \n  “But this reaction,” Mora said, referring to the protests, “Organic and honest, fed up with the security situation in the state – is something new.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/colombia-us-trump-payments-rubio","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-05:00","title":"US Has Yet to Follow Through on Trump Promise to Halt All Payments to Colombia as Rubio Stresses Importance of Relationship","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite President Donald Trump's promise to halt all US payments to Colombia, no such cut has occurred.

They pointed to a strong country-to-country relationship, built on decades of investment and singled out Petro as the biggest impediment to shoring up the joint efforts to tackle illicit drug production and trafficking inside the country. Though a review is ongoing at the State Department, a senior department official said.\n \n\n   \n  Days after Trump’s social media post deeming Petro a drug trafficker and calling for a cutting of all payments and subsidies to the country, there was an interagency meeting planned with all of the Cabinet heads to discuss US support to Columbia, US officials said. But that meeting was canceled for unknown reasons and has not been rescheduled.\n \n\n   \n  The axing of the inter-agency meeting meant that Trump’s national security adviser and Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who has been instrumental to the administration’s overall policy approach to the region – was again left as the most influential voice in the president’s ear in shaping the policy. Rubio’s staff began working with the Treasury Department to quickly put sanctions on Petro into place, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio, following Trump’s initial Truth Social post, publicly cited the “excellent” US-Colombia relationship, founded on strong partnership.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the status of the policy, a senior administration official highlighted to the country’s difficulty tackling drug trafficking under Petro’s leadership, and pointed to a review of US assistance at the presidential level.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite billions of US taxpayer dollars invested in Colombia’s counterdrug efforts, cartels are thriving under President Petro’s failed policies. President Trump is carefully reviewing every program and only investing in projects that show clear value to protecting US citizens,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has both imposed sanctions on Petro and decertified Colombia as a partner in the fight against drug trafficking, citing the Colombian president’s “disastrous and ineffective counternarcotics policies,” State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement announcing the decertification in late October.\n \n\n   \n  As part of that decertification, Rubio approved a “significant cut to security assistance in Colombia,” a senior State Department official said.\n \n\n   \n  “That reduction is now being implemented, and there is an active and comprehensive review of FY25 funds that is underway,” they said, without providing further details.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio has made clear publicly that the administration’s issues are with Petro, not the institutions in Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  “The politics of Colombia are not actually reflected by the current president,” the top US diplomat said as he prepared to head to Asia with Trump. “Our problem with the current president, in addition to his behavior, which has been erratic and counterproductive, is that in fact he is not cooperating on our counter-drug, and we felt that was best addressed at the individual level.”\n \n\n   \n  Rubio’s remarks came as a relief to US officials who had been privately hoping that the administration would climb down and draw a distinction between penalizing the country and targeting the actions and bellicose rhetoric of the president.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio went on to say that the targeting of Petro – whom he called a “hostile foreign leader” – is “separate” from any effort to punish the joint efforts at the working level between the two countries, which the US has invested in for decades.\n \n\n   \n  While the administration has pointed to both Colombia and Venezuela as driving the drug trade, their approach to tackling the problem in each country greatly differs because of contrasting diplomatic histories. Tough sanctions have been imposed on Venezuela by both Republican and Democratic administrations given a rupture in diplomatic relations after the country’s National Assembly declared Nicolás Maduro was not the country’s legitimate leader in 2019, which was a position the US backed.\n \n\n   \n  And, in 2024, the  US accused Maduro  of stealing the country’s election.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US-Colombia relations remain intact despite tensions at the top. Trump administration officials have also drawn up plans for  strikes inside Venezuela , while there are no plans for the same kind of action inside Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials are keenly aware of the political calendar in South America’s largest country: Petro’s presidency will end next year as he is constitutionally barred from running for a second term in the 2026 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  “Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they’re going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s anger towards Petro comes after the Colombian leader has taken on the US president very personally in addition to harshly criticizing the administration’s drug war and its support for Israel.  US officials were stunned and angry when Petro joined pro-Palestinian protests in New York in September and called on US soldiers to “disobey the orders of Trump.” It prompted the US  to revoke Petro’s visa .\n \n\n   \n  But days later, back in Colombia, the left-wing leader doubled down.\n \n\n   \n  “If Mr. Trump keeps being complicit in the genocide, as he is up to today, he deserves nothing but jail, and his army should not obey him,” Petro said in Bogota.\n \n\n   \n  Petro’s hostile stance towards Trump continued as the US drug boat strikes in the Caribbean have continued  at a steady pace  for the last two months. After one strike he accused the US of murdering a Colombian fisherman, fueling tensions and ultimately triggering Trump to declare that the US would halt payments to the nation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that at least one US military strike in the Caribbean over the last two months  targeted Colombian nationals on a boat  that had left from Colombia, according to two people briefed by the Pentagon about the strikes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘failures and incompetence’ of Petro\n \n\n   \n  When the US rolled out sanctions against Petro and two of his family members in recent weeks, Rubio also officially decertified Colombia as a partner in combatting drug trafficking. But the State Department’s language announcing the decertification made clear that US support for the country’s institutions are expected to endure.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain steadfast in our support for Colombian security forces, its justice sector, and departmental and municipal officials, and we will continue to partner with them in our joint efforts to combat drug trafficking,” the State Department announcement said. “Today’s decision is not a reflection on these institutions but rather the failures and incompetence of Gustavo Petro and his inner circle.”\n \n\n   \n  The senior administration official pointed to the sanctioning of Petro and his family as a Trump decision after the Colombian president failed to strengthen efforts to tackle the drug problem.\n \n\n   \n  “The decision to impose sanctions on Petro and his family was ultimately made at the Presidential level, as is every action. President Trump made it clear that Colombia is ‘failing demonstrably’ to uphold its drug control responsibilities, and Petro has since doubled down in defense of his failed policies,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Some US foreign assistance to the country had already stopped after the destruction of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) early in Trump’s second term. However, the US has continued to provide funding from the State and Defense departments, including on counternarcotics. The US has provided about $210 million in assistance to Colombia this fiscal year, including about $31 million in agricultural support, according to  data  from the US Department of State.\n \n\n   \n  While US officials believe that the strategy to target Petro instead of the whole of Colombia’s security institutions is settled for the time being, they warn that things could always quickly change.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking a day after Rubio last month, Sen. Lindsey Graham said that Trump believes that both Venezuela and Colombia “have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long.” Graham added, during his CBS interview, that Trump said there were plans to brief members of Congress after his trip to Asia “about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.”\n \n\n   \n    Unintended consequences\n \n\n   \n  The US has been working to establish the close relationship it has with Colombia since the late 1990s. The Clinton administration launched Plan Colombia in 2000, which was a $1.3 billion program primarily to support the military and security forces’ fight against growing and trafficking narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  But before that period in 1997 the US had cut off assistance to Colombia and decertified it as partner in combatting drug trafficking. Many reflected that the action did not produce the intended results.\n \n\n   \n  “US officials concluded that we actually did more damage to ourselves by cutting off assistance to Colombia than actually punish Ernesto Samper,” said Juan Gonzalez, a former NSC official focused on the Western Hemisphere during the Biden administration who is currently a fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute.\n \n\n   \n  The US support to the Colombian police was robust before that cutoff: helping pay for judicialized wiretaps, training police and vetting them. Gonzalez said that the cutoff in assistance during that period of time limited the US Department of Justice’s ability build cases against the cartels inside of Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that today’s continued funding to Colombia’s security and defense forces – which includes ongoing intelligence sharing between the two nations – is critical to achieve the administration’s own goals for fighting drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Colombia, said the US support on defense is “really, really significant.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re talking about two militaries that are deeply integrated and cooperating, and they work more closely together, I think, than any other country that the US works with that’s not in NATO,” she told CNN. “We’re talking about sort of an institutional relationship, sharing of intelligence, sharing of capabilities, day to day collaboration on logistics, operations.”\n \n\n   \n  “If that were to go by the wayside,” Dickinson said, “the capability of the Colombian security forces would be debilitated significantly” at a time when the country is facing major security challenges.\n \n\n   \n  And if intelligence sharing were to be cut, it would leave the US “flying blind,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “85% of all actionable intelligence that the US uses to interdict drugs in the Caribbean comes from Colombia,” Dickinson said.\n \n\n   \n  “If you are not sharing humint (human intelligence), electronic intel on shipments, routes, organizations, schedules, methods – you’re cutting off what’s needed to do the stated thing you want to do – stop the flow,” a former US diplomat who worked on the issue told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Another former US diplomat who worked on the issue said cutting the security funding would be “cutting one’s nose to spite one’s face.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/ups-plane-crash-louisville-airport","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00Z","title":"UPS Plane Crashes Near Louisville Airport, Three Crew Members On Board","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS MD-11 freight aircraft, operating as Flight 2976, crashed shortly after takeoff near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky.

     \n  By Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:30 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Some of the most prominent liberals in Congress are seething at an emerging deal to end the 35-day government funding stalemate without a clear win for Democrats, showcasing a massive splinter within the party that will soon be on full display.\n \n\n   \n  The divide among Democrats inside the Capitol over strategy offers a gloomy portrait of how a possible deal could land in the broader party — likely spurring ugly infighting at a critical moment as Democrats are seeking to define their future ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  There is still no official agreement within a group of Senate centrists that have been privately meeting to discuss a shutdown exit ramp. But multiple sources involved in discussions told CNN that a deal could be reached as soon as this week to pass a temporary stopgap bill to reopen the government alongside several full-year spending bills — with a promise of a future vote to extend billions in enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly a dozen Senate Democrats have privately signaled that they are willing to support a stopgap funding deal to reopen the government in exchange for a future vote on health care, two Democratic sources familiar with the discussions told CNN Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Negotiations are still ongoing on exactly what kind of stopgap funding bill the Senate would take up and how it would pass the House, the sources familiar said, but that level of party support in the Senate would be more than enough for Congress to end the funding standoff that has ground Washington to a halt for more than a month.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a reflection of the mounting frustration of many Democratic senators who can’t stomach any more shutdown pain, after this week’s partial cut-off in food aid, with the shutdown set to break the 35-day record on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Still, it won’t appease the scores of liberal senators now warning that the party will lose its leverage, and alienate voters, if it accepts such an offer.\n \n\n   \n  “If the Democrats cave on this, I think it would be a betrayal to millions and millions of working families who want them to stand up and protect their health care benefits,” a furious Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent told reporters on Tuesday when asked what message the centrist-led talks would send to voters.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’re suckers to believe that a party that is opposed to extending the subsidies now is all of a sudden going to be supportive of that a month from now,” Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut put it plainly, referring to the billions of dollars in enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire next month.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear whether these liberal Democrats will attempt to pressure Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to scuttle the dealmaking by the centrists or whether he would have any interest in doing so.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats huddled for nearly three hours Tuesday on the path forward, but remained uncharacteristically tight-lipped as they left. Schumer was also mum on whether he endorses the emerging plan, telling reporters: “We discussed all of the options.”\n \n\n   \n  Leaving Tuesday’s marathon meeting, retiring Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan called it “really one of the most productive caucus meetings I’ve been in.” He stressed there were no “whip counts” and instead, “everybody had a chance to really talk about ideas and issues.”\n \n\n   \n  And among the centrist Democrats, few are willing to speak publicly about where talks stand with Republicans – but many acknowledged the progress made in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the lunch on Tuesday, senators were briefed on the state of the negotiations and about the “opportunities to work together,” according to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said after the lunch meeting that the pace “has definitely picked up” but declined to get into specifics of the talks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think when there’s a deal and I get something on health care, I’ll be ready to vote,” Slotkin said, but wouldn’t say whether an ACA subsidies vote is sufficient.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters that Democrats were still talking to Republicans and acknowledged the massive gulf between the two parties on health care.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously we’re in different universes on how we’re trying to address this issue of rising costs for people,” Kelly said when asked whether a future vote on ACA subsidies could end the stalemate. “We want to bring down their health care costs, or at least make sure it’s what it was last year. My Republican colleagues and the White House seem not to care about that.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “But, you know, this thing can’t go on forever.”\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine similarly signaled willingness to engage with Republicans on future health care talks — as long as the bill included protections for thousands of federal workers in his own district.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to have a path to fixing the ACA, but all the I’s and T’s don’t have to be dotted and crossed,” Kaine said, stressing that his priority in a funding deal was blocking President Donald Trump from freely firing workers and canceling federal projects, rather than a guaranteed extension of the Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Stop the mischief, no more firings, no more furloughs, no more cancellation of projects,” Kaine said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said she wanted to establish a working group to lay out a framework to address the rising cost of health care but didn’t want to state what she would or wouldn’t accept in order to vote to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to negotiate in the press,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some Democrats were adamant they would not relent without a clear agreement from Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “A promise ain’t good enough for me,” Sen Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/sport/college-football-playoff-rankings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:44:00.000-05:00","title":"Ohio State tops first College Football Playoff rankings but nothing is settled","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the early College Football Playoff rankings released in November 2025, with Ohio State topping the list.

The Hurricanes, in the meantime, also have two losses and beat Notre Dame and they are a very distant 18th in the standings.\n \n\n   \n  Then exhale because there are, to paraphrase Robert Frost, still miles to go before we sleep on this college football season.\n \n\n   \n  The actual bracket will be created on December 7 and if this sport has taught us anything this season, things escalate quickly.\n \n\n   \n  It was, in fact, just one month ago to the day that Penn State made Jerry Neuheisel look like the second coming of Bear Bryant, losing to UCLA and beginning a downward spiral that  cost a coach his job , the school millions and has no signs of finding rock bottom just yet.\n \n\n   \n  Because, to borrow from another great poet - one Theodor Geisel - these first rankings ought to come with a dramatic reading of ‘Oh, the Places You’ll Go!’ It is not entirely about where you start, as where you might end up.\n \n\n   \n  From the next great QB to the next big bust, Arch Manning has found something of a sweet spot of normalcy, having steered Texas to wins against Oklahoma and Vanderbilt in the last month. With Georgia, Arkansas and Texas A&M left on the docket, the Longhorns can make their own case.\n \n\n   \n  Georgia Tech is similarly on the outside looking in, currently sitting at No. 17. But if the Yellow Jackets were to win out, that would include a season-ending win over Georgia and just one loss, which could overcome the ranking clunker of a loss to N.C. State.\n \n\n   \n  The inherent problem with rankings is whether you have four teams, 12 or 16, someone always has an argument that they’ve been overlooked. Just ask the folks who’ve made the college basketball committee which is currently pondering expanding its beautiful bracket to 76 teams. Whoever is 77th will be sure to be offended.\n \n\n   \n  The CFP selection committee this year has made a big deal about its adherence to new metrics to better evaluate strength of schedule which will, according to a release issued in August, “reward teams defeating high-quality opponents while minimizing the penalty for losing to such a team.’’\n \n\n   \n  They have not, however, come out and said exactly what those metrics look at, nor have they said how they’ll be weighted versus the eye test. In reality, they can’t.\n \n\n   \n  Analytics and metrics have offered all sorts of advances in sports. Kick the point after touchdown or go for two in football? Foul a player up three points or let it play out in basketball? Better to bunt or swing away in baseball? There’s a statistical answer for all of it.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, asked specifically about the fine hairs separating the top three undefeated teams in this first ranking, Mack Rhoades, the committee chair and athletic director at Baylor, sounded like a man torn between numbers and gut feelings.\n \n\n   \n  He explained that the committee had “robust” conversations about the trio but that ultimately they split the hair based on the fact that Ohio State “when we looked at the tape, and we looked at the metrics, we felt that Ohio State was a little better up front on the offensive line and we thought they were better defensively.’’\n \n\n   \n  Because no matter what the numbers say, eventually very real humans have to make the very hard decisions. And well, going back to the poets, to err is human.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, Alexander Pope also suggested the follow up - to forgive divine.\n \n\n   \n  But then again, the Englishman’s football team probably wasn’t sitting 13th in a 12-team playoff.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/snap-benefits-trump-threat","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:40:00Z","title":"White House says it will partially fund SNAP benefits after Trump threatens to withhold them until shutdown ends","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the government shutdown, the White House announced it would partially fund SNAP (food stamp) benefits despite President Donald Trump's public threat to withhold them until the government reopened.

fund SNAP benefits after Trump threatens to withhold them until shutdown ends \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:40 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The White House said Tuesday it would follow through on plans to partially fund critical food aid during the government shutdown, despite President Donald Trump’s threat just hours earlier that he would withhold the federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that she had spoken with Trump and that the administration would be “fully complying” with a court order to keep some Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits flowing.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting that partial payment out the door as much as we can and as quickly as we can,” Leavitt said of the program, which is more commonly known as SNAP or food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Trump sparked widespread confusion earlier Tuesday when he appeared to abruptly reverse course on the  administration’s funding plan,  writing on Truth Social that SNAP “will be given only when those Radical Left Democrats open up the government, which they can easily do, and not before!”\n \n\n   \n  That move would have left millions of people without the monthly federal assistance they rely on to purchase food and sparked a fresh legal showdown. More than two dozen states and a coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses sued in separate cases last week to force the administration to keep at least some of the aid flowing.\n \n\n   \n  “This is immoral. See you in court,” Skye Perryman, the CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organization involved in the coalition’s lawsuit that also sought continuation of the SNAP benefits,  wrote on X  in response to Trump’s post.\n \n\n   \n  The administration is tapping into a roughly $5 billion contingency fund to support partial benefits into November. The Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, issued guidance earlier Tuesday to states for distributing the partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans  receive SNAP benefits , which amount to roughly $350 per household per month on average when paid out in full.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA last month said it could not pay November’s benefits, citing concerns over whether it could legally use the contingency fund or move money from other accounts. But the courts ruled that the government must tap into the contingency fund to pay partial benefits and could shift other money to enable it to fully pay the more than $8 billion in benefits, as well as other costs. And Trump himself previously indicated he had instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it could legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,” he wrote Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The administration ultimately opted to use the contingency fund to pay out partial benefits.\n \n\n   \n    Varying benefit amounts\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone will receive half their benefit amount this month, according to the USDA guidance issued to states on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Those who receive the maximum monthly allotment – which in most of the country is $994 for a family of four – will receive half that amount. And one and two person households who receive the minimum monthly benefit will get $12, instead of the usual $24.\n \n\n   \n  But those in between will likely see less than half of their usual allotment, with the amount depending on their household size and income, according to Stacy Dean, who ran the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, during the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  States will have to recalculate these recipients’ benefit amount based on the reduced maximum allotment tables that USDA issued in its guidance, which is a faster way to get the payments out the door than to cut all recipients’ assistance in half. (States already base SNAP benefits on the agency’s maximum allotment tables.)\n \n\n   \n    Push to provide full benefits\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Rhode Island, meanwhile, scheduled a Thursday hearing to consider a fresh request for an order requiring the Trump administration to provide full food stamp benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  The hearing before US District Judge John McConnell will be the latest episode in a dramatic showdown over the benefits that is playing out in two federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  After the government notified McConnell of its plans on Monday that it would provide only partial SNAP benefits, the coalition that brought the legal challenge pressed the judge to intervene yet again, arguing USDA’s choice did not comport with the requirements of his order last week.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs are asking the judge to issue a new order that would tap into unused tariff funds meant for child nutrition programs to provide SNAP benefits for November. As part of that bid, they seized on Trump’s social media post in their lawsuit challenging the decision not to fully fund SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition to threatening defiance of the Court’s order, the post makes plain what Plaintiffs explained in their motion to enforce: Defendants are withholding SNAP benefits from individuals and families who need vital food assistance for partisan political gain,” attorneys for the coalition wrote in court papers.\n \n\n   \n  But the USDA told the court Monday that it would not utilize the tariff revenue because it would endanger the nation’s free and reduced-price school meals program, which serves about 29 million children a day. (The agency has transferred $750 million in tariff revenue to the WIC food assistance program for pregnant women, new moms and young children.)\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s hearing is set for 3:30 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"Timeline of US Strikes on Boats That Have Killed 67","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States military, under the Trump administration, has carried out 16 lethal strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans, killing 67 people across 17 boats, targeting vessels allegedly operated by designated terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and Colombian-affiliated cartels.

alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, killing two people, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has killed 67 people in 16 strikes that have destroyed 17 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory.

Gavin Newsom, after Texas Republicans redrew their maps to create five new seats that will favor the GOP at the behest of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom has made himself the face of the effort, investing  his own political capital  into his party’s efforts to win back control of the US House next year.\n \n\n   \n  But while Texas Republicans were able to pass new maps through the legislative process, California Democrats had to first seek voter approval. That’s because Californians amended their state Constitution in 2010 to give an independent redistricting commission the power to set congressional lines.\n \n\n   \n  Proposition 50 would give lawmakers the right to temporarily override that map through the 2030 election, after which the commission would draw the next decade’s maps.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of the measure have argued it will level the playing field ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when Democrats hope to retake control of the US House, and serve as a check on the Trump administration. If passed, it would help Democrats neutralize much of the advantage Republicans have gained after redrawing congressional maps in Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  “The essence of Prop 50 is to say that if you are going to play that game, then we are going to try to counteract that abuse of the system,” said former President Barack Obama, who has thrown his support behind getting the measure approved, during a virtual event with Newsom last month.\n \n\n   \n  Critics, however, say Proposition 50 would undermine the nationwide effort to promote nonpartisan redistricting, and they have said Democrats may be reluctant to relinquish the power to draw the congressional map in the next decade and cede seats back to Republicans. Several Democrats have already announced their plans to challenge incumbent Republicans in the proposed new districts.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s this war going on all over the United States. Who can out cheat the other one?” former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served from 2003 to 2011, told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Texas started it. They did something terribly wrong. And then all of a sudden California says, ‘Well, then we have to do something terribly wrong.’ And then now other states are jumping in.”\n \n\n   \n  Newsom and other Democrats backing the measure have stressed that Proposition 50 reaffirms the state’s general support for independent redistricting, despite the current attempt to gerrymander the state.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/reaction-trump-cheney-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump, a longtime Cheney critic, keeps quiet on former vice president’s death","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The death of former Vice President Dick Cheney has drawn bipartisan condolences, but President Donald Trump has remained silent, reflecting a long-standing personal and political animosity that dates back to 2011 and intensified after the January 6 Capitol attack.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While condolences for  former Vice President Dick Cheney  have poured in from both sides of the aisle,  President Donald Trump  has not addressed his death on Tuesday nor shared anything about it among his many posts on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Neither has Vice President JD Vance. The White House offered a muted reaction, including a perfunctory response from press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who told reporters at Tuesday’s press briefing that Trump was “aware” of Cheney’s death and noted that flags have been lowered to half-staff.\n \n\n   \n  The reaction was in keeping with Trump’s long-standing disdain for the former vice president, which he voiced long before he ever campaigned and won on dismantling the GOP establishment at the crux of Cheney’s ascent to power.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t like Cheney when he was a vice president. I don’t like him now,” Trump said in a 2011  video  taped from his Trump Tower desk.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, a hardline conservative,  endorsed  Trump’s 2016 run for president, but crossed the aisle in 2024 to endorse Kamala Harris.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump-Cheney relationship deteriorated significantly after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The former vice president sharply  criticized  Trump as a “coward” and a threat to the republic in an ad supporting his daughter, then-Rep. Liz Cheney, in her 2022 reelection campaign, which she lost in the primary to a Trump-backed challenger. Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the attack.\n \n\n   \n  In  endorsing  Harris, Dick Cheney said in a statement that citizens “have a duty to put country above partisanship.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt on Tuesday did not respond to inquiries as to whether Trump planned to speak at Cheney’s funeral or if he had spoken with members of the Cheney family.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president is aware of the former vice president’s passing, and as you saw, flags have been lowered to half-staff in accordance with statutory law,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  White House flags were lowered hours after Cheney’s death was announced on Tuesday morning, but the moment was not accompanied by a presidential proclamation.\n \n\n   \n  Federal laws govern flying American flags at half-staff. According to the  Department of Veterans Affairs , flags at all federal buildings, grounds and naval vessels must fly at half-staff for 30 days after the death of a president or former president, and 10 days for a vice president, Supreme Court chief justice or speaker of the House. For former vice presidents, flags must fly at half-staff between the day of death and interment.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump took office on January 20, the White House flag was flying at half-staff in honor of former President Jimmy Carter, who died on December 29, 2024. Trump, who once called the Democrat a “nice man” but “terrible president,”  signed  a presidential proclamation within hours of his swearing-in, requiring the flag to be raised to full-staff on Inauguration Day.\n \n\n   \n  But flying the flag at half-staff for other officials is at the president’s discretion. Trump has extended the honor three times during his second term: to assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September, to the victims of a school shooting at a Minneapolis church in August, and Pope Francis in April.\n \n\n   \n  Trump reflected on his relationship with Cheney briefly during a town hall with Tucker Carlson days before the 2024 election – weeks after Cheney endorsed Harris.\n \n\n   \n  “I was surprised a little bit with Dick Cheney. I didn’t know him at all,” Trump said, adding that they had spoken after Trump  pardoned  ex-Cheney aide Scooter Libby in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He added: “I was a little surprised because I actually thought that Dick Cheney would go with me over his daughter and he didn’t.

That’s affected our pipeline,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy also reaffirmed if the airspace wasn’t safe, the DOT would “shut it down.” He said some controllers may work two positions versus one because of the callouts, which is allowed and safe, but does pose a greater risk.\n \n\n   \n  “We delay flights, we cancel or tell airlines to cancel flights if we don’t have enough controllers to effectively and safely manage our skies, Duffy said. “With this shutdown, it would be dishonest to say that more risk is not injected into the system. There is more risk in the system.”\n \n\n   \n  While  most aviation experts  agree it is safe to fly during the shutdown, the union representing air traffic controllers, which has pushed hard for the government to reopen, says each day it stays closed, the less safe the system gets.\n \n\n   \n  “Every single day that this goes on, tomorrow is now less safe than today,” said Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, on CNN News Central Monday. “We’re supposed to go to work and be 100%, 100% of the time. I’m going to work right now, and I’m thinking about, ‘how do I pay my rent?’”\n \n\n   \n    TSA also sees staffing shortages\n \n\n   \n  TSA workers under the Department of Homeland Security are also going without pay and some of them are not showing up for work.\n \n\n   \n  Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport warned travelers of up to three-hour waits for security screening this week. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport warned of long lines last month caused by the shortage of workers.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, Delta Air Lines, whose largest hub is Atlanta, said it is utilizing a “years-long partnership” with TSA to assist workers near screening checkpoints and “free up” certified TSA screeners to process passengers.\n \n\n   \n  “Delta Air Lines implores Congress to immediately pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government so that our air traffic controllers, TSA and CBP officers charged with the safety and efficiency of our national airspace can collect the paychecks they deserve,” a Delta spokesperson said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/harvard-university-explosion-arrests","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"17:47:00.000Z","title":"Two Arrested in Connection with Explosion at Harvard Medical School, FBI Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two men, Logan David Patterson and Dominick Frank Cardoza, were arrested in connection with a firework explosion at Harvard Medical School’s Goldenson Building on November 3, 2025.

the arrests Tuesday of two men who authorities say are responsible for a weekend explosion inside a Harvard Medical research lab — an act that one official called “selfish” and “shortsighted.”\n \n\n   \n  Logan David Patterson, 18, and Dominick Frank Cardoza, 20, both of Massachusetts,  were arrested  and charged with conspiracy to damage by means of fire or an explosive a building belonging to an institution that receives federal financial assistance, according to a criminal complaint. It’s unclear whether the two have attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  It’s too early to speculate on the motive, as the investigation is ongoing, said Leah Foley, the US attorney for the district of Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  But a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN the two men filmed the explosion and later showed it to friends. The official added so far, the two men did not appear to be driven by political ideology.\n \n\n   \n  The men were arrested Tuesday morning at their homes, said Ted Docks, special agent in charge at the FBI’s Boston division.

EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A judge heard testimony Tuesday about overflowing toilets, crowded cells, no beds and water that “tasted like sewer” at a  Chicago-area building  that serves as a key detention spot for people rounded up in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  People who were held at the building in Broadview, just outside Chicago, offered rare public  accounts about the conditions  there as U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman considers ordering changes at a site that has become a flashpoint for protests and confrontations with federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want anyone else to live what I lived through,” said Felipe Agustin Zamacona, 47, an Amazon driver and Mexican immigrant who has lived in the U.S. for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Zamacona said there were 150 people in a holding cell. Desperate to lie down to sleep, he said he once took the spot of another man who got up to use the toilet.\n \n\n   \n  And the water? Zamacona said he tried to drink from a sink but it “tasted like sewer.”\n \n\n   \n  A lawsuit filed last week accuses the government of denying proper access to food, water and medical care, and coercing people to sign documents they don’t understand. Without that knowledge, and without private communication with lawyers, they have unknowingly relinquished their rights and  faced deportation , the lawsuit alleges.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an issue of not getting a toilet or a Fiji water bottle,” attorney Alexa Van Brunt of the MacArthur Justice Center told the judge. “These are a set of dire conditions that when taken together paint a harrowing picture.”\n \n\n   \n  Before testimony began, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman said the allegations were “disgusting.”\n \n\n   \n  “To have to sleep on a floor next to an overflowing toilet — that’s obviously unconstitutional,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Jana Brady of the Justice Department acknowledged there are no beds at the Broadview building, just outside Chicago, because it was not intended to be a long-term detention site.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have “improved the operations” over the past few months, she said, adding there has been a “learning curve.”\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions are not sufficiently serious,” Brady told the judge.\n \n\n   \n  The building has been managed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for decades. But amid the Chicago-area crackdown, it has been used to process people for detention or deportation.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who has led the Chicago immigration operation, said criticism was unfounded.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they’re doing a great job out there,” he told The Associated Press during  an interview  this week.\n \n\n   \n  Testifying with the help of a translator, Pablo Moreno Gonzalez, 56, said he was arrested last week while waiting to start work. Like Zamacona, he said he was placed in a cell with 150 other people, with no beds, blankets, toothbrush or toothpaste.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just really bad. … It was just too much,” Moreno Gonzalez, crying, told the judge.\n \n\n   \n  Claudia Carolina Pereira Guevara testified from Honduras, separated from two children who remain in the U.S. She said she was held at Broadview for five days in October and recalled using a garbage bag to clear a clogged toilet.\n \n\n   \n  “They gave us nothing that had to do with cleaning. Absolutely nothing,” Guevara said.\n \n\n   \n  Another witness,  Ruben Torres Maldonado , said he slept on the concrete floor and would fill water bottles to use as pillows.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said he could make a decision Wednesday on the request for a restraining order.\n \n\n   \n   For months  advocates have raised concerns about conditions at Broadview, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.\n \n\n   \n  The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, leading to the arrests of numerous protesters. The demonstrations are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/europe/russia-nuclear-burevestnik-poseidon-awards-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:01:00Z","title":"Putin hails developers of nuclear-powered Burevestnik missile, in latest signal to the West","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded state honors to the developers of the Burevestnik cruise missile and Poseidon underwater torpedo, emphasizing their historical significance and long-range capabilities—claiming the Burevestnik travels over 8,700 miles and the Poseidon over 6,000 miles.

has given state awards to the developers of the  Burevestnik  cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater torpedo, the latest signal in what analysts have cast as efforts by the Kremlin to discourage the West from supporting Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  At an awards ceremony in the Kremlin on Tuesday, Putin claimed the two nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable weapons were of “historic significance” for Russia and “for the entire 21st century.”\n \n\n   \n  “In terms of flight range, the Burevestnik … has surpassed all known missile systems in the world,” Putin said in a speech, praising the state of Russia’s defense technology.\n \n\n   \n  Putin also said that Russia has begun serial production of the  Oreshnik , another nuclear-capable missile. Russia used the hypersonic Oreshnik in a strike on the Ukrainian region of Dnipro in November 2024 – the first time in history an intermediate-range ballistic missile has been used in battle.\n \n\n   \n  The awards ceremony comes amid growing tension between Moscow and Washington, after US President Donald Trump – frustrated by Putin’s prevarications over ending the war in Ukraine – last month imposed  sanctions  on two Russian oil giants and cancelled a proposed  summit  with the Russian leader in  Hungary .\n \n\n   \n  Days after Trump’s sanctions, Putin announced on October 26 that Russia had successfully tested the Burevestnik cruise missile. In a video released by the Kremlin, Putin – wearing military garb – was shown meeting with Russia’s chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, who told the president that the Burevestnik flew 8,700 miles (14,000 kilometers) over 15 hours.\n \n\n   \n  On October 28, Putin claimed the Poseidon – another “invincible” Russian weapon with a range of more than 6,000 miles (9,650 kilometers) – had been successfully tested.\n \n\n   \n  Neither weapon is new. Putin unveiled both weapons in 2018, and even announced a successful test of the Burevestnik in  2023 .\n \n\n   \n  But analysts say Russia is using previously announced missile technology to send new nuclear threats to the West, and the US in particular.\n \n\n   \n  “The repeated emphasis on the long range of the weapon and ability to overcome any missile defense system also indicates that the intended target would be the United States, not a regional adversary that Russia could strike with much cheaper shorter-range systems,” the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said in a report published Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The report noted the Trump administration’s plan to build a  “Golden Dome”  missile defense system to shield the US from foreign attacks. Although Putin did not explicitly reference the Golden Dome in his October 26 announcement of the Burevestnik test, he has repeatedly stressed the missile’s ability to evade missile defenses.\n \n\n   \n  “Putin is using this test to create fear in the United States to discourage US decisionmakers from pursuing policies that threaten Russian interests,” the CSIS report said.\n \n\n   \n  The awards ceremony in the Kremlin comes days after Trump  ordered  the resumption of US nuclear weapons tests. The US president said he gave the order “because of other countries’ testing programs.”\n \n\n   \n  In his speech Tuesday, Putin claimed that Russia “is not threatening anyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “Russia, like all other nuclear powers, is developing nuclear potential and its strategic potential.

The judge said she wanted to review more complete statements than the Justice Department already has provided from the grand jury proceedings in Comey’s case.\n \n\n   \n  It is highly unusual for a US attorney to single-handedly secure indictments before a grand jury – which Halligan did against both Comey and James days after Trump appointed her to the top prosecutor job. But it’s also somewhat unusual for a federal judge to demand looking at internal records privately, called “in camera.” Typically, prosecutors can summarize their positions for courts without judges needing to double-check or dig further.\n \n\n   \n  Currie is set to hear arguments from both defense teams and the Justice Department on November 13 about Halligan’s role in the cases.\n \n\n   \n  The defense teams hope to have the criminal cases dismissed, arguing that Halligan doesn’t have the authority because the Eastern District of Virginia hasn’t had a Senate-confirmed US attorney for longer than the 120 days interim appointees are allowed, and that the former Trump personal attorney and White House staffer hadn’t come from another job within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Currie said in a court order on Monday she “finds it necessary to determine the extent of the indictment signer’s involvement in the grand jury proceedings.” And in an atypical follow-up on Tuesday, Currie said the Justice Department, in initially providing records to the judge, didn’t include transcripts that captured remarks Halligan made before and after a witness testified to the grand jury in the Comey case.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also wanted to see the transcript of an initial attempt to secure an indictment, where the grand jury rejected one charge against Comey. The ex-FBI director was ultimately charged with two counts: making a false statement and obstructing a congressional proceeding. He has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n    Tension in Tennessee \n \n\n   \n  In the criminal case against the mistakenly deported then criminally charged Abrego Garcia, federal Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr. in Nashville ordered prosecutors to send their internal communications to him. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys contend he has been unfairly prosecuted for political reasons.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing where the No. 2 leader of the Justice Department may have to testify is now scheduled for early December. The judge wants to privately review communications between Blanche’s office in Washington, DC, and the Tennessee-based federal prosecutors’ office, which charged Abrego Garcia.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also told the Justice Department to send to the court under seal other records it might have related to the federal government’s decision to prosecute him rather than deport him this spring. He was returned to the US after being wrongfully deported to a Salvadoran prison and then was charged with human smuggling linked to a traffic stop years ago. He is fighting the charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department submitted some documents under seal last week. But Crenshaw in recent days said they needed “more time to finish collecting and producing documents.”\n \n\n   \n  Crenshaw said that the Justice Department said it had no documents “for entire categories of information requested by the court,” but then said “the Government certainly has additional responsive documents” on its decision to prosecute Abrego Garcia over deport.\n \n\n   \n  “The Government shall continue to solicit responsive documents” and keep sending them to the judge, Crenshaw has ordered.\n \n\n   \n  But the matter isn’t totally resolved. The judge’s efforts to weigh whether Abrego Garcia was unfairly prosecuted will continue in a larger standoff slated for next month in Crenshaw’s courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  Abrego Garcia’s attorneys seek to question under oath Justice Department officials, including a former prosecutor on his criminal case in Tennessee who had resigned, and three attorneys from the Deputy Attorney General’s office, including Blanche himself.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors on the case have said Blanche’s and his deputies’ testimony would be unnecessary, despite Blanche speaking on national TV about the decision to charge Abrego Garcia and return him to the US from El Salvador. They also argue official decision-making should be protected from being disclosed in court because of executive branch confidentiality.\n \n\n   \n  “Given that undisputed evidence shows that there is no link between the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and the decision to prosecute, there is no basis for subpoenas seeking to compel testimony from high-ranking officials in that office, including the Deputy Attorney General himself,” prosecutors wrote to the court on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors in the case say, however, the former acting US Attorney in Nashville, Homeland Security investigators and a state trooper who stopped Abrego Garcia for speeding on the interstate highway in 2022 could testify.\n \n\n   \n  The department has also indicated it has wanted to deport Abrego Garcia imminently, which could end the criminal proceedings, and Abrego Garcia’s attorneys are advocating to have his charges dismissed if Blanche won’t testify.\n \n\n   \n  “The very officials whose testimony is required to meet that burden” to show in court the case should stay alive, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys wrote this week, “are resolutely unwilling to show up. For anyone interested in good government, that is profoundly troubling.”\n \n\n   \n  The depth Crenshaw ultimately decides to probe into top Justice Department decision-making could factor into the Comey and James cases, too.\n \n\n   \n  Both of those defendants are fighting their charges, and asking judges to dismiss their cases because they say Trump unfairly pushed for their indictments.\n \n\n   \n  “Objective evidence,” Comey’s team wrote to the court, noting dozens of angry social media posts the president has made about Comey, “establishes that President Trump directed the prosecution of Mr. Comey in retaliation for Mr. Comey’s public criticisms and to punish Mr. Comey because of personal spite. Such a vindictive prosecution serves no legitimate government interest and contradicts fundamental constitutional values.”\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department this week argued that years of  Trump commenting on social media  that he wanted to see Comey indicted didn’t mean the Justice Department was unfairly targeting the former FBI Director with criminal charges now.\n \n\n   \n  And on Tuesday afternoon, federal prosecutors also told the court it didn’t immediately plan to hand over documents to defense lawyers related to the decision to charge James with mortgage fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors say, according to the filing, that James shouldn’t have more access to their internal records unless there are further court proceedings.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/longest-government-shutdown-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"16:55:00Z","title":"The last government shutdown was the longest in nearly 50 years.

Tomatoes?”\n \n\n   \n  Lairmore said he could not tell from the picture, but claimed he had mustard stains on his uniform and pieces of the sandwich hanging from his radio equipment that night.\n \n\n   \n  “From the photo it looks bent and out of shape,” the officer said of the sandwich.\n \n\n   \n  Lairmore also said he had received gag gifts related to the sandwich incident from some of his colleagues, including a plush sandwich and a patch that said “felony footlong.”\n \n\n   \n  Lairmore chuckled when he described the gifts. Of the stuffed toy sandwich, he said, “I put it on top of my shelf in the office.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the incident and after leaving the Subway restaurant, Dunn soon became “red-faced and enraged,” Lairmore testified, “calling me and my colleagues all kinds of names. Saying we were fascist.”\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t respond. That’s his constitutional right to express his opinion,” Lairmore, a division chief who has been with Customs and Border Protection for 23 years, said.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, body-worn camera footage taken from the night of Dunn’s arrest was played for the jury, including a portion where Dunn told an officer: “I was trying to draw them away from where they were. I succeeded.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘You can’t go around throwing stuff at people when you’re mad’\n \n\n   \n  As neither party disputes the basic facts of the case, jurors will need to determine whether the sandwich-throwing is enough to convict Dunn on the misdemeanor assault charge.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, I understand you may all have views of the federal law enforcement presence in DC,” Assistant US Attorney John Parron told the jury during opening statements Tuesday. “And that’s fine, we’re not trying to convince you otherwise. But respectfully, that’s not what this case is about. This case is about the fact that you can’t go around throwing stuff at people when you’re mad.”\n \n\n   \n  “When we have disputes, we settle them verbally,” Parron added, concluding that Dunn threw the sandwich and “forcibly assaulted him.”\n \n\n   \n  Gatto argued that the throwing of the sandwich served “as an exclamation mark at the end of a verbal outburst,” from Dunn, who was upset by the surge of federal officers in DC and the Trump administrations’ deportation efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “He is not a fan. He thinks recent immigration enforcement is racist,” Gatto said, adding that Dunn saw the local federal takeover of DC law enforcement as “fascism.”\n \n\n   \n  Of the charge her client faces, Gatto said, “bodily injury, that’s the standard.”\n \n\n   \n  “They will not come close to convincing you beyond a reasonable doubt the conduct was forcible,” Gatto concluded.\n \n\n   \n  The trial, which presiding Judge Carl Nichols called the “simplest case” in the history of the world, will continue Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  A DC jury recently acquitted a different resident who was also charged with assault for allegedly moving her knee up toward an officer while being restrained after filming officers as they made immigration-related arrests.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated to include additional testimony. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/world/2-french-nationals-freed-from-iranian-prison-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:13:00Z","title":"Two French Nationals Freed from Iranian Prison After More Than 3 Years in Detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two French nationals, Cécile Kohler and Jacques Paris, were released from Iranian prison after more than three years of detention on spying charges.

Sarah Ferris, Ted  Barrett, Adam Cancryn, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:44 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With Congress now tied for its longest-ever shutdown, a small group of fed-up lawmakers in Washington are furiously trying to end the standoff as soon as this week.\n \n\n   \n  Those members insist there’s real momentum this time. Yet the potential off-ramp doesn’t appear to deliver Democrats any real win on their biggest demand of the shutdown: health care.\n \n\n   \n  Talks over reopening the government are focused on putting together a funding package and giving Democrats a stand-alone vote to extend expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, according to sources familiar with the high-stakes negotiations. The deal would also include a pathway to move ahead with three bills to fund major agencies of the federal government through next September.\n \n\n   \n  But given that there is no guarantee that an extension of ACA subsidies will pass the Senate – much less the House — it’s unclear whether enough Democrats will accept that proposal to reopen the government, the sources said. So it is bound to prompt sharp division among Democrats about whether a vote is enough after the damaging consequences of the shutdown standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Susan Collins, the Senate’s top GOP spending leader, has been involved in a flurry of conversations in recent days to end the impasse by funding both parties’ priorities in bipartisan year-long funding bills.\n \n\n   \n  “I do believe that we are finally making progress. It’s too soon to declare that this nightmare of a shutdown is over, but I’m very cautiously hopeful that it will be resolved by the end of this week,” the Maine Republican told.\n \n\n   \n  There’s still a long way to go. Party leaders are still not talking. On Tuesday, the Senate failed its 14th vote on the GOP’s stopgap plan to reopen the government. And neither side expects tangible progress on Election Day with key races from New Jersey to California on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune is not yet certain the end is in sight. He said Monday he is “optimistic” but not necessarily “confident” bipartisan senators will reach a deal to fund the government by week’s end.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on sort of my gut of how things operate, I think we’re getting close to an off ramp,” Thune said, but he cautioned: “This is unlike any other government shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Thune also acknowledged Monday that the Senate will likely have to draft a new stopgap bill — replacing the House’s version that goes through November 21 — in order to buy Congress more time to pass those full-year spending bills. Democrats see this as an opening to support something other than the same GOP funding plan, and to have input on the new version. (One person involved in the discussions said the likely end date for the new bill would be January, though spending leaders like Collins want Congress to aim for around Christmas instead.)\n \n\n   \n  That semblance of movement comes as shutdown damage is quickly racking up. Already on day 35 of the shutdown,  food banks nationwide are swamped  with new families, furloughed workers are  applying for unemployment benefits  and air traffic is  snarling across the country .\n \n\n   \n  Collins and others involved in the talks have been mostly secretive about exactly who and what is involved. Leadership in both parties had for days largely downplayed the talks, though they are being kept up to speed by those involved, according to one person involved in the talks. For the first time, Collins said Democrats are now contributing to these appropriations talks, but there’s still a huge problem — it doesn’t solve the looming health care cliff next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if that’ll work or not. … This has nothing to do with health care, and that’s what my Democratic colleagues have harped on,” GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said bluntly.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats will soon be faced with a key question: What will they accept from Republicans after their month-long push to extend expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies? Thune has publicly offered Democrats an up-or-down vote on those subsidies — but Democrats have said it is not enough.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about her view, Sen. Elizabeth Warren stressed that Republicans need to sit down and negotiate and signaled that her party would not cave just because the shutdown effects were getting more painful.\n \n\n   \n  “He thinks he can use hungry children as a bargaining chip against Democrats, saying, in effect, that it’s only Democrats who care whether or not kids go hungry,” the Massachusetts Democrat said. “Well, it is Democrats who care, and it’s Americans who care. Republicans should come to the table and negotiate.”\n \n\n   \n  The internal Democratic debate comes at a delicate time for the party, with internal cracks already beginning to show over the momentum of Zohran Mamdani in New York’s mayoral election this week, which has bolstered progressives while ringing alarm bells for its more establishment wing.\n \n\n   \n  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders delivered an  even starker  warning to Democrats in an op-ed over the weekend, warning the party not to cave to  President Donald Trump  on the shutdown: “This may be the most consequential moment in American history since the civil war.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Running out the clock’\n \n\n   \n  There’s one notable Republican absent in the discussions: Trump, who returned from a week abroad to find little had changed on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have largely steered clear of major visible involvement in the day-to-day dynamics of the shutdown, consulting frequently with Republican congressional leaders but letting House Speaker Mike Johnson and Thune dictate much of the party’s direction. Trump aides have sought instead to demonstrate that the administration is still pushing ahead on major priorities and policy announcements.\n \n\n   \n  Yet behind the scenes, officials have grown increasingly antsy as the shutdown drags on far longer than any of them expected.  Polling shows  Americans still placing significant blame on Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, complicating a messaging war that the White House initially anticipated it would decisively win.\n \n\n   \n  The health care rate hikes that Democrats initially shut down the government over more than a month ago are also now starting to hit consumers, further amplifying the issue at a moment in which voters are already unhappy with the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Within the White House, officials have had running debates over the administration’s health care platform, consulting with GOP lawmakers and outside policy experts in preparation for post-shutdown talks with Democrats over the restoration of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But those conversations have only progressed so far, stymied by the White House’s own hardline position against any negotiations during that shutdown. That stance, people involved in the discussions said, has made it difficult for the administration to counter Democrats’ attacks on health care, beyond offering vague assurances that officials are developing a health plan — a well-worn promise the GOP has failed to deliver on for nearly a decade.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s created a range of critical unknowns that under the current stalemate will go unanswered until the shutdown is over. Among them: what policies could win bipartisan support, the level of appetite on Capitol Hill for negotiating a broader health reform package, and what the health care landscape will look like whenever the shutdown is finally over.\n \n\n   \n  “We can come up with the policy in 30 seconds,” said one of the people involved in the discussions. “It’s just a question of what politically is going to be acceptable to the Republicans and what Democrats are going to think is enough of a fig leaf to move it forward.”\n \n\n   \n  “People see that there’s an issue that has to be fixed,” added GOP Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York.\n \n\n   \n  “The speaker and Thune have both said this is something they want to address. The willingness is there,” Garbarino told CNN last week. “But the fact that nobody’s talking to each other right now, because they haven’t opened the government, it’s kind of running out the clock.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/science/dinosaur-hadrosaur-tail-injuries-sex","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:00Z","title":"Mating Injuries May Lead Scientists to Identify Dinosaurs’ Sex","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in iScience proposes that healing injuries on the vertebrae at the base of the tail in hadrosaur dinosaurs—common across multiple species and continents—were caused by mating behavior, specifically by male hadrosaurs mounting females.

Additionally, evidence of dinosaurs containing fossilized eggs has been hard to come by.\n \n\n   \n  The authors of a  new study  published Tuesday in the journal iScience believe the injuries occurred during mating — and they could be used to indicate which fossils belong to female hadrosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be a game changer since it will enable other questions to be answered about differences between male and female dinosaurs,” said lead study author Dr. Filippo Bertozzo, a researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences’ Operational Directorate Earth and History of Life.\n \n\n   \n    Identifying a pattern in fossils\n \n\n   \n  Canadian paleontologist Darren H. Tanke first noticed the injuries on hadrosaur vertebrae on bones he discovered in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park throughout the 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  Tanke’s original hypothesis was that they were caused by male hadrosaurs mounting females during the mating process, but he based his claims largely on fossils found in Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Bertozzo noticed the same injury while studying a fossil belonging to the hadrosaur species Olorotitan arharensis, during a research trip to Russia in 2019. He was working on his PhD about disease in duckbilled dinosaurs while at Queen’s University Belfast. Bertozzo invited Tanke to join him in conducting new research.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to support behavioral claims, you need to have an extensive dataset able to possibly cover bias from fossilization, preservation, and collection,” Bertozzo said. “Also, the dinosaur biomechanical simulations weren’t as developed as those of today, and Darren couldn’t test his hypothesis.”\n \n\n   \n  Together, the researchers and their collaborators analyzed nearly 500 tail vertebrae across different hadrosaur species kept at museums in North America, Europe and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  The injuries and deformities they discovered on the middle part of the tail across different specimens were strikingly similar.\n \n\n   \n  “At the base of the tail, between the sacrum and the mid-point of the tail, the neural spines (the elongated bars atop the vertebra, what we call the “spinous process” in human anatomy) are broken on their tip, sometimes along the main body of the spine,” Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  The tips were either tilted, swollen, inclined or even missing — meaning the injury caused the tip to break off and become reabsorbed by the body, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The injuries were visible on several vertebrae for each specimen, suggesting the damage was spread along the main line of the tail, Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  The team carried out multiple simulations to see if the injuries could have been sustained through other activities during the dinosaurs’ daily lives, like accidentally stepping on each other’s tails, muscular strain during motion, fighting, being hunted, feeding or walking. But none of the scenarios would have consistently produced the injuries seen on the fossils, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the authors think the males may have mounted the females , who were lying on their sides, and pressed down on the females’ tails during mating, accidentally breaking the neural spines.\n \n\n   \n  “The mating hypothesis is the one that, at the moment, best explains our observations and data,” Bertozzo said. “The best evidence is the fact that we find this condition in many different species in different localities and times, suggesting it wasn’t something species-specific, but rather an event that would be conservative across all of them, happening to all of them, that is mating.”\n \n\n   \n  The injuries also didn’t appear to be fatal because signs of healing, and even evidence of a second injury, were visible.\n \n\n   \n  “Aggressively pursuing a female during reproduction might sound evolutionary disadvantageous for the continuation of the species but we already witness similar occurrences in many modern species, such as in sea lions, turtles, and some species of birds,” said study coauthor Gareth Arnott, professor in the school of biological sciences at Queen’s University Belfast, in a statement. “Reproductive competition is one of the most complicated topics in animal biology, especially for extinct species.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Albert Prieto-Márquez, a researcher in the dinosaur ecosystems research group at the Autonomous University of Barcelona’s Miquel Crusafont Catalan Institute of Paleontology, believes the consistent injury pattern of healed middle tail fractures is most likely a genuine signal, rather than coincidence. He was not involved in the study, and applauds the creative insight of the researchers, but believes more evidence is needed.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, we can’t identify male and female dinosaurs just by looking at tail injuries,” he said. “To be sure, we’d need to find the same pattern in specimens that we know are female, for example with eggs or medullary bone preserved.”\n \n\n   \n  Medullary bone is temporary tissue that forms inside a cavity in long bones of birds and dinosaurs to provide calcium for eggshells, and was previously used in research to  identify a pregnant Tyrannosaurus rex  in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  For example, in chickens, medullary bone forms one to two weeks before the first egg is laid, and is reabsorbed about three weeks after the last egg is laid, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  If the same pattern occurred in dinosaurs, any containing this evidence would have died within a time range of about five weeks during the reproduction period, the authors wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Telling female from male\n \n\n   \n  If the hypothesis can be proven, it could open up a whole new way to understand complete hadrosaur fossils that bear such injuries, Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  “This might bring a cascade of implications, such as testing whether skull crests vary between sexes, or identify anatomical features that were previously assigned to new species,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But more data is required. Although the team compiled a large dataset, they are eager to study fossils from China and South America to continue their comparisons. They also want to use more powerful computer simulations to include tail movements and muscle volumes across different injury scenarios, Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  Bertozzo is also curious to see if the injuries are present in other types of dinosaurs, like long-necked sauropods. He was surprised not to find similar lesions in iguanodons, which were ancestors of hadrosaurs and are also very common in the fossil record.\n \n\n   \n  “The story is just at the beginning, and I hope ours is only one of the initial steps to better understand this aspect of the life of dinosaurs,” Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  Determining male from female dinosaurs based on bones requires a high burden of proof, something that has historically been difficult, said Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who did not participate in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “The authors have laid out their case and I think they provide a compelling argument, but as with so many aspects of dinosaur behavior, we just weren’t around tens of millions of years ago to observe them as real animals, so there will always be some degree of doubt, some degree of uncertainty in these interpretations,” he said. “We often just can’t tell the boys from the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, a professor of vertebrate paleontology at the Hokkaido University Museum in Japan, found the study to be one of the most imaginative he’s seen in recent dinosaur paleobiology and believes the modeling in the study rules out other possible causes. While Kobayashi has  discovered new species of hadrosaurs , he was not involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  However, while Kobayashi finds the hypothesis intriguing, he regards it as a bold starting point rather than conclusive evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “This study opens a fascinating window into the private lives of dinosaurs,” he wrote in an email. “Even if not all the conclusions hold, it shows that bones can preserve traces of behavior we never thought we’d see. It’s exciting to think that even the scars of these ancient creatures can reveal moments of their most intimate lives, quite literally, the ‘love life’ of dinosaurs written in their bones.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/jeanine-pirro-reverses-fbi-firings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:07:00Z","title":"Jeanine Pirro Intervenes to Reverse FBI Agent Firings Amid Trump Administration Purge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early November 2025, DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro intervened to reverse the firings of at least four FBI agents linked to the Arctic Frost investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, citing their work on investigations she has championed.

policy ideas \n       \n  By Gloria Pazmino, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:23 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democratic nominee  Zohran Mamdani , the frontrunner in the city’s mayoral race, has multiple proposals that have garnered significant interest throughout the campaign as he aims to make the city more affordable.\n \n\n   \n  They include a plan to create New York City’s first universal childcare program, making city buses free and freezing the rent for 1 million rent-stabilized tenants in the city.\n \n\n   \n  He has also proposed a tax on the city’s wealthiest residents and an increase in the city’s corporate tax rate to pay for his policy ideas, which his critics have said are unrealistic.\n \n\n   \n  As mayor, Mamdani would need the state legislature and the governor to approve a tax hike. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who endorsed Mamdani, has said she will not support a tax increase on the most wealthy, arguing she doesn’t want business leaders leaving the state.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s more on some of his policy ideas, which have provoked intense interest as well as skepticism throughout the campaign.\n \n\n   \n    Universal childcare\n \n\n   \n  The  cost of childcare  is at a crisis level in New York City, which is one of the most expensive cities in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s proposal would implement free childcare for all New York City children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old and would expand existing pre-K and 3-K programs launched during Bill de Blasio’s administration. Mamdani wants to fund his proposal by taxing high earners and corporations.\n \n\n   \n  Critics such as Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa say that there would not be enough  funding to do so .\n \n\n   \n    Fast and free buses\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani made buses a centerpiece of his campaign, proposing to expand a pandemic-era pilot program and eliminate fares on all city buses.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has proposed expanding dedicated bus lanes to speed up bus traffic. Mamdani’s free bus proposal would be funded by raising the state’s corporate tax rate as well as income taxes on New Yorkers who earn more than $1 million per year.\n \n\n   \n  Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running in the race as an independent candidate, has  criticized the proposal  as “unnecessary benefits to wealthy New Yorkers who take the bus and can afford the fare.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has proposed making subways and buses free for the lowest-income New Yorkers.\n \n\n   \n    City-run grocery stores\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani would also like to create five government-subsidized grocery stores, one in each New York City borough. This is one of Mamdani’s most controversial ideas, with critics comparing his plan to Soviet-era government food rationing.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, who refers to his plan as a “public option for produce,” has said the government stores would address rising food prices by using city land for the stores, buying food at wholesale prices and not charging owners property taxes.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at the other candidates  vying to become New York City’s mayor .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/health/obesity-glp1-gene-therapy-research","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00Z","title":"The race is on to turn your body into a GLP-1 factory","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two biotech startups, RenBio and Fractyl Health, are pioneering gene therapies to enable the human body to produce its own GLP-1 hormone — the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — in order to offer a long-term, potentially maintenance-based solution to obesity and blood sugar regulation.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  People looking to lose weight and lower their blood sugar may someday be able to get a single injection that turns their cells into tiny factories churning out a protein that is essentially the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the ambition of two biotech startups, New York-based RenBio and Fractyl Health in Massachusetts. Both companies have completed initial tests showing that their approaches work, at least in mice, and both have started tests in larger animals — pigs and monkeys — to see whether their gene therapies can work in larger animals.\n \n\n   \n  With continued success and enough funding, they hope to bring the therapies to human patients — although it may take years more research to prove that their ideas work and are safe.\n \n\n   \n  Newer GLP-1 medications – available as injections and pills – have proven to be highly effective for weight loss, ushering in a new era of obesity treatment.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1, which stands for glucagon-like peptide-1, is a hormone made by the body that helps signal to the brain and the gut that it’s full and doesn’t need to eat any more. The new weight loss drugs mimic the action of this hormone by increasing the secretion of insulin to lower blood sugar. They also slow the movement of food through the digestive tract, which helps people feel full more quickly and for longer, and they work in the brain to reduce appetite.\n \n\n   \n  In less than two years, the percentage of American adults using these meds for weight loss has roughly doubled, rising from 5.8% to 12%, according to  a recent Gallup report . Their popularity may finally be making a dent in the nation’s obesity rate, which dropped from 39.9% in 2023 to 37% in 2025, according to Gallup.\n \n\n   \n  But the medicines can be expensive, and up to half of users say they have side effects including nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Studies suggest that people need to continue using them to maintain their weight loss, but many people don’t love the idea of staying on them indefinitely. A  recent study  found that nearly two-thirds of people without diabetes who started GLP-1 drugs stopped within a year.\n \n\n   \n  The next wave of research has sought to capitalize on the benefits of GLP-1s with fewer downsides. That’s where companies like Fractyl and RenBio come in.\n \n\n   \n  Fractyl is presenting  the latest results  from its trial of a gene therapy called Rejuva in mice at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society, called ObesityWeek, which is being held in Atlanta this week.\n \n\n   \n  RenBio shared its results from ongoing mouse studies as a  preprint paper , meaning it has not been peer reviewed or accepted into a medical journal, last month.  RenBio will also present updated findings at ObesityWeek.\n \n\n   \n    Turning muscle cells into GLP-1 factories\n \n\n   \n  RenBio calls its technology “Make Your Own,” and it’s a relatively simple idea. They use a plasmid — a ring of naked DNA — in saline solution.\n \n\n   \n  DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the instructions that the body uses to build and constantly refurbish itself. It lives in the nucleus, or brain, of every cell as a twisting, double-sided ladder. The ladder is made up of four individual nucleic acids, like the letters that make up words in a book, strung together in long chains that spell out the instructions for proteins.  The order of the letters tells the body how to make the proteins.\n \n\n   \n  In RenBio’s case, the researchers spelled out the instructions to make a GLP-1 receptor agonist protein — essentially the same active ingredient in medicines like Ozempic and Mounjaro — and looped it into a small circle called a plasmid. They injected saline solution containing these plasmids into muscle tissue and used short electrical pulses — milliseconds long — to zap the muscle cells.\n \n\n   \n  “It works really efficiently. Basically, the electrical pulses transiently make little pores in the cell membrane that allow the DNA rings to slip into the cell,” said Dr. Rachel Liberatore, president and chief scientific officer at RenBio.\n \n\n   \n  From there, the plasmids migrate to the nucleus, where they hang out in the jelly-like cytoplasm. When the cell gets ready to translate its own DNA, the plasmid DNA is read and translated right alongside it. When the cell reads the instructions, it builds the GLP-1 receptor agonist protein and releases it into the body.\n \n\n   \n  Liberatore said that although RenBio’s therapy uses a genetic technology, it’s not a traditional gene therapy: The researchers aren’t trying to fix a broken gene. Rather, they’re using the cell’s own machinery to turn it into a protein factory.\n \n\n   \n  “The DNA we’re injecting, the plasmid DNA, doesn’t interfere with your own DNA in any way. So it doesn’t interfere with your own chromosomes. It doesn’t integrate. It’s not something you’re going to pass on to your children,” Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  RenBio is also using this platform to make protein therapies that can be built in the same way, like antibodies to the Zika virus. The work is supported by the federal government’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or DARPA, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA.  It’s also supported by the Wellcome Trust, a health research foundation.\n \n\n   \n  In RenBio’s most successful experiments, mice injected with the plasmids lost about 15% of their body weight, which was significantly more than mice in a placebo group. The loss was maintained for at least a year after they received the plasmid DNA.\n \n\n   \n  In each formulation tested, the weight loss leveled off in mice treated with the plasmids. In essence, they hit a plateau. But that’s a good thing if you’re using a long-acting therapy, Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  “We were actually quite happy to see that, because you don’t necessarily want continued weight loss for a year, a year and a half,” Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  Glucose tolerance tests show that blood sugar was better regulated, too.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers aren’t sure how long the plasmids may remain active. The idea is that a doctor might give their patients a shot every year or two.\n \n\n   \n  “I think what our take on it is, it’s really ideally suited for the sort of maintenance phase that people are starting to talk about with GLP-1s,” Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  The plasmid platform has also been tested on monkeys, and the researchers even used the device to inject themselves – albeit with pure saline, not with any plasmids.\n \n\n   \n  RenBio hopes to begin testing its plasma platform to deliver instructions for making antibodies against the Zika virus in people next year.\n \n\n   \n    Targeting cells to help the body make more GLP-1\n \n\n   \n  Another company called Fractyl Health is taking a slightly different approach. It uses a more traditional gene therapy technique in which the outer shell of a small virus — called an adeno-associated virus — slips DNA into cells and givens them the instructions to make GLP-1.\n \n\n   \n  In rare cases, when viruses are used to deliver genes, they can trigger an immune response in the body, leading to potentially dangerous inflammation, allergic reactions or organ damage. In other cases, gene therapy vectors like viruses may wind up where they’re not supposed to be and can introduce errors into the genomes of cells, which  can lead to cancer .\n \n\n   \n  The idea is that a single treatment delivered directly to the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas would never need to be repeated.\n \n\n   \n  “Because we are delivering it locally, we believe that we will need a very low dose of this virus, which helps gives us confidence in the potential safety in people,” said Dr. Harith Rajagopalan, co-founder and CEO of Fractyl Health.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers have tried this in mice and pigs, and both tests were successful, Rajagopalan said. But mice and pigs aren’t humans, and many therapies that have succeeded in lab animals have gone on to fail in people.\n \n\n   \n  “There is promise, but much more data would be needed to consider human clinical trials, as it likely would be irreversible,” said Dr. Donald Kohn, a distinguished professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics, at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at the University of California – Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  “The concern would be, the genetic change would be permanent so if there is over-expression … which may change with various states — weight loss, illness, aging, hormonal changes — it could cause problems from over-expression with no way to reverse, except remove the pancreas or treated muscle,” Kohn said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Kohn said there has long been a debate in gene therapy about whether it should be used for non-disease treatment, such as enhancement of height or muscle mass. In general, the feeling is that it should not be used for enhancements.\n \n\n   \n  “This certainly is near that line between Medicine and enhancement and so I think that’s another reason that needs to be considered whether this is something that should be gone into,” Kohn said.\n \n\n   \n  Fractyl says it has filed the regulatory paperwork in Europe to start human trials.\n \n\n   \n  “We anticipate seeing human data in the next year, in 2026,” Rajagopalan said.\n \n\n   \n  Viruses are experts at infecting cells, so scientists use that capability to slip DNA into a cell, so the cell can start building the proteins the researchers want it to build – in this case, GLP-1.\n \n\n   \n  Gene therapy like this can be risky, however, so in order to minimize the risk, the researchers designed their DNA to recognize the promoter sequence for insulin. Promoter sequences are short stretches of DNA that tell the cell’s copying machinery where a new protein starts. It acts like an on/off switch in the DNA.\n \n\n   \n  By having the DNA sequence for GLP-1 recognize the insulin promoter, the researchers tied the function of their sequence to the production of insulin, another hormone that helps regulate blood sugar.\n \n\n   \n  That means only cells that make insulin will also make GLP-1, limiting the dose that’s delivered to the body.\n \n\n   \n  It also creates a way to dial up or down the volume of extra GLP-1. When a mouse eats a high-fat, high-calorie meal, its body will make more insulin but also more GLP-1, to guard against weight gain. When it eats a more moderate serving of its normal chow, it won’t make as much GLP-1, so it won’t lose weight when it doesn’t need to.\n \n\n   \n  In mice, the results have been encouraging, said Dr. Randy Seeley, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies hormone signaling as it relates to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Fractyl hired Seeley to test the gene therapy, and he owns stock options in the company.\n \n\n   \n  Obese mice that were treated with the gene therapy, which Fractyl calls Rejuva, lost about 20% of their body weight within three weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “It outperformed semaglutide,” the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, Rajagopalan said.\n \n\n   \n  When researchers treated normal-weight mice with the gene therapy and then fed them a high-fat diet, the mice did not gain weight. Their blood sugar also stayed normal.\n \n\n   \n  When they gave the gene therapy to lean mice who ate their normal diet, the lean mice didn’t lose excessive amounts of weight. They also didn’t seem to develop dangerously low blood sugar, suggesting that it might be safe to use to prevent obesity as well as treat and maintain it.\n \n\n   \n  It might also be a way to prevent diabetes.\n \n\n   \n  Rajagopalan envisions a day when it might be possible to identify people at risk of obesity, because of a family history or other factors, and give them gene therapy to prevent that fate.\n \n\n   \n  In a food environment where processed foods have been engineered to trick the brain into eating unhealthy amounts, he sees this gene therapy as potentially helping people regain control over their appetite and health.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is cheaper per calorie and more widely available than at any point in human history,” Rajagopalan said. “We’re just not built to make enough GLP-1 for the world around us.”\n \n\n   \n  The solution, he said, may be helping the body make more of its own.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a long way to go before you get there, and we can’t minimize the work involved. I mean, that’s equivalent to saying we’re going to colonize Mars, in terms of the magnitude of effort involved to get there,” Rajagopalan said. “But why not aspire to aspire to that?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/middleeast/trump-administration-un-resolution-gaza-security-force-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:11:00-05:00","title":"Trump administration advancing UN resolution for Gaza security force, source says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is pushing for a United Nations Security Council resolution to establish a multinational International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza as part of a US-brokered ceasefire plan.

resolution to deploy a multinational force to Gaza to uphold the US-brokered ceasefire deal, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  The details of a temporary security force in charge of demilitarizing Gaza and training a new Palestinian police force are under discussion as part of the work on the resolution, according to the source. US troops would not be part of the force on the ground in Gaza, instead operating in a coordination role outside of the territory.\n \n\n   \n  Early drafts of the resolution have been shared with other members of the Security Council, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Setting up an international stabilization force (ISF) is a key part of Trump’s  20-point  Gaza ceasefire plan, but many of the nations considering taking part have made clear that they would only join under the mandate of a UN resolution.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said while visiting Israel  last month  that some of the potential participants would only join the force if it had “some sort of international mandate,” adding that this could take the form of a UN resolution or an “international agreement.”\n \n\n   \n  Once established, the ISF would operate under a unified command in close coordination with Israel and Egypt, the source told CNN. The US has established a coordination center in southern Israel to manage the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan, including the planned reconstruction effort and the entry of humanitarian aid. According to US Central Command, nearly 40 different nations and international organizations have representation at the coordination center.\n \n\n   \n  The ISF, working together with a trained Palestinian police force, will stabilize the security situation in Gaza and ensure the demilitarization of the enclave, according to the draft resolution. That includes the destruction of military infrastructure used by Hamas, a step that risks putting the new force in direct conflict with the militant organization, which has worked to re-establish its authority since the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  The  US-brokered ceasefire plan  also calls for the international force to carry out the disarmament of Hamas, but countries have been reluctant to agree to such a task.\n \n\n   \n  Several Muslim-majority nations that are  considering participation in the ISF  met in Istanbul on Monday to discuss the mission. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who attended the meeting, told a news conference that the countries will decide whether to participate in the mission depending on the definition of the force and the UN mandate.\n \n\n   \n  “We are ready to shoulder the burden for peace. We are ready to make any sacrifice. But… it’s crucial that the documents and framework that emerge are of a quality we can clearly support. Therefore, our diplomatic contacts and efforts on this matter continue,” Fidan told a news conference after the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what role Turkey will play in the force but Israel has made it clear that it will not tolerate the presence of Turkish troops in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Israel was reluctant to agree to a UN mandate for the international force but backed down under US pressure, according to a senior Israeli official. Even so, Israel was involved in drafting the resolution and is still trying to influence its wording, the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “At the moment, there aren’t any major issues for us — the question is whether it will stay that way,” the official said. The current working draft does not include any reporting requirement to the Security Council, and Israel wants it to stay that way.\n \n\n   \n  “Some countries will try to increase the Security Council’s involvement as much as possible, and Israel will seek to prevent that,” the official added.\n \n\n   \n  Under the draft resolution, the ISF would operate until the end of 2027, at which point it would require renewal for its mandate in consultation with Israel, Egypt and members of the Security Council.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Kurtzer-Ellenbogen, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute, said that ideally an international force would have begun operating the moment the ceasefire went into effect in early October. The agreement calls for the “immediate” deployment of the force.\n \n\n   \n  “These matters of composition, lack of clarity around the specifics of the disarmament mandate, and the uncertainties around what interaction and coordination will inevitably entail with the (Israel Defense Forces), undoubtedly raise challenges for launching,” Kurtzer-Ellenbogen told CNN.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/uk/england-train-stabbing-driver-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:09:00-05:00","title":"‘Heroic’ actions of train employee and driver saved many lives in England stabbing attack, police say","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a stabbing attack on a London North Eastern Railway train traveling from Peterborough to London on Saturday evening, a suspect named Anthony Williams was apprehended within 11 minutes of the first emergency call.

PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There were just 11 minutes between the moment British police received an emergency call about a  stabbing on a train  heading to London and the moment the suspect was arrested.\n \n\n   \n  Eleven victims were hospitalized in the attack, including one railway worker who is in critical but stable condition, according to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have said the casualties would have been far worse if not for the actions of the “heroic” railway worker who tried to stop the attacker on the train and the driver who arranged for the train to be diverted to a nearby station.\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train, which was taking passengers from northern England to the British capital on Saturday evening, had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place. The first emergency call to Cambridgeshire police was at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time. By 7:50 p.m., officers had arrested the 32-year-old British suspect on the platform at Huntingdon station, police told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train worker, who was critically injured after confronting the attacker, has been named as 48-year-old Samir Zitouni, who has worked for LNER for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  “In a moment of crisis, Sam did not hesitate as he stepped forward to protect those around him,” LNER managing director David Horne said. “His actions were incredibly brave, and we are so proud of him, and of all our colleagues who acted with such courage that evening.”\n \n\n   \n  His family added in a statement: “We are immensely proud of Sam and his courage. The police called him a hero on Saturday evening, but to us – he’s always been a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday paid tribute to him saying he “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police (BTP) said that “detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Three other casualties remain stable in the hospital, BTP said in an update on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander also paid tribute to emergency services and, in particular, the train driver, “who had the presence of mind to phone the signals in Network Rail and get the train onto that slow line into Huntingdon station and a place of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed train was scheduled to pass through the station on a fast line, but driver and signalers quickly arranged for it to divert onto a slow track so it could stop alongside the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Open-source data shows that a signaler made the first alteration to the train’s planned route at 7:40 p.m. local time – only one minute after police received the first call about the attack. Another local train was already at the platform at Huntingdon – once it had left, the signaler was able to guide the LNER train safely into the platform where it stopped by 7:44 p.m.\n \n\n   \n  Huntington station happens to be around the corner from the Cambridgeshire Constabulary police headquarters, and both response officers and armed officers were quickly on the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Train driver Andrew Johnson told ITV News: “I was only doing my job. It was my colleague who is in hospital who was the brave one.” Johnson, from Peterborough, served in the Royal Navy for 17 years, according to LNER.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has been praised for remaining calm as the attack unfolded and choosing not to make an emergency stop between stations, where it would have been more difficult for authorities to respond. Instead, the swift decisions by Johnson and the signaler enabled the train to be stopped at Huntingdon; the next opportunity would have been a station seven minutes further down the line.\n \n\n   \n  Train drivers in the United Kingdom have extensive route training and are required to know the location of every signal and track layout on their route, including in the dark. Signalers have similar detailed knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  Nigel Roebuck, an organizer for the train drivers’ union ASLEF and a lead officer with LNER, told British media that “the driver did everything he was trained to do, at the right time and in the right way.”\n \n\n   \n  “He showed real courage, real dedication, and real determination in the most difficult of circumstances,” Roebuck added. “Our thoughts tonight are with his colleague who is still in intensive care.”\n \n\n   \n    Suspect charged with multiple attempted murders\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive for the attack but said that there was no evidence to suggest it was terror related. Mahmood said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  The man apprehended, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article. He was also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with an incident that happened earlier on Saturday at a station in London. Williams was remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  A second man was initially arrested at the scene, but he was later released without charge.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, police are investigating three more knife incidents they believe are linked to the attacker that took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n    Witnesses describe running from attack\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  At first she thought it was a Halloween prank, but it became clear it was a genuine attack when the man shouted that someone had a knife and more people came running down the train.\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses. Other passengers were able to hide themselves in the train’s buffet carriage.\n \n\n   \n  Another witness, Thomas McLachlan, told the BBC: “There were definitely many heroes on that day, many kind people who just wanted to help those around them – people handing out blankets, hand warmers.”\n \n\n   \n  McLachlan said he saw one injured man who had been slashed in the face. He and another witness told local media that he heard the man had been “trying to protect a young girl from being attacked” when he was stabbed.\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Catherine Nicholls and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/science/nasa-goddard-building-closures-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"14:55:00Z","title":"NASA May Be Quietly Gutting an Iconic Campus With What It Calls Strategic Closures, Workers Fear","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is undergoing a series of unannounced building closures, with 13 buildings — including over 100 laboratories — being emptied and padlocked during a federal shutdown.

Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:55 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Alarm is growing among federal workers at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center’s main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland — the nerve center for groundbreaking missions like the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes — as more than a dozen buildings on the campus are being emptied and padlocked during the federal shutdown, with very little notice to employees, said four sources who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. NASA leadership has pushed back against those concerns.\n \n\n   \n  In one instance, furloughed employees were given just days to temporarily return to work and help empty entire buildings of highly specialized equipment, according to sources and internal emails obtained by CNN. In the communications, NASA managers wrote that equipment not moved in time — including one-of-a-kind hardware — could be thrown away or donated.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a NASA spokesperson said the building closures are part of a “strategic consolidation” plan mapped out by Goddard leaders that should not impact ongoing projects.\n \n\n   \n  But some of the sources CNN spoke with say they fear the sudden moves are part of an effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to quietly gut the Maryland Goddard campus while the government remains unfunded — a claim the spokesperson denied.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s April budget proposal would have slashed the center’s funding and workforce, including  reducing Goddard’s science staff by 42% . Funding bills passed by congressional lawmakers since then have largely excluded the President’s proposed science cuts.\n \n\n   \n  “Getting rid of Goddard removes the entire nation’s capability to build, develop and analyze data from space science satellites,” one Goddard engineer, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One document reviewed by CNN, which was compiled by more than a dozen Goddard workers concerned about the steps taken at the campus, states that 13 buildings are being shuttered, including about 100 laboratories. The roughly 1,270-acre campus  includes  more than 30 large buildings and dozens of smaller structures.\n \n\n   \n  Uncertainty around the closures has left workers perplexed and concerned that management is moving forward with plans to enact sweeping cuts before Congress passes a funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  In their statement, the NASA spokesperson said that the agency is “planning for multiple FY26 scenarios” — including the president’s budget request — “but it is important to note that NASA has and will continue to comply with the law.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A devastating loss’\n \n\n   \n  The changes described by sources have the space agency’s engineers concerned they could permanently lose access to equipment and facilities that are crucial to keeping current and future projects on track.\n \n\n   \n  The closures could impact  the  2027  launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope, a powerful successor to the Hubble and James Webb telescopes that could revolutionize scientists’ understanding of the cosmos and the beginnings of the universe, two sources told CNN. Roman is a “super Hubble” that can take full sky surveys in space and is meant to study potentially habitable planets and dark matter.\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN the closures could also affect NASA’s Dragonfly program, which aims to send a car-size helicopter to study Saturn’s largest moon for signs of habitability and is scheduled to launch in 2028. Both Roman and Dragonfly received continued funding and support even in the President’s budget request.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond those two more imminent projects, sources told CNN the sudden changes at Goddard this month could severely hurt space science and exploration in the next decade.\n \n\n   \n  “Stopping development of what’s in the pipeline now, you’re cutting off the next three decades of missions to explore the universe, to learn more about the planets and to learn more about the Earth,” the Goddard engineer said. “It’s a really devastating loss to think about for the country.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, the NASA spokesperson said that “Dragonfly and Roman will remain operational as their excepted work continues throughout the shutdown,” noting leadership does not expect projects to be delayed by the Goddard Greenbelt campus changes.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Taking a Maserati to the junkyard’\n \n\n   \n  Goddard and NASA leadership had already been working through a master plan —  hashed out years ago  — to revamp the Goddard campus, aiming to cut costs and eventually modernize some of the center’s aging infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  However, several of the buildings currently being emptied are not scheduled to be closed until the early 2030s, according to documents and first-hand accounts from sources. And workers say they haven’t seen signs of new laboratories being constructed or renovated, as is spelled out in the master plan.\n \n\n   \n  The NASA spokesperson said in their statement that “Goddard leadership proposed and was approved to initiate a consolidation of buildings at the Greenbelt and Wallops campuses” earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The new plan was hashed out in response to an exodus of employees who  took deferred resignations . About 841 Goddard employees took such offers this year, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  “Buildings vacated were approximately 40% unoccupied on average,” the spokesperson’s statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  One building that has been shuttered, however, houses Goddard’s ElectroMagnetic Anechoic Chamber, or GEMAC, a one-of-a-kind radio-proof room that is essential for testing spacecraft antennas before they are launched.\n \n\n   \n  Components for NASA’s Davinci mission, slated to conduct an unprecedented study of Venus after launch in the early  2030s, were set to be tested in the GEMAC, a source noted.\n \n\n   \n  And closing the facility would have far broader implications, impacting untold numbers of current and future projects because the unique design of the GEMAC allows for the testing of large pieces of communications equipment that would not fit in other, similar facilities, the source noted.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like taking a Maserati to the junkyard to get crushed because your driver’s license expired,” another source said. “The GEMAC is fully operational and could go on for many more years to support in-house, out of house, and the industry (like it has for several decades).”\n \n\n   \n  A NASA spokesperson said the GEMAC was in poor condition and would remain closed. The Davinci spacecraft could be tested in alternative facilities, the spokesperson said, and no other projects were slated to move through GEMAC for testing in the next 15 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN, however, that they were concerned GEMAC was the only facility of its kind with an expansive doorway suitable for accommodating large pieces of hardware — and decommissioning the facility would have a long-term impact on NASA’s spacecraft testing capabilities.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Sabotage’\n \n\n   \n  Another building that is being emptied on Goddard’s campus includes labs for teams that have been working on the Roman telescope’s propulsion subsystem, one of the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “In terms of future missions, once this lab goes away, we won’t be able to do anything like it again,” one Goddard employee said.\n \n\n   \n  That employee questioned whether the cost of moving equipment from one building to another, possibly misplacing or throwing away equipment in the process, was actually saving Goddard and the federal government money.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t understand why our management would want to internally sabotage our capabilities,” the source said. “They haven’t communicated any rationale other than they’re trying to save money, but the things they’re doing don’t actually seem to save money.”\n \n\n   \n  Infrastructure and equipment slated to be given away or disposed of at Goddard cannot be easily replaced, sources said.\n \n\n   \n    Alleged ADA violations\n \n\n   \n  Some of the workers who spoke to CNN also raised concerns that shuttering offices and ordering furloughed workers to return to the office to pack boxes may violate the Antideficiency Act, or ADA.\n \n\n   \n  The ADA is a federal law that impacts how shutdowns should be carried out and stipulates that “employees cannot ‘volunteer’ their services to agencies — i.e., provide services without payment — except in very limited circumstances,” such as being “necessary to protect human life and government property,” according to a government  definition .\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the NASA spokesperson said “two exceptions were approved to mainta﻿in our schedule for facility movements throughout the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Those exceptions mostly involved moving technical equipment, not office spaces, the spokesperson said, and “over 100 office space moves have been put on hold until the government reopens.” The statement also denies that any of the building closures or return-to-work directives related to the changes violate federal laws.\n \n\n   \n  Still, employees have also been left wondering why the moves needed to take place when so many employees remained furloughed and unaware of how sensitive hardware was being handled. It’s also unclear whether employees who were asked to help with the moves will ever be compensated for returning to work to move boxes.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this shutdown that is not like every other shutdown,” said Charles Tiefer, a former acting general counsel for the US House of Representatives and a professor emeritus at the University of Baltimore School of Law. Tiefer also noted that Trump has already said he is  considering not giving back pay  to all federal employees once the government shutdown ends, a stark departure from precedence.\n \n\n   \n  “My circle of people fell out of our chairs when we heard that,” he added, referring to attorneys and experts familiar with government spending laws.\n \n\n   \n    ‘An existential crisis’\n \n\n   \n  The purported chaos at Goddard is further affecting the morale of an employee base that has been  reeling  from job losses, looming budget cuts and discordant communication from leadership, the sources who work at the center told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Goddard in particular has been a hotspot of contention in an already tumultuous year for the space agency. The center’s leader, Makenzie Lystrup, abruptly resigned in July on the same day hundreds of scientists and current and former NASA employees signed a declaration lambasting what they perceived as “ rapid and wasteful changes ” being implemented under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Some NASA scientists were also angered and confused earlier this year over the decision to cancel a lease for the Goddard Institute for Space Studies — an offshoot laboratory located in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  Goddard has been involved in all of the space agency’s moon rovers and has sent spacecraft to Jupiter and other planets in the solar system. Employees at the center said that if the campus is seriously crippled or shut down altogether, it will be a massive loss to the US space program and hamper scientists’ efforts to better understand the universe.\n \n\n   \n  “Not many people are sending missions to Jupiter except for NASA Goddard,” the Goddard employee said. “It’s not profitable, so private industry wouldn’t do it.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels like an existential crisis; Goddard will either no longer exist at all or no longer exist the way it should.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/uk/uk-train-attack-wwk-intl-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:09:00-05:00","title":"British man charged over mass stabbing attack on train in England","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 32-year-old man from Peterborough, Anthony Williams, has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder and one count of actual bodily harm following a mass stabbing attack on an LNER train traveling from Doncaster to London on Saturday, November 3, 2025.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, Catherine Nicholls, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:09 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A man has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder over a  mass stabbing attack  on a British train on Saturday evening that targeted passengers as they traveled through central England on their way to London.\n \n\n   \n  The attack left eleven people hospitalized with injuries, one of whom is still fighting for his life in the hospital after confronting the attacker, according British Transport Police (BTP).\n \n\n   \n  The man charged, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, was remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday. While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  He is further charged with one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article in connection to the mass stabbing in Cambridgeshire, according to BTP.\n \n\n   \n  The man is also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with a separate incident that happened earlier on Saturday at Pontoon Dock Station in London.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, police are investigating three more knife incidents they believe are linked to the attacker that took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive but previously said that there was no evidence to suggest the attacks were terror-related.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the stabbing on the train.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6:25 p.m. local time on Saturday, bound for London.\n \n\n   \n  The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place.\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood.\n \n\n   \n  Cambridgeshire police received their first emergency call at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within about 11 minutes of the call, two initial suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned stop at Huntingdon station. One of those suspects was later released.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  The train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Police had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before rescinding it later.\n \n\n   \n  Williams was charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article in connection to another incident on Saturday at Pontoon Dock station in London, which is about 100 miles from Peterborough.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the victims?\n \n\n   \n  A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. Ten people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, while another person later self-presented that evening.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday evening, four people remain in hospital, one of whom is in critical but stable condition, BTP said. The critically injured man, an LNER staff member who was on the train, had “tried to stop the attacker,” police said earlier.\n \n\n   \n  LNER named him as 48-year-old Samir Zitouni, who has worked for the train company for more than two decades as a customer experience host.\n \n\n   \n  “Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives,” BTP said.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood paid tribute to the worker, saying that he “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  Zitouni’s family said in a statement: “We are immensely proud of Sam and his courage. The police called him a hero on Saturday evening, but to us – he’s always been a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims who was hospitalized is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.\n \n\n   \n    How common are such attacks in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday’s attack and offered their condolences to victims.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” Starmer wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5597978","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Sustainable Living: How Communities and Technology Are Driving Change","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article published on April 5, 2023, discusses the growing importance of sustainable practices in modern society.

Practicing classical ballet technique after having her son in 2022, she says: \"It's as if I've been reborn and I have a new body to try it through.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Copeland  took her final bow  with American Ballet Theatre in October, after spending years away from performance. In 2015, Copeland made history as the  first Black woman  to become a principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre. It was the culmination of a journey that began, not in a traditional ballet academy, but in a Boys & Girls Club gym in Los Angeles, where a shy teenager first discovered what her body could say through movement.  \"Being onstage was the first time that I felt safe in my young life,\" Copeland says. \"I've always felt very protected when I was onstage.\" But ballet can be brutal on a dancer's body. Copeland says she reached a \"breaking point\" at the beginning of 2020, which caused her to step away. \"I just felt like I needed to pause and really figure out what was going to make me feel fulfilled and good about using all that I've built, my voice and my platform and my reach,\" she says.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2022, she founded  The Misty Copeland Foundation , which aims to build pathways for children who've never seen themselves reflected on the ballet stage. That same year, she also became a mother. She says giving birth without pain medication was easier than some of her dance performances. \"I just kind of locked in and it was like, 'Oh, I know this feeling of preparation, of mental preparation and preparing yourself for the pain and breathing through the pain,'\" she says. \"I still don't think that anything compares to  Swan Lake.\" Copeland began preparing for her farewell performance with ABT a year ago. It was a way to get her body back in shape, but, more than that, it was a way to give back to a community that has given her so much. \"The reason I agreed to having the farewell performance was because I wanted to say thank you ... [to] the dance community, the Black community, all the people that have spent their hard-earned money and flown from their hometowns and come to support me,\" Copeland says. \"What I represented is something far bigger than me, and I've always known that.\" Interview highlights On her relationship to pain \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I think that's something I learned as a child. So many things in my childhood, whether they're good or bad, they prepared me to be in this position. I think about always feeling uncomfortable, whether it was in the living circumstances that we were in, in my own skin, feeling so much shame around not often having a home or food on the table, and so I didn't keep friends close. Like I just felt like I was never comfortable and was always kind of dealing with that, navigating, but like keeping a happy face on the outside. I think anyone who knew me would say: She was very quiet but she was always very happy. And you know, I had severe migraines growing up and I remember I would have to leave school early sometimes like to the point of vomiting and it was just like all this stress that I held inside, but somehow was able to still remain very pleasant on the outside. ... I think [pain] is just a part of what we are used to dealing with as performers and as dancers. And so it just kind of comes with the territory. ... Even in my last performance with ABT, I was barely walking before and somehow, you know, muster up the strength. … I found out in preparation for the performance that I have bone spurs in my left hip and a labral tear and loss of cartilage. And my doctors, they were just like, \"I don't think this is a good idea for you to push for this performance.\" And I said, well, \"I've already agreed to it.\" On painting her own pointe shoes to match her skin early in her career \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The first time I ever did it, I must have been 14, performing with  Debbie Allen  ... a mentor of mine, in her version of  The Nutcracker , which at the time she was calling the \"Chocolate  Nutcracker. \" And that was the very first time that I was understanding what the ballet shoe even represents and what the tights mean and it's an extension of yourself and your skin and it should be the same color. I was wearing brown tights then and painting my shoes. But I would continue to do that throughout the course of my career at ABT. And I would just go to the drug store and get ... the cheapest liquid foundation and put it on my shoes. It's not meant to be danced in and it doesn't have the right ingredients and consistency, it can be very slippery. But it's the first thing that a young dancer receives is their leotard, their ballet slippers and their tights And that's just right there saying for a Black or brown dancer, \"This isn't for you. You don't belong.\" On why she dances without pads in her pointe shoes \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When I started dancing, I wore lambswool or whatever kind of padding is what you put in your shoes. That was with my first ballet teacher. When I moved to my second ballet school where I was training, I think I was about 15 when I moved that school, she didn't allow for us to wear anything in her shoes. She said she could see the loss of the articulation in the toes, like when you have something between your foot and the shoe that you don't have as much control. I remember just being so terrified of her because she could tell if I snuck a little bit of tissue or anything in my shoe, I would go up on point and she would say, \"Misty, there's something in your shoe.\" I'm like, \"How does she know? She must be a witch.\" I agree wholeheartedly at this point, but preparing for this performance after having five years off and losing all of my calluses, I had to put something over my toes. It wasn't a pad, I was wearing a thin paper towel because I didn't have enough time to really build up all of the calluses that I had lost over a lifetime of training by not being in pointe shoes, but it definitely makes a difference. On collaborating with Prince \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He was my biggest supporter. He showed me what it was to be one of a kind, to be unique, to be proud to stand in his uniqueness, and to use that as a power. Whereas before I felt isolated and alone ... he really saw it as the opposite. He's like, \"You have such an advantage.\" He's like, \"You're the only brown girl out there. Everyone's gonna look at you. Now what are you gonna do?\" And then just exploring my artistry by working with him, I think made me grow in leaps and bounds as a dancer. On her body changing after pregnancy and birth I can focus on different things because my body can't do the things that it once did. It's like learning it again. It's like learning to dance again. It's learning the ballet technique again, and it keeps things fresh and exciting and it's challenging. Monique Nazareth and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

I'm Tonya Mosley. When Misty Copeland stepped onto the stage at Lincoln Center, golden confetti rained down as she took her final bow with American Ballet Theatre. After years away from performing, she returned to dance Juliet one last time and spin through Twyla Tharp's \"Sinatra Suite,\" closing a chapter that began over two decades ago. It was a farewell to a company where she made history as the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer in ABT's history. By ballet standards, Copeland came to the art form late at 13 years old. It was the culmination of a journey that began not in a traditional ballet academy, but in a Boys & Girls Club gym, where a shy teenager first discovered what her body could say through movement. Copeland rose through ABT's ranks to dance the roles that define classical ballet - Odette/Odile in \"Swan Lake,\" Juliet in \"Romeo And Juliet\" and the title role in \"Firebird.\" But her impact extends far beyond technique and tradition. As a bestselling author, film producer and founder of the Misty Copeland Foundation, her goal is to build pathways for children who've never seen themselves reflected on the ballet stage. Now, as Copeland steps away from ABT, she's turning her focus from performance to transformation, working to remake an art form that has for centuries defined beauty through exclusion. Misty Copeland, welcome back to FRESH AIR. And it's a pleasure to have you as you enter this new chapter in your life. MISTY COPELAND: Thank you. I'm excited to be here. MOSLEY: You never wanted a farewell performance, but you got one. I mean, there's a 15-minute standing ovation. How are you feeling now that it's over? COPELAND: Yeah. It's so interesting to just kind of process all that I'm feeling. I actually feel very calm and low. I don't know if that makes any sense. And it's a reminder, too, of kind of all the stages of recovery after performance that I feel like I forgot because it's been years. One of my favorite things about, you know, what I do, of course, is going on stage. But then there's something so special that happens after the fact, you know, of kind of coming down and letting your body really feel all that you put into it to get to that point and then just being grateful for it after. And I'm trying to let myself enjoy this kind of recovery process before I start to feel normal again (laughter). MOSLEY: Because this was quite a ramp-up. I mean, you had been gone... COPELAND: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...For five years. How long were you practicing to prepare yourself for this actual performance? COPELAND: Yeah, it's been over five years. I think the last time I was actually performing on stage with American Ballet Theatre was December of 2019. And I started preparing October of last year, so it was a very gentle preparation towards the end of the year - like, October through the end of the year. And then come January, I really started to really hone in on the ballet aspect of things 'cause before, it was really just getting my body back in some sort of shape because I really wasn't doing anything over the last five years. MOSLEY: No dancing? COPELAND: No dancing. MOSLEY: No dancing at all? COPELAND: No, and not a lot of physical activity either. MOSLEY: Oh. COPELAND: I really needed a break. And, you know, injuries - I don't really count injuries as breaks. But, you know, I really hadn't stopped dancing since I started at 13 and, you know, have always been very physical and was just kind of at a breaking point at - you know, at the beginning of 2020, when I just felt like I needed to pause and really figure out what was going to make me feel fulfilled and good about using all that I've built - you know, my voice and my platform and my reach. MOSLEY: How did you approach that time period, the things that you wanted to do, the insights you wanted to discover about yourself, stepping away from ballet? COPELAND: I've always just really listened to myself and my instincts and my gut and - you know, about what felt real and authentic to me and - which is why I stepped away when I did because it was no longer feeding, I guess, a part of myself that felt necessary. I've never been someone that has kind of fed off of the accolades or the applause. You know, I love being in the studio. I love being on the stage, but bows have never been my favorite thing to do and - yeah. And so I... MOSLEY: Why do you think that is? Because that's where you get all of the... COPELAND: Right. MOSLEY: ...Response to all of the... COPELAND: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...Work that you've put in. Folks are standing. They're clapping for you. They're just giving you their flowers, literally. COPELAND: Right. (Laughter) Yeah. I don't know. It's hard for me to, like, accept, I guess. I know it sounds so counter, you know, to what I do, but I've just never been someone that really enjoys being in the spotlight. I - again, I enjoy the work, and I love being on stage and there's - I've always felt very protected when I was on stage. You know, this is something as a child and from my upbringing, that being in a studio and being on stage was the first time that I felt safe in my young life. And I still feel that - a sense of that when I'm on stage. So for me, it's never been about kind of this outward thing. You know, the reason I agreed to having the farewell performance was because I wanted to say thank you. I wanted to say thank you for the dance community, the Black community, all the people that have spent their hard-earned money and flown from their hometowns and come to support me. And I understand, like, what I represent. I understand all of that. So, like, yes, I had to get back up on that stage because what I represent is something far bigger than me, and I've always known that. It's just - it can be a lot. It can be really overwhelming, and I've kind of carried that for the last 25 years. And - but yes, I am so grateful and thankful to everyone who has built me up and poured into me and invested in me, in ballet and in dance and hopefully will continue far beyond me. MOSLEY: You know, Misty, you always seem so composed. And I got to watch the standing ovation at the end, the 15 minutes. But in that moment, you were also dealing with a hip injury. COPELAND: Yeah. MOSLEY: You were in a lot of pain. COPELAND: Yeah (laughter). I think it's just a part of what we're used to dealing with as performers and as dancers, and so it just kind of comes with the territory. But it's so fascinating. You know, I've been just kind of very reflective over the last couple of months and especially over the last couple of days and just thinking about how whenever I have these, like, monumental moments, there seems to be an injury that comes with it, with all of them. And I was having this conversation with my husband about it and trying to kind of decipher, you know, what pushes me. And it's like, if I didn't have these injuries, I wonder how I would be. I wonder what - where the drive or fire - you know, if that would be coming from somewhere else. But there's always some kind of obstacle that I have to overcome to get to these - you know, the stage or to these roles. Even in my last performance with ABT, you know, I was barely walking before and somehow, you know, muster up the... MOSLEY: You were barely walking before you got up... COPELAND: ...Strength. MOSLEY: ...On stage? COPELAND: Yes. I mean, I found out in preparation for the performance that I have bone spurs in my left hip and a labral tear and loss of cartilage. And my doctors, you know, they were just like, I don't think this is a good idea for you to push for this performance. And I said, well, I've already agreed to it, and I'm definitely not going to wait any longer to get back on that stage. So what can we do to make it happen without, you know, further injuring my hip? So it's been a journey, and I've been really good about pacing myself and in good health. And then, you know, about a month before, a couple of weeks out, I think my hip was just like, I can't tolerate anymore. And it just got worse the closer I got to the performance, and I actually was canceling rehearsals and pulling back on training up until the show because I was just, you know, trying to reserve my hip for performance. MOSLEY: Oh, Misty. Every time I think about you, I think about the pain that you endure. I mean, all ballerinas, to a certain extent. But yours, you've been so open about it. COPELAND: Yeah. MOSLEY: You've documented it. When did you first begin to understand maybe your relationship to pain, to control it rather than to let it control you? COPELAND: I think that's something I learned as a child. So many things in my childhood, I feel like, really, whether they're good or bad, they prepared me to be in this position. You know, I think about just always feeling uncomfortable, whether it was in the living circumstances that we were in, in my own skin, feeling so much shame around, like, you know, not often having a home or food on the table. And so I didn't keep friends close. Like, I just felt like I was never comfortable and was always kind of dealing with that, navigating but, like, keeping a happy face on the outside. Like, you know, I think anyone who knew me would say, like, she was very quiet, but she was always very happy. And, you know, I had severe migraines growing up, and I remember I would have to leave school early sometimes, like, to the point of vomiting. And it was just, like, all this stress that I held inside but somehow was able to still remain, like, very pleasant on the outside. I think, also, just watching my mom navigate life and raising six children on her own and dealing with, you know, a lot. And so I feel like my relationship with pain, yeah, it started very early. Like, I can remember, like, 7 years old, probably. And so, coming into the dance world, and experiencing just the - I mean, leaving injury out of it, just the pain of what it takes to train in ballet and be an athlete, the mental strength, all of that, I think was very innate, very natural for me. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Misty Copeland, the groundbreaking ballerina who recently retired from the American Ballet Theatre. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR, and today we're talking to Misty Copeland, who, in 2015, made history as the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre. She recently performed for the final time with ABT after a 25-year career with the company. You revealed to us some years ago that you've been painting your own pointe shoes for years to match your skin tone. And now folks can find various different skin tones with pointe shoes and with the tights and everything. But can you take us back to when you first started doing this? When you were doing it in those early days, how were you actually doing it? What were you even using to make them your color? COPELAND: Yeah. I think the first time I ever did it, I must have been 14, performing with Debbie Allen in California in Los Angeles - she was a mentor of mine - in her version of \"The Nutcracker,\" which at the time, she was calling \"The Chocolate Nutcracker.\" And that was the very first time that I was understanding, like, what the ballet shoe even represents and what the tights mean. And it's an extension of yourself and your skin, and it should be the same color. I was wearing brown tights then and painting my shoes. But I would continue to do that throughout the course of my career at ABT. And I would just go to the drug store and get whatever the cheapest liquid foundation and put it on my shoes. I mean, it's not meant to be danced in. It doesn't have the right, like, ingredients and consistency. It can be very slippery. But it's the first thing that a young dancer receives, is their - you know, their leotard, their ballet slippers and their tights. And that's just right there saying, for a Black or brown dancer, this isn't for you. You don't belong. MOSLEY: Was there ever pushback when you started doing that in the beginning? Did anyone tell you it was wrong? COPELAND: No. You know, I definitely knew that there were certain roles I couldn't do that in. So if I was doing a more contemporary role, modern, then I would wear my skin-colored shoes. But the conversation has now evolved into, well, what classical works can we allow for dancers of color to wear their their skin color in. And so every company, you know, have kind of come up with their own set of rules, I guess, because we're kind of just, you know, making it up as we go along because it's just - it's always been this way, that when you do a classical work, everyone wears pink tights and pink shoes. And so I know at ABT, they've evolved with - I know \"Giselle,\" they allow for the court of ballet dancers now to all wear their own skin color. I believe in \"Swan Lake,\" they still wear pink. But, you know, this is an ongoing kind of learning, evolving thing, and the fact that we're even at this point and companies are having the conversation is huge. MOSLEY: I want to ask you about something that you also talk about quite a bit but I've always been sort of curious about. You don't wear pads in your pointe shoes. I mean, that's something that's pretty famous. People know this about you. Most ballerinas do, though, because even with pads, the pain can be excruciating. Why no pads? COPELAND: When I started dancing, I wore lambswool or whatever kind of padding, is what you put in your shoes. That was my first ballet teacher. When I moved to my second ballet school where I was training - I think I was about 15 when I moved to that school. She didn't allow for any - for us to wear anything in her shoes. She said she could see the loss of the articulation in the toes. Like, when you have something between your foot and the shoe, that you don't have as much control. And I remember just being so terrified of her because she could tell. If I snuck a little bit of tissue or anything in my shoe, I would go up on pointe, and she would say, Misty, there's something in your shoe. And I'm like, how does she know? She must be a witch (laughter). But, you know, I'm very grateful for - and I agree wholeheartedly, you know, at this point. But preparing for this performance after having five years off and losing all of my calluses, I had to put something over my toes. It wasn't a pad. I mean, I was wearing, like, a thin paper towel because I didn't have enough time to really build up all of the calluses that I had lost over a lifetime of training by not being in pointe shoes. But it definitely makes a difference. MOSLEY: I need to know. You mentioned your son. How does childbirth... (LAUGHTER) MOSLEY: ...Compare to the kind of pain that you've experienced - that physical pain from injuries? COPELAND: You know, I couldn't have felt more prepared for labor, you know, by being a ballerina. I felt so completely, emotionally, mentally and physically prepared to give birth. And I still don't think that anything compares to \"Swan Lake\" (laughter). MOSLEY: Really? Oh, my - OK. So wait. Misty Copeland is saying \"Swan Lake\" is harder on your body than childbirth. COPELAND: Oh, my gosh. And I know everyone has very different experiences with childbirth, and there's no way to know what someone else feels. You know, I really enjoyed giving birth to my son. Like, yes, it was difficult. There were some complications that happened. I almost had a caesarean, but my doctor pushed for me not to do it, and I ended up giving birth without any pain medication in the end. But there was something that was so familiar to me that I just kind of walked into. And it was like, oh, I know this feeling of preparation, of mental preparation and kind of preparing yourself for the pain and breathing through the pain and just staying as calm as possible, that - it was so interesting because I hadn't been on stage, you know, in some years, and I felt like I was preparing for a performance. And when I gave birth to my son, I looked at my husband and I said, I want to do that again. He was like, you're crazy (laughter). MOSLEY: What was it like to see your 3-year-old son, Jackson - he walks out with his little tuxedo to give you flowers? And 3-year-olds - they're just so precocious. COPELAND: I know (laughter). MOSLEY: They say, like, the most amazing things. What has he said about that moment? COPELAND: Oh, my gosh. I had no idea how he was going to respond. I mean, it can be really overwhelming or scary. And when I saw Jackson walking towards me and he wasn't holding Olu's hand, I kind of screamed to Olu, why aren't you holding his hand? He said, he wouldn't let me. He wanted to do this on his own. And it was just so beautiful. And, you know, I knelt down, and I hugged him. And he pulled this little figurine - like, a dog - out of his pocket, and he just goes, here's - here, Mama. This is for you. (LAUGHTER) COPELAND: And so I was, like, holding this little dog in my hand, trying to bow. But he was just so excited. He was waving at the audience, and he felt so confident and comfortable. I was like, wow. And I saw a change in him the next day. I mean, I feel like he's a different boy now, but I'm just so grateful that he experienced seeing me perform live - well, perform for the first time. He'd never seen me dance. So I... MOSLEY: Not in any way? COPELAND: No. MOSLEY: No recordings? Nothing? COPELAND: Well, he saw - he's seen me dance with, like, Elmo on YouTube (laughter). But it was really, really, really special, and he just seemed like he grew up. And, you know, I was like, a star is born. MOSLEY: I'm sure your body changed after having a baby. What has your relationship been with your body now that that change has happened and there's no going back after that? There's only just working with what you have. COPELAND: It's a beautiful thing, you know, to be able to see your body change, to acknowledge that it's changed and that it's different and that you value movement in a different way. I love a challenge, and so I love the fact that I get to experience this incredible technique of classical ballet. But it's as if I've been reborn and I have a new body to try it through, which is so cool, you know, that I can focus on different things because my body can't do the things that it once did. You know, it's like learning it again. It's like learning to dance again. It's learning the ballet technique again, and it's - it keeps things fresh and exciting, and it's challenging. MOSLEY: Were there ever moments where you're just frustrated with your body? You're like, I could do - I used to... COPELAND: Yes. MOSLEY: ...Do this. COPELAND: I think that one of the most frustrating is the loss of flexibility in my back, which I had heard, you know, seeing all the ballerinas go through ABT and have babies and come back and just say, it's not - never going to be the same. Like, the back is the one thing that, like, I just can't get it to do what it used to do. Yeah. It's a strange feeling to look back at your leg and you're like, where is it? Why isn't it up next to my ear (laughter)? MOSLEY: Right. COPELAND: Not anymore (laughter). MOSLEY: Our guest today is Misty Copeland, the trail-blazing ballerina who became the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer in American Ballet Theater's 85-year history. She performed her farewell with ABT at a star-studded gala at Lincoln Center on October 22. I'm Tonya Mosley, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DON BYRON'S \"BOUNCE OF THE SUGAR PLUM FAIRIES\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. And we're continuing our conversation with Misty Copeland, who performed her final show with American Ballet Theatre after 25 years with the company. In 2015, she became ABT's first Black female principal dancer, breaking barriers in an art form that has historically excluded dancers of color. Now, through her foundation and her advocacy work, she's fighting to expand access to ballet and create space for the next generation of diverse dancers. You know, Misty, many people who are first - there is a burden that you carry, sometimes with pride that you're undergoing all of this mental and physical pain of being the first so that those who come after you don't have to experience that. You say, like, I'm going to carry this burden and deal with all that comes with it. But then you find the Raven Wilkinsons of the world, a Black woman in ballet from the 1950s, decades before you. And then you realize, oh, there were several - maybe even many - firsts, but they were intentionally erased. Did you ever at any point feel angry about that? Because you're so poised and talking about it in such a beautiful way that allows everyone into the conversation. But was there ever a moment where you're just like, what the heck, you know? COPELAND: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. It was, you know, a combination of feelings. I think in particular, you know, with Raven Wilkinson's story and finding out about her, yeah, there was this sense of regret that maybe had I known of her story sooner, I would just have a different sense of myself. But I guess I'm just not someone that kind of, like, wallows in that space, that I feel the anger and then it's like, how can I use this and channel it to do something? And so, yeah, it went from anger to curiosity of, you know, well, how can I find out about more, and how can I share those stories? You know, I - there's a Black dance community. There's a - you know, a strong Black ballet dance community, and it's, you know, the Virginia Johnsons and the Alicia Graf Macks and Lauren Anderson and Desmond Richardson. There are people that I have been able to call on throughout my career, even just to fill in the gaps of, like, people who have come before me that have kind of made me feel more whole. And, you know, I think something that I've been so drawn to about ballet is that I could be a part of something that's bigger than me and that I could be a part of this legacy. But then to find out that there's a Black ballet history, it's like, you know, even more so, you know, feeling like I'm healing and becoming this - even more of a whole person. And it's just been so important that I'm finding ways to document our history as Black dancers through my books. I mean, that's really at the core of so many of my books and the stories that I'm telling, is that I'm finding ways to create our own history books and that the next generation can pick it up and learn something about themselves and their history. MOSLEY: Is it true that your mother also studied dance when she was young? COPELAND: Yes. Yeah, my mom loves dance, and not on a professional level by any means, but, you know, she did ballet and tap and jazz growing up. And then she was a professional cheerleader for the Kansas City Chiefs football team, and that was just a part of our household. Like, there was always music, and she was always moving. She would choreograph things for me and my siblings, like, for different talent shows when we were younger. But music was, like, the one constant in our household and in my life that I'm so grateful to her for because I feel like it's what brought me to dance. It's what allowed me to, you know, start to develop my voice and opinion and - but, yeah, she's a lover of movement and music. MOSLEY: Most of us go through a stage of rebellion when we're coming of age. And I was curious, what did your rebellion look like? COPELAND: I would say - I was probably 19 years old. I would say between, like, 19 and 21 were those years of trying to understand and find myself and connect with other people that were like me. And it definitely came out in what I was eating. I think it ended up hurting me because I wasn't taking care of myself, but it was like I didn't know how else to express myself and not feel like I was just, like, another peg, you know, in the system of ABT or - I don't know - just trying to find my voice. And so I was really, you know, pushing back against, you know, being the only. And I remember eating a lot of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. I remember going out, dancing, going out to the club, you know, just, like, really in search of myself. But I don't regret that time at all because I definitely found myself. I found my husband (laughter). I found so many incredible friends and artists and people that I feel like a lot of dancers - you get kind of stuck in this ballet bubble, and, you know, like, you can't do this. You can't do that. And then you never really kind of grow into a person and an individual, and you're kind of just, like, stunted by this ballet bubble. And I was like, I'm in New York City. I'm in one of the most, like, incredible, diverse cities with artists. And yet, I'm spending my days from, you know, 9 to 7 in a studio, and I'm the only Black person. Like, this is crazy. Like, I need to be out in the world and experiencing life. And so I was - yeah, I was going out and meeting people and exploring and seeing art. But I wasn't getting enough sleep, and I was eating poorly and gaining weight and all the things. (Laughter) I was rebelling. MOSLEY: What changed? What was the thing that made you realize, like, I'm doing this 'cause I want to do it, and now it doesn't feel so great? COPELAND: It was meeting my husband. Olu and I met when I was just 21, out at a club (laughter). MOSLEY: Yeah, yeah. COPELAND: And it was meeting him and, I guess, someone who just seemed so steady and grounded and had such a clear sense of self, even though he was - I don't know. He was 26, I think, at the time when we met. You know, I didn't grow up really understanding how to take care of my body. Like, I stumbled into ballet and happened to be good at it, and then I became a professional within four years. Everything happened really quickly, and I didn't feel like I had a really good base in terms of, like, just how to take care of myself as an athlete and treat my body with respect and fuel it. And he completely changed my mindset. You know, he was a former athlete, played basketball, but he was raised vegetarian. And he just had just such a very, like, holistic approach to how he took care of himself, and I trusted him. And he just completely changed the way that I looked at myself as an athlete and as an artist, in that it wasn't just something I was doing and I was good at it. But, like, I have to invest, the same way I do in my training, in these other aspects of myself and how I'm preparing. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Misty Copeland, the groundbreaking ballerina who recently retired from the American Ballet Theater. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ACADEMY OF ST MARTIN IN THE FIELDS & SIR NEVILLE MARRINER'S \"GISELLE, ACT I: VARIATION DE GISELLE\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, we're talking to Misty Copeland, who in 2015 made history as the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theater. She recently performed for the final time with ABT after a 25-year career with the company, though she's not retiring from dance. I want to ask you just a few questions about your relationship with Prince because it was a pretty defining time period in your life. You guys worked together for about six years, on and off? COPELAND: Yeah. You know, he definitely came into my life. You know, it was - I guess it was in that same time when I was - when I discovered Raven and was really... MOSLEY: Raven Wilkinson. Yes. COPELAND: ...Raven Wilkinson, yes - and was trying to understand how I can be my fullest and best self, how I can carry on these legacies of, you know, people who have come before me. And it was just pretty surprising to find out that Prince was a fan and that he had actually followed my career since I was very young and was - had had a vision for me to be in a music video of his and spent a year trying to find me. I still don't really understand that story. MOSLEY: I know. COPELAND: But... MOSLEY: Where was he looking? (LAUGHTER) COPELAND: I don't know. I don't know. He says he reached out to ABT many times and that I was never given the message. Maybe they didn't believe it was him. I don't know. But, you know, when we finally did connect, it just made sense, you know, for him to come into my life at that time. He was my biggest supporter. He showed me what it was to be one of a kind, to be unique, to be proud to stand in his uniqueness and to use that as a power. And I think - whereas before, I felt, you know, like, isolated and alone, being the only, and he really saw it as the opposite. He's like, you have such an advantage. He's like, you're the only brown girl out there. Everyone's going to look at you. Now what are you going to do? (LAUGHTER) COPELAND: And then - you know, and then just exploring my artistry by working with him, I think, made me grow in leaps and bounds as a dancer. You know, though I wasn't doing classical works with him, he really challenged me to improvise, to be in the moment on the stages that he performed in. And it really broadened my audience and appeal and brought people to ABT that had not been before. And being able to show a whole new audience, maybe that had never seen ballet before, me dancing en pointe on top of his piano was an incredible... MOSLEY: Yes. COPELAND: ...Opportunity. MOSLEY: That - I mean, he definitely had a vision for you. And dancing on the piano - that seems like such a feat. I mean... COPELAND: Yeah. MOSLEY: ...The stability in itself. COPELAND: (Laughter) You know, it's interesting. When we first started working together, so the first time that I toured with him, traveling through France and dancing on different stages and - he just let me improvise. He would say, like, oh, I'm going to - you know, these songs you'll dance to tonight, and, you know, I'll give you a cue to leave when it's time to go. And then, as he was preparing for his \"Welcome 2 America Tour,\" he really included me in the whole preparation for it. I mean, I was there at Paisley Park, and he was working around when I could perform with him when I wasn't performing with American Ballet Theater. So we decided on one song, and it was \"The Beautiful Ones,\" and then he had a whole idea for choreography. At the time, we were preparing to do Alexei Ratmansky's - he's the choreographer of ABT's \"Nutcracker.\" It was a new version that he was putting together. And so we would be performing it at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, at BAM. Yeah. But we were rehearsing it at NJPAC, at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. And so I would be with ABT all morning, all day, into the night and rehearsing \"The Nutcracker\" until, like, 10 p.m. And then Prince would come in a limo and pick me up from New Jersey and take me to either one of the theaters that we were performing at, or he would take me back to his hotel and we would have, like, a conference room. And I would be standing on the conference table, using that as my piano, and we'd be working through the choreography until, like, 2 in the morning (laughter). Then I'm like, Prince, I've got to work in the morning, so I've got to go. You get to sleep in all day, like the rock star you are. But it was very much this beautiful collaboration. And then to be able to perform that song with him, you know, night after night was so incredibly special. And I feel like I just grew so much as an artist and just felt like I was very open from the time that I spent working with him. MOSLEY: You know, one of the things that I was curious about regarding Prince is that he had you in the video \"Crimson And Clover,\" and it's a remake. What did you think about that choice? And also, in that video, you're sort of taking on a modern dance. It's not ballet. COPELAND: Yeah. I mean, I liked the song before Prince remade it. And so I was like, this is cool. This is - this also feels very different for him. And just listening to the lyrics, I thought it was, like, a really cool thing, just because we didn't know each other. Like, we met on the set, and... MOSLEY: Wow. COPELAND: Yeah. MOSLEY: There was no setup beforehand... COPELAND: I mean, we spoke on... MOSLEY: ...Where you got a chance to chat? COPELAND: We spoke on the phone, like, briefly, and then he asked me - he was like, you know, are you interested? Like, we could fly you out this weekend and shoot it. And so I did. But we met on the set, and so it was just, like, this kind of tension. Like, we don't know each other. And so I thought that the lyrics and the - I don't know. It just kind of all worked and made sense. And he just sat, you know, right next to the camera guy, filming it. He sat on a - what do you call it? - an apple box with his camera and was just taking pictures of me throughout the whole shoot. MOSLEY: What did that feel like? That feels like a lot of pressure. (LAUGHTER) COPELAND: Yeah. It was kind of strange, right? You know, I mean, we would chat in between, like, takes and - but I was just improvising. I mean, I had pointe shoes on, and I was just kind of making things up. And he didn't really give me much direction. He just was like, I just wanted you to be in it. Like, I envisioned you in this, and that was that. Yeah. I don't know. I thought the song made sense, especially for that time in our lives, like, coming together and not really knowing each other and getting to know each other. I thought it was cool. MOSLEY: What meaning did you put to the song? What did it mean for you for that time period? COPELAND: He had said to me, you know, many times that, you know, he actually filmed the whole video with another dancer, and he was not satisfied. And so that's when he started to look for me again. But there's, like, a line in the song that's like, I've been waiting to know her, or something like that, that I feel like just kind of sums up (laughter) that time and that moment of just him really wanting me in his life and making that happen. And it - I think it changed my life in so many incredible ways. And so it was, like, you know, meant to be. MOSLEY: You know, Misty, now that you've had that five years away and you're able to discover some things about yourself, is there anything specific that you have on your list that you want to do, that you haven't done? COPELAND: There's so much, and I feel like I've never been someone that kind of, like, has a list or, like, I have to do this. I really try and let things play out and happen organically. And if it makes sense, then I'm like, OK. Yes, this is what we're doing, you know. But I'm open. You know, I'm open to just creating and being able to be an artist in a different way now, like, to have more say in the stories that I'm telling. I'm really looking forward to all of the projects that I have on the horizon with my production company in collaboration with some incredible other producers. It just feels limitless right now. But I really - I want to stay true to myself and not just kind of be out there just to be out there, but with intention and purpose. MOSLEY: Misty Copeland, this has been such a pleasure. Thank you so much. COPELAND: Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CRIMSON AND CLOVER\") PRINCE: Come on. MOSLEY: Misty Copeland gave her final bow with the American Ballet Theatre last month. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CRIMSON AND CLOVER\") PRINCE: (Singing) I don't hardly know her, but I think I could love her. I hope she walks over 'cause I've been waiting to show her crimson and clover, over and over. Baby, I think I love you. I want to know for sure. Come here and sock it to me one time. You move me.

Lopez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:37 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At 7:32 a.m. on Friday,  FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X  that his agency “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan.”\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” Patel said.\n \n\n   \n  Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case told CNN about a cryptic reference to “pumpkin day,” online chats about an ISIS-inspired attack, and activity at a shooting range.\n \n\n   \n  The more details Patel promised ultimately arrived Monday in the form of a 73-page criminal complaint accusing Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud of  plotting an ISIS-inspired Halloween attack in the US .\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud’s attorney, William “Bill” Swor, told CNN his client and Ali are both 20 years old. He declined to provide additional details. CNN asked Ali’s attorney for comment after the criminal complaint was released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A detention hearing for both men is scheduled for November 10.\n \n\n   \n  CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller on Monday addressed five key questions related to the case.\n \n\n   \n   How atypical was the process here? The FBI director announces arrests on X, and three days later the details are released in the form of a criminal complaint. \n \n\n   \n  It’s not typical to announce a case before charges are filed. But there were a number of considerations here. When it seemed like the alleged attack was becoming   imminent, the FBI decided to move in on the suspects early. The social media post from the FBI director was likely his way of being transparent in a case where multiple high-profile FBI raids in a tight-knit community were definitely going to   leak out. He has said before he is the most transparent FBI director in the agency’s   history. His forward lean on these things is deliberate.\n \n\n   \n   What kind of complications can arise going forward when the FBI director goes public with the case so early? \n \n\n   \n  Just the kind we saw. The early announcement left the public with more questions than answers and allowed for a lot of speculation. They may have tried to compensate for that by the enormous amount of detail that they included in the 73-page public document released Monday  charging two men in the alleged plot. \n \n\n   \n   What did we learn from the criminal complaint that makes a case for prosecutors? \n \n\n   \n  We learned, according to the FBI, just how close we may have come to a horrific terrorist attack. The complaint tells us that these individuals have been using encrypted apps and chat groups to communicate for months. Talking about potential attacks, martyring themselves for ISIS. What the date of the attack should be, looking at potential targets. According to the complaint, the youngest member of the group, a 16-year-old boy, was the one who was pushing the hardest not to wait any longer, to do the attack on Halloween. We also learned from the complaint that they purchased multiple AR-15 rifles and a shotgun and equipped them with laser-pointed sights and flashlights to be able to pick out targets in the dark. They went to target practice in groups multiple times, according to the complaint. The lead agent in the FBI investigation believes that two trips they made just days before the arrest to look at a strip of nightclubs and bars were likely a reconnaissance mission, the complaint alleges, and the agent believed the targets under consideration were LGBTQ+ nightclubs.\n \n\n   \n   What did we not learn from the complaint that may be beneficial to the defense? \n \n\n   \n  We did not learn full details about the role of a “confidential human source” referred to in the complaint. This was likely an FBI informant, but there were also references to an FBI “undercover employee” who may have also been an agent. For the FBI, having two people on the inside providing information would give them a real advantage. From the defense standpoint, there is always the “agent provocateur” defense, that people not predisposed to this may have been entrapped into the plot. Well, that defense has been raised in many, many cases since 9/11. It has done much better on the courthouse steps in the lawyer’s press conferences than it has fared in court in front of a jury.\n \n\n   \n   What are next steps for investigators? \n \n\n   \n  There are two people charged in the federal complaint, and both are adults. So one question is, where is the 16-year-old who was such a high-profile driver of this   alleged plot? Is he cooperating? Is he charged in a separate document that is sealed because of his age? Or is he facing state charges in Michigan that may be coming later? Beyond that, the complaint describes other people involved in the conspiracy who have also not been charged. I think we can expect more arrests. This didn’t come together the way these things usually do. The FBI had to move quickly at the end of last week to prevent what they believed was then an imminent plot. So they will go over the evidence they gathered in the search warrants, what they find in the computers and on the phones, and what they learned by questioning these suspects after they were arrested in the early morning hours of Halloween. There’s definitely more to come.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/dick-cheney-death-obit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:07:00-05:00","title":"Dick Cheney, influential Republican vice president to George W.

Bush, dies \n       \n  By Stephen Collinson, Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:07 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dick Cheney, America’s most powerful modern vice president and chief architect of the “war on terror,” who helped lead the country into the ill-fated Iraq war on faulty assumptions, has died, according to a statement from his family. He was 84.\n \n\n   \n  “His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him as he passed,” the family said, adding that he died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,” the family added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”\n \n\n   \n  The 46th vice president, who served alongside Republican President George W. Bush for two terms between 2001 and 2009, was for decades a towering and polarizing Washington power player.\n \n\n   \n  Bush described Cheney in a statement Tuesday as a “decent, honorable man.” “History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation – a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position,” Bush said.\n \n\n   \n  In his final years, Cheney, still a hardline conservative, nevertheless became largely ostracized from his party over his intense  criticism of President Donald Trump  whom he branded a “coward”   and the greatest-ever threat to the republic.\n \n\n   \n  In an ironic coda to a storied political career, he cast his final vote in a presidential election in 2024 for a liberal Democrat, and fellow member of the vice president’s club, Kamala Harris, in a reflection of how the populist GOP had turned against his traditional conservatism.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was plagued by cardiovascular disease for most of his adult life, surviving a series of heart attacks, to lead a full, vigorous life and lived many years in retirement after a  heart transplant in 2012  that he hailed in a 2014 interview as “the gift of life itself.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, a sardonic former Wyoming representative, White House chief of staff and defense secretary, was enjoying a lucrative career in the corporate world when he was charged by George W. Bush with vetting potential vice-presidential nominees. The quest ended with Cheney himself taking the oath of office as a worldly number two to a callow new president who arrived in the Oval Office after a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  While caricatures of Cheney as the real president do not accurately capture the true dynamics of Bush’s inner circle, he relished the enormous influence that he wielded from behind the scenes.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was in the White House, with the president out of town on the crisp, clear morning of September 11, 2001. In the split second of horror when a second hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center in New York, he said he became a changed man, determined to avenge the al Qaeda-orchestrated attacks and to enforce US power throughout the Middle East with a neo-conservative doctrine of regime change and pre-emptive war.\n \n\n   \n  “At that moment, you knew this was a deliberate act. This was a terrorist act,” he recalled of that day in an interview with CNN’s John King in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney reflected in later years on how the attacks left him with overwhelming sense of responsibility to ensure such an assault on the homeland never happened again. Perceptions however that he was the sole driving force behind the war on terror and US ventures into Iraq and Afghanistan are misleading.\n \n\n   \n  Contemporary and historic accounts of the administration show that Bush was his own self-styled “ The Decider .”\n \n\n   \n  Multiple former presidents paid tribute to Cheney on Tuesday, with Bill Clinton and Joe Biden highlighting the former vice president’s “public service.”\n \n\n   \n    A changed man\n \n\n   \n  From a bunker deep below the White House, Cheney went into crisis mode, directing the response of a grief-stricken nation suddenly at war. He gave the extraordinary order to authorize the shooting down of any more hijacked airliners in the event they were headed to the White House or the US Capitol building. For many, his frequent departures to “undisclosed” locations outside Washington to preserve the presidential chain of succession reinforced his image as an omnipotent figure waging covert war from the shadows. His hawkishness and alarmist view of a nation facing grave threats was not an outlier at the time – especially during a traumatic period that included anthrax mailings and sniper shootings around Washington, DC, that exacerbated a sense of public fear even though they were unrelated to 9/11.\n \n\n   \n  The September 11 attacks unleashed the US war in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, which was harboring al Qaeda, though the terror group’s leader Osama bin Laden escaped. Soon, Cheney was agitating for widening the US assault to Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein, whose forces he had helped to eject from Kuwait in the first Gulf War as President George H.W. Bush’s Pentagon chief.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s aggressive warnings about Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction programs, alleged links to al Qaeda and intent to furnish terrorists with deadly weapons to attack the United States played a huge role in laying the groundwork for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Congressional reports and other post-war inquiries later showed that Cheney and other administration officials exaggerated, misrepresented or did not properly portray faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction programs that Iraq turned out not to possess. One of Cheney’s most infamous claims, that the chief 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta, met Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, was never substantiated, including by the independent commission into the September 11 attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But Cheney insisted in 2005 that he and other top officials were acting on “the best available intelligence,” at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting that the flaws in the intelligence were plain in hindsight, he insisted that any claim that the data was “distorted, hyped, or fabricated” was “utterly false.”\n \n\n   \n  The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan also led the US down a dark legal and moral path including “enhanced interrogations” of terror suspects that critics blasted as torture. But Cheney – who was at the center of every facet of the global war on terrorism – insisted methods like waterboarding were perfectly acceptable.   Cheney was also an outspoken advocate for holding terror suspects without trial at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba – a practice that critics at home and abroad branded an affront to core American values.\n \n\n   \n    No regrets\n \n\n   \n  Cheney became a symbol of the excesses of the anti-terror campaigns and the fatally false premises and poor planning that turned the initially successful invasion of Iraq into a bloody quagmire. He left office reviled by Democrats and with an approval rating of 31%,  according to the Pew Research Center. \n \n\n   \n  To the end of his life, Cheney expressed no regrets, certain he had merely done what was necessary to respond to an unprecedented attack on the US mainland that killed nearly 3,000 people and led to nearly two decades of foreign wars that divided the nation and transformed its politics.\n \n\n   \n  “I would do it again in a minute,”  Cheney said , when confronted by a Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2014 that  concluded  enhanced interrogation methods as brutal and ineffective and responsible for damaging US standing in the eyes of the world.\n \n\n   \n  Of the Iraq war, he told CNN in 2015: “It was the right thing to do then. I believed it then and I believe it now.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘He’s a coward’\n \n\n   \n  Cheney’s aggressive anti-terror policies fit into a personal doctrine that justified extraordinary presidential powers with limited congressional oversight. That was in line with his belief that the authority of the executive branch had been mistakenly eroded in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of his first presidential boss, President Richard Nixon.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in his final years, Cheney emerged as a fierce critic of a man who had an even more expansive view of the powers of the presidency than he did – Trump. Cheney had supported Trump in 2016 despite his criticism of Bush-Cheney foreign policies and his transformation of the party of Reagan into a populist, nationalist GOP. But the ending of the president’s first term, when his refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat led to the January 6 insurrection, caused Cheney to speak out, in a rare, public manner.\n \n\n   \n  The former vice president’s daughter, then-Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, meanwhile, sacrificed a promising career in the GOP to oppose Trump after his attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. In an  ad for his daughter’s unsuccessful campaign  to fight off a pro-Trump candidate’s primary challenge in 2022, Dick Cheney – who was, by then, rarely seen in public – looked directly into the camera from under a wide brimmed cowboy hat and delivered an extraordinary direct message.\n \n\n   \n  “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said.\n \n\n   \n  “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election, and he lost big. I know it. He knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know.”\n \n\n   \n    Early days out West\n \n\n   \n  Richard Bruce Cheney was born January 30, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska. While living in the small mountain town of Casper, Wyoming, he met his high school sweetheart and future wife Lynne Vincent. Cheney was  accepted  to Yale University on a scholarship, but he struggled to fit in and maintain his grades. By his own admission,  he was kicked out .\n \n\n   \n  He returned West to work on power lines and was twice arrested for driving under the influence. In a turning point for Cheney, he was given an ultimatum from Lynne, who had “made it clear she wasn’t interested in marrying a lineman for the county,” he told  The New Yorker . “I buckled down and applied myself. Decided it was time to make something of myself,” he told the magazine.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney went back to school and earned a bachelor’s and master’s in political science from University of Wyoming. The couple was married in 1964.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney is survived by Lynne, his daughters Liz and Mary Cheney and seven grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n    A veteran Washington power broker\n \n\n   \n  Cheney began honing his inside power game – at which he became a master – as an aide to Nixon.\n \n\n   \n  He was later picked by Donald Rumsfeld as his deputy White House chief of staff under President Gerald Ford and then succeeded his mentor and close friend in the job in 1975 when Rumsfeld departed to become defense secretary. Cheney was instrumental in reviving their partnership in 2001 when he recalled Rumsfeld from the political wilderness to return to the Pentagon.\n \n\n   \n  The pair formed an extraordinary backroom alliance in the Bush administration throughout the war on terror and the Iraq war – much to the frustration of more moderate members of the administration including then-Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice – who took over from Powell in the second term.\n \n\n   \n  While Democratic President Jimmy Carter was in the White House, Cheney decided to run for Congress and was elected to Wyoming’s sole US House seat in 1978. Cheney served six terms, rising to become House minority whip, and racked up a  very conservative voting record .\n \n\n   \n  In 1989, President George H. W. Bush, who had served with Cheney in the Ford administration, tapped him to serve as his defense secretary, calling him a “trusted friend, adviser.” He was confirmed by the Senate in a 92-0 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As Pentagon chief, Cheney showed considerable skill in directing the US invasion of Panama in 1989 and Operation Desert Storm in 1991 to push Iraq’s troops out of Kuwait. Following his stint as defense secretary, Cheney briefly explored a run for president in the 1996 election cycle but decided against it.\n \n\n   \n  During Clinton’s presidency, Cheney joined Dallas-based Halliburton Co. serving as its chief executive officer.\n \n\n   \n  It wouldn’t be until the younger Bush decided to run for office that Cheney was chosen to lead the Republican candidate’s search for a running mate and, after initially turning down the job, ended up being added to the GOP ticket.\n \n\n   \n  “During the process, I came to the conclusion that the selector was the best person to be selected,” Bush said in the 2020 CNN film “President in Waiting.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to areas where critics complained Bush was weak. As a former Texas governor, Bush had no elected experience in Washington and little military and foreign policy background compared with Cheney.\n \n\n   \n  Early in Bush’s presidency, Cheney led a task force to develop the administration’s energy policy and sought to keep its records secret in a fight that lasted Bush’s first term and went all the way to the US Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  He was, however, at odds with Bush over the issue of same-sex marriage, saying that it should be left to the states to decide. In a 2004 town hall, he noted his daughter Mary’s sexual orientation reportedly for the first time publicly, according to  The Washington Post . “With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone. People … ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to,” he said, the Post reported.\n \n\n   \n  His relationship with Bush was complicated in later years, including by Bush’s refusal to pardon Cheney’s chief of staff Scooter Libby, who had been convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in 2007 after a probe into who leaked the identity of a CIA operative. Libby was eventually pardoned by Trump in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most notorious moments in his personal life, which added to his grizzled legend in 2006, Cheney accidentally  shot a hunting partner  in the face with birdshot, causing relatively minor wounds.\n \n\n   \n    Health issues\n \n\n   \n  Cheney’s health issues began in 1978, when he had his first heart attack at age 37 while running for Congress. Three more followed in 1984, 1988 and November 2000, just a few days into the Florida presidential ballot recount that resulted in a Bush-Cheney win.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney at the time said that he’d be the “the first to step down” if he learned he’d be unable to do the job and had a resignation letter in case he was deemed incapacitated. Cheney completed both terms under Bush, attending Barack Obama’s inauguration in January 2009 in a wheelchair.\n \n\n   \n  A year after a fifth heart attack in 2010, Cheney received a heart pump that kept the organ running until his transplant in 2012.\n \n\n   \n    Life after the White House\n \n\n   \n  After leaving office, Cheney returned to private life, penning two memoirs — one about his personal and political career and the other about his struggles with heart disease as well as a book with his daughter, Liz. He became one of the most strident GOP critics of President Barack Obama, who had based his election campaign on promises to end the wars and other changes from what he called failed policies of the Bush-Cheney administration.\n \n\n   \n  Years later, Cheney was decrying his own party — especially its leadership’s response to the attack on the Capitol — when he returned to the US Capitol with then-Rep. Liz Cheney   on the one-year anniversary of January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply disappointed at the failure of many members of my party to recognize the grave nature of the January 6 attacks and the ongoing threat to our nation,” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  In a remarkable moment,  Democrats lined up  to greet the former Republican vice president and shake his hand. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  hugged Cheney . The former vice president slammed Republican leaders in Congress, saying they do not resemble the leaders he remembered from his time in the body.\n \n\n   \n  It was a scene that would have been unthinkable two decades earlier and an illustration of how the extraordinary changes in American politics wrought by Trump had made former bitter political foes find common cause in the fight for democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” Cheney said at the Capitol in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney continued his criticism of Trump in the following years and went as far as to  endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris , a Democrat and Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential campaign. He said he would vote for Harris because of the “duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.” Cheney emphasized his disdain for Trump at the time and warned that he “can never be trusted with power again,” though Trump would go on to win the presidency a couple of months later.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jamie Gangel and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/fbi-investigation-michigan-terrorist-plot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:49:00.000-05:00","title":"How phone calls, sessions at gun ranges and secret meetings in parks led the FBI to charge suspects in alleged terrorist plot","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a major counterterrorism operation, the FBI uncovered an alleged ISIS-linked terrorist plot in Michigan involving Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, both aged 20, who were accused of purchasing firearms, practicing at gun ranges, and planning an attack on Halloween 2025.

sessions at gun ranges and secret meetings in parks led the FBI to charge suspects in alleged terrorist plot \n       \n  By Chelsea Bailey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:49 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A series of encrypted phone calls – secretly recorded by a confidential FBI source – tipped off federal agents that a group was allegedly planning to carry out a  terrorist attack  in Michigan on behalf of ISIS, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali, 20, and Majed Mahmoud, 20, face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials have yet to charge a third person – a juvenile described throughout the complaint as Person 1 – in connection with the alleged plot.\n \n\n   \n  But the complaint details how agents doggedly surveilled the alleged co-conspirators for two months as they visited multiple gun ranges and held late-night meetings in local parks during what authorities allege was preparation for a possible terrorist attack.\n \n\n   \n  Then, based on what they believed to be references to a possible attack on Halloween, agents swooped in to seize the weapons and take the men into custody in the predawn hours of October 31.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about how the investigation unfolded:\n \n\n   \n    A cryptic reference to Paris prompts suspicion\n \n\n   \n  According to an FBI affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, the agency began surveilling a man, described as “co-conspirator 1,” in 2024 as he traveled in the US and overseas.\n \n\n   \n  In June, agents allegedly tracked the man’s phone to Dearborn, Michigan, and physical surveillance led them to Ali’s home there, where he stayed for two nights.\n \n\n   \n  The following month, according to the FBI, the man joined a group call from overseas with five others – including an FBI confidential source, who recorded the meeting. Person 1, Mahmoud and Ali do not appear to have been part of this call.\n \n\n   \n  During the call, the group allegedly discussed “traveling together to Syria to join ISIS” and co-conspirator 1 said they were “gonna die there … unless,” he told the group, “the Amir sends you to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  A review of co-conspirator 1’s cellphone allegedly revealed he had “Person 1’s phone number saved in his phone under ‘Athari’ and ALI’s phone number saved in his phone as ‘Bukhari.’”\n \n\n   \n  According to the complaint, one of the participants on the call also stated, “Athari and Bukhari said they were going to stay back and do the ‘same thing as France.’”\n \n\n   \n  “Knowing Athari, it’s (the attack) probably going to be at like a club, a disco,” co-conspirator 1 said, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The reference to Paris stood out to FBI counterterrorism experts. They concluded it was a thinly veiled nod to the coordinated ISIS-linked terrorist attacks that unfolded across Paris in  November 2015 . More than 130 people were killed in the attacks and scores more were wounded.\n \n\n   \n  After studying the call, the FBI concluded an attack could be imminent and began keeping close tabs on Ali and Mahmoud.\n \n\n   \n    Talk turned to action with purchase of firearms, complaint alleges\n \n\n   \n  According to the complaint, in the months following the June meeting with “co-conspirator 1,” Ali allegedly purchased a Beretta A300 Ultimata Black Shotgun, a “Sabre” Forged 16” rifle, as well as a holographic sight “built for close-quarter engagements with fast moving targets.”\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud also allegedly purchased a rifle and two boxes of ammunition with more than 800 rounds in each box. In October, he allegedly purchased a red dot sight, which provides “the shooter a single point of focus during the aiming process,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in September and October, Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 began practicing at local shooting ranges, under the watchful eye of FBI agents, the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  Security footage obtained by the FBI shows all three men visiting local gun ranges over the course of several weeks.\n \n\n   \n  On multiple occasions, undercover FBI agents entered the range and surveilled the men from nearby as they practiced firing weapons. Although the agents did not identify themselves, according to the complaint they observed the men practicing with guns and ammunition like those they had previously purchased.\n \n\n   \n    FBI tailed trio as they allegedly scouted locations\n \n\n   \n  Although Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 are all under 21, the complaint noted in September they began traveling to a popular area in Ferndale, Michigan, known for its bars and clubs.\n \n\n   \n  “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  The following month, FBI agents “observed three individuals appearing to match the physical description” of Person 1, Ali, and Mahmoud meeting at a local park in Dearborn, Michigan, around 9 p.m. They met up again the following week at another park.\n \n\n   \n  Since the men all live with their families, the FBI concluded the late-night meetups at the park “reflect their efforts to meet to plan an attack without being detected.”\n \n\n   \n    References to ‘pumpkin’ trigger arrest on Halloween\n \n\n   \n  In September and October, the FBI received court-approved authorization to surveil communications between Person 1, Ali and Mahmoud.\n \n\n   \n  In calls and messages, they found multiple mentions of “pumpkin,” which agents concluded was a reference to “Halloween as the potential day for the attack they were plotting, an attack that they understood could result in their deaths and martyrdom.”\n \n\n   \n  “So ya, I talked to my brothers. We are going to do pumpkin,” Person 1 allegedly told Ali on October 24, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI later notes in the complaint references to “brothers” likely mean “other ISIS supporters.”\n \n\n   \n  As the Halloween weekend loomed, a judge authorized the execution of search warrants on Ali and Mahmoud’s homes.\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of October 31, FBI agents descended on the Detroit suburb where the men lived and detonated smoke bombs before storming into their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Both Ali and Mahmoud were arrested.\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel later tweeted about the foiled terrorist plot but offered little additional detail. As a result, some Dearborn residents  speculated  whether the arrests were justified, or perhaps a way to profile the city’s large Arab population, which has long been targeted for Islamophobic attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But on Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi boasted on X the unsealed criminal complaint revealed “a major ISIS-linked terror plot.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our American heroes prevented a terror attack,” Bondi wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Court process begins with hearing\n \n\n   \n  Both Mahmoud and Ali were shackled as they were escorted into court Monday, according to CNN reporters who attended the hearing. Both men acknowledged they had read the complaint against them and understood the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for both of the men briefly spoke to reporters after the hearing, but declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  Co-conspirator 1 has not been charged.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Holly Yan, Jeff Winter and Leigh Waldman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5596488","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Trump's Tariffs Are Raising Billions — But at a Steep Economic Cost","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Trump's recently implemented tariffs have generated significant revenue for the federal government, with the average import tax rising to nearly 18%, but they are simultaneously driving inflation, increasing costs for importers, and failing to stimulate domestic manufacturing. Despite claims that foreign suppliers bear the cost, most of the burden falls on U.S. importers and eventually consumers. Wild fluctuations in tariff rates—ranging from 30% to over 100%—have created supply chain chaos and uncertainty, with no significant increase in domestic production.

They're also costing consumers, frustrating businesses and hurting the manufacturers they're supposed to help.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The average tax on U.S. imports today is nearly 18%, according to  economists at the Budget Lab at Yale   — up from 2.4% before Trump returned to the White House. The Treasury Department is collecting almost four times as much tariff revenue now as it was a year ago.  The average tariff rate would be closer to 9% were it nor for the \"emergency tariffs\" the Supreme Court is reviewing. Despite the administration's repeated claims that foreign suppliers are paying the tariffs, most of the bill is being paid by U.S. importers.  And ultimately, at least some of the tab will be passed along to American consumers in the form of higher prices.  \"It's a tax,\" says Patrick Allen, a wine importer based in Columbus, Ohio. \"And it gets built into the price everybody is paying for goods.\" Inflation is rising  Tariffs have already contributed to higher prices for apparel, furniture and other goods where the U.S. is heavily reliant on imports.  Inflation has been inching up in recent months, although it's still nowhere near the 9% level it reached three years ago, in the wake of the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Annual inflation in September was 3%, compared to 2.3% in April when Trump first announced his worldwide tariffs.  Inflation watchdogs at the Federal Reserve are betting that Trump's tariffs will raise prices once, as they work their way through the supply chain, but will not continue to cause upward price pressure month after month.   'Havoc' for importers Wild swings in tariff rates — from 30% to over 100% — have also created challenges for importers who typically order products months ahead of time. \"The unpredictability of the tariff situation continues to cause havoc and uncertainty,\" said an anonymous computer manufacturer, quoted in a report this week from the  Institute for Supply Management .   But even then, the manufacturer noted it wasn't spurring more domestic production. \"Even with the tariffs, the cost to import in many cases is still more attractive than sourcing within the U.S,\" said the manufacturer. While the tariffs are designed to encourage domestic manufacturing by making imports more expensive, factory employment has dropped by more than 40,000 jobs since April, while the ISM index of manufacturing activity fell in October for the eighth month in a row. \"The products we import are not readily manufactured in the U.S., so attempts to reshore have been unsuccessful,\" said the manager of a machinery factory. \"Overall, prices on all products have gone up, some significantly. We are trying to keep up with the wild fluctuations and pass along what costs we can to our customers.\" Supreme Court challenge  Trump's emergency tariffs have been  challenged by a number of businesses and states  as exceeding the president's authority.  The White House has relied for many of the tariffs on a 1970s statute designed to address economic emergencies. That law never mentions the word \"tariff,\" and lower courts have found that using the law to impose taxes on virtually everything the U.S. imports goes too far.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The administration has warned of dire consequences if the tariffs are struck down by the high court.  \"With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" the administration said  its Supreme Court brief . \"America could go from strength to failure the moment such an incorrect decision took effect.\"  In fact, tariffs accounted for just 6% of total government revenue in September — the most recent month for which figures are available.  And the jump in tariff revenue that month was more than offset by a decline in corporate tax payments.   The president's Plan B Even if the Supreme Court does find the president's emergency tariffs are illegal, Trump has other options to impose import taxes, using powers that were explicitly granted by Congress.   \"I think in the end, he could piece together something very close to — if not identical to — what he's done so far,\" says law professor Kathleen Claussen, a tariff expert at Georgetown University.  \"That's not to say we might not have legal challenges in the courts again. But certainly, on the surface, I think the president could move to replicate what he's already done using these other statutes. \" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/dearborn-fbi-raid-terror-attack-skepticism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:47:00-04:00","title":"Suspects Charged in Alleged Terror Plot Cited ISIS and May Have Tried to Replicate Paris Terror Attack on US Soil, FBI Says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two men, Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, face federal charges for allegedly plotting an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in the U.S. on Halloween, with plans to replicate the 2015 Paris attacks.

ISIS-inspired Halloween attack in the US – possibly on the scale of the  2015 Paris terror attacks  that killed at least 130 people, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  An FBI raid on Halloween morning stunned neighbors in Dearborn, the  second-safest city in Michigan  and home to the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to a criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  “Our newly unsealed complaint reveals a major ISIS-linked terror plot,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi  posted on X .\n \n\n   \n  “According to the complaint, subjects had multiple AR-15 rifles, tactical gear, and a detailed plan to carry out an attack on American soil,” she said, thanking officials for averting an attack “before innocent lives were lost.”\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud’s attorney, William “Bill” Swor, told CNN his client and Ali are both 20 years old. He declined to provide additional details.\n \n\n   \n  CNN asked Ali’s attorney for comment after the criminal complaint was released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A detention hearing for both men is scheduled for November 10.\n \n\n   \n    Suspects bought AR-15-style rifles and over 1,600 rounds of ammo, agent says \n \n\n   \n  Ali and an unidentified juvenile were “planning to conduct a terrorist attack in the United States on behalf of the designated foreign terrorist organization ISIS,” an FBI agent wrote in the criminal complaint, citing communications on an encrypted app.\n \n\n   \n  Further investigation revealed Mahmoud and others were co-conspirators in the plot, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n  Ali purchased a shotgun, an AR-15-style rifle and multiple accessories, including “a forced reset trigger that allows a shooter to increase the rate of fire in a semiautomatic weapon,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud also bought an AR-15-style rifle and more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition that could be used in AR-15 style rifles he and Ali had purchased, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n    A suspect mentions doing the ‘same thing as France’ on Halloween\n \n\n   \n  In addition to meeting in person, Ali, Mahmoud, the juvenile and co-conspirators chatted online, sharing “extremist and ISIS-related materials that encourage attacks similar to what they planned,” the FBI agent wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Ali and the juvenile “discussed when to conduct their attack, which they appeared to set for Halloween,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The pair allegedly said they were going to do the “same thing as France,” the complaint says. And a conversation with a co-conspirator included mention of someone potentially going “to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  The agent took this to be a reference to the multifaceted terror rampage in France, which  killed at least 130 people in 2015 . ISIS claimed responsibility for those attacks.\n \n\n   \n  ISIS also claimed responsibility for a 2016 mass shooting in Orlando. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub, which was popular with the LGBTQ community,  killed 49 people .\n \n\n   \n  Ali, Mahmoud and the juvenile traveled to clubs in Ferndale, Michigan, the FBI complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  “All three of these clubs are located on Woodward Avenue near East Nine Mile,” the agent wrote. “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community.”\n \n\n   \n    How a Halloween raid unfolded\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of Halloween, residents of a quaint Michigan neighborhood were jolted awake by the blasts of detonated smoke bombs and a voice shouting in Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the FBI. We have a warrant. All residents inside … come out with nothing in your hands,” a man yelled before armed federal agents stormed the home in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, FBI Director Kash Patel  boasted on X  the agency had “thwarted a potential terrorist attack” and arrested “multiple” people in Dearborn “allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  Considered to be the heart of Arab America, Dearborn is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States and has frequently faced Islamophobic and hateful remarks.  Abdullah Hammoud , the son of Lebanese immigrants, became the first Arab American mayor of Dearborn when he was elected in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the community, including neighbors and attorneys for the people taken into custody, say they are skeptical of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  One of the neighbors is Laraib Irfan, who says his Dearborn community is a close-knit, peaceful place where everyone looks out for each other like family.\n \n\n   \n  Irfan was woken up Friday morning by his sister, telling him the FBI agents were outside. He heard two bangs he described as so loud they sounded like bombs and gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  He watched in shock as FBI agents surrounded the house two doors away from his. To his knowledge, the house was home to a family of seven – a mother, father and five sons.\n \n\n   \n  At the sound of the FBI’s command, the residents stepped out of their home with their hands behind their backs, Irfan said. For hours afterward, agents filed in and out, carrying materials to gather evidence, as Michigan State Police cordoned off the surrounding streets, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others questioned, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told CNN on Friday; their ages range from 16 to no more than 29. Amir Makled, who represents Ali, told CNN on Sunday three people were arrested and two were questioned. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled told CNN before the criminal complaint was released.\n \n\n   \n  The two law enforcement sources told CNN about a reference to “pumpkin day,” an online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack and a shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Hussein Bazzi, who said he is representing another suspect arrested in the raid, told CNN the “pumpkin” day reference may have been “online gamer chat that was misinterpreted.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI told CNN it was conducting law enforcement activities in the cities of Dearborn and nearby Inkster, Michigan, but has not responded to CNN’s request for additional comment.    \n \n\n   \n  Patel’s initial X post applauded the FBI for “crushing our mission to defend the homeland,” yet he gave no explanation or evidence to support claims of a foiled terrorist plot.\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s curious to me,” Colin Clarke, a domestic terrorism and international security expert, told CNN prior to the release of the criminal complaint. “What it makes me think is that the plot wasn’t maybe as mature as they led people to believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke, executive director of the security research nonprofit The Soufan Center, says authorities may be holding back details to protect a potential prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re waiting to comment on it so they don’t go out and say anything that ends up hurting them in a court case,” said Clarke, who has no direct knowledge of the investigation. “Or there’s not much to this, the plot, there wasn’t much there.”\n \n\n   \n  Only time will reveal the full story, he said. The delay in charges often depends on how long the FBI has been tracking an alleged plot. His central concern, he added, is whether the claim the plot was inspired by ISIS has any basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Was there an actual ISIS operative communicating with these individuals, or were they just communicating with one another?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But for Dearborn’s community, the prolonged silence from authorities is raising serious concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “An allegation like this is dangerous to this community,” Makled said. “So when you have the national director of the FBI putting out a statement that there was a thwarted terrorist attack and then the news covers the raids of homes in the city of Dearborn, immediately the backlash on the internet is homegrown terrorist cell.”\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the raid posted on  Facebook  sparked bigoted comments: “A real shocker that they reside in Dearborn,” one person wrote. “Well, Dearborn does have a major Islamic population who aren’t exactly friendly to anyone else,” said another. Some accused the people in the home of being “sleeper cells.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Dearborn’s large Arab population, which makes up nearly half the city, makes it an easy target for Islamophobic, racist comments, the city has been ranked the second-safest large city in Michigan, according to the FBI’s  2024 annual crime report .\n \n\n   \n  “This community has been part of the state of Michigan for generations,” Makled, a Lebanese American and lifelong Dearborn resident, said. “They’re deeply ingrained in the American fabric here and this community, they’re sick and tired of being held to a different standard.”\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor, who asked to only be identified as “Ahmed,” said the people who lived in the home were kind, and he was not convinced the raid was based on credible suspicion.\n \n\n   \n  “You never hear anything from them, they are perfect, smiling, and I do not believe anything happened (from them), they are very good people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the FBI’s claim they stopped a terrorist plot, Ahmed interrupts and rejects the possibility completely: “No, no, no, no,” he says. “I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   \n  Another neighbor, Kathy Sisson, also speaks highly of her community; she says she’s disabled and her neighbors, who are from Brazil, Pakistan and Iraq, are constantly checking on her to make sure she’s OK.\n \n\n   \n  A person in the home where the FBI activity took place who did not want to share their name told CNN the people taken into custody “were just kids” and the situation was “being blown out of proportion and shouldn’t have happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke warned against hasty conclusions but expressed skepticism that officials could credibly claim a foiled terrorist plot without clear, compelling evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “For the administration to come out and say they thwarted a plot, I feel like they (would need) stronger evidence than just a bunch of teenagers talking sh*t in a chat room,” Clarke said.\n \n\n   \n  Makled said his client’s mother has not stopped crying.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that my client has stopped thinking or slept for one second since the moment he’s been taken into custody because of how deeply concerned he is about what the future is bringing,” he said. “He has no control in terms of what the federal government is going to say about him.”\n \n\n   \n    Muslim American communities are exhausted\n \n\n   \n  For many, the incident harks back to the post-9/11 era, when Arab Americans were routinely subjected to false stereotypes, covert surveillance, unequal restrictions and, all too often, threats from people who were violent and driven by hate.\n \n\n   \n  “I know what went on after 9/11 and how our Arab and Muslim communities felt after that,” Clarke said. “Of course they’re under the microscope, even with the New York City  mayor’s race , you see a lot of Islamophobia kind of rearing its head again. We just don’t know.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the attack on the Twin Towers in New York, the FBI has prevented  numerous  suspected terrorist attacks by running undercover operations, where agents say they have infiltrated extremist networks to catch people who would have committed crimes.\n \n\n   \n  However, Muslims have often borne the brunt of racialized state surveillance. Many were suspected of domestic terrorism, through everyday actions that were disproportionately scrutinized and subjected to FBI attention solely because of their faith, according to a  2018 study published in Critical Sociology  examining patterns of surveillance targeting Muslim communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to be targeted and always looked at with a sense of suspicion. Dearborn’s used to this,” Makled said. “This community doesn’t want to be held in that light of suspicion anymore, and it doesn’t deserve to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Michigan chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations criticized the FBI’s lack of transparency in the days after the arrests. Executive Director Dawud Walid stressed that, no matter what the investigation uncovers, Muslims in Dearborn and across the US do not owe anyone an apology for the actions of others.\n \n\n   \n  “People in the community are getting tired of this idea of collective guilt, or somehow we have to answer for the alleged actions of a couple of people,” Walid told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged the public to withhold judgment and wait for the results of the investigation before making assumptions about the community as additional details from the FBI are still pending.\n \n\n   \n  If Patel put out a statement prematurely, “I would demand an apology from the national director,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you create unity,” he added. “And that’s how you cure any error or harm that was caused by a mistake. This community is very forgiving, and we would accept that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/jeep-recall-hybrids-fire","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-05:00","title":"Stellantis recalls 375,000 Jeep SUVs over fire risks, urges owners to park outside","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Stellantis has issued a global recall of 375,000 plug-in hybrid Jeep SUVs, including the 2020–2025 Wrangler 4xe and 2022–2026 Grand Cherokee 4xe models, due to a fire risk stemming from battery defects.

Over the course of an argument that lasted almost three hours, both the court's conservatives and liberals seemed doubtful about the legal authority underpinning Trump's signature economic policy. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, representing Trump, was first up to the lectern, telling the court that Trump imposed the tariffs to deal with two dire emergencies: a persistent trade imbalance and the flood of fentanyl entering the United States. But the justices were openly doubtful about the president's claim that he has the power to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, known as IEEPA, a statute that, as Chief Justice John Roberts observed, says nothing about tariffs. Sauer replied that the statute's terms are \"capacious,\" not restrictive, and that Trump has inherent authority as president, under the Constitution, to deal with these national security and foreign affairs threats. Roberts acknowledged that tariffs involve foreign affairs. But he noted that the statute, as interpreted by Trump, imposes  taxes on Americans, and taxes have always been \"the core power of Congress.\" Under your theory, said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, President Biden could have declared an emergency under global warming, and that would have been enough to justify his environmental policy. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       And Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked, \"Can you to point to any other place in the code or any time in history where the phrase…'regulate importation' [the words in the statute] has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?\" When Sauer repeated that emergency situations justify the Trump tariffs, Justice Elena Kagan replied caustically, \"It turns out, we're in   emergencies…all the time, about, like, half the world.\" Justice Neil Gorsuch posed perhaps the most vociferous challenge to the solicitor general, contending that the president's position in essence, could cover anything, including the power to declare war specifically given to Congress in the Constitution. \"You're saying inherent authority in foreign affairs, all foreign affairs, to regulate commerce, duties, and tariffs and war. Its inherent authority all the way down, you say. Fine,\" he said. \"Congress decides tomorrow, well, we're tired of this legislating business. We're just going to hand it all off to the president. What would stop Congress from doing that?\" Sauer replied that the court in past opinions has said that the president's powers apply with \"much less force, more limited force.\" Indeed, he said that Congress can always change the law, and take back the power he claims it ceded under the IEEPA statute. But Gorsuch wasn't buying the argument, noting that even if Congress passed a new law, the president could veto it, and it would take a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate to override the veto and prevail.  \"As a practical matter,\" said Gorsuch, that would be impossible. \"Congress can't get its power back once it is handed over to the president.\" Next up to the lectern was lawyer Neal Katyal, representing those challenging the Trump tariffs. He noted that IEEPA has been in existence for 50 years and no other president has ever claimed that the statute grants him such unilateral power. Katyal got some tough questions from the justices, particularly about why the words in the law calling for the regulation of imports and licensing fees are not tariffs. But the hardest question came from Justice Barrett, and that was about how to return the billions of dollars already paid by U.S. businesses in order to comply with the Trump tariffs.  \"If you win, tell me how the reimbursement would work,\" asked Barrett. You said before that \"the government promised reimbursement…How would that work? It seems to me like it could be a mess.\" Katyal said there would be a variety of options, prompting this from Barrett: \"So a mess.\" A decision in the case could come more quickly than usual because both sides asked the court to expedite consideration of the case. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5600082","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"18:56:00-05:00","title":"FAA to Reduce Air Traffic by 10% at Major Airports to Maintain Safety During Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the sixth week of a prolonged government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced a 10% reduction in air traffic at 40 high-volume airport markets—including major hubs like Dallas, Houston, Newark, and Phoenix—to prevent safety risks caused by widespread staffing shortages.

     Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 6:56 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration will reduce air traffic by 10% at many busy airports, the agency said Wednesday, in a move intended to keep the nation's airspace safe during  the government shutdown . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The FAA plans to  reduce air traffic  in 40 \"high-volume markets\" beginning on Friday. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford told reporters the agency wants to reduce the pressure at those airports before safety is compromised. \"We just can't ignore it,\" Bedford said, \"when the early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating.\" The FAA has already been delaying flights at some airports because of widespread staffing shortages among air traffic controllers. The government shutdown, now in its sixth week, has taken a  growing toll  on those controllers, who are required to work without pay until it ends. Some have taken on second jobs, and many are calling out sick. Even before the shutdown, the system was more than 3,000 certified controllers short. Bedford and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy say they would meet with airline leaders to figure out how to implement the reductions fairly before announcing the details. They did not immediately announce which airports would be affected by the reductions. But the agency has been reporting persistent staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities around some of the nation's busiest airports, including major airline hubs in Dallas, Houston, Newark, N.J., and Phoenix. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Earlier this week, NPR spoke to several air traffic controllers who say morale at the agency was already low before the government shutdown, due to a longstanding staffing shortage across the system, mandatory overtime and stagnating wages. They said morale has fallen even lower during the longest government shutdown on record. They asked NPR not to use their names because they're afraid of retaliation from the FAA. \"I think we're reaching a tipping point,\" said one air traffic controller who works at a facility in the Midwest that handles high-altitude traffic. \"This is kind of about the point in the last shutdown where people just started getting fed up with it.\" It was more than a month into the last government shutdown in 2018 and 2019 when a small number of air traffic controllers in a few key facilities called in sick, causing  major disruptions  at airports up and down the East Coast. The reductions announced on Wednesday could cause even more disruption, forcing airlines to cancel or reschedule thousands of flights per day. Secretary Duffy acknowledged that will likely cause widespread frustration. But he said the decision was not taken lightly. \"Our heart goes out to those who will have flights disrupted,\" said Duffy. \"This is what we feel like we have to do to make sure we maintain that safety profile.\" Bedford said he could not recall a similar situation during his 35 years working in aviation. \"Then again, we're in a new territory in terms of government shutdowns,\" Bedford said. \"And we look forward to a time when we can get back to business as usual.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96661","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"18:30:00-05:00","title":"Rubio, Hegseth brief lawmakers on boat strikes as frustration grows on Capitol Hill","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following President Trump's authorization of unprecedented U.S. military strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held a closed-door briefing with top congressional members, including Republican and Democratic leaders, to address growing concerns over legality, transparency, and accountability.

\n           Updated Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 6:30 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth briefed a group of top congressional members behind closed doors on Wednesday following President Trump's orders for a wave of unprecedented U.S. military strikes against alleged drug boats that are raising the specter of a new war. Legal analysts have broadly described the strikes as  illegal under both U.S. and international law  — in part because they have not been authorized by Congress. Trump officials invited a dozen members of Congress, including Republican and Democratic leaders and the top lawmakers on intelligence and armed services committees in both chambers. A growing bipartisan group of lawmakers have submitted  months of demands for more information on the attacks . Since the strikes began in September, at least  66 have been killed in 16 strikes  in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, according to the administration. Trump said last month he approved  covert operations in Venezuela , which was followed by orders to send a  surge of U.S. naval forces to the waters off South America . Pentagon officials said the country's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and its strike group, which marks  20% of the Navy's deployed warships  is now headed for the region. On Tuesday, the White House disputed claims it wasn't being transparent enough with Congress regarding the strikes and military buildup in the region. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the meeting is a top example of their cooperation and said his appearance marks the ninth briefing so far. \"The president made it very clear if senators want to understand the administration's operations against narco-drug traffickers, we are very happy to speak with them about that,\" she said. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, agreed.  \"The administration has kept me and other members fully advised, fully satisfied with what they're doing,\" Risch said after Wednesday's briefing.  However, several Democrats complained that earlier congressional briefings were limited in scope and key information was only shared with Republicans. Last week, top Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee,  criticized Trump administration officials  for holding a closed-door briefing with about a dozen GOP Senators — and no Democrats. Warner said someone should be \"fired\" for the oversight. \"We hit a new low, what the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive not only to our Democracy but downright dangerous for our national security,\" Warner, D-Va., said. After Wednesday's meeting, Warner said he remains perplexed why the U.S. has upended its drug interdiction program that allows the Coast Guard to instead detain suspected drug vessels and pursue criminal charges after obtaining evidence.  \"Showing by interdiction, and drug recovery, and … that the individuals on the boats are known narco-terrorists would sure go a long way in convincing Americans and for that matter, the rest of the world,\" Warner, D-Va., said.  Top House Intelligence Committee Democrat Jim Himes said while there's high confidence in U.S. intelligence providing information on targets, he remains worried some of those killed are not who the administration claims and other information gaps. Himes said at least now, the administration is starting to share information.  \"In my world and the intelligence world, when something is done, we get a great deal of detail on every operation. That has not been shared,\" Himes, D-Conn., said. \"Finally they've started to notify Congress of this stuff, until basically ten days ago we had nothing.\"  He said the administration has finally shared their legal defense for the strikes at sea, and some additional information on military operations. \"But don't misunderstand me, lots of mistakes could get made,\" he added. \"But they are applying the eyes and ears of our intelligence community to these boats.\" Wednesday's meeting marked the first time Rubio and Hegseth briefed top lawmakers on the strikes since they began more than two months ago. During this time, members have complained they did not have a legal basis for Trump's orders for the attacks, access to a secret list of targets or broader information on evidence recovered and identities of those killed. A small bipartisan group of lawmakers intends to force a vote to block Trump's use of military forces to engage in hostilities within or against Venezuela. Behind closed doors, Trump officials have been lobbying Republicans to vote no. Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., introduced the war powers resolution after Trump said he was entertaining the possibility of military strikes inside Venezuela. They argue that — as laid out clearly by the Constitution — Congress retains the authority to declare war, not the president. An earlier  vote to limit the strikes in the Caribbean  failed. Two Republicans, Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joined Democrats in the 48-51 vote. However, Kaine argued this new vote has a shot at passage, reflecting the earlier resolution's focus on the Caribbean turned off some members and this resolution is more clear cut. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5599928","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"15:29:00.000Z","title":"NYC's next mayor is a democratic socialist.

What does that mean? \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 3:29 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         New York City has elected a democratic socialist as its next mayor. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani  won with a progressive platform  focused on making the city more affordable, through free bus service, frozen rents, universal childcare and a higher minimum wage, among other ideas. The state assemblymember represented both the Democratic Party and the Working Families Party on the ballot. He quoted prominent late-19th and early-20th century socialist Eugene Debs in his  victory speech  Tuesday night. And he is a longtime member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Its New York City chapter played a key role in Mamdani's campaign, providing an early endorsement and a legion of volunteers for canvassing and fundraising — and raising its own profile in the process. \"Since [Mamdani's] primary win in June, Democratic Socialism has soared in popularity here and across the nation,\" the  NYC-DSA tweeted  after his general election win. \"Our  unprecedented growth  is a testament to our vision and our ability to inspire renewed hope and political engagement from the working class.\" As Mamdani's campaign pushed democratic socialism further into the mainstream, it has also raised questions about what the political ideology is — and isn't. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Most notably, President Trump has frequently and falsely criticized  Mamdani as a communist  in the lead-up to the election. Mamdani refuted that characterization in a  June appearance  on NBC's  Meet the Press , to which he responded, \"I am not.\" Mamdani went on to describe his brand of democratic socialism, a term that is largely up to interpretation. \"When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. King from decades ago who said, 'Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God's children in this country,'\" he said, referring to a  1961 speech  by Martin Luther King Jr. \"And as income inequality has declined nationwide, it has increased in New York City. And, ultimately, what we need is a city where every single person can thrive.\" What is democratic socialism? There is no one-size-fits-all definition of democratic socialism, though its adherents  broadly support  the government taking control over certain sectors of the economy, such as health care and utilities, to benefit the public rather than private corporations. \"We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation,\" reads the DSA's website. The DSA, which has been around since the 1980s,  calls itself  the largest socialist organization in the U.S. It says it has more than 80,000 members organized into campus and community chapters across all 50 states. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The group  says its members  are socialists because they reject an international economic order sustained by things like private profit, discrimination and violence \"in defense of the status quo,\" and instead envision a more equitable and humane social order \"based both on democratic planning and market mechanisms.\" Democratic socialists often distance themselves from historic examples of  socialism  and communism, which have had largely negative connotations in the U.S. since the Cold War era. Proponents also say democratic socialism goes further than \"social democracy,\" which often involves  a strong welfare state  operating under capitalism. \"We believe there are many avenues that feed into the democratic road to socialism,\" the DSA says. \"Our vision pushes further than historic  social democracy  and leaves behind authoritarian visions of socialism in the dustbin of history.\" The  Communist Party USA  says that while it shares some values of democratic socialists — like opposing war and wanting higher minimum wage — it believes those can only happen through a fundamental restructuring of society. Many democratic socialists acknowledge that radical transformation won't happen in the short term, so they use tools like organizing, lobbying and protesting in hopes of making change within the existing system, at least for now. \"As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people,\" it explains,  naming  single-payer  Medicare for All  and the  Green New Deal  as examples. Why is democratic socialism on the rise?  Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont put democratic socialism on many peoples' radars during his 2016 presidential campaign. While a registered independent, Sanders has described himself as a democratic socialist  for decades , the ideology shaping  his stances  on everything from poverty to health care to higher education. Sanders is not a member of the DSA. But his candidacy is credited with  boosting the organization's membership  and visibility, just in time for the first Trump presidency. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Holly Otterbein, an Axios reporter who has covered the rise of socialism, told NPR's  It's Been a Minute  earlier this week that she saw the biggest increase in DSA membership after Trump's 2016 win. \"When I've talked to people who have become members of the DSA or DSA leaders, they felt like that 2016 election sort of discredited the Democratic Party in their eyes,\" she said. Many  young voters  have become  discontented  with the Democratic Party, a trend that has continued through the COVID-19 pandemic, economic turbulence and now Trump's second term. All of that has fueled the democratic socialist movement. \"Socialism is a recurring talking point for people that still can't find ways to get out of the economic precarity that their generation and the immediately prior generations couldn't get out of,\" Lex McMenamin, head of the politics section at Teen Vogue, told  It's Been a Minute . A  Gallup poll released  in September found that roughly two-thirds of Democrats view socialism positively, up from 50% in 2010, even as Americans as a whole continue to view capitalism more favorably. What could Mamdani's win mean for the movement?  Recent years have seen the elections of DSA members including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez — as well as the NYC-DSA — endorsed Mamdani before the primary in June, and have headlined rallies with him in the months since. After Mamdani's win on Tuesday, an NBC reporter  asked Ocasio-Cortez  how she would define democratic socialism. \"To me, it's this radical idea that working people have economic rights,\" she said, listing housing, a livable wage, health care and child care as examples. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Political scientists  have cautioned  that Mamdani's approach may not be a  winning blueprint  for democratic socialist candidates running outside of New York City, where registered Democrats heavily outnumber Republicans. But supporters see lessons in his success. \"He had to defeat a Republican and the old guard of the Democratic party at the same time,\"  Ocasio-Cortez told CNN , referring to Curtis Sliwa and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \"And he still won resoundingly. \"And I think the message that that sends is that the Democratic Party cannot last much longer by denying the future, by trying to undercut our young, by trying to undercut a next generation of diverse and upcoming Democrats that ... our actual electorate and voters support.\" NYC's DSA is already touting Mamdani's victory in  recruitment efforts , calling it just the beginning. Notably, Mamdani stressed during his campaign that  his platform differs  from that of the DSA, and has taken a more moderate stance on issues like eliminating misdemeanor offenses and  defunding the police . McMenamin, of Teen Vogue, says Mamdani's mayorship could change what socialism means to people, depending on how he governs. \"I think people are going to really want to talk about socialism if some of these policy changes actually start coming into effect,\" McMenamim adds. \"And so what could happen in New York over the next year could make a big change for people in all 50 states.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article features a collection of Tiny Desk Concerts, highlighting performances from artists on NPR's Tiny Desk series, which showcases live, intimate music performances.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":["Tiny Desk Concerts","NPR","Music","Live Performances"],"content":"\n         Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel \n         \n        \n           Wednesday, February 28, 2024 • 2:20 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A collection of featured Tiny Desk Concerts. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5598547","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:32:00-05:00","title":"Spanberger, Virginia's first woman governor, says she'll defy Trump's 'bad policies'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abigail Spanberger, a former U.S. Congresswoman and federal agent, has been elected as Virginia's first female governor, defeating Republican Lt.

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Spanberger served in the CIA before running for Congress in 2018, where she served three terms in the U.S. House.

During her run for governor, she earned Virginian's support by speaking to their concerns about the rising cost of living and economic uncertainty.

And right now, that will be pushing back against a variety of the bad policies that are coming out of this White House.\" In a conversation with NPR's Leila Fadel, Spanberger spoke about her historic win and plans to deliver on the platform she laid out during her campaign. The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity. Interview Highlights Leila Fadel : How are you feeling this morning as you reflect on your historic election, the first woman governor in Virginia? Abigail Spanberger : I am feeling great this morning. It is a good day in Virginia and the transition starts today. So I'm excited to get to work. Fadel : So winning an election is one thing, but fulfilling the promises to make things affordable for federal workers who have lost their jobs, as you did on the campaign trail, is another. What's on your agenda, day one? Spanberger : Day one is to start working with our partners in the General Assembly to make sure they're ready to go with the bills to file. Making sure that I am ready, day one, in January, with executive actions related to ensuring that we're supporting all Virginians, particularly given the challenges that so many of our community members are facing in the past because of DOGE and now because of the shutdown. And maintaining the economic focus that I have had throughout this campaign, so that as soon as I am sworn in, in January, we are moving quickly to take decisive and clear actions to deliver on the promises and the plans that I set forth throughout the campaign. Fadel : As you point out, Virginia, home to hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors deeply affected by DOGE cuts and the government shutdown. Before we get further into that, I do want to ask if you see your win as an endorsement of your agenda or a repudiation of Donald Trump? Spanberger : I think it's absolutely an endorsement of an agenda that's putting Virginians first. It's an endorsement of an agenda that we laid out with plans throughout the summer in strengthening our public schools, lowering costs, particularly housing, health care and energy, and growing our economy. And certainly that happens all on a landscape where Virginia has been so impacted by the choices coming out of this White House, whether it's DOGE, whether it's tariffs and then retaliatory trade policies that we have then experienced and have impacted Virginia, from small businesses to farmers to shipments into our port. But certainly it's an endorsement of our affirmative agenda. But, certainly, on the landscape where so much of what is happening here in Virginia and so many of the concerns that people have are really heightened because of the ways that we have been impacted by the bad choices and aggressive chaos coming out of Washington. Fadel : What about on immigration? I mean, Virginia's outgoing Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, shares the president's hardline approach to immigration. He signed an executive order that requires local law enforcement to work with federal immigration authorities. Will that also be your approach? Spanberger : Absolutely not. I'm a former law enforcement officer. I was a federal agent before I became a CIA officer. So my entire background is one of law and order, understanding the threats that our country faces coming from the outside, and a clear recognition, frankly, of the responsibilities of what it is to uphold the law. The efforts that we have seen undertaken by this administration with ICE is beyond anything that I ever knew as a law enforcement officer. Any time we went anywhere, we were showing our warrants. When we were with local police, they were clearly marked. We were clearly marked. The idea that there are families getting pulled over on the side of the road, and parents getting taken out of the cars, and children left is just an absolute nightmare situation and it doesn't make our communities safer. And so my approach will be: when there is a warrant signed by a judge, certainly law enforcement can and must work with federal agencies. That's how I always worked task force or joint issues. But I do not want local Virginia law enforcement doing the administrative actions of ICE, particularly at a time when it drives so much fear and confusion within our communities.

We're going to talk about one of those now. Virginia just elected its first woman governor, Abigail Spanberger. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And just a few minutes ago, Adam said to our daughters, your mom's going to be the governor of Virginia. (CHEERING) SPANBERGER: And I can guarantee those words have never been spoken in Virginia ever before. FADEL: That's Spanberger at her victory speech last night. This specific gubernatorial race, one of just two held the year after the presidential election, is seen as a bellwether for how voters feel about leaders in Washington. Spanberger, a former congresswoman, capitalized on voters' concerns about the cost of living, jobs, immigration reform and a whole range of other issues, including political violence, all issues that resonate across the country. And she won decisively, by just over 15 points, according to this morning's numbers. And Democrats also scored down the ballot, leading the lieutenant governor and attorney general races and securing a supermajority in the House of Delegates. And Abigail Spanberger joins me now to discuss. Governor-elect, thank you for being on the program. SPANBERGER: Thank you so much for having me. FADEL: So how are you feeling this morning as you reflect on your historic election, the first woman governor in Virginia? SPANBERGER: I am feeling great this morning. It is a good day in Virginia. And the transition starts today, so I'm excited to get to work. FADEL: So winning an election is one thing, but fulfilling the promises to make things affordable, fight for federal workers who have lost their jobs, as you did on the campaign trail, is another. What's on your agenda Day 1? SPANBERGER: Day 1 is to start working with our partners in the General Assembly to make sure they're ready to go with the bills to file, making sure that I am ready Day 1 in January with executive actions related to ensuring that we're supporting all Virginians, particularly given the challenges that so many of our community members are facing in the past because of DOGE and now because of the shutdown and maintaining the economic focus that I have had throughout this campaign so that as soon as I am sworn in in January, we are moving quickly to take decisive and clear actions to deliver on the promises and the plans that I set forth throughout the campaign. FADEL: As you point out, Virginia, home to hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors deeply affected by DOGE cuts and the government shutdown. Before we get further into that, I do want to ask if you see your win as an endorsement of your agenda or a repudiation of Donald Trump. SPANBERGER: I think it's absolutely an endorsement of an agenda that's putting Virginians first. It's an endorsement of an agenda that we laid out, you know, with plans throughout the summer in strengthening our public schools, lowering costs, particularly housing, health care and energy, and growing our economy. And certainly, that happens all on a landscape where Virginia has been so impacted by the choices coming out of this White House, whether it's DOGE, whether it's tariffs and then the retaliatory trade policies that we have then experienced and have impacted Virginia, from small businesses to farmers to, you know, shipments into our port. But certainly, it's an endorsement of our affirmative agenda, but in - you know, certainly on the landscape, where so much of what is happening here in Virginia. And so many of the concerns that people have are really heightened because of the ways that we have been impacted by the bad choices and aggressive chaos coming out of Washington. FADEL: The president and Democratic governors have been at loggerheads a lot this year, and I wonder, as you think about taking office in January, how you see your future relationship with the president. SPANBERGER: Well, certainly, during my time in Congress during his first presidency, my approach was always, if there is something that I can work on for Virginia, I will look to build out that coalition, and certainly, I will look to work with a president that I may disagree with on - you know, substantially. And right at this moment, you know, coming in now as governor-elect, and governor in the new year, my approach will be to make sure that I'm pushing for what we need here on the ground. And right now, that will be pushing back against a variety of the bad policies that are coming out of this White House. Again, our cargo coming into our port is down nearly 9% year over year. And that's impacting, you know, certainly people down the line who would be bringing in those goods, but I've heard directly from truck drivers and port workers about the impact. Our economy is set to have zero growth next year. We had seven months of rising unemployment, principally because of DOGE. And we had been the No.1 state for business. And we lost that, and CNBC, with that rating, said it was because of DOGE. So, you know, there are so many places where, when it comes to the choices of this president, his choices are at odds with the needs of Virginians. And so I will continue to make that clear and continue to push back on bad policies. But certainly, any place I can find common ground, celebrate what it is that we're trying to do in Virginia, I look forward to doing that. And hopefully, you know, we'll see a lessening of some of these attacks on our state into the future. At least, that's what I'm going to work to achieve. FADEL: What about on immigration? I mean, Virginia's outgoing Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, shares the president's hard-line approach to immigration. He signed an executive order that requires local law enforcement to work with federal immigration authorities. Will that also be your approach? SPANBERGER: Absolutely not. I'm a former law enforcement officer. I was a federal agent before I became a CIA officer. So my entire background is one of law and order, understanding the threats that our country faces kind of from the outside and a clear recognition, frankly, of the responsibilities of what it is to uphold the law. The efforts that we have seen undertaken by this administration with ICE is beyond anything that I ever knew as a law enforcement officer. You know, anytime we went anywhere, we were showing our warrants. When we were with local police, they were clearly marked. We were clearly marked. The idea that there are, you know, families getting pulled over on the side of the road and parents getting taken out of the cars and children left is just - it's an absolute nightmare situation. And it doesn't make our communities safer. And so my approach will be, when there is a warrant signed by a judge, certainly law enforcement can and must work with federal agencies. That's how I always worked task force or joint issues. But I do not want local Virginia law enforcement doing the administrative actions of ICE, particularly at a time when it drives so much fear and confusion within our communities. FADEL: Governor-elect of Virginia Abigail Spanberger, who will be the first woman governor in the state. Thank you for your time and coming on the program. SPANBERGER: Thank you so much for having me.

The thaw has arrived, at least here in Baltimore, where I am at the time of this taping. The days are getting longer, the cold is subsiding, and we are fast approaching that perfect date weather, that \"Miss Congeniality\" weather - you know, when it's not too hot, not too cold. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"MISS CONGENIALITY\") HEATHER BURNS: (As Cheryl Frasier) ...Not too hot, not too cold. All you need is a light jacket. LIMBONG: ...Which is to say, it is the perfect time to get outside and see something new. And you don't have to go far. Today's episode is all about how to pay attention to your usual surroundings with some fresh eyes. JENNY ODELL: We have a natural curiosity, and it's just, you know, unfortunate that the structures of life and, you know, many different factors kind of cover over that, and you have to find ways of rehabilitating it. LIMBONG: That's Jenny Odell, previous guest of the pod, avid birdwatcher and author of the book \"How To Do Nothing.\" In this episode of LIFE KIT, she's going to be our guide to finding some new things in old spaces. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LIMBONG: It's easy to take for granted the stuff that's around you - you know, that park down the street, that weird-looking building a few blocks from work, that bench underneath that tree where you ate a sandwich once. Really paying attention to these things is probably something you only do when a friend visits from out of town and you play tourist in your own town with them. But it's important to try and incorporate that energy into your everyday life. It is, after all, the ecosystem you inhabit. Just like those dioramas in science class, everything in an ecosystem affects everything else, including you. Here's Odell reading from her book, \"How To Do Nothing.\" ODELL: (Reading) It's a bit like falling in love, that terrifying realization that your fate is linked to someone else's, that you are no longer your own. But isn't that closer to the truth anyway? Our fates are linked to each other, to the places where we are and everyone and everything that lives in them. How much more real my responsibility feels when I think about it this way. This is more than just an abstract understanding that our survival is threatened by global warming or even a cerebral appreciation for other living beings and systems. Instead, this is an urgent personal recognition that my emotional and physical survival are bound up with these, quote, \"strangers,\" not just now, but for life. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LIMBONG: Whew. (LAUGHTER) LIMBONG: It's just hit it, like, I - you know, every - I don't know, every guy hits 30 and all of a sudden, like, gets, like, into the city-planning YouTube rabbit hole, and, like, that's been my bag. And I've sort of been thinking a lot about, like, oh, everything - all of our decisions are, you know, intricately... ODELL: Yeah. LIMBONG: ...It's like, oh, where you put a street affects all this other stuff, you know, and I was just like, oh man. So reading the book has, like, made me think a lot about that sort of stuff. I'm just curious, what do you think? What do you get out of acting like a tourist in your own town? ODELL: I've always been amazed by how much we take for granted. Even if you haven't lived somewhere that long or aren't that familiar - or don't think you're that familiar - there's so much that we write off. And that could be, you know, architectural. It could be environmental. It could be things that happen, things that people are doing. I think, you know, if you think about, like, the route that you take to commute, for example, there's so much that just kind of doesn't come to your attention because you sort of either think that you know it already or there's no reason for you to pay attention to it. And then - it's sort of funny, because then, when you go to another place as a tourist, you notice everything because you're in a sort of tourist mindset, whereas, like, people who live there have probably written off many of those things. So it's really just a perspective, I think, that is one where you pay attention to maybe different kinds of things, maybe a different kind of level of granularity. I think you're less susceptible to think of things as, like, banal or everyday if you're in a tourist mindset. And so, I think, that's - for me - that's the main thing. It's always surprising. Like, you'll always find something, you know, surprising and oftentimes delightful when you're in that mindset. LIMBONG: Yeah. Like, you take the time to read the little, like, some guy built this thing here once, like, placards - right? - like, that sort of thing? ODELL: Yeah. I mean, I think one thing that's been really amazing to me - especially during the pandemic, because, you know, I and many people I know have been walking a lot and walking in neighborhoods - is to walk around a space with someone else - like, a space that you think you're familiar with. Like, I - a friend of mine had gone for a walk in my neighborhood and then a week later was like, I really want to show you this weird thing that I found in a mural. And I've walked past this mural, like, hundreds and hundreds of times, and I never would have noticed that thing. And so, like, it just really goes to show that what you see has to do with, like, what you specifically are looking for or aren't looking for. And so I think just, like, going somewhere with someone else or, like, going on a walking tour - historical walking tour - of your own neighborhood, if you're so lucky to be able to do that - those can be really eye-opening experiences. LIMBONG: And, you know, besides having someone else accompany you around your neighborhood, what other ways do you think that, like, people can really dig into, like, their whereabouts? Like, how do they reopen their eyes, so to speak? ODELL: I think one really easy way is to think about the idea of, like, a lens. And you can take that literally or figuratively. So, literally, I tend to walk around with - I don't know, I've seen it referred to as a jeweler's loop. I don't know a lot about these lenses, but basically I have a very small magnifying glass, like, type thing, and it's, like, a 10X lens. But I've used that to look at, you know, plants really close up. And it's actually a little bit comical because, in my experience, you have to be quite close to the thing that you're looking at, and your eye also has to be pretty close to the lens. So I look like some kind of weird plant detective because I'm, like, walking up to these plants with this, like, tiny - you know, my face sort of pressed up against this thing and, like, really close to some leaves or whatnot. But I am always surprised by how things look. I mean, plants are so much hairier than you realize, and, like, insects are terrifying. But - and like, there's, like, dewdrops and all these kind of tiny details. It's, like, very magical to realize that there's this, you know, world. It's very like, \"Honey, I Shrunk The Kids,\" like, level of wonder. So I carry that around. And then I also often have binoculars on me because I'm a birder. So I have, you know, my own eyes, which see in a certain way, and then I have this lens where I can see things that are really small. And then I have this other lens where I can see things that are far away. And so, like, that's sort of a literal example of lenses. But I think you can also think about, like, conceptual lenses. Like, what are you looking for? So, you know, like, what if you walked your neighborhood and you tried to pay attention to things that are flowering? I mean, this is a good time to be doing that because it's the spring. And maybe over the course of, you know, weeks or months, you continue to pay attention to those plants, and you kind of track them through their flowering processes. Or maybe you try to pay attention to, like, what kinds of insects are attending to them. You could do a really interesting thing, just, like, only paying attention to sound or only certain types of sound. But, like, all of these kind of involve like a decision to begin with. Like, I am going to pay attention to X, and that's my lens. And I'm going to move through the space. And I think that that's - I mean, there's almost like an infinite number of things that you could choose. And so there's an infinite number of interpretations that you could have of the same space. And I think, like, that's been something that I've really relied on during the pandemic, especially, because, you know, we're all looking for novelty. And that is sort of a movement that you can make in your own head before you're even in the space that will drastically affect what you're going to notice. LIMBONG: How do you decide what to fix your lens on or which lens to choose? ODELL: Yeah. I think it sort of just depends on what you are maybe naturally curious about. So, you know, for me, I personally just am drawn to ecological processes. But there's also this layer of history that is in everything as well. So, you know, I remember at some point years ago, I was - I think I looked up - I live in an apartment building, but there's a house across the street that I looked up, and it was built in the 1920s. And I remember that just kind of set off this whole thing for me of like, oh, this, that side of the street, those were all built in the 1920s. Like, I wonder why? Like, why were they built like that? So I think there's also kind of like an architectural, historical layer that you could pay attention to, like, you know, styles of things. But just thinking about, yeah, like, why things are in the places that they are - you know, another way of putting it is, it's just like - during the pandemic I remember I would walk around and just ask myself like, what is different from yesterday? And then, like, that's kind of a funny question because you realize that, actually, everything is different from yesterday. But asking that question will maybe, like, allow you to find the things that are most obviously different from yesterday. And that could be things that people are doing in the space, you know, things that are growing or blooming, things that are being built or torn down, birds that have arrived, you know, that weren't there before, smells. I know there's someone who gives, like, smell tours in New York City - or did at some point - so really, like, anything that's in your sort of powers of observation, like using that to try to measure the difference of today from yesterday. LIMBONG: Bro, I'm not going on that smell tour. (LAUGHTER) ODELL: I mean... LIMBONG: This question might sound a little ridiculous, but how do you pay attention? ODELL: I mean, I think there are many ways to pay attention. I think, for me, one of the things that I have noticed, I think, especially in the last couple of years, about the way that I pay attention, is that it has a lot to do with time and being attentive to change. So, for example - I know; sorry. All my examples are from birding. But, like, when you start birding - right? - you get your bird guide, and you have all these different birds in it. And you could sort of treat it like Pokemon Go, right? Like, I'm looking for this bird. I saw it. I saw the bird. I'm done. Like, I keep walking, right? And then inevitably, I think, especially if you're in the same place and you're paying attention to the same birds, you start to notice things like, oh, you know, these birds do different things at different times of the year. And then you realize, oh, they do different types of things during in different times of the day. And at some point, I think, when that moves from just, like, that bird is there to, like, that a bird is observing and responding to its environment, I find that, like, if I observe that, that's the deepest form of attention that I'm aware of, is if I am attending to, you know, like, let's say this bird attending to its environment, which really just means, like, tracking something through space and time and acknowledging that it is also alive to its environment. So conversely, the best - the easiest way to not pay attention to something is to think that it's just kind of a frozen object in space, like it's not going to change. It doesn't have an orientation to time. And that's how you write things off. It's like, I've seen it. I'm done. And then you're no longer paying attention to it. And I think if you really want to pay attention to something for more than a moment, it has to come with the acknowledgement that, you know, that thing or being has a history, and it also has a future. And it's sort of existing in time with you. And it's changing. LIMBONG: Do you have any advice on how to build a community out of this sort of stuff, like, maybe from scratch and, like, start, you know, spreading the good news of looking around and noticing things? ODELL: Yeah. I mean, I think the first step would just be having to find out if someone's already done that, which, you know, if you're lucky, maybe someone already has. I don't have a lot of great examples. I mean, well, so I guess, you know, under the category of things that are already established, you know, here in the Bay Area, the Golden Gate Audubon Society organizes trips - you know, birding trips, which - and I also mentioned earlier, the Feminist Birding Club. So there are - you know, birding is the type of thing that's like - it's an established enough thing that there are often, like, groups that already exist that you could maybe look for. But I also - I'm almost more drawn to, like, smaller things where - I'm just thinking of - I have one friend in particular who's, like, my birding friend. Like, this is the friend that I will text if I see, you know, a bird for the first time with, like, many exclamation points because it's like the - one of the only people I know who will, like, understand why that's so exciting on a personal level. We walk around and look at birds. And that's - I don't know if that counts as a group. That's two people. But I do feel like you sometimes only need one other person to sort of make that agreement with, like, we are going to pay attention to X, and then you go and look for it because it's about sharing that experience. So - and then who's to say that, you know, you and your friend don't find, like, another person that you just know, sort of through friends or whatever, who also likes that thing. So maybe the three of you go, you know what I mean? That's kind of a more organic approach versus the kind of, like, organized walk - which the organized walks are really great, too, because they're - you know, they're often led by an expert. So, like, you can just ask the person, like, what is that? And they'll tell you. But I think that those are kind of two different approaches to kind of, like, finding others. LIMBONG: You mentioned taking the bus before. There's a passage in the book about public transportation and sort of, like, what it offers. And I was wondering if you could, like, tell me a little bit more about, like, what do you get out of taking the bus or the train as opposed to just, like, driving somewhere? ODELL: Yeah, it's funny you ask. I was just on the bus in - again, in San Francisco last week, and I was thinking about how much I love the bus. But I think it's that - it's one of the last places, for me, anyway, where you are thrown together with strangers. And I mean, I know this is not always the case, but there's generally, like, a sense of, like, respect and, like, mutual recognition. Like, we all just want to get to where we're going, and people sort of rearrange themselves accordingly. And I think just, especially, like, on a long bus ride, like, for me, it's just been this opportunity to consider, like, the reality of other people who I don't have some kind of - it's not, you know, friends or family or someone that I have some kind of, like, obvious relationship to. And you just kind of see people getting on and off. It's just this kind of, like, indication, I think, of, like, other lives. And I find that that - again, especially during the pandemic, I felt I really missed that. I think, like, the world kind of shrank in this way, that it made it harder to just, like, really, in a palpable way, like, sit with the fact of, like, just everyone kind of trying to make it, right? Like, everyone's just trying to get through their lives. And people have, like, hopes and desires and dreams and regrets. And every single person you see on the bus has those, you know? And, like, you know, you can get that, sort of, from walking around, if you're in a crowded area. But I don't know. To me, there's something about the bus where you're all going in the same direction, and you're all kind of invested in the bus, like, getting there. And you're just - and you're sitting together, you know, even if you're not talking. So in short, I love the bus (laughter). LIMBONG: No, buses rock. Yeah, I love - yeah, the - I never feel like more part of the city than, like, if somebody is, like, being a piece of s***, and everybody on the bus is, like, booing them, you know what I mean? ODELL: Yeah. Right, right. Like, totally. And that's what I was going to - I know there's - you know, like, there's always - you know, not always, but there's going to be, you know, oftentimes, some kind of incident on the bus. And it's like - but there are also then all the other people on the bus who are going to, like, rally around, like, trying to make sure that everything is OK. So - and I think that that's - maybe that's part of it for me, too, is like, there's some kind of illusion of individuality - like, a model of individuality, where you can sort of live your life unaffected by others and not affecting others that is perpetuated by something like driving a car on a freeway versus, like, when you're on a bus, you are confronted with this reality that you are - your life is intimately bound up with the lives of others, especially those who you do not - are not friends and family, who you don't have some sort of personal relationship to. And, like, the bus just kind of models that or just kind of reminds you of that general truth. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LIMBONG: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

Democrats have refused to back short-term spending measures without agreeing to extend these subsidies, citing the risk of millions facing unaffordable premiums, especially during open enrollment. While Republicans have traditionally opposed the ACA, several members—including Jeff Hurd, Don Bacon, and Marjorie Taylor Greene—now support preserving subsidies due to constituent pressure, especially in rural and small-business districts. Polling data from KFF and Republican pollster John McLaughlin reveals strong bipartisan support for extending the subsidies, indicating a shift in both public sentiment and internal party dynamics. The debate reflects the lasting political legacy of the ACA, which helped fuel the Tea Party movement and reemerged as a central issue in 2018 midterms. Democrats are leveraging the health care issue as a key political strategy, expecting it to play a similar role in the 2026 midterms. While some Democrats, like Catherine Cortez Masto, believe the shutdown should end to avoid disproportionate hardship, the broader narrative is that this standoff will reinforce Democrats' position as champions of health care access and affordability, while Republicans remain divided on the ACA’s future.","keyTakeAways":["The U.S. government shutdown has reached a record length of 36 days, driven primarily by a political deadlock over the expiration of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies for marketplace health insurance.","Democrats have withheld votes on multiple short-term spending bills, demanding a bipartisan agreement to extend ACA subsidies, which expire at the end of the year.","Despite Republican opposition to the ACA, several members—including Rep.

How an enduring debate over health care sparked a now record-long shutdown \n         By Sam Gringlas \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The government shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history. The ongoing 36-day closure has sparked disputes over a range of topics — from the separation of powers and the federal workforce, to food assistance and air traffic control. But at the heart of the impasse is a debate about health care, specifically expiring subsidies for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Democrats have gone all-in on their fight to preserve the subsidies, withholding votes 14 times for a Republican-backed short-term spending measure even  as shutdown pain ratchets up  with flight cancellations, delayed SNAP benefits and missed paychecks for federal workers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Though Republicans have insisted they will not negotiate on the subsidies until the government reopens, some members are calling for them to be preserved. The stalemate has underscored the Affordable Care Act debate's lasting imprint on Washington, more than 15 years after it was signed into law. Clashes over health care have continued to animate pivotal moments in American politics, from consequential elections to paper-thin votes in Congress and even a past government shutdown in 2013. Now the debate has stoked a record-long shutdown, just ahead of midterm elections in 2026, when health care could once again shape the results. Why some Obamacare critics want to extend its subsidies For more than a month, Democrats have refused to back a government funding measure without an agreement to extend subsidies for ACA marketplace plans, which expire at the end of the year. That has left Republicans in a tricky position. While the party broadly dislikes the law, some in Congress have begun to acknowledge they may be stuck with it. \"This is a big deal in my district,\" said Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Colo. \"I've heard from a number of people who are facing dramatic increases.\" Hurd says without the subsidies, constituents in his heavily rural district could lose health coverage. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Like most in his party, Hurd says reopening the government has to come first. He is also one of more than a dozen House Republicans who signed onto a letter calling for them to be preserved. And along with a pair of Democrats, Hurd and Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., outlined a bipartisan framework this week to temporarily extend the subsidies. Even the conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has called for keeping them, despite her sharp criticism of Obamacare, saying the cost of health care is a top issue in her deep red district. \"The toothpaste is out of the tube,\" Greene  wrote  on X this month. When the Affordable Care Act passed with zero Republican votes, this kind of acceptance would have been hard to imagine. Fights over the ACA helped fuel a 2013 shutdown. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) held the Senate floor for  more than 21 hours , railing against Obamacare and memorably reading from Dr. Seuss'  Green Eggs and Ham . Former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says backlash against the law helped give birth to the Tea Party and later the Make America Great Again movement. \"There was a lot of trepidation as to what Obamacare was going to mean,\" Cantor said in an interview with NPR. \"Whether you were going to be able to keep your doctor, whether there were going to be 'death panels,' and honestly a concern about the unknown.\" Over the years, Republicans repeatedly tried to repeal and replace Obamacare. \"We still faced opposition from within our own ranks,\" said former Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who chaired a key committee that tried to work on a substitute. \"Here we are today, and there's still no alternative. It's been 15 years. It's not gonna go away.\" Today, Upton says letting the subsidies expire could be disastrous for many Michiganders. Even House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has acknowledged that Obamacare is unlikely to be repealed. Johnson and other Republicans, including President Trump, who talked about \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA during a presidential debate last fall, have struggled to articulate concrete reforms. \"These ideas have been on paper for a long time,\" Johnson said recently. \"There's volumes of this stuff. We've been working on it since day one of this Congress.\" Polls show a majority of Republicans still oppose Obamacare, but the law's popularity has grown, says Ashley Kirzinger, director of survey methodology at the health policy organization KFF.  More than half  of marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts. \"They're more likely to live in rural areas, to own a small business or be farmers,\" she said. An  October survey  of competitive congressional districts by Republican pollster John McLaughlin, who has worked with Trump during each of his campaigns, also found overwhelming support for extending the subsidies. He says the results have been put in front of top advisers at the White House. \"Voters are definitely more likely to vote for somebody who's gonna support a health care tax credit that they can use versus those who might oppose it,\" McLaughlin said in an interview. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some Democrats hoped Trump would get involved and cut a deal on subsidies to end the shutdown. But Trump has continued to bash Obamacare and has yet to embrace an extension of the subsidies. And many rank-and-file Republicans remain skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a gastroenterologist. \"Obamacare has become the 'Unaffordable Care Act,\" Cassidy said. \"And the reforms that were supposed to lower costs are now being papered over with more and more subsidies.\" Hurd, the Colorado congressman, agrees the subsidies only address a symptom of the ballooning cost of health care. Still, he says extending them is an imperative for him and many colleagues — and hopes this can also be an opportunity for a bipartisan conversation about health care. \"Whether it's something they're public about or not, if you're genuinely serious about serving your constituents, this ought to be something on your radar screen,\" Hurd said. Why Democrats are all-in on their health care push Meanwhile, Democrats are betting enormous political capital as they hold out for a subsidies deal, emboldened by what happened in 2018, when candidates running on health care swept the party back into the House majority. That year, Andy Kim ran for a Republican-held congressional district in New Jersey. The incumbent, Rep. Tom MacArthur, was a key player in efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, authoring an amendment that would have allowed states to waive the ACA ban on denying coverage over pre-existing conditions. \"Everyone was furious,\" Kim recalled. \"He really touched a third rail.\" That year in Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin also challenged a Republican incumbent on health care. \"I think it was the dominant issue,\" Slotkin said. \"My experience with my mom not having insurance when she was diagnosed with Stage 4 ovarian cancer just meant that a lot of people wanted to talk about it and I had a lot to say.\" Kim and Slotkin won their races — part of a blue wave that gave Democrats control of the House. Eight years later, they are in the Senate, where Democrats have refused to back a stopgap spending bill without a deal to extend expiring ACA subsidies. Open enrollment began Nov. 1, when many Americans discovered that their premiums without the subsidies next year will skyrocket. \"That's 500,000 people in my state alone,\" Slotkin said. \"You're talking about people who are going to be doubling their costs and then therefore deciding not to keep health care coverage.\" \"I think what's really telling is that we see not just majorities, but large majorities, of Republicans, independents and Democrats saying that they want Congress to extend the enhanced premium tax credits,\" KFF's Kirzinger said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       KFF has been polling on the ACA for years. The 2010 law is  more popular than ever , a sea change from 15 years ago, when Americans were more evenly divided on the law. \"The best thing that happened to the Affordable Care Act politically was when Republicans started trying to take it away,\" said Meredith Kelly, a top Democratic congressional committee staffer during the 2018 midterms. Leading up to that cycle, Kelly worried that Obamacare was a political liability for Democratic candidates. But then, with Trump in office, Republicans moved to destroy it. \"I think that the 2018 cycle was a massive turning point for the popularity of the ACA,\" Kelly said. \"And I think that's in great part because Democrats worked really hard that cycle to help Americans understand what Republicans were ripping away.\" Democrats think health care will resonate again in the 2026 midterms, despite the onslaught of news that has characterized Trump's second term. Riding the Senate subway, Kim says 2018 was chaotic, too, and still the health care message cut through. \"I think sometimes we don't remember how turbulent and crazy the first term was as well,\" Kim said. Hustling to another vote on the Republican funding bill, Slotkin said she does not know whether health care will play the same driving role it did in 2018. But she says there is reason to believe it will. \"Among all of the major ways people are paying more and the cost of living is going up, I can't think of something that is more personal than health care,\" she said. Will the shutdown reshape the health care debate? Throughout the shutdown, Republicans have slammed the high cost of the subsidies, calling them a relic of the pandemic-era and no longer needed. They also have accused Democrats of holding the government hostage to extract policy concessions, putting federal workers and others in the crosshairs. \"I'm still at a loss as to what exactly they're trying to get out of this,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday. \"While they may believe politically that it's in their best interests, it's certainly not in the best interests of the American people ... Nobody wins. Shutdowns are stupid.\" Kelly, the Democratic strategist, thinks Democrats will win that argument in the long run. \"What I do hope the American people understand before next November is that Democrats are on the side of lowering their costs and protecting their health care, and Republicans are not,\" she said. \"That will be the lasting impact of this shutdown.\" Not all Democrats agree that the shutdown consequences will be worth it. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., has been one of three in her caucus voting with Republicans to reopen the government. \"I don't think we should swap the pain of some Americans for others,\" she told reporters. \"I think we can keep the government open and address the looming crisis of the health care cliff that we are seeing.\" Republicans hoped more Democrats would see it that way as the shutdown dragged on. This week, some have signaled they may now accept just the promise of a vote on the subsidies. For now, the shutdown may soon stretch into a sixth week, with the subsidies still set to expire. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5597788","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"20:06:00-04:00","title":"Mamdani wins New York City mayoral race, in a historic victory for progressives","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Ugandan-born Democratic socialist, won the New York City mayoral election in a historic victory, becoming the city's first Muslim and person of South Asian descent mayor and the youngest in over a century.

November 5, 2025 • 2:06 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         BROOKLYN, N.Y. - Zohran Mamdani will be the next mayor of New York City, becoming the first Muslim and person of South Asian descent — as well as the youngest in over a century — to hold the position. \"The future is in our hands,\" Mamdani declared to roaring applause Tuesday night at a victory celebration in Brooklyn.  \"My friends, tonight we have toppled a political dynasty.\" The 34-year-old, Ugandan-born Democratic socialist defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an Independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in Tuesday's election, according to a race call by the Associated Press. It's a remarkable ascent for Mamdani, who was a relatively unknown state assemblymember representing a district in Queens when he entered the crowded mayoral race last year. He went on to win June's Democratic primary by 12 percentage points, quickly becoming one of the country's most  popular and polarizing  politicians along the way. Taking the stage Tuesday night, Mamdani didn't shy away from his socialist political views, opening his speech with a quote from Eugene Debs, a socialist politician who ran for president five times in the early 1900s. \"I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity,\" Mamdani said, promising to improve conditions for New York City's workers. Many of the young Mamdani supporters who gathered in Brooklyn said they had been moved by his optimism and promises that he would improve their lives.  \"I voted with my parents, it's a tradition of ours,\" said Dania Darwish, 32, who described herself as a Syrian-American Brookynite.  \"My mom was crying the entire way to the voting station,\" Darwish added.  \"It was very emotional for all of us to see a candidate on the ballot who represents us.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some of Mamdani's main campaign promises included making the city's buses fare-free, freezing stabilized rents, providing universal child care, increasing the minimum wage by 2030 and lowering the cost of living by raising taxes on big corporations and the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers. Mamdani has also said he would stand up to President Trump, who has frequently criticized — and mischaracterized — Mamdani as a communist and  repeatedly threatened  to slash New York City's federal funding if he won. In a concession speech that echoed the ominous themes of his campaign, Andrew Cuomo warned of antisemitism and lawlessness.  \"We need the police to keep society safe.  We will not make the NYPD the enemy,\" Cuomo said, while also condemning Mamdani's embrace of socialism. \"We are headed down a dangerous, dangerous road,\" Cuomo said. Critics have pointed to Mamdani's relative inexperience and the political challenges he would face in delivering on his ambitious, highly progressive agenda. And, despite his repeated disavowal of antisemitism, his vocal and long-held criticisms of Israel's government and actions in Gaza have alienated some voters in a city that's home to the  largest Jewish community  outside of Israel. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Mamdani's vision of a more affordable city, articulated through savvy social media videos and upbeat in-person interactions, has clearly resonated with young and first-time voters (even  outside of New York ). He won endorsements from scores of  high-profile progressives , mobilized  tens of thousands  of campaign volunteers and held a  double-digit lead  in polls going into Election Day. Young voters, who were likely to have supported Mamdani, are credited with  driving record early-voter turnout .  Less than an hour after polls closed on Tuesday, it was clear his efforts had paid off. A recap of the race New York City's mayoral race unfolded in a series of dramatic twists and turns, clashes and unlikely alliances. It energized voters and, in the end, more than two million votes were cast — the first time since 1969, according to the  New York City Board of Elections . Current Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, initially ran for a second term, despite a scandal-ridden first term and all-time low  approval ratings . After the Trump administration formally  dismissed the corruption case  against him, he announced his reelection bid in June, this time as an independent. That allowed Adams to bypass the Democratic primary, in which Mamdani triumphed over Cuomo. Mamdani's win was seen as an upset to the establishment, since the 67-year-old Cuomo is the son of a three-time New York governor and held the position himself for a decade beginning in 2011. In 2021, after numerous women  accused him of sexual misconduct  and questions swirled about his administration's  management of nursing home residents  during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuomo resigned as governor to avoid a likely impeachment trial, but denied all wrongdoing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Angling for a comeback, Cuomo entered the mayoral race  in March , saying the city was \"in crisis\" and in need of \"effective leadership.\" His platform emphasized issues like public safety, affordable housing, healthcare and fighting antisemitism — with a more centrist stance compared to Mamdani. Cuomo reentered the race as an independent after his primary loss, seeking to appeal to more moderate voters. He also got Adams' endorsement after the mayor  dropped out  in late September. At that point, the race narrowed to three main contenders: Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa, a 71-year-old radio talk show host and founder of the subway patrol organization the Guardian Angels, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Sliwa, who ran against Adams in 2021, was determined to remain in this year's race despite third-place poll numbers and  mounting calls  to drop out, from his own party as well as from Cuomo. Their concern was that Sliwa would take votes away from Cuomo, propelling Mamdani to victory. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The three faced off in two  contentious debates  in October, in which Mamdani and Cuomo sparred over issues of integrity and experience while Sliwa sought to paint them as two sides of the same ideological coin. Tuesday's election marks a pivotal moment for liberal-leaning New York City and the Democratic establishment. Both have grappled with how to respond to the Trump administration, which has targeted blue cities nationwide ( including the Big Apple ) with funding cuts and National Guard troops. The high stakes and voter enthusiasm of this election were evident well before Election Day: The city Board of Elections said 735,317 voters cast ballots during early voting,  more than five times  the number of early voters in 2021. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5599131","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"13:37:00.000Z","title":"A child disappears from a playdate and it's 'All Her Fault' in this gripping TV series","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reviews the new Peacock TV miniseries 'All Her Fault', a psychological thriller centered on a 5-year-old boy, Milo, who goes missing during a school playdate.

Sarah Snook, one of the stars of HBO's \"Succession,\" returns to television this week. She's the star of a new eight-part miniseries called \"All Her Fault,\" based on a novel by Andrea Mara. The first four episodes drop all at once this Thursday on the Peacock streaming service. Our TV critic David Bianculli has this review. DAVID BIANCULLI, BYLINE: Sarah Snook has provided plenty of proof about how good an actress she is, and attention has been paid. She won an Emmy Award for her role as Shiv Roy, one of the manipulative wealthy siblings on \"Succession,\" and won a Tony Award for playing 26 different roles in her one-woman Broadway production of \"The Picture Of Dorian Gray.\" In her new Peacock TV miniseries, \"All Her Fault,\" she plays only one role. But right from the opening scene, it's a dramatic and challenging one, and she pulls you right in. Snook plays Marissa Irvine, a wealthy wife with a 5-year-old son. We meet her at the start of \"All Her Fault,\" running a seemingly mundane errand - picking up her son from an after-school playdate at the home of Jenny, one of the other classroom moms. Except when Marissa arrives at the address that Jenny had texted to her, the woman who lives there isn't Jenny and knows nothing about a playdate or about Marissa's son, Milo. Linda Cropper plays Esther, the helpful homeowner. Sarah Snook, as Marissa, reads aloud from the text on her phone. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"ALL HER FAULT\") SARAH SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) The address is 1800 Crescent Hollow Road (ph). If I'm not home from work when you get there, my nanny will be there with the boys. This isn't 1800? LINDA CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) It is, but there's no Milo here. It's just me all by my lonesome. Who sent you the text? SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) A mom from the school, Jenny. Milo's on a playdate with her son, Jacob, and this is where I'm supposed to pick him up. I'm not crazy, right? That's this address. CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) It is. Should you give her a call? SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) Yeah. Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF DIAL TONE) AUTOMATED VOICE: We're sorry. You have a reached a number that... SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) It's not working. The number isn't working. (SOUNDBITE OF DIAL TONE) CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) Come on in. We'll figure it out together. AUTOMATED VOICE: We're sorry. You have a reached a number that... SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) Thank you. BIANCULLI: From there, things escalate quickly and frighteningly. Milo has an electronic tracker in his backpack, but it's been disabled. When Marissa calls another parent at the school to confirm Jenny's phone number, she learns Milo couldn't be on a play date with Jacob because Jacob is with that other parent. And when Esther uses the correct phone number to call Jenny, who's played by Dakota Fanning, the news gets even worse. And in the space of a few moments, Marissa goes from calm to justifiably panicked. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"ALL HER FAULT\") CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) Would you like me to call Jenny for you? SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) Yeah. Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) DAKOTA FANNING: (As Jenny Kaminski) Hello? CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) Hello, Jenny. You don't know me, but I'm here with your friend Marissa. FANNING: (As Jenny Kaminski) Hi, this is Jenny. Yeah. Is everything alright? CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) Well, Marissa thought her son was at your house today, but there seems to be some kind of confusion on that. FANNING: (As Jenny Kaminski) Oh, no, I'm working tonight. Jacob's at Sarah Larsen's for a play date. CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) So Milo isn't with you? FANNING: (As Jenny Kaminski) No, he isn't. CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) OK, so... SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) No, you sent me a message. FANNING: (As Jenny Kaminski) Hi, Marissa? No, I'm so sorry, but I didn't. SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) It's on my phone. I'm not crazy. It's on my phone. You sent me a text. FANNING: (As Jenny Kaminski) I promise I didn't. Is Milo OK? CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) I'm sure he's fine. We'll figure it out. Thank you, Jenny. SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) Oh. Who sent me that text? BIANCULLI: The next call is to Marissa's husband, which goes straight to voicemail. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"ALL HER FAULT\") JAKE LACY: (As Peter Irvine) You've reached Peter Irvine, please leave a message. SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) Peter, can you call me back? Right now, please? Right now. CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) That's your husband? Could he have picked up your son? Maybe forgetting to tell you? SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) No, he doesn't do that. It's our nanny or it's me, and he doesn't ever pick up Milo from school. CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) Could your son still be at school? SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) No. No, it's past 5. School is closed. CROPPER: (As Esther Bauer) So there's no way he could still be there? SNOOK: (As Marissa Irvine) No, they would have called me. If no one picked him up, they would have - so someone has picked him up. Who picked up my son from school? BIANCULLI: This is all before the opening credits.

funds to tsunami-proof an Oregon hospital. That money is MIA \n         By Katia Riddle \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 6:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Eight years ago, Erik Thorsen — CEO of Columbia Memorial Hospital in Astoria, Ore. — received a warning that no hospital administrator wants to hear: A big earthquake could cause his hospital's building to collapse. His staff and his patients could die in a matter of moments.  \"They basically said, 'None of you are prepared for a major natural disaster from the Cascadia subduction zone,'\" recalls Thorsen.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The  Cascadia subduction zone  is an earthquake-prone region that stretches about 700 miles from California to British Columbia. Thorsen's hospital sits right along it — which is why a team of experts and engineers from the state had come to talk to him and other leaders from coastal hospitals about earthquake risk. Alarmed, Thorsen — who grew up in this area, left for college, and then returned to raise his family here — got to work fundraising and planning in order to fortify his hospital to withstand an earthquake and provide shelter during a tsunami. A critical part of the project's $300 million budget was to come from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Their $14 million grant would help to build a tsunami evacuation zone in the hospital. But in April, the Trump administration canceled the grant program that awarded the funding, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. A  report  from the Urban Institute estimates this  cancellation  jeopardizes over $3 billion nationally in hazard mitigation funds to protect communities from threats like floods, wildfires, tornadoes and hurricanes. When the news reached Astoria, construction plans were already well under way. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We did go back to the design team and say, 'What would it take to actually take these elements out?'\" says Mark Kujala, a Clatsop County commissioner who worked on fundraising for the project. \"And because it's so integrated into the project, that just wasn't feasible.\" The hospital broke ground in September. The current plan for filling the $14 million hole left by FEMA: There is no plan. \"Unfortunately, FEMA — even prior to the shutdown, had kind of gone silent on us,\" says Thorsen. \"And now with the shutdown … very silent on us.\" No worse place to locate a hospital Columbia Memorial Hospital was constructed in its current location in 1977, when earthquake risk was not as well understood. In addition to being constructed in a zone vulnerable to a major earthquake, the hospital sits in a low-lying plain just blocks from the waterfront, on unstable ground. \"The theory is if the earthquake happened, that ground underneath us would liquefy and the building would potentially collapse,\" says Thorsen. \"If we happen to remain upright and a tsunami comes our way, maybe we get 20 to 30 minutes of notice to evacuate people up the hill.\" That would mean moving vulnerable patients — in some cases, critically ill patients — out of their environment and into another, in the middle of a disaster zone, in a matter of minutes. Other earthquake-prone places like Japan have already built such structures to avoid this scenario by moving to higher ground within their buildings. But Oregon is late to the game, some experts say. \" We're sitting here on — you know the overused phrase — [a] ticking time bomb,\" says Chris Goldfinger, who studies paleoseismology at Oregon State University. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A magnitude 9 earthquake, says Goldfinger, is a realistic possibility in the Cascadia subduction zone. \"Those happen on average just under [once every] 500 years,\" says Goldfinger. \"We're 325 years since the last one.\" At least 25,000 people could die in this scenario, according to  some estimates . There are only three hospitals in Oregon in this region. \"Honestly, with this project, we could be the only hospital that could survive and serve the residents — for about 60,000 people,\" says Thorsen. \"It's a big responsibility.\" Currently the hospital is a sprawling, one-story building, and modeling has predicted that several feet of water could flood the hospital's ground floor during a tsunami. When it is complete, the new hospital will be dramatically taller, growing from one story to four (plus a fifth level for a helipad). The idea behind the vertical evacuation zone is that once the earthquake has stopped and the new building is still standing, people can congregate in the top several floors, built especially to be able to withstand a tsunami. In order to help mitigate that potential disaster, engineers designed a plan to anchor the hospital to bedrock 65 feet deep. \"The building is 97 feet and the helipad sits on the roof,\" says Thorsen, gesturing to the hospital and describing its new design. A 100-foot drill — basically an enormous version of the kind of drill bit one might find in a household toolbox — is already making deep holes to secure the piles. Although the Pacific Northwest is beginning to build these kinds of structures, Goldfinger says, they're hard to finance without federal support. \"The federal government is really the only entity that's large enough to deal with this as a national-level problem,\" he says. \"It's just well beyond anything that the states could do alone.\" \"It is just incredibly frustrating\" Though Thorsen and his staff say they were given some indication that existing BRIC grants would still be distributed, they've yet to see any money. The  BRIC program  was established under the first Trump administration in order to fortify communities against natural disasters. After it was  canceled , a lawsuit challenged the program's termination and a federal judge  issued an injunction . \"It is just incredibly frustrating,\" says Democratic Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, who represents the area. Bonamici says she and her staff have been pleading with anyone who will listen to help access the money. \" I lost count of how many calls I have made, trying to get somebody from FEMA on the phone,\" says Bonamici. FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Plans for a new hospital, says Bonamici, provided her peace of mind about a potential catastrophe in her district. Some predictions forecast a magnitude 9 earthquake here could be the  worst natural disaster  the U.S. has ever seen. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It is going to be a safe place not just for patients or employees in the hospital, but for the community, \" says Bonamici. \"They can't outrun a tsunami. \" In addition to saving lives, she says, the project will save property and money. \"It is really critical that — now that they're underway with construction — this funding comes through.\" Waste, fraud, and abuse hits different at a local level When Trump officials started talking about cutting \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" Willis Van Dusen was enthusiastic. A registered Republican, Van Dusen was mayor of Astoria for more than two decades. Eliminating waste, he says, is what he and fellow Republicans wanted. \"This is what Trump ran on,\" he says. But when Trump's \"waste, fraud and abuse\" campaign came to his town, Van Dusen says he felt differently. \"What is more important than a hospital in a rural community like Astoria?\" he asks. Astoria has a history as a fishing and logging town, but more recently it's given way to big-city retirees and craft breweries. It's a rare, politically moderate area — a place, says Van Dusen, where neighborhoods are socioeconomically mixed and people are typically more concerned with questions of practical issues like trash collection than identity politics. Few issues are more practical than having a trusted hospital nearby, says Van Dusen. When he had a heart attack some years ago, it was doctors at Columbia Memorial who brought him back. \"I had actually died,\" he says, pointing to a framed EKG reading he keeps in his office. Making sure that this hospital can keep providing care during an earthquake and tsunami, he says, is the opposite of waste, fraud and abuse. \"Just to jerk that money away from us,\" he says, \"it makes me livid.\" Van Dusen says he's not the only one in this town who's mad, regardless of political party. \"Every single Republican that I have talked to is livid over what's happening,\" he adds. Hospital CEO Erik Thorsen says they are not giving up — even without the federal money. Construction continues. They've been thinking through other ways to finance it. Thorsen feels a responsibility for protecting this community where he has spent most of his life. \"We have this obligation to make sure that our patients and our residents and citizens are safe,\" he says. Without the federal government, though, the path ahead is unclear. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1196978795","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-27","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+00:00","title":"Artificial Intelligence in the Modern World: Transforming Industries and Raising Ethical Questions","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming sectors such as healthcare, education, and customer service.

Here's how to eat it responsibly \n         By Stacey Vanek Smith, Clare Marie Schneider \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, September 10, 2024 • 1:42 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on March 7, 2024, and has been updated.  Climate change is affecting our food, and our food is affecting the climate. NPR is dedicating a week to  stories and conversations about the search for solutions . As a consumer, it can be hard to know if the fish at the supermarket or on the menu is contributing to the degradation of marine life.  Overfishing has led to the decline of entire species, like Atlantic cod,  according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . And destructive fishing practices have driven others, like the Maui dolphin, to near extinction.  That's why it's crucial to get more information about the fish you eat — especially about how it was caught and where it came from.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Your Life Kit for living more sustainably \n       Your choices matter, says  Jennifer Dianto Kemmerly , vice president of global ocean initiatives at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. When people buy sustainable fish — fish that minimize harm to our wildlife and oceans — it sends \"a very clear market signal to the industry that this is what people want: healthy, responsible [fish] that's good for people and the planet.\"  Kemmerly, who works on  Seafood Watch,  the aquarium's sustainable seafood advisory list, shares three principles to consider when eating seafood.  Ask the right questions  Let's say you're at a restaurant or the fresh fish counter at the supermarket and you want to get the salmon — but you're not sure whether it's sustainable. To find out, simply ask the server or the fishmonger, says Kemmerly. Here are two key questions:  Is this fish pole or line-caught?  If the answer is yes, that's usually a good sign, says Kemmerly. \"Even at a commercial scale, a fishing boat can see what they just reeled in and if they caught a fish that's too small or is a different species they didn't intend [to catch], they can quickly release it.\"  When trawling or large nets are used to catch fish, sometimes other species are caught by accident, says Kemmerly. This is referred to in the industry as \"bycatch.\" Fish or marine life that get caught in these nets are often considered waste and thrown overboard.  According to NOAA , \"these unintentionally caught animals often suffer injuries or die.\"  Is this fish caught in the U.S.?   If so, it's probably a sustainable choice. \"The U.S. has some of the most stringent regulations\" of fishing in the world,  Kemmerly says. For example, if fish populations are depleted, fisheries in the U.S. are required to rebuild them to sustainable levels.  Do your research If you're not able to ask these questions, you may need to get your answers elsewhere. For example, if you're buying frozen shrimp in the seafood aisle of the supermarket and have limited information about its origins.  In addition to Seafood Watch, you can find information about sustainable fish on the  NOAA's  FishWatch site or the  Environmental Defense Fund 's Seafood Selector tool. (Which resource you use is up to you and your personal values, advise experts in  an NPR story from 2017  about seafood guides — each may offer different recommendations based on varying factors.) \n       \n      Related Story:  I Want To Eat Fish Responsibly. But The Seafood Guides Are So Confusing!   \n       All you need to do is look up the fish — say, pink shrimp from the U.S. — to get its status. According to the  NOAA's website , \"U.S. wild-caught pink shrimp is a smart seafood choice because it is sustainably managed and responsibly harvested under U.S. regulations.\" So that should give you confidence that pink shrimp is a safer choice for the environment.  Compare that to Argentine red shrimp caught in Argentina. Seafood Watch has flagged it as  a fish to avoid  because of concerns about bycatch.  Kemmerly recommends reading up on your go-to fish. Having the facts handy makes it easier to decide which seafood to eat without contributing to overfishing.  Don't be swayed by seafood labels  You might see seafood labels like \"wild-caught\" and \"farm-raised\" when buying fish. Don't be swayed by either term when determining what to eat, says Kemmerly.  Just because a fish is \"farm-raised,\" or raised in a pen or tank, doesn't mean it's sustainable. The same goes for a fish that is \"wild-caught,\" or caught from its natural habitat.  Knowing how a fish was harvested can be a helpful puzzle piece in determining how sustainable it is, but on their own, these labels don't provide much information. The most important factor is its impact on the environment, Kemmerly says. \n       \n      Related Story:  Sustainable Seafood? It's A Question Of Data \n       Remember there are other fish in the sea Don't be afraid to get outside of your comfort zone and try other kinds of fish. There are some tasty options outside of salmon, tuna and shrimp — the most popular fish in the U.S. — that you may be overlooking.  Like  farmed mussels , says Kemmerly. They are high in protein and the environmental impact of farming them is minimal,  according to Seafood Watch . Or  Arctic char , a cold-water fish with a rich, flavorful taste and the same pink color as salmon.  According to Seafood Watch , \"the stock is considered healthy, and the fishery is managed well.\" You may be pleasantly surprised by what you find. Kemmerly says she discovered sablefish when she was trying to move away from eating bluefin tuna. \"It's kind of buttery. It's denser and prepares well.\"  There's another sustainable benefit to diversifying your palate, says Kemmerly: it helps avoid overtaxing one type of fish species.

Salmon are not native to Chile.] MARIELLE SEGARRA, BYLINE: You're listening to LIFE KIT... (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:   Ahoy, LIFE KITers. I'm Stacey Vanek Smith in for Marielle Segarra. CLARE MARIE SCHNEIDER, HOST:   And I'm Clare Marie Schneider, a producer for LIFE KIT. VANEK SMITH: And today, Clare and I are bringing you a very special tale about fish, namely which fish to eat, because fish are some of the only wild animals that we consume on a mass scale. And it can be very hard to know what's OK to eat and what might be really harming the ocean or what's really overfished. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So we visited a restaurant in New York that is doing fish a little differently. It's called Rosella. It's a little sushi place in the East Village. VANEK SMITH: And the night we went, it was packed. It was hopping. People were dancing to the music a little. And we were all sort of sitting around watching the chefs, like, chop up the fish. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. And they were blaring U.K. rap really loud. VANEK SMITH: It was its own scene. ANDREW SORLAESITH: I'm Andrew. I'll be helping you with food tonight. So if you have any questions... VANEK SMITH: Andrew Sorlaesith is a sushi chef at Rosella. He's been making sushi for a decade, and he was serving up some of the restaurant's signature dishes. SORLAESITH: We have a porgy from Montauk. This one is dry aged, and... SCHNEIDER: It's a little loud. It might be a little hard to hear him, but he is telling us that he is serving us porgy sashimi. VANEK SMITH: Dry aged porgy sashimi from Montauk. SORLAESITH: Porgy is like a very American fish. You find it here, like, the Northeast a lot, but most people don't use it for sushi. VANEK SMITH: But I don't think, like, the California roll needs to be shaking in its shoes right now. But in fairness, porgy sashimi was basically the reason that we were at Rosella because porgy is quite sustainable. And Rosella is one of the only sustainable sushi restaurants in New York City. It only serves fish that have been sustainably farmed or caught. SCHNEIDER: Yeah, and the results are some kind of cool twists on classics. SORLAESITH: And then this one is actually made with - it's very similar to, like, a Philly roll. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I was going to say, there's cream cheese... SCHNEIDER: Yeah, the Philadelphia roll, which is usually made with smoked salmon, cream cheese and avocado. VANEK SMITH: I love cream cheese in a sushi roll. This is how you know that the U.S. has gotten involved (laughter). In whatever sushi roll it is, we have added cheese. SCHNEIDER: But Rosella does do it a little differently. SORLAESITH: This one is served with a dill cream cheese and our housemade tamago - the Japanese rolled omelet. VANEK SMITH: A smoked trout Philadelphia roll. Actually, this - I think we both - Clare Marie, that was pretty delicious. But it kind of shows how being a sustainable sushi restaurant puts you in this kind of bind. Because, you know, a lot of the greatest sushi hits - the rolls that people come in to order - they don't really make the cut. For instance, salmon - that is definitely one of the most popular sushi fish. So this time of year, sustainable salmon, it's just really hard to come by. So right now, Rosella's salmon avocado roll is actually an Arctic char avocado roll. SCHNEIDER: And it's actually dishes like the char avocado roll that brought Sasha Litvinov (ph) to the restaurant the night we were there. VANEK SMITH: Do you know that it's a sustainable sushi restaurant? SASHA LITVINOV: Yes, very much a draw. Part of what drew me is that it's a sustainable sushi restaurant. It's, you know, a complete travesty getting - what's going on in the oceans these days, and the fact that somebody is paying attention and trying to make it - you know, do their part in this town is really exciting. So... VANEK SMITH: So Sasha has a point about what's going on in the oceans right now. In fact, the World Bank estimates that almost 90% of global fish stocks are overfished. And the effect - it's kind of mind-blowing. It's been pretty devastating. Over the past 40 years, marine species have seen their populations fall by more than a third. SCHNEIDER: And Sasha said that she appreciates that, at Rosella, she can just order anything she wants off the menu because she knows all the fish is sustainable. VANEK SMITH: Right. I mean, and I felt that, too, when we were there. You can just kind of order anything off the menu and they've done all the curating for you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANEK SMITH: But, you know, Clare Marie, let's say you don't have the money to eat at a sustainable sushi restaurant every night. Maybe you just need to figure out which fish to buy to cook up for dinner or, you know, you're at Red Lobster and you're trying to figure out what to order. Don't worry. We have got you covered. You can have your fish cake and eat it, too. SCHNEIDER: This is going to be the whole episode, isn't it? VANEK SMITH: I have so many - so many fish puns that I've been saving up for this moment, Clare Marie. It's going to be the whole episode, yes. On this episode of LIFE KIT, along with many, many fish puns, we are going to take a deep dive into fish - what to eat, what not to eat... SCHNEIDER: And what to consider when you're buying fish, too. VANEK SMITH: OK. So, Clare Marie, before we dive into which fish to eat, which fish not to eat, what's sustainable, we should probably talk about how we are defining sustainable in this episode because it can mean a lot of different things. For our purposes today, we're talking about fishing practices that don't have a really negative environmental impact. And this is everything from, like, overfishing to local ecosystems, all of it. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So you're at the grocery store, and you're looking at all the fish for sale. You're seeing tuna, shrimp, crabs, trout, whatever. But how do you know what you should buy? JENNIFER DIANTO KEMMERLY: Hello, my name is Jennifer Dianto Kemmerly. I'm the vice president of Global Ocean Conservation at Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So the Monterey Bay Aquarium has created one of the best resources for people who are trying to eat more sustainably. It's called the Seafood Watch Guide. VANEK SMITH: Yes. Seafoodwatch.org is totally free, and it's become kind of a big thing. KEMMERLY: It's actually quite unique. It wasn't planned at all. VANEK SMITH: Yes. And Jennifer says this whole thing, the whole Seafood Watch Guide started by accident back in the '90s. The aquarium put this flyer out in their cafe to just let guests know how they were sourcing the seafood that they were serving there at the cafeteria. KEMMERLY: So we created these little tent cards and lo and behold, people started taking them, which was a real surprise to us. But we're like, wow, I think we're on to something here. People are really interested in this information. VANEK SMITH: So then Seafood Watch evolved into these little wallet-sized cards and then to a website, and it is now used by millions of people all over the world. It covers every kind of fish you can think of, from northwestern brook trout to Alaskan king crabs to Caribbean lobster. It is all covered by the seafood watch's, like, traffic light system. SCHNEIDER: That's our first takeaway. Do your homework. VANEK SMITH: Use a guide and look up the seafood that you tend to like to buy or order at a restaurant. Take yourself to fish school. SCHNEIDER: There are a bunch of sites and they're all really thorough and free. So obviously, Seafood Watch, of course, but also, NOAA has a great guide and so does the Safina Center at Stony Brook University, and the Environmental Defense Fund has a seafood selector. VANEK SMITH: Yes. I mean, and truly, like, we've looked at all of these, Clare Marie. The sights are kind of overwhelming. There is just, like, so much information and it gets really, really granular. It's just - it's so hard to know. I mean, there are really great farmed fish, there are really terrible farmed fish, totally sustainable wild-caught fish, totally unsustainable wild-caught fish. And the idea of trying to look through it while you are, like, in line or while a server is staring at you, waiting for you to order something, that could be hard. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So Jennifer recommends actually just picking the fish that you tend to eat. You know, the stuff that you're buying or ordering at restaurants. And educate yourself. Stacey, what's your favorite kind of fish? VANEK SMITH: I mean, I - this is going to sound so basic, but it is the truth. My favorite fish is salmon. I love salmon. SCHNEIDER: So yeah, if you look up salmon in the Seafood Watch Guide, you'll see different kinds of salmon are totally sustainable - green light fish. And then others get a red light. So as of this taping, king salmon farmed in Alaska and New Zealand gets a green light. Also, salmon caught with gillnets or trolling lines in the Northeastern U.S. - green light. VANEK SMITH: And red light, which means, like, take a pass for now, that would be king salmon caught with gillnets in Canada, those salmon are apparently overfished. Also, coho salmon farmed in Chile. Apparently, there's been a problem with the fish getting out of the pens and harming the wild, native species there. So red light. SCHNEIDER: Yellow light, this means there are some concerns about how it's been raised, like farmed Atlantic salmon raised in Norway can be good, but they use some chemicals to get rid of sea lice on the fish, which may be a little iffy. But there are all kinds of factors Seafood Watch takes into account. VANEK SMITH: Yes. And Jennifer says for salmon, for the specific case of salmon, a lot of the farms, they just, like, really pack the fish in there. And that's a lot of what can create a red light situation. KEMMERLY: I would love the listeners to envision these big net pens off the coast floating, and in those net pens are hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, depending on how big the net pen is, of salmon. And any time you have a large number of one species in a space, disease can spread very quickly. So what we do when we're assessing farmed salmon is we're really looking at the chemical and the pesticide use. And depending on the patterns of the water temperature, how many fish are packed into a net pen, this really does impact disease outbreaks and chemical use. SCHNEIDER: But then there are issues that have nothing to do with the animal itself. Take for example the Maine lobster. VANEK SMITH: Oh no, I love Maine lobster. SCHNEIDER: I know, me too. So the real problem here isn't actually the lobster population itself, it's that the lobster pots they use end up entangling a lot of North Atlantic right whales, and they're really endangered. There are only around 300 left in the world. So it's a red light. VANEK SMITH: But there are still options if you want to eat a green light lobster. Let's say you're at a Red Lobster, Clare Marie, and Lobster Fest, I think is on right now. You can opt for the rock lobster from Florida right now or the langostino lobsters from Chile. Both of those get a green light. And when - you know, when you're at Red Lobster, one of the best things to do that everybody told us to do was just to ask questions, to ask a lot of questions, to be that annoying customer that just will not stop asking questions. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So Jennifer said this is actually one of the most powerful things you can do. And it's our second takeaway. It's to ask questions. And if the answer is I don't know, keep asking. KEMMERLY: Just asking, is this sustainable? Or even asking, is this wild card or farm raised? It's really surprising how many retailers and restaurants can't tell you. And I think as a consumer, just making it known that that's important to you really helps programs like Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch do the work that we need to do. So help us help you. Ask questions at point of sale. Is it farmed or wild? Is it sustainable? Where is it from? And if you ever see just white fish on the menu, please ask what does that mean? Because it can be anything from, like, a farm-raised striped bass to Arctic char. VANEK SMITH: And Jennifer says those questions have a big impact. Servers and fish sellers will feel pressure to know that information, and that can actually push them to make changes. Jennifer says she has seen this happen. SCHNEIDER: Take the rockfish. It's a white California coastal fish, and it used to solidly be in the red category. VANEK SMITH: Yes. Apparently it is very tasty, and it was on a lot of fancy California menus, and the chefs did not want to take it off because people loved it. KEMMERLY: It had been red rated because it was overfished for all the reasons that we've been talking about, and we were seeing the populations dwindle. VANEK SMITH: But people started asking restaurants about it. A lot of customers started asking a lot of questions. And, Jennifer says, restaurants and fish sellers - they felt the heat. KEMMERLY: Chefs and local businesses who relied on rockfish as part of their menu staples were starting to get engaged and say, what are we doing? What are we doing here? So it was really raising the alarm. So the government, the fishing community, the conservation organizations, academia came together and started co-designing solutions. VANEK SMITH: Special protected areas were created to encourage breeding. Fishing was regulated to certain times of year. And now the rockfish is a green-light fish. So, you know, using these guides, educating yourself, asking questions - this is just a great way to make sure that you're eating fish that you feel good about eating. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. And if you don't have your phone with you, or it's dead, or you just need to make a fast call, there are some general rules you can follow. VANEK SMITH: Rule No. 1 - ask how the fish was caught. If it is pole-and-line caught, Jennifer says that is usually a very good sign. That is a green flag. Some other fishing practices, like the use of nets or trawlers - that can sometimes be a little more iffy, but pole-and-line - thumbs up all the way. SCHNEIDER: Also, if the fish is farmed or caught in the U.S., that's usually a good sign because U.S. regulations are quite strict around fishing and raising fish, so you're probably OK there. VANEK SMITH: And one thing to ignore is price, because unlike with most food, sustainable fish are not necessarily more expensive. In fact, we heard this from Rosella's head chef and owner Jeff Miller. He said this is something he discovered when he decided to open his sustainable sushi restaurant. SCHNEIDER: He knew that he was going to have to find some nontraditional sushi fish. And for about two years, he tried every single fish that met his sustainability criteria. JEFF MILLER: I kept track, and there were - we used, I used, 91 unique species of fish in here, and not all of them worked. A lot of it was just, like - anytime I would see a fish that that I hadn't worked with before, I would bring it in. SCHNEIDER: Jeff said that in a lot of the cases, the most sustainable fish were actually way cheaper than the sushi-grade fish he used to import from Japan. MILLER: If you then switch to looking at what's from Long Island, it's hard to find fish that are as expensive as the fish that you're getting from Tokyo. Porgy is an abundant fish. There's so much porgy up and down the East Coast. And it's - in general, it's like $4 a pound. VANEK SMITH: And it makes a mean sashimi. SCHNEIDER: And so did another seafood that you don't often see in sushi restaurants - mussels. MILLER: It's kind of the next level of sustainability in that they're filter feeders. They're good for the water that they grow in, and super cheap. SCHNEIDER: This brings us to our third takeaway - seek out more sustainable fish and give it a try. VANEK SMITH: Yes. In fact, those mussels that Jeff was just talking about - they are taking center stage at the Monterey Bay aquarium this month. For the 25th anniversary of the seafood watch list, the aquarium is unveiling its super-green list, aka fish that are super green, exceptionally environmentally friendly and exceptionally sustainable. SCHNEIDER: So every month they're going to name one seafood, and they're going to provide recipes and nutritional facts. And for March, the pick is mussels. VANEK SMITH: And you know, we did try some mussels. SCHNEIDER: We tried Chef Jeff's pickled mussels. And Chef Andrew served it up for us. SORLAESITH: And then the pickled mussels - the muscles are from Maine. They're pickled in Chardonnay vinegar and served with a spicy aioli. VANEK SMITH: And so, Clare Marie, as you know, I was not 100% sold on the porgy, but the pickled mussels - those were great. I could eat pickled mussels from Rosella every day. It felt like a real flex from the chef. Like, get it? Like, mussels and flexing. SCHNEIDER: OK, let's serve up our takeaways, Stacey. VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) Oh, my gosh, Clare Marie. My heart just grew three sizes. Serve it up. SCHNEIDER: Takeaway No. 1 - use an online guide. There are a bunch of great ones. They're free. And the information is amazing. And it goes super in-depth on all kinds of aspects about where your fish came from. And maybe look up some of your favorites in advance. Those guides are kind of complicated and very thorough. VANEK SMITH: Takeaway No. 2 - ask questions. Ask all the questions. Be that annoying guest, because just the act of asking questions can make a real difference, can have a real impact. SCHNEIDER: Takeaway No. 3 - look up sustainable fish and maybe try some out. You might find something that you really like. VANEK SMITH: That is so true. And you know why, Clare Marie? SCHNEIDER: Why? VANEK SMITH: There are just a lot of fish in the sea. SCHNEIDER: Like porgy. VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) Like porgy. SCHNEIDER: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

Here are 5 takeaways from the 2025 elections \n         By Domenico Montanaro \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         One thing was clear — it was a big night for Democrats. Up and down the ballot, Democrats did well. That was true whether it was the marquee governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats significantly outperformed 2024 presidential election margins, or even  less-closely watched races  like the Virginia House of Delegates, the state supreme court in Pennsylvania and even Georgia Public Service Commission. And  the outcomes  very well may have consequences in the near term, for things like the federal government shutdown, in the medium term for the 2026 midterm elections and in the longer term for 2028. Here are five takeaways from the 2025 off-year elections: 1.   It's still the cost of living, stupid The old political axiom, coined by former Bill Clinton adviser James Carville is, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Well, over the last couple of years, more specifically that should be, \"It's the cost of living, stupid.\" Whether it was Democratic President Joe Biden or now Republican President Trump, prices and affordability have proven to be voting motivators. But Trump  has largely ignored it , saying he always felt immigration was more motivating. That came back to bite his party Tuesday night. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The  exit polls  found that in all four major contests — the governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York mayor's race and the Proposition 50 battle in California — voters said the economy was the most important issue (or close to it in New Jersey), and they sided with Democrats overwhelmingly. And that's despite Republicans being seen Tuesday night as best on the issue of crime or immigration in these elections (counting Trump-endorsed Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent in New York). That's a very bad sign for Republicans and Trump, who clearly now own the economy, despite how much the president continues to try to blame his predecessor. 2. Republicans still have a Trump problem — in two different ways The president is unpopular and a drag on his party when he's not on the ballot, but also, when he's not on the ballot, the GOP can't seem to turn out conservatives. Trump's numbers with independents haven't been good since early on in his second term as president, as lots of them disapprove of the job he's doing on the economy and think he's gone too far with how he's approached a policy of mass deportations. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In these elections, according to the exit polls, as of 1 a.m. ET — independents made up a third of the electorate in Virginia, and Democrat Abigail Spanberger won those voters by 19 points in the governor's race. It was a similar story in New Jersey, where they made up 31% and went for Democrat Mikie Sherrill by 13 points. It's a real quandary for Republicans. It was true during his first term as president, too, that in these non-presidential election years, Trump brings people out to the polls in the wrong way for the GOP. If you're a Republican, that has to be figured out. But so few want to cross Trump, and show a public break with him, that that's unlikely to happen anytime soon for the party  en masse . It's something to watch heading into next year's midterms and into 2028 when Trump is constitutionally ineligible to run again. 3. The Trump slump with Latinos appears to be real Trump made significant inroads with Latinos during the 2024 presidential election. In fact, no Republican presidential candidate won a higher percentage with Latinos — ever. But there have been  signs that Latinos were moving away from Trump . Poll after poll has shown that, and Tuesday night was the first time it showed up at the ballot box in a significant way. Spanberger and Sherrill, the governors-elect from Virginia and New Jersey respectively, both won Latinos by 2-to-1 margins, according to the exit polls. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Going deeper into New Jersey specifically, Trump won Passaic County in North Jersey, a county that is nearly half Latino, according to the census. He was the first Republican presidential candidate to win it since 1992. Trump won it by 3 points, but Sherrill won it by 15. There are 10 counties in New Jersey where Latinos make up at least 1-in-5 people, per the U.S. census. Sherrill not only won them all, she expanded Democratic margins and flipped three Trump had won. For a couple of decades — since Latinos have become a significant political force given their population boom in the country — they had been reliable Democratic voters. But they have increasingly become a bloc that is not necessarily loyal to either party. Get more updates in the NPR Politics newsletter . They're particularly worried — like lots of other voters — about the cost of living. And many Latino leaders, including in the Republican Party, have voiced concerns about Trump's approach to immigration — casting a far-wider net than just hardened criminals. Tuesday's result is likely going to have a lot of smart conservatives privately questioning Trump's policies and biting their nails about winning the group back for their races next year, as they try to hold onto the House. 4. The redistricting arms race is on, and Democrats got a boost Tuesday on that front Practically, maybe the most consequential election Tuesday was the Proposition 50 ballot initiative in California. A yes vote on Prop 50 would temporarily overturn the requirement that California draw its congressional districts via independent commission. That's exactly what happened — and it wasn't even close. That wasn't guaranteed at the beginning of this effort a few months ago. It was spearheaded by California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, and with the help of a lot of money and high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, they successfully made it a proxy fight with Trump. They convinced California Democrats that this was necessary to counterbalance Trump's demands on red states, like Texas, to squeeze out more Republican congressional districts to try to ensure GOP control of the House next year. Now, California is set to redraw its congressional maps, which likely will result in more Democratic seats. If that wasn't politically significant enough, there was also how Newsom positioned himself. While taking a victory lap, he tried to show he's a Democrat looking to counterbalance Trump not just with congressional districts but as a leader.   Newsom called it a \"good night\" for the Democratic Party, one on the \"ascendancy,\" and \"on its toes rather than on its heels.\" Newsom also chided Trump, calling him \"historically unpopular,\" that he \"promised to make us healthier and wealthier,\" but \"we're sicker and poorer\" and that Trump knows his unpopular position. \"Why else,\" Newsom asked, would Trump try to get more seats out of Texas except to try to \"rig\" next year's elections? Newsom boasted of his state standing \"firm in response\" to Trump. Democrats have made clear they want a fighter, someone willing to stand up to Trump in any way possible, someone with the guts to, say, bend the rules a little the way Trump might. One wonders who Newsom thinks should lead this \"ascendant\" party? 5. The Democratic Party will have to wrestle with its identity over the next year There are plenty of people in the party with different ideas on how to lead the party, push a message of affordability and stand up to Trump in the process. That brings us to Zohran Mamdani. No one has captured more attention during this election cycle than Mamdani. The 34-year-old, who is set to become the youngest New York City mayor in more than a century, and the first Muslim to serve in that office, has become a star with progressives — and a villain among conservatives. Conservatives are very good at creating Democratic bogeymen, and they will try their hardest to make Mamdani, a self-avowed democratic socialist, the face of the party.   Mamdani has plenty of political gifts. The campaign he ran was unique in its ability to reach out to younger voters in authentic ways and on social media. And, unlike a lot of Democrats, who have a hard time squeezing their policy proposals onto a bumper sticker, he was able to communicate his message of affordability clearly. But he also did nothing to calm his critics Tuesday night. His victory speech was bold and defiant, even beginning by quoting Eugene Debs, a committed socialist who created the Socialist Party of America. The cover of the conservative New York Post Wednesday depicts Mamdani holding up a hammer and sickle, a communist symbol, with the headline: \"THE RED APPLE.\" He reached out to Jewish New Yorkers in his speech, saying he would aim to fight the \"scourge of antisemitism.\" And he also poked the White House hive. Speaking directly to Trump, he urged him to \"turn the volume up\" before lambasting him over income inequality, union rights and his view of immigrants. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       All night, Fox News opted to talk about \"Commie\" Mamdani instead of taking victory speeches from Spanberger and Sherrill. Both women cut a different political profile: both have military or law enforcement backgrounds and tried to reach out to their opponents' voters. So, a large swath of the country on the right didn't hear a Democrat wishing her opponent well, praising her military service and saying she wants to be governor for everyone in the state. Instead, they were served a heavy dose of red scare. But is Mamdani now the face, or the \"soul\" of the Democratic Party? New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who also describes herself as a democratic socialist and was an early Mamdani backer, was asked about that on MSNBC Tuesday night. \"I don't think that our party needs to have one face,\" she said. \"Our country does not have one face. It's about all of us as a team together. And we all understand the assignment. Our assignment everywhere is to send the strongest fighters for the working class wherever possible. In some places, like Virginia, for the gubernatorial seat, that's going to look like Abigail Spanberger. In New York City, unequivocally, it's Zohran Mamdani.\" Again, it's the cost of living and affordability that's key. Can Republicans effectively make the next year a debate between capitalism and socialism — or will Democrats be able to band together and sell something on the economy that's better than what's currently in control of Washington? That's going to be a key question for the 2026 midterms, which kick off now. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Here to help us understand what happened, not just in New York but across the country, is NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Good morning, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. FADEL: So I know you didn't sleep covering these votes last night, all so we can wake up and hear your insights. So for all of us just waking up this morning, what do we need to know about the results? MONTANARO: I slept a little bit, but... (LAUGHTER) MONTANARO: It was a very good night for Democrats, obviously, as you've been talking about. No doubt about it. I mean, from the marquee races, you know, for governor in Virginia and New Jersey to the redistricting ballot initiative in California to state House and state Supreme Court races, Democrats really cleaned up across... FADEL: Yeah. MONTANARO: ...The country. People might say, you know, New Jersey and Virginia are states that lean Democratic. They do, but the Democratic candidates in those races outpaced the 2024 presidential margins by a significant amount, winning by double digits. FADEL: So what do you think is behind that? Why do you think Democrats did as well as they did? MONTANARO: Well, I mean, first and foremost, it's about the cost of living. I mean, people are upset, frustrated, scared, nervous that things still cost as much as they do. I mean, many people are struggling to buy homes, pay off student loans, medical debt - worry about, you know, affording - being able to afford having children or paying for child care, accessing health care. You know, this has been a huge frustration for a lot of people, you know, particularly since the pandemic, through the Biden administration and now into Trump's first year. FADEL: So are voters then tying this frustration to Trump and the Republicans - the state of the economy? MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, taking a look back at the exit polls, in all of the marquee races, people rated the economy as either the most important issue or close to it. In every race - in every single one - more than 6 in 10 sided with the Democrats on the economy. That's pretty remarkable. You know, it was overwhelming. That should be like a hair-on-fire, red-alarm moment for the party on the losing end of that, but Trump has had a real lack of focus on prices. He said very early on in this second term of his as president he felt immigration was most important. You know, how can you talk about the price of apples so much? - he said on multiple occasions. You know, a lot of people care about prices, and that lack of focus, the tariffs he's put in place have landed him really upside down when it comes to his approval ratings on the handling of the economy. You know, and it really came back to bite his party last night. FADEL: So one of the groups that Trump made inroads with were Latinos during the campaign. MONTANARO: Yep. FADEL: What clues did we have from last night about where they stand now? MONTANARO: Well, Latinos, like a lot of other groups, are very concerned about affordability, and that's why many crossed over to vote for Trump in the first place. That unraveled last night. You know, there've been signs in polling that Latinos were sliding away from Trump, and exit polls last night showed Democrats winning them by 2-to-1 margins in those governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey. In New Jersey, in particular, I want to point to Trump did very well in some counties with big Latino populations in 2024. Take Passaic County, which is about half Latino, according to the census. Trump won it by three points, a first for a Republican since 1992. Last night, it went to Democratic Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill by 15 points. FADEL: We heard earlier about Zohran Mamdani's win in New York. What did you take away from those results and what it means for the Democratic Party? MONTANARO: Well, I think the Democratic Party is going to really be wrestling with its identity over the next year, no doubt about it. You know, Mamdani has captured so much attention in this election cycle. You know, he's a rising star among progressives, especially because of his focus on affordability, you know, which he's communicated very clearly. And Democrats have struggled to do that in the past. But he's also become a villain on the right. You know, he would be the first Muslim mayor of New York, as you mentioned, and he's been attacked for his faith and criticisms of Israel. He also calls himself a Democratic socialist, and he really leans into that label. Socialism is what Fox News honed in on last night. They didn't carry the speeches of Sherrill or Abigail Spanberger, who won for governor in Virginia. Instead, they focused on Mamdani. It was really interesting how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez answered the question last night on MSNBC about whether Mamdani is the new soul or face of the Democratic Party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: I don't think that our party needs to have one face. Our country does not have one face. It's about all of us as a team together, and we all understand the assignment. Our assignment everywhere is to send the strongest fighters for the working class wherever possible. In some places, like Virginia, for the gubernatorial seat, that's going to look like Abigail Spanberger. In New York City, unequivocally, it is Zohran Mamdani. FADEL: And really quickly, where do the Democrats go from here? MONTANARO: Well, you've got the big race in California where they got a big win on ballot - on the ballot initiative to temporarily overturn the requirement to redraw congressional maps by independent commission. They're going to be able now to try squeeze out way more Democratic seats. That's going to help them in 2026. FADEL: NPR's Domenico Montanaro, thank you. MONTANARO: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5598481","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"12:52:00-04:00","title":"Mikie Sherrill says New Jersey voters want 'leadership' in face of Trump's challenges","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial election, Democrat Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli, marking the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected a governor from the same party for three consecutive terms.

face of Trump's challenges \n         By Obed Manuel, A Martínez \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 12:52 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         New Jersey Rep. Mikie Sherrill secured a decisive victory in Tuesday's election to become the next governor of the Garden State in a race some polls predicted would be tighter. Sherrill beat the President Trump-endorsed Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, by  about 13% of the vote  — marking the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row. In an interview with  Morning Edition , Sherill said her win was about New Jersey residents wanting leadership at a time when many feel some of President Trump's moves — including tariffs, federal reductions in health spending and  threats to the multi-billion dollar Gateway Tunnel Project  — will make life harder for them. \"They look to my background in the military. They also want somebody who gets it and gets them,\" Sherrill said. \"They look to the fact that I'm a mom of four kids and I know what's been going on in our communities and our schools, and they wanted somebody to address those key issues.\" Speaking to NPR's A Martínez, Sherrill discussed her win and what Democrats' successful 2025 election means going forward. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Interview highlights A Martínez:  It's been six decades since New Jersey elected a governor from the same party three times in a row. How does that make you feel? Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill:  It makes me feel pretty great. And I'll tell you, after speaking to thousands and thousands of New Jerseyans about just what it was going to take for for them, for their families to succeed, and then really executing the campaign focused on declaring a state of emergency on utility costs on day one, expanding first-time homebuyers credit to get people a foot in the door to homes or really handling the crisis that's going on in our health care system. Just relentlessly focusing on the people that I was stepping up to serve I think had huge gains. I think that's what people here in New Jersey expect from government. I often say that the key to my success is ruthless competence. And so we got it done in the campaign. We put together just the biggest, I think most professional campaign, the state has seen, and we saw great results last night. Martínez:  My colleague Leila Fadel  asked Virginia's governor-elect, Abigail Spanberger , if her win was more of an endorsement of her policies or more of a push back to President Trump. So that same question now to you. Sherrill:  I think what this shows is that people in this state really want leadership. They look to my background in the military. They also want somebody who gets it and gets them. And I think in that case, they look to the fact that I'm a mom of four kids and I know what's been going on in our communities and our schools, and they wanted somebody to address those key issues. While at the same time, the fact that a lot of the affordability issues and the problems there stem from Trump's administration. So I heard as I went and spoke to thousands of people about the tariffs, how they were putting people out of business or larger businesses were laying people off. I heard about fears from the One Big Beautiful Bill and how people were going to afford to have health care. And then most recently, when Trump said he was going to terminate the Gateway Tunnel Project — thousands of New Jerseyans spoke to me about how important that was to not just their quality of life, but their hopes for opportunity and jobs. So again and again, the focus on affordability, on people's lives, on their kids' future really intersects with the attacks on the economy coming from Trump's administration. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Martínez:  Are there any places at all where you might find common ground with President Trump? Sherrill:  We have a lot of big events coming up here in New Jersey where we will really be showcasing kind of the center of what we're showcasing about America. That's both the nation's 250th birthday anniversary. And most people know that the majority of the Revolutionary War took place in New Jersey. George Washington spent more time in Jersey than anywhere else. And some major turning point battles are here. So that's a huge event coming up. We have the FIFA World Cup, the biggest sporting event in the world. The final will be here in New Jersey. So all of that's coming into the state. It's a great opportunity to both showcase our country as well as, I think, some really good economic opportunities. And hopefully the administration will be a good partner in that endeavor. Martínez:  Now, you've made the rising cost of living a top issue. And New York City is right across the Hudson River from New Jersey. When it comes to housing affordability, how do you see yourself possibly working with its new mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani? Sherrill:  You know, we're not going to solve New York's housing shortage, but what we can do here in New Jersey is really work to expand housing opportunities. Martínez:  People go from New Jersey to New York all the time. That's why I'm asking. Sherrill:  Right. But what we're seeing is a real influx of New Yorkers into places like Jersey City, Hoboken — and we'll continue to provide great opportunities for people. We'll continue to build our businesses here. But really what we have to do is across the state, look to some of our opportunities and transit-oriented development business opportunities in the southern part of our state, transit across the state. Although again with the Gateway Tunnel Project, that's going to be a key investment that we need from the federal government. And then when it comes to working with Mayor-elect Mamdani or [New York Gov. Kathy] Hochul, I will be working to get, you know, get in to ensure that we have resources here in New Jersey, that we're working together to make sure, for example, the FIFA World Cup goes off really well. I think we'll have a lot going on in Liberty around the Statue of Liberty in our harbor. So we'll work closely with New York to make sure we run this safely, securely, and we have the economic benefits of it here. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Martínez:  What are your thoughts on these two significant wins [in Virginia and New Jersey] across the mid-Atlantic region? Sherrill:  I think it's building back that juggernaut of a Democratic coalition — working people, the Black and Latino communities — these are communities that want to see great government. They want to see great schools, great job opportunities. And that's what Democrats have traditionally focused on when we build out a juggernaut of a campaign and a good, effective government. And that's what I intend to do.

In New Jersey, voters picked Mikie Sherrill. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKIE SHERRILL: We're not going to give in to our darker impulses. Here in New Jersey, we know that this nation has not ever been, nor will it ever be, ruled by kings. (CHEERING) MARTÍNEZ: Sherrill's win marked the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row. She beat her Trump-endorsed Republican opponent by 13 percentage points, according to the latest polls. Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill is on the line, and she has not slept much. So I think, Governor-elect, we'll give you some slack if you're feeling a little drowsy this morning. SHERRILL: (Laughter). MARTÍNEZ: But congratulations on your win. How do you feel? I mentioned it's been six decades since New Jersey elected a governor from the same party three times in a row. How does that make you feel? SHERRILL: It makes me feel pretty great. And I'll tell you, after speaking to thousands and thousands of New Jerseyans about just what it was going to take for them, for their families to succeed, and then really executing the campaign focused on declaring a state of emergency on utility costs on Day 1, expanding first-time homebuyers' credits to get people a foot in the door to homes or really handling the crisis that's going on in our health care system, I - just relentlessly focusing on the people that I was stepping up to serve, I think, had huge gains. I think that's what people here in New Jersey expect from governent (ph) - government. I often say that the key to my success is ruthless competence. And so we got it done in the campaign. We put together just the biggest, I think, most professional campaign the state's seen. And we saw great results last night, and it feels good. MARTÍNEZ: Ruthless competence is better than, I guess, nice incompetence, I suppose - right? - if that's the opposite. SHERRILL: (Laughter). MARTÍNEZ: Earlier in the show, Governor-elect, I - my colleague Leila Fadel asked Virginia's Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger if her win was more of an endorsement of her policies or more of a pushback to President Trump. So that same question now to you. SHERRILL: I think what this shows is that people in this state really want leadership. They look to my background in the military. They also want somebody who gets it and gets them. And I think in that case, they look to the fact that I'm a mom of four kids and I know what's been going on in our communities, in our schools. And they wanted somebody to address those key issues while, at the same time, the fact that a lot of the affordability issues and the problems there stem from Trump's administration. So I heard as I went and spoke to thousands of people about the tariffs, how they were putting people out of business or larger businesses were laying people off. I heard about fears from the One Big Beautiful Bill and how people were going to afford to have health care. And then most recently, when Trump said he was going to terminate the Gateway tunnel project - oh, my gosh - you know, thousands of New Jerseyans spoke to me about how important that was to not just their quality of life, but their hopes for opportunity and jobs. So again and again, the focus on affordability, on people's lives, on their kids' future really intersects with the attacks on the economy coming from Trump's administration. MARTÍNEZ: Are there any places at all where you might find common ground with President Trump? SHERRILL: We have a lot of big events coming up here in New Jersey, where we will really be showcasing kind of the center of what we're showcasing about America. That's both the nation's 250th birthday, anniversary, and most people know that the majority of the Revolutionary War took place in New Jersey.

We have the FIFA World Cup, the biggest sporting event in the world. The final will be here in New Jersey. So all of that's coming into the state.

But what we can do here in New Jersey is really work to expand... MARTÍNEZ: Well... SHERRILL: ...Housing opportunities. MARTÍNEZ: ...People go from New Jersey to New York all the time, though. That's why I'm asking because, you know, people move around from those two places all the time. SHERRILL: Right. But what we're seeing is a real influx of New Yorkers into a lot of our - you know, places like Jersey City, Hoboken. And that is going to continue to be - you know, we'll continue to provide great opportunities for people. We'll continue to build out businesses here. But really, what we have to do is, across the state, look to some of our opportunities in transit-oriented development, business opportunities in the southern part of our state, transit across the state.

I think we'll have a lot going on in Liberty - you know, around the Statue of Liberty in our harbor. So we'll work closely with New York to make sure we run this safely, securely, and we have the economic benefits of it here. MARTÍNEZ: As I mentioned earlier, we had your former roommate on earlier this morning, Abigail Spanberger, who won the other gubernatorial race in Virginia - first woman in that role in Virginia. Have you spoken with her at all in the hours since these elections? SHERRILL: You know, it's funny. I spoke to her yesterday morning as we were going into Election Day, and then we've been texting back and forth. But I called her when, I think, she was on the stage. I think she called me back when I was on the stage giving my acceptance speech. So we haven't actually caught up on the phone, just via text. MARTÍNEZ: Via text? OK. That's - I guess that's fine. Phone calls are so 1980s, I think, right? I think just... SHERRILL: (Laughter) We'll get to it. MARTÍNEZ: ...Texting each other is the best way. Yeah. SHERRILL: But it just might be a minute. MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. Really quick, what are your thoughts on these two significant wins across the mid-Atlantic region? SHERRILL: I think it's - you know what it is? It's building back that juggernaut of a Democratic coalition - working people, the Black and Latino communities. These are communities that want to see great government. They want to see great schools, great job opportunities. And that's what Democrats have traditionally focused on when we build out kind of a juggernaut of a campaign and a good effective government, and that's what I intend to do. MARTÍNEZ: That's New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill. Thanks a lot. SHERRILL: Thank you.

 Updated Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 11:10 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         SAN FRANCISCO — California voters have easily approved a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional map to favor Democrats, according to a race call by The Associated Press, marking the party's biggest victory to date in a national battle over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms. The measure, called Proposition 50, will replace lines drawn by an independent commission with a map that could net Democrats as many as five new seats in next year's U.S. House elections. The AP called the race just as polls closed in California. The result caps a strong election night for Democrats, who also pocketed notable wins in  Virginia  and  New Jersey . In an abbreviated campaign that saturated California's airwaves with ads, Gov. Gavin Newsom convinced voters that the state needed to draw new maps to counteract gerrymandering done at President Trump's behest in Republican-led states such as Texas. In  Texas ,  Missouri  and  North Carolina , the new GOP-friendly maps were enacted after approval by the state legislature. But in California, Newsom and Democratic allies needed to win approval from voters for the new political lines, because voters had given congressional line-drawing power to an independent citizens commission in 2010. The commission remains popular in California, but Newsom was able to  amplify the partisan stakes  of the campaign, arguing that California could not stand by and watch Republicans bake in a sizable advantage through redistricting ahead of midterm elections that will decide control of power in a closely divided House of Representatives. The results, said California political strategist Erica Kwiatkowski Nielsen, \"shows a huge appetite and just the willingness of Californians to stand up to Donald Trump.\" \"I think the campaign did a fantastic job of saying and acknowledging people's fears that, hey, we've been a leader in California on redistricting but this isn't politics as usual,\" Nielsen said. \"These are unprecedented times.\" Newsom's \"Yes\" side wins the money battle Newsom, who has positioned himself as a primary foil to Trump, amassed a war chest to support the measure — bringing in nearly $120 million as of Friday. Top donors included House Majority PAC, a group working to elect Democrats to the House, and George Soros' Fund for Policy Reform. The Yes campaign blanketed the state with ads featuring top Democrats, from former President Barack Obama to New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Polling in the last week of the campaign  showed more than 90% of Democrats supporting the measure and more than 90% of Republicans opposed. That didn't bode well for opponents of Proposition 50, given Democrats' strong registration advantage in the state. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The campaign against Proposition 50 was led by Charles Munger Jr., a Bay Area donor who bankrolled the original campaign to create the citizens redistricting commission in 2008. Munger contributed nearly $33 million to the No on 50 campaign — but his donations accounted for roughly three-quarters of the $44 million raised by opponents. Other Republican heavyweights stayed away from the campaign and spending against Proposition 50 dried up in the final weeks of the race, as polling showed the measure opening up a wide lead. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former California Republican governor who worked with Munger to create the citizens commission, played a restrained role in the campaign — voicing his opposition to Proposition 50 in just a handful of interviews and public appearances. The changes to the state's congressional map are sure to trigger a series of difficult decisions for Republican incumbents in the coming weeks. U.S. Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley and Doug LaMalfa will have to weigh running in districts where chances of reelection range from challenging to virtually impossible. The new lines approved under Proposition 50 will remain in place through the 2030 election, after which the citizens commission would again take over redistricting responsibilities. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5598279","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"14:28:00Z","title":"Worsening listeria outbreak tied to pasta products kills 6, hospitalizes 25","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A worsening listeria outbreak linked to prepared pasta meals, including chicken fettuccine Alfredo sold under brands like Home Chef and Marketside at retailers such as Kroger, Walmart, and Trader Joe's, has resulted in 6 deaths and 27 illnesses, with all but two cases requiring hospitalization.

hospitalizes 25 \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 2:28 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A deadly listeria outbreak connected to prepared pasta meals sold at grocery chains nationwide is worsening, federal health officials say. As of late October, the outbreak has killed six people and sickened 27, all but two of whom were hospitalized,  according to last week's update  from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). One of those affected was a pregnant mother, resulting in a fetal loss. Cases have been reported in 18 states: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Since the last CDC case count update on September 25, 2025, a total of 7 new illnesses from 3 states have been reported, with 2 additional deaths reported,\" the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said . That list has grown in recent months. The outbreak started in June, when listeria concerns prompted recalls of several brands of ready-to-eat chicken  fettuccine Alfredo meals made by FreshRealm Inc. and sold under the Home Chef brand at Kroger and the Marketside brand at Walmart. In response, FreshRealm began testing some of its pasta samples — and in mid-September, they came back positive for listeria. Further genetic testing confirmed it was the same strain of listeria that was detected in FreshRealm's previously recalled chicken Alfredo meal, the FDA said at the time. That discovery prompted the recall of two more products with specific use-by dates in late September and early October: Marketside Linguine With Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce, sold at Walmart, and Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo. They shared a pasta supplier, Nate's Fine Foods. The company supplies precooked pasta and grains to the wholesale food service and restaurant industries, according to its website. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In late September, Nate's further expanded its recall to include other batches of precooked pasta \"including fettucine, linguine, and farfalle (bowtie), after a sample of linguine pasta collected and tested by FreshRealm tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes,\"  the FDA said . Early October  saw the recalls  of several more pre-made pasta salads and heat-and-eat noodle dishes sold at Trader Joe's, Albertsons, Kroger, Walmart, Giant Eagle and Sprouts locations across the country. In a late  September statement , Nate's said it was recalling the products out of an \"abundance of caution\" and apologized for any concern it had caused. \"Our top priority is ensuring the safety of the people who enjoy our products, and we will continue to take all appropriate steps until this matter is resolved,\" it said, adding that it is working closely with the CDC, FDA and state health officials to identify the source. The  FDA says  it is working with Nate's to determine if additional recalls are needed. Health officials say customers who purchased any of these meals should throw them away, and clean their refrigerators, containers and any surfaces that may have come into contact with the food. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At this point, the products that were recalled between June and October are more likely to be in customers' fridges and freezers than on store shelves. Most of them had use-by dates earlier than Oct. 10. The  recalled product  with the longest shelf life is a frozen meal, Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Bowls. Those dishes, which were distributed to wholesale distributors and operators nationwide, have best-by dates in March 2027. A spokesperson for the company told NPR that retailers have removed the product from their shelves. What to know — and do — about listeria Listeria infection, or listeriosis, is most likely to sicken pregnant people and newborns, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems. Pregnant people may only experience mild symptoms like fever, fatigue and muscle aches, but should be aware that listeria could cause miscarriages, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of their newborn. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal issues, stiff neck, confusion and loss of balance. They usually start within two weeks of eating contaminated food but could start as soon as the same day or as late as 10 weeks later, the CDC says. It can be hard to confirm the scope of an outbreak, since some people recover from the infection without medical care. For those who do require medical attention, the CDC says it usually takes three to four weeks to determine whether their illness is part of an outbreak. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The CDC says it has interviewed 13 of the people who got sick as of late September. Seven of them reported eating precooked meals before their illness started, and four specifically mentioned eating chicken fettuccine Alfredo. The CDC and FDA say consumers should contact their health care provider to report any symptoms of listeriosis and receive care. They can also report any adverse health effects  to the FDA online . The U.S. has seen a number of listeria outbreaks in the past year. A 2024 outbreak tied to deli meat left 10 people dead and dozens more hospitalized across the country. A U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in January blamed \" inadequate sanitation practices \" at a since-closed Boar's Head facility in Virginia and listed  several steps  it would take to better protect the public from listeria. In February, nearly two million  baked goods  — including some donuts sold at Dunkin' — were recalled over listeria concerns. That same month,  frozen shakes  sold to nursing homes and long-term care facilities were recalled in connection with a listeria outbreak dating back to 2018. The  FDA says  that outbreak sickened 42 people and killed 14 — across 21 states — before authorities declared it over in May. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1199885811","dateOfPublication":"2025-08-13","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00-04:00","title":"8 Essential Conversations to Have with Your Aging Parents","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article, written by Marielle Segarra and Margaret Cirino and updated in 2025, encourages families to have essential conversations with aging parents about finances, end-of-life plans, and long-term care.

      \n           Updated Wednesday, August 13, 2025 • 2:00 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on Sept. 25, 2023, and has been updated.  Cameron Huddleston was 35 when her mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  Trying to ask her mom about her financial situation and end-of-life plans while she was showing signs of memory loss was a challenge. \"When there's an emergency, it's a lot harder to have a rational conversation,\" she says. \"Your emotions are all over the place.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That's why Huddleston, a financial journalist, wants people to start talking to their parents about these topics early. Ask them about their plans for retirement, how they will pay for health care if they get sick, and what will happen to their property when they die. She  covers these subjects in her 2019 book ,  Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk: How to Have Essential Conversations with Your Parents About Their Finances .  Huddleston explains how to broach this conversation with your parents — and which documents and plans they should have in place.  1. Get a sense of your parents' end-of-life plans Your parents might be hesitant to open up about their finances with you. For a long time,  you  were the child — and  they  were your caregivers. So Huddleston recommends asking them for advice as a way into the conversation. Start with a question like: I just had my first child. Should I set up a will? Or, I just started a new job. Should I be taking advantage of a workplace retirement plan?  \"Their answers are going to give you clues about what sort of planning\" they might have done in their own lives, she says. For example, if they say yes, you should draft up a will, that's a good sign — it's likely they have that document written for themselves.  On the other hand, if they say nope, don't worry about a 401K, that's a red flag. It might make you wonder whether they've prioritized saving for retirement. So you might probe a bit deeper (and get them thinking about the topic) by saying \"maybe this is something we could look into together,\" says Huddleston.  You could also share a cautionary tale about a friend who's had to get involved with their parents' finances, says Huddleston. Maybe your friend's parent passed away without a will in place, and the family had to go to court. When you tell the story, she adds, you might say, \"I hope we can avoid that.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Assess whether they're able to handle their affairs  If your parents are experiencing cognitive decline, there may be big changes in their spending habits, says Huddleston. So be on the lookout for choices that don't make sense to you — for example, lapses in bill payments or sudden, big-ticket purchases.  If that's the case, encourage your parents to get a health checkup, she adds. If a medical condition is compromising their decision-making, you'll need a power of attorney and a living will to make financial and medical decisions on their behalf – which we'll get into next. 3. Make sure they have a will to distribute their assets...  This is the most important item on the list, says Huddleston. A will is a legal document that states how a person wishes to distribute their assets after their death. Keep it somewhere safe. Then when a parent dies, you'll need to submit it to the court, along with a death certificate, in order for their assets to be distributed.   If a parent doesn't have a will, state law will determine who gets what. \"A lot of people don't realize this. They think, 'my family can just work it out,' \" she says. But having to go through the court system to handle a parent's assets is the last thing you'll want to do after a death, says Huddleston.   4. ... and a power of attorney  In the event that your parents become unable to make financial and legal decisions for themselves, they will need a power of attorney. It's a legal document that allows another individual to step in and manage that person's finances during their lifetime. That includes everything from handling their bank accounts and property to doing their taxes or even filing a lawsuit on their behalf. This form is crucial for anyone showing signs of cognitive decline, says Huddleston.  You can find free, state-specific power of attorney forms online. Notarize it and keep the form in a safe place until you need it.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       5. Outline their medical wishes in a living will  Unlike a will, which deals with a person's assets, a living will communicates a person's wishes in terms of medical treatment in the event that they're not able to make those decisions themselves.  For example, if a parent should suffer from severe and irreversible brain damage, would they want any treatments to help prolong their life? If so, for how long? Huddleston says you don't want to be in the difficult situation of having to act on a parent's behalf without knowing what they want. \"You don't want to have to be the one deciding whether to keep them on life support.\" 6. Prepare for long-term care There may come a time when your parents may not be able to perform everyday tasks like bathing, cooking, cleaning or taking their medications. So they may need extra help at home from a caretaker, they may need to go to an adult daycare or live in an assisted living facility.  But this long-term care, as these services are called, can be expensive. The AARP has a  long-term care cost calculator  that you can use to find the costs of a caretaker, adult daycare, nursing home and other types of care in your area. Ten hours of assistance from a home health aide in Lakewood, Calif., for example, costs about $2,666. And assisted living costs about $5,250 a month.  A long-term care insurance policy can help soften that blow, says Huddleston. It works much like home or auto insurance. You pay premiums and make claims if you ever need covered services – like adult daycare or a room in a nursing home.  She recommends that people start investing in them when they're in their 50s or early 60s, as the premiums grow as you get older. \"These are not cheap, but they're a heck of a lot cheaper than the monthly cost of assisted living or bringing [a caretaker] into the home,\" she adds.  If you're unsure what kind of long-term care your parents can afford, consult a financial planner. You might think that financial planners are only for the wealthy, \"but that's not true,\" says Huddleston. \"Your parents can just meet a few times to have someone look over their financial situation, give them a few suggestions and create a plan for them.\"  7. Get access to their passwords  If there's an emergency and you need to log into a parent's bank account or contact their doctors through their medical portal, you don't want to waste time hunting down their usernames and passwords, says Huddleston. So ask your parents to make a list of relevant passwords, store it somewhere safe — like a password manager — and tell you how to access it.  8. Reassure them If you're struggling to get your parents to talk to you about their finances and their plans as they age, reassure them that you're looking out for their best interests. By setting up these documents and coming up with a long-term care plan, \"you can help them in the way that they want to be helped,\" says Huddleston.  Remind them: \"I respect your independence and I want to help you remain independent for as long as possible. But to do that, we need to have some plans.\" This episode of Life Kit was produced by Margaret Cirino and edited by Sylvie Douglis. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

2025-11-05T09:42:08+00:00\n\nBERLIN (AP) — The German government on Wednesday banned a Muslim group over accusations of violating human rights and the country’s democratic values, and conducted raids against two other Muslim groups. The Interior Ministry said Muslim Interaktiv represented a threat to the country’s constitutional order by promoting antisemitism and discrimination against women and sexual minorities . Several hundred police officers searched seven premises in the northern city of Hamburg linked to Muslim Interaktiv, as well as 12 other premises in Berlin and the central German state of Hesse in connection with two other Muslim groups — Generation Islam and Reality Islam. The authorities in Hamburg confiscated assets including cash, data stored on computers, and handwritten notes. Muslim Interaktiv’s websites were also shut down and the group is banned from continuing its activities and from actively displaying any symbols of Muslim Interaktiv. Muslim Interaktiv is known for a savvy online presence used to appeal especially to young Muslims who may feel alienated or discriminated against in Germany’s Christian majority society.

Germany has in recent years been acting more forcefully against extremism, and banned several extremist groups — including several far-right and Muslim organizations . The latest crackdown comes after a spate of attacks by Muslim extremists and far-right groups plotting to overturn the country’s order . The Interior Ministry said Muslim Interaktiv “is particularly opposed to gender equality and freedom of sexual orientation and gender identity.” “This expresses an intolerance that is incompatible with democracy and human rights,” it added. The government said Muslim Interaktiv sought to indoctrinate as many people as possible to “create permanent enemies of the constitution in order to continuously undermine the constitutional order.” Andy Grote, the interior state minister of Hamburg, where the group was especially active, applauded the ban and called it a blow against “modern TikTok Islamism,” according to German news agency dpa. In a recent report, the domestic intelligence service of Hamburg said Muslim Interaktiv’s leaders used online posts and videos to address socially relevant topics in order to exploit them “to portray a supposedly ongoing attitude of rejection by politics and society in Germany towards the entire Muslim community,” dpa reported.

Pennsylvania \n         By Stephen Fowler \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 11:55 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         ATLANTA — Democrats flipped two seats on Georgia's statewide Public Service Commission by wide margins, one of many surprise victories for the party Tuesday up and down the ballot in the handful of races across the country. Polling shows the Democratic Party is historically unpopular, but at polling places this year voters have helped the party overperform in elections against the backdrop of President Trump's even less popular policies. Beyond the  blowout victories  in the New Jersey and Virginia governors' races, Zohran Mamdani winning a majority of votes in New York City's mayoral election and California voters approving a plan to temporarily redraw the state's congressional districts to add Democrat-leaning districts, the party continued its trend of electoral success in the 2025 general election. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Here are some other notable election results around the country: In Georgia, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson will be the newest members of the state's  five-person public utility regulator  after earning roughly 60% of the vote. It's the first time Democrats have won a nonfederal statewide office there since 2006 and one where soaring energy costs and displeasure with incumbents dominated the race. Pennsylvania voters  chose to retain three state Supreme Court judges  that were first elected as Democrats after millions of dollars in outside spending driven by  conservative billionaire Jeff Yass ' efforts to reshape the state court's politics. Democrats also won special elections for a seat on Pennsylvania's Superior Court and a seat on its Commonwealth Court. Also in Pennsylvania, Democrats swept the top \"row offices\" in the purple-hued Bucks County, electing the county's  first-ever Democratic district attorney  and defeating an incumbent Republican sheriff a year after Trump narrowly won there. Democrats similarly notched commanding victories in county executive races in Erie, Lehigh and Northampton counties, all bellwether counties in recent presidential elections. At the state legislative level, Mississippi Democrats have broken a GOP supermajority in the state Senate after flipping two seats in that chamber plus another pickup in the state House. A federal court ordered lawmakers to redraw 14 total House and Senate districts after finding the maps drawn in 2022 discriminated against Black voters.  Democrats have also  vastly expanded their control  of the Virginia House of Delegates and in New Jersey's General Assembly, the party gained a supermajority. In many local races across the country, Democrats touted victories that will reshape their communities, like the flipping of all three city council seats in Georgetown, S.C., the unseating of the last remaining Republican city council member in Orlando, Fla., and  winning back mayoral races in Connecticut . For the first time in a half-century, Democrats control the  Onondaga County legislature  that includes Syracuse, N.Y. Democrats saw a  city council seat in Charlotte, N.C. , switch parties for the first time since 1999.  Democrats across the ideological spectrum won, too. Beyond Mamdani's victory in New York City, the Democratic Socialists of America touted municipal wins for members in Detroit, Atlanta and Cambridge, Mass., among others. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin previously predicted in an interview with NPR that the party's success in special elections in 2025 — where the party has overperformed prior margins by an average of about 14% — would continue into the midterm cycle. \"The important thing to remember is midterm elections are not a referendum on a party that's not in power,\"  Martin said . \"So our numbers really don't matter here. Donald Trump is at an all-time low in terms of his favorability and his approval numbers… the Republican Party is as well.\" Tuesday's results also show that the economy and affordability continue to be top of mind for voters, and voters have registered their displeasure with Trump and congressional Republicans' agenda on that front. \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Nov. 5th, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story said Democrats won a supermajority in both Virginia's House of Delegates and New Jersey's General Assembly.

The award, called the FIFA Peace Prize, will “recognize exceptional actions for peace,” soccer’s governing body said Wednesday. But FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who has a close relationship with President Donald Trump , would not tip his hand Wednesday when asked if Trump will be the first recipient of the award. “On the 5th of December, you will see,” Infantino said. He was speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami, shortly after Trump addressed the same event. Infantino said earlier Wednesday that, “in an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it’s fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace.” FIFA said the award, which Infantino will present this year, will be bestowed annually “on behalf of fans from all around the world.” Trump was passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize last month despite lobbying from fellow Republicans, various world leaders and himself. And Infantino made no secret of the ties between himself, FIFA and Trump in his remarks Wednesday.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it would reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 “high-volume” markets beginning Friday morning to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers exhibit signs of strain during the ongoing government shutdown . The cutback stands to impact thousands of flights nationwide because the FAA directs more than 44,000 flights daily, including commercial passenger flights, cargo planes and private aircraft. The head of the FAA didn’t immediately identify which airports will be affected but said the restrictions would remain in place as long as necessary. Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid since the shutdown began Oct. 1, and most have been on duty six days a week while putting in mandatory overtime. With some calling out of work due to frustration, taking second jobs or not having money for child care or gas, staffing shortages during some shifts have led to flight delays at a number of U.S. airports. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, citing growing staffing pressures and safety reports indicating growing fatigue among air traffic controllers, said he and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy did not want to wait until the situation reached a crisis point.

If the pressures continue to build even after we take these measures, we’ll come back and take additional measures.” He and Duffy said they would meet with airline executives later Wednesday to determine how to implement the reduction in flights. Bedford said a list of the selected airports would be released sometime Thursday. Airlines and passengers wait for information The Associated Press on Wednesday sent requests for comment on the FAA’s decision to major U.S. airlines, including Delta, United and American Airlines. Calls to the customer service hotlines at United and American got answered within a few minutes Wednesday afternoon, anxious passengers were not swamping the airlines with questions about the status of their upcoming flights. Southwest Airlines said it was evaluating potential impacts to its flight schedule and would reach out as soon as possible to customers whose travel plans may be impacted. “We continue to urge Congress to immediately resolve its impasse and restore the National Airspace System to its full capacity,” the carrier said. AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said some travelers were adjusting their plans and considering driving to their destinations, but that’s not an option for everyone. She advised people with booked flights to try to stay informed by downloading their airline’s app and watching it for updates, or checking airport websites for the latest information. Diaz recommended allowing plenty of time at the airport before a scheduled flight. “It’s frustrating for travelers because there’s not much you can do. At the end of the day, you either fly or you don’t,” she said. “You go on your trip and you roll the dice and you show up at the airport, or you choose to drive. So you don’t have that many options.” Data shows worsening weekend staffing The FAA regularly slows down or stops flights from taking off toward an airport due to weather conditions, equipment failures and technical problems. Staffing shortages also may lead to slowed or halted departures if other personnel can’t fill in or another facility can’t absorb some of the work load. Last weekend saw some of the worst staffing shortages of the shutdown, which became the longest on record early Wednesday . From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 different air traffic control facilities announced there was some potential for limited staffing, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans sent through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center system. The figure, which is likely an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown During weekend periods from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, the average number of airport towers, regional centers that oversee multiple airports and facilities that monitor traffic at higher altitudes announced the potential for staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis. But during the five weekend periods since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the average more than tripled to 26.2 facilities. Travel industry joins unions in urging shutdown’s end Major airlines, aviation unions and the wider travel industry have urged Congress to end the shutdown. Wednesday’s announcement came on the heels of Duffy warning a day earlier that there could be chaos in the skies next week if the shutdown drags on long enough for air traffic controllers to miss their second full paychecks next Tuesday. Duffy said the FAA wanted to take a proactive approach instead of reacting after a disaster. He pointed to all the questions that arose after the deadly mid-air collision in January between a commercial jet and a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport about why FAA didn’t recognize the risks and act sooner. “We learned from that. And so now we look at data, and before it would become an issue, we try to assess the pressure and try to make moves before there could be adverse consequences,” Duffy said. “And that’s what’s happening here today.” ___ Associated Press journalist Christopher L.

(AP) — A UPS cargo plane crashed and exploded in a massive fireball Tuesday while taking off from the company’s global aviation hub in Louisville, Kentucky, killing at least seven people and injuring 11, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said the plane crashed about 5:15 p.m. as it was departing for Honolulu from Louisville’s Muhammad Ali International Airport. The plane crashed about 5:15 p.m. as it was departing for Honolulu from UPS Worldport at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. Video showed flames on the plane’s left wing and a trail of smoke. The plane then lifted slightly off the ground before crashing and exploding in a huge fireball. Video also revealed portions of a building’s shredded roof next to the end of the runway. The death toll had risen to at least seven Tuesday night, and four of those killed were not on the plane, officials said. Among the 11 who were hurt, some had “very significant” injuries, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said. “Anybody who has seen the images, the video, knows how violent this crash is,” he said. Beshear said he didn’t know the status of the three crew members aboard the plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 made in 1991. AP AUDIO: At least 3 dead, 11 injured in UPS plane crash in Kentucky and governor says numbers likely to grow At a news conference, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear says several businesses were struck when a UPS cargo plane crashed and exploded Tuesday. UPS’s largest package handling facility is in Louisville and the company announced Tuesday night that it had halted package sorting at the center and didn’t say when it would resume.

She had been at a metal recycling business near the explosion and wasn’t answering her phone, he told the AP. Her phone’s live location said she was still there. Bobby Whelan, Richardson’s friend had been in front of her in line, but had left minutes before the explosion. He said he was about a quarter mile down the road when he heard what sounded like a bomb exploding. “We don’t even want to think about anything but the best,” Whelan said. “All our friends were there.” A UPS plane crashed on takeoff from the airport in Louisville, Kentucky, igniting a huge fire on ground, officials said Tuesday. A video taken by Leirim Rodríguez shows several massive balls of flames exploding into the sky in a row, followed by large billowing clouds of black smoke. Tom Brooks Jr., who runs a metal recycling business down the street, said the unbelievable magnitude of the crash “just rocked the whole place.” “This was massive. I mean, it literally looked like a war zone,” he said. Destyn Mitchell said she was working as a host at an Outback restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from the crash, when she heard a loud boom. About 20 people were in the restaurant. “The mood in the restaurant was very shaken up,” Mitchell said. “Everyone is really concerned. People who just sat down to eat got up and left in under 30 minutes and packed up their food because they wanted to hurry up and get home.” Pablo Rojas, an aviation attorney, said that based on the videos it looked like the aircraft was struggling to gain altitude as a fire blazed on its left side around one of its engines. Given the large amount of fuel it was carrying, once the fire started in that area, it would’ve been only a matter of time before there was an explosion or the fire grew rapidly. “Really the plane itself is almost acting like a bomb because of the amount of fuel,” he said. The Louisville airport is only a 10-minute drive from the city’s downtown, which sits on the Ohio River bordering the Indiana state line. There are residential areas, a water park and museums in the area. ___ Golden reported from Seattle.

elected mayor of New York on Tuesday, capping a stunning ascent for the 34-year-old, far-left state lawmaker, who promised to transform city government to restore power to the working class and fight back against a hostile Trump administration. In a victory for the Democratic party’s progressive wing , Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa . Mamdani must now navigate the unending demands of America’s biggest city and deliver on ambitious — skeptics say unrealistic — campaign promises. With his commanding win, the democratic socialist will etch his place in history as the city’s first Muslim mayor , the first of South Asian heritage and the first born in Africa. He will also become New York’s youngest mayor in more than a century when he takes office on Jan. 1. Zohran Mamdani votes on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in New York.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “The conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate. I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this,” Mamdani declared to a roaring crowd at his victory party. He cast his win as a boon for blue-collar workers struggling to get by. “New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change,” he said, vowing to ”wake up each morning with a singular purpose: To make this city better for you than it was the day before.” More than 2 million New Yorkers cast ballots in the contest, the largest turnout in a mayoral race in more than 50 years, according to the city’s Board of Elections. With roughly 90% of the votes counted, Mamdani held an approximately 9 percentage point lead over Cuomo. Mamdani’s unlikely rise gives credence to Democrats who have urged the party to embrace more progressive candidates instead of rallying behind centrists in hopes of winning back swing voters who have abandoned the party. He has already faced scrutiny from national Republicans, including President Donald Trump , who have eagerly cast him as a threat and the face of a more radical Democratic Party that is out of step with mainstream America. Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut federal funding to the city — and even take it over — if Mamdani won. A commanding win At his victory party in Brooklyn, Mamdani supporters cheered and embraced, some tearfully, after The Associated Press called the race. Campaign posters flew through the air, as one person hoisted the official flag of New York City and Bad Bunny played from the speakers. The mood was far more muted at Cuomo’s party at a midtown Manhattan theater. In his concession speech, a defiant Cuomo called his campaign “a caution flag that we are headed down a dangerous, dangerous road” and noted that “almost half of New Yorkers did not vote to support a government agenda that makes promises that we know cannot be met.” Still, he corrected his supporters when they began to boo at the mention of Mamdani’s name. “No, that is not right,” he said, offering to help the incoming mayor in any way. “Tonight was their night.” Mamdani’s grassroots campaign centered on affordability, and his charisma spoiled Cuomo’s attempted political comeback. The former governor, who resigned four years ago following allegations of sexual harassment that he continues to deny, was dogged by his past throughout the race and was criticized for running a negative campaign. Mamdani will also have to deal with Trump, who not only threatened retribution against the city but also suggested he might try to arrest and deport Mamdani if he won. Mamdani was born in Uganda , where he spent his early childhood, but was raised in New York City and became a U.S. citizen in 2018. In his speech, Mamdani addressed Trump head on. “New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” he said, adding that, “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.” Trump appeared to acknowledge Mamdani’s challenges, posting ”…AND SO IT BEGINS!” on his Truth Social site.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Mamdani, who was criticized throughout the campaign for his thin resume, will now have to begin staffing his incoming administration and planning how to accomplish the ambitious but polarizing agenda that drove him to victory. Among the campaign’s promises are free child care, free city bus service, city-run grocery stores and a new Department of Community Safety that would send mental health care workers to handle certain emergency calls rather than police officers. It is unclear how Mamdani will pay for such initiatives, given Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s steadfast opposition to his calls to raise taxes on wealthy people. His decisions around the leadership of the New York Police Department will also be closely watched. Mamdani was a fierce critic of the department in 2020, calling for “this rogue agency” to be defunded and slamming it as “racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.” He has since apologized for those comments and has said he will ask the current NYPD commissioner to stay on the job. Mamdani’s campaign was driven by his optimistic view of the city and his promises to improve the quality of life for its middle and lower classes. Cuomo, Sliwa and other critics assailed him over his vehement criticism of Israel ’s military actions in Gaza. Mamdani, a longtime advocate of Palestinian rights, has accused Israel of committing genocide and said he would honor an arrest warrant the International Criminal Court issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Mamdani began his campaign as a relatively obscure state lawmaker, little known even within New York City. Going into the Democratic primary, Cuomo was the presumed favorite, with near-universal name recognition and deep political connections. Cuomo’s chances were buoyed further when incumbent Mayor Eric Adams bowed out of the primary while dealing with the fallout of his now-dismissed federal corruption case . But as the race progressed, Mamdani’s natural charm, catchy social media videos and populist economic platform energized voters in the notoriously expensive city. He also began drawing outside attention as his name recognition grew. Mamdani trounced Cuomo in the primary by about 13 points. The former governor relaunched his campaign as an independent candidate for the general election, vowing to hit the streets with a more energetic approach. However, much of his campaign continued to focus on attacking opponents. In the race’s final stretch, he claimed Mamdani’s election would make Jews feel unsafe. Meanwhile, supporters packed Mamdani’s rallies , and he held whimsical events, including a scavenger hunt and a community soccer tournament. Cuomo also juxtaposed his deep experience in government with Mamdani’s less than five years in the state Legislature. But the former governor also faced his own political baggage, as his opponents dredged up the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation, as well as his decisions during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sliwa, the creator of the Guardian Angels crime patrol group, also had his moments — mostly in the form of funny quips on the debate stage — but had difficulty gaining traction as a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. He conceded the race about a half hour after the polls closed, wishing Mamdani “good luck because if he does well, we do well.” But he also issued a warning: “If you try to implement socialism, if you try to render our police weak and impotent, if you forsake the people’s public safety, we will become the mayor-elect and his supporters’ worst enemies.” ___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Philip Marcelo and Jake Offenhartz contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-sheinbaum-women-harassment-f98a1bdcfe613256a1485164557b7202","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"14:39:52+00:00","title":"Mexico’s First Female President Faces Public Backlash Over Gender Violence Incident","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on a public incident in Mexico City where President Claudia Sheinbaum, the country’s first female president, was groped by a drunk man during a routine walk from the National Palace to the Education Ministry.

2025-11-05T14:39:52+00:00\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) — What should have been a five-minute time-saving walk from Mexico’s National Palace to the Education Ministry for President Claudia Sheinbaum has become a symbol of what Mexican women face every day after a video captured a drunk man groping the country’s first woman president. On Wednesday, gender violence catapulted to the highest-profile platform, and Sheinbaum used her daily press briefing to say that she had pressed charges against the man. She also called on states to scrutinize their laws and procedures to make it easier for women to report such assaults and said Mexicans needed to hear a “loud and clear, no, women’s personal space must not be violated.” Sheinbaum said she felt a responsibility to press charges for all Mexican women. “If this is done to the president, what is going to happen to all of the young women in our country?” Related Stories Hegseth and Rubio share classified details on boat strikes with congressional leaders 5 MIN READ Interpol announces a new global fight against illegal deforestation 2 MIN READ High in Peru’s Andes, villagers carry out centuries-old work of collecting salt, in photos 3 MIN READ Widespread problem Indeed, if Mexico’s president is not exempt from street harassment, then it’s not difficult to imagine what women with hourslong commutes on public transportation are experiencing daily. Andrea González Martínez, 27, who works for Mexican lender Nacional Monte de Piedad, said she has been harassed on public transportation, in one case the man followed her home. “It happens regularly, it happens on public transportation,” she said. “It’s something you experience every day in Mexico.” Her coworker, Carmen Maldonado Castillo, 43, said she has witnessed it. “You can’t walk around free in the street,” she said. Sheinbaum said Wednesday that she had similar experiences of harassment when she was 12 years old and using public transportation to get to school, and understands the problem is widespread. “I decided to press charges because this is something that I experienced as a woman, but that we as women experience in our country,” she said.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Government response The incident immediately raised questions about the president’s security, but Sheinbaum dismissed any suggestion that she would increase her security or change how she interacts with people. She explained that she and her team had decided to walk from the National Palace to the Education Ministry to avoid a 20-minute car ride in city traffic. Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada had announced overnight that the man had been arrested. Brugada used some of Sheinbaum’s own language about being elected Mexico’s first woman president to emphasize that harassment of any woman – in this case Mexico’s most powerful – is an assault on all women. When Sheinbaum was elected, she said that it wasn’t just her coming to power, it was all women. Brugada said that was “not a slogan, it’s a commitment to not look the other way, to not allow misogyny to continue to be veiled in habits, to not accept a single additional humiliation, not another abuse, not a single femicide more.” Hoping for change Lilian Valvuena, 31, said she didn’t think Sheinbaum had really taken violence against women seriously until her firsthand experience yesterday. She hopes that work to better train police to respond will follow. “They have to prepare them,” she said. “They don’t know what protocols to follow.” Marina Reyna, executive director of the Guerrero Association against Violence toward Women, said that watching the video she initially worried that Sheinbaum had minimized the assault, continuing to smile and talk calmly to the man. But she hoped the president’s willingness to talk about it Wednesday would change how such cases are handled, after years of activists highlighting the issue. “You lose confidence in the institutions,” Reyna said. “The people stop going to report it, because when you report it nothing happens.” A World Health Organization report this year revealed that one in three women in the Americas has experienced physical or sexual violence from a partner or by a third party at some point in their lives. In the first seven months of this year cases of femicide in Mexico dropped almost 40%, compared to the same period in 2024, and intentional injuries against women decreased by 11%, according to figures from the Federal Security Secretariat. Reyna indicated that the violence suffered by Mexican women is related to impunity, which she estimated at over 70%, and added that this situation leads women not to report crimes. From 2019 to 2024, only 20% to 30% of women experiencing violence in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Honduras, Peru and Uruguay used state services specifically designed for them, according to a report by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) on femicide in the region. Political scientist Manuel Pérez Aguirre, a researcher at the Seminar on Violence and Peace at the College of Mexico academic center, argued that in the case of the president, there must be a “truly exemplary punishment” that serves as a clear message to sexual aggressors in Mexico. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/redistricting-kansas-midterms-trump-7847d53b34245aead8cac5bf8cd6e12f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"00:38:20+00:00","title":"Kansas Republicans Drop Push to Redraw Congressional Maps Amid National Redistricting Race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Kansas, Republican lawmakers attempted to bypass Governor Laura Kelly and convene a special session to redraw congressional district maps in an effort to gain more favorable conditions for the GOP ahead of the 2026 midterms, driven by President Donald Trump's call for states to redistrict.

(AP) — The Kansas House’s top Republican on Tuesday dropped efforts to force a redraw of U.S. House districts that would have thrust the state into a widening national battle for partisan advantage in the 2026 elections. The announcement by House Speaker Dan Hawkins ended a weekslong push by GOP lawmakers to circumvent Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and call themselves into a special session on redistricting, which would have convened Friday. A session would have targeted four-term U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, the only Democrat in the state’s four-person House delegation. Republicans still could draw a map designed to oust her after the GOP-supermajority Legislature convenes its next regular annual session in January. Indeed, state Senate President Ty Masterson promised immediately after Hawkins’ announcement that redistricting would be “a top priority” early next year. Kansas Republicans were trying to answer President Donald Trump’s call for states to redraw their maps to give the GOP more winnable seats ahead of the 2026 midterms so the party stands a better chance of keeping its slim House majority.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Some GOP critics opposed a mid-decade redistricting, while others feared that changes could make the three other Republican-held districts more competitive for Democrats. “Planning a Special Session is always going to be an uphill battle with multiple agendas, scheduling conflicts and many unseen factors at play,” Hawkins said in a statement. Davids conceded that the fight over a new Kansas map isn’t over. “We’ve won the first round in this fight against gerrymandering,” she said in a statement. Kansas lawmakers haven’t done a mid-decade congressional redistricting since 1965, following federal court rulings requiring congressional and legislative districts to be as nearly equal in population as possible as a matter of fairness to all voters. Most of Davids’ district is in the Kansas City area, dominated by Johnson County, the state’s most populous county. It is highly likely that Republicans would have to split Johnson County between at least two districts to hurt Davids enough for her to lose in 2026 — and that could alienate voters there. Laurel Burchfield, advocacy director for the Mainstream Coalition, which opposes a mid-decade redistricting, said Kansas residents want GOP lawmakers to focus on economic issues and lowering costs for families. “Changing the maps mid-decade to rig the system in their favor is wrong,” Burchfield said in a statement texted to The Associated Press. GOP lawmakers in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina have heeded the president’s call for new maps, creating seven additional Republican seats among them. California countered with an initiative on Tuesday’s ballot to pick up five Democratic seats there. In Maryland, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore announced Tuesday that he has formed a commission to consider mid-cycle redistricting despite the state Senate president saying last week that his chamber would not move forward with redistricting. Democrats hold seven of eight House seats there. In Kansas, it would have been only the second time in the state’s 164-year history that lawmakers bypassed the governor for a special session. The only previous time was in 2021, when Republicans sought to challenge federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates. GOP leaders circulated this year’s petition for weeks. Hawkins’ statement was titled, “Countdown to January 12th,” the date lawmakers open their next annual session. Hawkins said in his statement that most Republicans “wish to have a conversation about redistricting.” GOP lawmakers would still have time to get a new map into law. The state’s candidate filing deadline isn’t until June 1, and the primary election is Aug. 4. Davids has said she expects to challenge a new congressional map in court. She also is considering a run for the U.S. Senate next year against incumbent Republican Roger Marshall if her district is redrawn. “Every option is on the table, including a statewide race,” Davids said during a recent Zoom news conference. ___ Associated Press journalist Brian Witte contributed reporting from Annapolis, Maryland."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"6112-06-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article highlights a range of global events from November 6, 2025, including allegations of electoral manipulation in Ukraine during Russia’s war, legal and accountability issues involving a Palestinian detainee rape case, a fire in Tuzla, Bosnia, a Supreme Court overturning a conviction related to a right-wing leader's presidency, legal challenges to U.S. tariffs under Trump, a motorist convicted of setting fire to his vehicle after killing pedestrians, severe flash floods in a region, inspiration from Zohran Mamdani’s New York City victory in Uganda, and ongoing abductions by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces in el-Fasher.

(AP) — A UPS cargo plane’s left wing caught fire and an engine fell off just before it crashed and exploded after takeoff in Kentucky, a federal official said Wednesday, offering the first investigative details about a disaster that killed at least 12 people, including a child. First responders, meanwhile, searched for more victims, a day after the crash at UPS Worldport, the company’s global aviation hub in Louisville , though Gov. Andy Beshear said finding survivors seemed unlikely. The inferno consumed the enormous aircraft and spread to nearby businesses. After being cleared for takeoff, a large fire developed in the left wing, said Todd Inman, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation. The plane gained enough altitude to clear the fence at the end of the runway before crashing just outside Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, Inman told reporters. Airport security video “shows the left engine detaching from the wing during the takeoff roll,” he said. The cockpit voice recorder and data recorder were recovered, and the engine was discovered on the airfield, Inman said. “There are a lot of different parts of this airplane in a lot of different places,” he said, describing a debris field that stretched for half a mile. A chain reaction The plane with three people aboard crashed about 5:15 p.m. Tuesday as it was departing for Honolulu from UPS Worldport at the Louisville airport. The crash had a devastating ripple effect, striking and causing smaller explosions at Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and hitting an auto salvage yard, Grade A Auto Parts. Beshear said the child who died was with a parent at the parts business. Beshear earlier said it was a “blessing” that the plane did not hit a nearby Ford Motor factory or the convention center.

Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky., praised firefighters who rushed headfirst to the disaster scene, describing it as “hotter than hell and raining down oil.” Some people who heard the boom, saw the smoke and smelled burning fuel were still stunned a day later. “I didn’t know if we were getting attacked. I didn’t know what was going on,” said Summer Dickerson, who works nearby. The number of victims is unclear Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg announced on the social platform X on Wednesday evening that the death toll had risen to 12, saying, “Please take a moment to hug your loved ones and check on your neighbors.” The governor predicted that the death toll would rise, saying authorities were looking for a “handful of other people” but “we do not expect to find anyone else alive.” Mark Little, chief of the Okolona Fire District in Louisville, said debris would have to be moved and searched, adding: “It will take us quite a while.” University of Louisville Hospital said two people were in critical condition in the burn unit. Eighteen people were treated and discharged at that hospital or other health care centers. The airport is 7 miles (11 kilometers) from downtown Louisville, close to the Indiana state line, residential areas, a water park and museums. The airport resumed operations on Wednesday, with at least one runway open. Beshear said he did not know the status of the three UPS crew members aboard the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 made in 1991. It was not clear if they were being counted among the dead. ‘We all know somebody who works at UPS’ UPS said it was “terribly saddened.” The Louisville package handling facility is the company’s largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour. “We all know somebody who works at UPS,” Louisville Metro Council member Betsy Ruhe said. The governor said The Team Kentucky Emergency Relief Fund, typically used to help people in natural disasters, is accepting donations to help with funeral expenses and other hardships. “In Kentucky, we grieve together and we support one another,” Beshear said.

He said his girlfriend, who had been at a metal recycling business near the explosion, wasn’t answering her phone. Her phone’s live location said she was still there. “We don’t even want to think about anything but the best,” a friend, Bobby Whelan, said. “All our friends were there.” Stooges Bar and Grill bartender Kyla Kenady said lights suddenly flickered as she took a beer to a customer on the patio. “I saw a plane in the sky coming down over top of our volleyball courts in flames,” she said. “In that moment, I panicked. I turned around, ran through the bar screaming, telling everyone that a plane was crashing.” Manager Lynn Cason said explosions, only about 100 yards (90 meters) away, shook the building three times — “like somebody was bombing us” — but no one there was injured. “God was definitely with us,” Cason said. What happened to the plane? Flight records show the plane was on the ground in San Antonio from Sept. 3 to Oct. 18. Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said a number of things could have caused the fire as the UPS plane was rolling down the runway. “It could have been the engine partially coming off and ripping out fuel lines. Or it could have been a fuel leak igniting and then burning the engine off. It’s just too soon to tell,” Guzzetti said. He said the crash bears a lot of similarities to one in 1979 when the left engine fell off an American Airlines jet as it was departing Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, killing 273 people. Guzzetti said this UPS plane and the American plane were equipped with the same General Electric engines. The 1979 crash involved a DC-10, but the MD-11 UPS plane is based on the DC-10. ___ Golden reported from Seattle.

White House. And while a debate about the future of the Democratic Party may have only just begun, there are signs that the economy — specifically, Trump’s inability to deliver the economic turnaround he promised last fall — may be a real problem for Trump’s GOP heading into next year’s higher-stakes midterm elections. Democrats on Tuesday won governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey , the only states electing new chief executives this year. They also swept a trio of state Supreme Court contests in swing-state Pennsylvania and ballots measures from Colorado to Maine. ELECTION 2025: See the full results from key races across the country. Trump was largely absent from the campaign trail, but GOP candidates closely aligned themselves with the president, betting that his big win last year could provide a path to victory this time. They were wrong. Democrats are hoping the off-year romp offers a new winning playbook, but some caution may be warranted. Tuesday’s elections were limited to a handful of states, most of which lean blue, and the party that holds the White House typically struggles in off-year elections. Related Stories Democrats are hopeful again. But unresolved questions remain about party’s path forward 6 MIN READ Sherrill says she has a mandate as New Jersey’s next governor and will focus on affordability 2 MIN READ In Election 2025, the economy’s still the main thing, according to the AP Voter Poll 4 MIN READ Meanwhile, Republicans in Washington may be more excited than Democrats that a self-described democratic socialist will become New York City’s next mayor. Here’s some top takeaways: A new Democratic playbook emerges Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the Virginia governor’s race Tuesday, defeating Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to give Democrats a victory heading into the 2026 midterm elections and make history as the first woman ever to lead the commonwealth. Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger will become Virginia’s next governor — and its first female chief executive — while Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the New Jersey governor’s office by running campaigns focused largely on the economy, public safety and health care. Early results showed Democrats outperforming their margins from four years ago in fast-growing suburbs, rural areas and even places with high concentrations of military voters. The Democrats won by actively distancing themselves from some of the Democratic Party’s far-left policies and emphasized what Spanberger described in her victory speech as “pragmatism over partisanship.” A growing collection of Democratic leaders believe the moderate approach holds the key to the party’s revival after the GOP won the White House and both congressional chambers last year. Above all, the Democrats in both states focused on rising costs such as groceries, energy and health care, which Trump has struggled to control.

Spanberger rarely even mentioned Trump’s name on the campaign trail. Both also have resumes that appealed to the middle. Spanberger is a former CIA case officer who spent years abroad working undercover, while Sherrill spent a decade as an active-duty helicopter pilot for the Navy before entering Congress. Both played up their public safety backgrounds as a direct response to the GOP’s attack that Democrats are soft on crime.

But voters who decided Tuesday’s top elections were more concerned about the economy, jobs and costs of living. That’s according to the AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 17,000 voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City suggesting that many voters felt they can’t get ahead financially in today’s economy. Ironically, the same economic anxieties helped propel Trump to the White House just one year ago. Now, the economic concerns appear to be undermining his party’s political goals in 2025 — and could be more problematic for the GOP in next year’s midterm elections, which will decide the balance of power for Trump’s final two years in office. That’s even as Trump regularly brags about stock prices booming and boasted about leading a new renaissance of American manufacturing. About half of Virginia voters said the economy was the most important issue facing their state while most New Jersey voters said either taxes or the economy were the top issue in their state. Just over half of New York City voters said cost of living was their top concern. It was unclear whether kitchen table concerns weighing so heavily on voters might help break the impasse that has prompted the government shutdown, which has spanned more than a month.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More This was the first election since Trump’s return to the presidency and voters rejected candidates and causes aligned with his Republican Party from Virginia and Pennsylvania to Maine and New Jersey. It was, in fact, difficult to point to any significant victory for Trump’s party. They also expressed strong feelings about the direction of the country under his leadership. About 6 in 10 voters in Virginia and New Jersey said they are “angry” or “dissatisfied” with the way things are going in the country today, according to the AP Voter Poll. Just one-third said they are “enthusiastic” or “satisfied.” In a sign of the extent of the GOP’s struggles, Republicans lost the Virginia attorney general’s race to Democrat Jay Jones, who was forced to apologize after text messages surfaced weeks before Election Day in which he depicted the murder of political opponents. Fearing a bad night, Trump tried to distance himself from the election results. The president endorsed Ciattarelli in New Jersey but held only a pair of tele-town halls on his behalf, including one Monday night . Trump also did a Monday night tele-town hall for Virginia Republican candidates, but he focused mostly in favor of the GOP candidate for attorney general, who also lost. Despite Trump’s distance, his policies — including his “big, beautiful” budget bill and his massive cuts to the federal workforce — played a central role in Virginia, New Jersey and even New York City’s mayoral contest. And the Republicans in each refused to distance themselves from the president or his agenda. The results left the president ducking blame. “TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,” according to pollsters, he posted on his social media account. Trump planned to have breakfast Wednesday at the White House with Senate Republicans who have so far opposed his calls to end the shutdown by abandoning the legislative filibuster, the 60-vote minimum needed to pass most major legislation though the Senate. A new star for Democrats (and Republicans) in New York City Zohran Mamdani was elected New York City mayor Tuesday, capping his meteoric rise to national prominence. The 34-year-old democratic socialist will make history as the city’s first Muslim mayor - and its youngest in more than a century. Moderates won in Virginia and New Jersey. But it was a self-described democratic socialist who cruised to victory in New York City. Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state legislator who backs radical changes to address economic inequality, will serve as the next mayor of the nation’s largest city. His bold agenda and inspirational approach helped generate the largest turnout in a New York City mayoral race in at least three decades. It also spooked some business leaders and voices in the Jewish community, who otherwise support Democrats but oppose some of Mamdani’s past statements about personal wealth accumulation and Israel. Trump, who actually endorsed Mamdani’s independent opponent, former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, falsely called Mamdani a communist on the eve of the election. Some Republicans in Washington were quietly rooting for a Mamdani victory. Even before his win was final, Republican campaign committees launched attack ads against more than a dozen vulnerable House Democrats in New York and New Jersey linking them to Mamdani and his far-left politics. The ad campaign is expected to extend to Democrats across the country ahead of next year’s midterms. More Democratic wins The Democratic successes extended beyond Virginia, New Jersey and New York. In Pennsylvania, Democrats swept all three elections for state supreme court justices. The wins could have implications for key cases involving redistricting and balloting for midterm elections — and the 2028 presidential race — in the nation’s most populous swing state. Conservative causes struggled on ballot questions in other states as well. Maine voters defeated a measure that would have mandated showing an ID at the polls while approving a “red flag” rule meant to make it easier for family members to petition a court to restrict a potentially dangerous person’s access to guns. Colorado approved raising taxes on people earning more than $300,000 to fund school meal programs and food assistance for low-income state residents. California voters approved new congressional district boundaries Tuesday, delivering a victory for Democrats in the state-by-state redistricting battle that will help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026 And in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, frequently mentioned as a 2028 presidential hopeful, led a triumphant charge to redraw congressional maps to give Democrats as many as five more House seats in upcoming elections. The push is the centerpiece of a Democratic effort to counter new Republican maps in Texas and elsewhere that were drawn to boost the GOP’s chances in next year’s fight to control Congress. For the new maps to count in 2026, however, Californians had to vote on a yes-or-no ballot question known as Proposition 50 . It was easily approved."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/jamaica-haiti-and-cuba-take-stock-after-hurricane-melissa-destruction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-30","timeOfPublication":"07:33:17+00:00","title":"Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba take stock after Hurricane Melissa destruction","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, devastated the northern Caribbean in October 2025, killing at least 34 people across Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba.

across the northern Caribbean are reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Melissa as dozens of deaths are reported in Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.\n\nThe hurricane – at Category 5, the  strongest  on record to hit Jamaica directly – ripped across the Caribbean islands on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 25 people in Haiti, eight in Jamaica and one in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe United States-based National Hurricane Center said early on Thursday that Melissa’s eye was expected to move away from the southeastern and central Bahamas before passing west of Bermuda.\n\nAlthough the storm was downgraded to Category 1, the lowest strength on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it was still packing winds of 155km/h (100mph) with even higher gusts, the NHC reported.\n\nIn Haiti, where roughly 12,000 people remained in emergency shelters, families grappled with the rising death toll. Twenty people were reported dead in the southern coastal town of Petit-Goave alone, where a river burst its banks and collapsed dozens of homes.\n\nResident Steven Guadard told The Associated Press news agency that Melissa killed his entire family: “I had four children at home: a one-month-old baby, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old and another who was about to turn four.”\n\nAlthough no deaths were tallied in Cuba, more than 735,000 evacuated residents slowly returned home as the military helped to rescue people in isolated communities.\n\nRecovery efforts were rolling out across Jamaica’s western parishes, where Melissa ripped roofs from homes, felled trees, flooded hospitals, and cut off electricity and water.\n\nYet even as Prime Minister Andrew Holness pledged a “credible and strong” recovery strategy, residents pleaded for help.\n\nSylvester Guthrie, a resident of the hard-hit parish of St Elizabeth, was left with only his bicycle.\n\n“I don’t have a house now,” Guthrie told the AP. Although he has land in another location, he said, “I am going to need help.”\n\nThe centre of Melissa did not cross over Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, allowing emergency relief flights ferrying water, food and other supplies to start landing at Norman Manley International Airport after it reopened late on Wednesday.\n\nAs the prime minister took a helicopter tour of the damage, the Jamaica Public Service utility kicked off a damage assessment as the majority of the island’s 2.8 million residents were left without electricity. It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on October 19, 2025, marking a major milestone in its space program.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/death-toll-from-hurricane-melissa-climbs-to-49-with-many-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:15:49+00:00","title":"Death toll from Hurricane Melissa climbs to 49, with many still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, caused extensive damage and at least 49 deaths across the Caribbean.

2025-10-21T02:23:04+00:00\n\nTitle: What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/avalanche-hits-nepals-mount-yalung-ri-killing-seven-climbers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"02:55:07+00:00","title":"Avalanche hits Nepal’s Mount Yalung Ri, killing seven climbers","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche on Mount Yalung Ri in eastern Nepal's Rolwaling Valley killed seven climbers, including five foreigners—three French, one Canadian, one Italian, and two Nepalis—while they were ascending the 5,630-meter peak.

reports.\n\nThe Kathmandu Post, citing local officials, reported on Tuesday that the avalanche hit the team of 15 people as they were ascending the 5,630-metre (18,471-foot) mountain of Yalung Ri, and that four members of the expedition remain remaining.\n\n“The avalanche buried everyone on the slope,” Deputy Superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the Kathmandu Post. “We got the

Nepali climbers who were injured have been evacuated, while four others, also from Nepal, remain missing, the Kathmandu Post reported.\n\nOne of the injured climbers told the newspaper that the climbers had called for help but got no response for hours.\n\n“We shouted and cried for help, but no one could reach us,” the unnamed climber said. “We were told that a helicopter would come after four hours, but by then, several of our friends were gone.”\n\nYalung Ri is located in the Rolwaling Valley of northeastern Nepal, and climbers there encounter a mix of rock, ice and snow.\n\nBefore Monday’s tragedy, the valley had experienced continuous snow and poor weather conditions for several days, according to the Kathmandu Post.\n\nMahato, the police officer, said helicopters could not be flown in the area due to heavy snowfall and clouds but an aircraft finally reached the area on Monday evening.\n\nHe added that rescue teams on foot have also been dispatched to the area, and that the search operation would resume on Tuesday morning.\n\nNepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks, including  Mount Everest , and welcomes hundreds of climbers and trekkers every year.\n\nAutumn expeditions on the Himalayan mountains in October and November are less popular because of the shorter, colder days, snowy terrain and a narrow summit window compared with the busy spring season, which runs from April to May.\n\nLast week,  Cyclone Montha  triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, leaving trekkers and tourists stranded on popular Himalayan trekking routes.\n\nSeparately, two Italian climbers have also gone missing while scaling a remote peak in western Nepal, tourism officials said on Monday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why

Despite its public health importance, the campaign faced widespread resistance due to conspiracy theories, including claims that the vaccine causes infertility or is tied to foreign espionage, rooted in historical mistrust from a 2011 CIA-led operation in Abbottabad. Public skepticism was also fueled by cultural beliefs about premarital sex and misinformation spreading on social media. Initial vaccination uptake was low—only 78% of the target was reached—leading to a four-day extension of the campaign.

papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/bosnia-retirement-home-fire-kills-11-injures-dozens","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"18:49:57+00:00","title":"Bosnia retirement home fire kills 11, injures dozens","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fire at a retirement home in Tuzla, northeastern Bosnia, killed at least 11 people and injured around 30 others.

black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/bolivia-top-court-orders-release-of-former-interim-president-jeanine-anez","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"18:36:34+00:00","title":"Bolivia top court orders release of former interim President Jeanine Anez","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bolivia’s Supreme Court has ordered the release of former interim President Jeanine Anez, overturning her 10-year prison sentence.

of digging through the rubble in the eastern Gaza City neighbourhood of Shujayea.\n\nThe area “has been under the control and operation of the Israeli army for months”, said Odeh, explaining that an Egyptian team of experts took part in the effort.\n\nShe added that Israel has made clear that “it will not deliver on its commitments in phase one of the ceasefire agreement” – including the free flow of  humanitarian aid  into Gaza – until all the bodies are returned.\n\nSeparately, the Israeli army killed two Palestinians in central Gaza, claiming that they crossed the ceasefire’s yellow line near Israeli positions.\n\nGaza health authorities said Israeli fire also killed a Palestinian collecting firewood in central Gaza, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nThe United Nations warned earlier this week that while aid deliveries have increased since the ceasefire came into effect in October, the amount of food and other assistance getting into the territory remains insufficient.\n\n“We need full access. We need everything to be moving fast,” Abeer Etefa, a senior spokesperson for the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP),  told reporters  on Tuesday.\n\n“We are in a race against time. The winter months are coming. People are still suffering from hunger, and the needs are overwhelming,” said Etefa, urging more crossings into Gaza to be opened to allow supplies to get to Palestinians in need.\n\nAuthorities in Gaza said last week that Israel had allowed an average of 145 aid trucks into Gaza per day between when the ceasefire came into effect and the end of October – just 24 percent of the 600 trucks that are meant to be entering daily as part of the agreement.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council also said on Wednesday that the Israeli authorities had rejected 23 requests from aid agencies to bring  shelter supplies , including tents and blankets, into Gaza.\n\n“We have a very short chance to protect families from the winter rains and cold,” Angelita Caredda, the group’s Middle East and North Africa regional director, said in a statement.\n\n“More than three weeks into the ceasefire, Gaza should be receiving a surge of shelter materials, but only a fraction of what is needed has entered. The international community must act now to secure swift and unimpeded access.”\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of Palestinians – many of whom remain displaced after their  homes were destroyed  in Israel’s two-year bombardment – have been forced to seek out food at community kitchens across the Strip.\n\n“Life is difficult for us, because we own nothing and we don’t have anything to buy food with. There is no work,” Abdel Majid al-Zaity, a 55-year-old father of nine from the Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera in the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\n“Without the soup kitchens here, we couldn’t have eaten. These soup kitchens keep us alive and continue living,” he said.\n\nAnother displaced Palestinian, 43-year-old Hind Hijazy, also said she struggles to feed her family despite the ceasefire. “Every day I come to the soup kitchen here to be able to provide food for my children,” the mother of six said.\n\n“They say there is a truce, but it is a sham truce because the siege is still in place.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/world-very-likely-to-exceed-1-5c-climate-goal-in-next-decade-un","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:05:28+00:00","title":"World ‘very likely’ to exceed 1.5C climate goal in next decade: UN","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) warns that global warming is likely to exceed the 1.5°C climate target within the next decade, with warming projected to reach 2.3 to 2.5°C by 2100 under current policies.

to exceed 1.5C climate goal in next decade: UN\n\nGlobal climate commitments are on track to limit  global warming  by as much as 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) this century, far below what is needed to tackle the climate crisis despite a raft of pledges, the United Nations has warned.\n\nIn its annual Emissions Gap Report on Tuesday, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said the world would exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, the report said. However, with the policies currently in place, Earth is expected to be 2.8C (5F) hotter in that time span.\n\n“Nations have had three attempts to deliver promises made under the Paris Agreement, and each time they have landed off target,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop.”\n\nThe findings come just days before world leaders are set to converge for a UN climate conference in Brazil,  COP30 , where the global failure so far to tackle the crisis will loom large.\n\nGlobal emissions grew 2.3 percent in 2024 compared to the previous year, an increase driven by India followed by China, Russia and Indonesia, Tuesday’s report found.\n\nBut wealthy and powerful Group of 20 (G20) economies accounted for three-quarters of global emissions, and of the six largest polluters, the European Union was the only one to cut greenhouse gases last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States under President Donald Trump has moved away from its climate commitments, and  the country’s planned withdrawal  from the Paris Agreement will be official early next year.\n\nThe Trump administration’s policies, which range from rolling back  environmental regulations  to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, UNEP said in its report.\n\nThe UN agency also said the rest of the world must cut an additional two billion tonnes a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing US carbon pollution.\n\nScientists are in broad agreement that warming above 1.5C (2.7F) relative to pre-industrial times risks  catastrophic consequences , and every effort must be made to stick as close as possible to that safer threshold.\n\nAt 1.4C (2.5F) above pre-industrial times, the Earth is already too warm for most tropical coral reefs to survive, while ice sheets and the Amazon rainforest could suffer severe and lasting changes below 2C (3.6F), with consequences for the entire planet.\n\n“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world,” said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate UN scientific panel that calculates climate impacts.\n\n“It is particularly important for those  vulnerable communities  and ecosystems that are already being impacted,” she told The Associated Press news agency.\n\n“It matters in  heatwaves . It matters in ocean heatwaves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long term when we think about sea level rise.”\n\nIn its report, the UN said only 60 parties to the Paris Agreement – accounting for 63 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions – had submitted or announced new mitigation targets for 2035 by an end-of-September deadline.\n\nIt urged world leaders to make “decisive, accelerated” reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions to minimise the projected overshoot of 1.5C (2.7F).\n\n“Scientists tell us that a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees is now inevitable – starting, at the latest, in the early 2030s. And the path to a livable future gets steeper by the day,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement on the report.\n\n“But this is no reason to surrender. It’s a reason to step up and speed up.[Achieving] 1.5 degrees by the end of the century remains our North Star. And the science is clear: this goal is still within reach. But only if we meaningfully increase our ambition.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/mamdani-kicks-off-new-york-city-transition-after-historic-victory","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"21:17:25+00:00","title":"Mamdani kicks off New York City transition after historic victory","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, has won the New York City mayoral election, becoming the city’s first Muslim mayor and setting a historic precedent in U.S. politics.

promising to form a “capable and compassionate” administration to lead the city and turn his election platform into policies.\n\nMamdani said in brief remarks on Wednesday that he is moving from the “poetry” of campaigning to the “beautiful prose of governing”.\n\n“In the coming months, I and my team will build a city hall capable of delivering on the promises of this campaign,” he said.\n\n“We will form an administration that is equal parts capable and compassionate, driven by integrity and willing to work just as hard as the millions of New Yorkers who call this city home.”\n\nMamdani said his all-women transition team would be led by four co-chairs, including the former chief of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC),  Lina Khan , who is a prominent antitrust advocate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 34-year-old democratic socialist had defeated former Democratic Governor  Andrew Cuomo , who was backed by President Donald Trump, and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to become the city’s first Muslim mayor.\n\nHe is set to take office on January 1, 2026.\n\nThe New York race had implications well beyond the city itself. It was seen as a  reflection of the battle  between progressive Democrats and the centrist, pro-Israel old guard of the party.\n\nMamdani’s campaign focused on affordability, promising to expand social programmes to help struggling families.\n\nHis plans include waiving fares for public buses, freezing rents for government-subsidised homes, and providing free childcare to residents.\n\nMamdani’s agenda will require working with state leaders to increase taxes on the highest earners to fund his programmes.\n\nAlthough Mamdani’s campaign was focused on New York, his advocacy  for Palestinian rights  had taken centre stage throughout.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a major pro-Israel group, says it is launching a “comprehensive initiative to track and monitor policies and personnel appointments” of the incoming Mamdani administration in New York.\n\nADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt hurled baseless accusations of anti-Semitism at Mamdani, saying that the mayor-elect “demonstrated intense animosity toward” Israel.\n\n“We expect the mayor of the city with the largest Jewish population in the world to stand unequivocally against anti-Semitism in all its varied forms and support all of its Jewish residents just as he would all other constituents,” Greenblatt said.\n\n“We will hold the Mamdani administration accountable to this basic standard.”\n\nMamdani has been critical of Israel over its human rights abuses. He has also pledged to protect Jewish New Yorkers, and throughout the campaign, he met with Jewish community leaders.\n\nTrump, who was born and raised in New York, had loomed heavily  over the race . On Tuesday, he said any Jewish resident who would vote for Mamdani is “stupid”.\n\nThe United States president had also threatened to withhold funds to New York and deploy federal forces to the city if Mamdani is elected.\n\nIn his victory speech on Tuesday night, Mamdani sent a defiant message to Trump, saying that New York will show how to stop the US president.\n\n“If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,” Mamdani said. “And if there is any way to defeat a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.”\n\nHe added that addressing the root causes of Trump’s ascent to power, including income inequality, would also prevent the rise of others like him.\n\n“So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up,” Mamdani said.\n\nOn Wednesday,  the mayor-elect  suggested that he would turn to the legal system if Trump moves against New York.\n\nAsked by ABC News how he would stand up to Trump, Mamdani said: “The first thing is, you actually utilise the courts. You stop treating things as being law just by virtue of the fact that President Trump is saying them.”\n\nTuesday’s elections also saw Democrats  score big wins  in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nDemocrats also won two races for seats on Georgia’s utility board – statewide contests that were widely considered a litmus test of Trump’s appeal in the swing state.\n\nVoters in California adopted a congressional map that would draw US House districts that favour Democrats.\n\nThe results represent a boost for Democrats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nTrump acknowledged the election setback, partly blaming the federal  government shutdown  for the results.\n\nLate on Tuesday, Trump called on Republicans to abolish the filibuster – a Senate rule that requires 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber to pass major legislation – to facilitate what he called “voter reform”.\n\n“Pass Voter Reform, Voter ID, No Mail-In Ballots,” Trump wrote in a social media post. “Save our Supreme Court from “Packing,’ No Two State addition, etc. TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER!!!”\n\nTrump has long opposed mail-in voting, a practice that is common in democracies across the world, baselessly claiming that it enables fraud.\n\nIn the 2024 elections, which Trump won, nearly 30 percent of Americans relied on mail-in voting to cast their ballots."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/mamdanis-win-raises-hopes-of-change-in-uganda-the-land-of-his-birth","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"17:31:36+00:00","title":"'I can also make it': Mamdani’s NYC win inspires hopes of change in Uganda","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City’s mayoral election has inspired hope among Ugandans, particularly youth and opposition leaders, who view his rise as a symbol of political possibility in a country under authoritarian rule by President Yoweri Museveni.

stunning victory in New York City’s mayoral race was built on a promise of hope and political change, a message that is resonating loudly with the people in Uganda, where he was born.\n\nThe 34-year-old leftist’s  decisive win  in the United States’ largest metropolis on Wednesday was celebrated by many in Uganda’s capital Kampala, the city where Mamdani was born in 1991.\n\nFor many Ugandans, the unlikely rise of Mamdani – a young Muslim with roots in Africa and South Asia – in the world’s most powerful democracy carries an inspirational message in a country where an authoritarian leader has been ruling since even before Mamdani was born.\n\nUganda’s 81-year-old President Yoweri Museveni is seeking a seventh term in January elections as he looks to extend his nearly 40-year rule. He has rejected calls to retire, leading to fears of a volatile political transition.\n\n“It’s a big encouragement even to us here in Uganda that it’s possible,” Joel Ssenyonyi, a 38-year-old opposition leader in the Parliament of Uganda, told The Associated Press.\n\nHe said that while Ugandans, who are facing repressive political conditions, had “a long way to get there”, Mamdani’s success “inspires us”.\n\nMamdani left Uganda when he was five to follow his father, political theorist Mahmood Mamdani, to South Africa, and later moved to the US. He kept his Ugandan citizenship even after he became a naturalised US citizen in 2018, according to AP.\n\nThe family maintains a home in Kampala, to which they regularly return and visited earlier this year to celebrate Mamdani’s marriage.\n\nWhile Mamdani, a self-described  democratic socialist , has vowed to tackle inequality and push back against the xenophobic rhetoric of US President Donald Trump, opposition politicians in Uganda face different challenges.\n\nMuseveni has been  cracking down  on his opponents ahead of next year’s elections, as he has in the lead-up to previous polls.\n\nIn November last year, veteran opposition figure Kizza Besigye, who has stood against Museveni in four elections, and his aide, Obeid Lutale, were abducted in Nairobi, Kenya, before being arraigned in a military court in Kampala on treason charges. The pair have since repeatedly been  denied bail , despite concerns raised by the United Nations’ human rights officials.\n\nOther opposition figures  have also faced crackdowns .\n\nTens of supporters of the National Unity Platform (NUP) party, led by 43-year-old entertainer Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, have been convicted by Uganda’s military courts for various offences.\n\n“From Uganda, we celebrate and draw strength from your example as we work to build a country where every citizen can realise their grandest dreams regardless of means and background,” Wine wrote on X as he sent his “hearty congratulations” to Mamdani.\n\nRobert Kabushenga, a retired Ugandan media executive who is friendly with the Mamdani family, told AP that Mamdani’s win was “a beacon of hope” for those fighting for change in Uganda, especially the younger generations.\n\nDescribing the new mayor-elect as belonging to “a tradition of very honest and clear thinkers who are willing to reimagine … politics”, Kabushenga said Mamdani’s victory underlined that “we should allow young people the opportunity to shape, and participate in, politics in a meaningful way”.\n\nOkello Ogwang, an academic who once worked with Mamdani’s father at Kampala’s Makerere University, said his son’s success was an instructive reminder to Uganda “that we should invest in the youth”.\n\n“He’s coming from here,” he said. “If we don’t invest in our youth, we are wasting our time.”\n\nAnthony Kirabo, a 22-year-old psychology student at Makerere University, said Mamdani’s win “makes me feel good and proud of my country because it shows that Uganda can produce some good leaders”.\n\n“Seeing Zohran up there, I feel like I can also make it,” he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/eu-waters-down-climate-target-in-last-ditch-deal-ahead-of-cop30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:23:03+00:00","title":"EU waters down climate target in last-ditch deal before COP30 in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"European Union climate ministers have agreed on a watered-down climate target, allowing up to 10% of its 90% emissions reduction goal by 2040 to be offset through foreign carbon credits, with further flexibility under consideration.

waters down climate target in last-ditch deal before COP30 in Brazil\n\nEuropean Union climate ministers have struck a watered-down deal on emission-reduction goals as they have scrambled to win over member states before the United Nations  COP30 summit  in the Amazon.\n\nMinisters approved a compromise early on Wednesday after marathon talks on how the bloc will go about slashing its greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent by 2040, introducing flexibilities that will essentially offload some of the task onto foreign countries.\n\nUnder the compromise, countries will be allowed to buy foreign carbon credits to cover up to 5 percent of their overall target of cutting emissions by 90 percent compared with 1990 levels. In a further concession, the bloc also agreed to consider the option of using international carbon credits to meet a further 5 percent of its goal.\n\n“Setting a climate target is not just picking a number. It is a political decision with far-reaching consequences for the continent,” Danish Climate Minister Lars Aagaard said, adding that he and his colleagues had worked to provide “comfort” that would preserve “competitiveness, social balance and security”.\n\nIn a further effort to win over sceptical members, EU countries agreed for the overall 2040 objective to be reassessed every two years. They also agreed to weaken other politically sensitive climate policies, delaying the launch of an upcoming EU carbon market from 2027 to 2028.\n\nA handful of countries including Poland, Slovakia and Hungary opposed the 2040 climate target on the grounds it would hit industrial competitiveness, but they could not block the deal, which needed backing from only 15 of the EU’s 27 member states.\n\nThe UN had asked all governments worldwide to submit 2035 climate plans before the COP30 climate summit opens on Monday in Brazil. The deal means European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will not go empty-handed to the meeting.\n\nThe talks will test the will of major economies to keep fighting climate change in the face of opposition from sceptics like United States President Donald Trump.\n\nThe EU, in particular, has prided itself on leading international efforts to curb climate change at past COPs, but climate concerns have recently taken a backseat to defence and competitiveness.\n\nEnvironmental groups accused countries of undermining the bloc’s climate ambitions by pushing for loopholes.\n\nHundreds of environmental and human rights groups and activists penned a letter in late September urging COP30 to place justice and reparations for people unfairly affected by the climate crisis, colonialism and slavery at the centre of the talks."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to President Donald Trump’s announcement of resuming nuclear weapons testing, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarified that the planned tests are noncritical and do not involve nuclear explosions.

These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/6/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1351","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-06","timeOfPublication":"00:36:03+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,351","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Russia-Ukraine war has reached its 351st day, with the latest update provided on Thursday, November 6, 2025.

with democratic standards, says the African Union (AU), adding to mounting international pressure on President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s administration over the  deadly vote .\n\nThe AU’s election monitoring arm – which sent a team of 72 observers to Tanzania and Zanzibar for the  October 29 election  – on Wednesday pointed to ballot stuffing, the government-imposed internet blackout, allegations of excessive military force, and politically-motivated abductions as “compromising election integrity”.\n\nThe election “did not comply with AU principles, normative frameworks, and other international obligations and standards for democratic elections”, the mission’s report concluded, adding that the environment was “not conducive to peaceful conduct and acceptance of electoral outcomes”.\n\nProtesters  poured into the streets  of Dar es Salaam and other cities following the election, where they faced police violence, clouds of tear gas and limited internet access.\n\nThe country’s main opposition party, Chadema, has since claimed  hundreds of people were killed , a figure the government has denied.\n\nVideos  reviewed  by Al Jazeera show dozens of bodies, including of people shot in the head, protesters with bloodied faces, and security forces firing guns in the streets.\n\nThe AU’s mission urged Tanzanian authorities to exercise restraint and pursue “thorough investigations” into violence against protesters.\n\n“Tanzania should prioritise electoral and political reforms to address the root causes of its democratic and electoral challenges witnessed ahead of, during, and after the 2025 General Elections,” the report said.\n\nThe AU report came amid another rare rebuke from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) earlier this week, which detailed violence, censorship and “general intimidation” of the public and opposition figures.\n\nOverall, “voters could not express their democratic will”, SADC said in a preliminary report on Monday, adding that the elections “fell short” of SADC principles.\n\nHassan swept nearly 98 percent of the vote after her two main competitors were barred from competing. Chadema was  disqualified  in April after refusing to sign an electoral code of conduct, while the country’s second-biggest party, ACT-Wazalendo, was excluded after an objection from the attorney general.\n\nChadema’s leader Tundu Lissu separately faces a  treason trial  after calling for election reforms.\n\nSADC chronicled such events directly, writing that the disqualifications had created an “uneven political playing field” that undermined the democratic process.\n\nThe last time SADC openly criticised an African election process was during Zimbabwe’s election in 2023. It has since observed a handful of other elections, including in Malawi, Botswana, South Africa, Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nIn her first comments after being sworn in, Hassan appeared to blame foreigners for the protests, saying “it was not a surprise that those arrested were from other countries”, according to a translation by the Associated Press.\n\nHassan first took power in 2021 after the unexpected death of her predecessor, John Magufuli.\n\nSince then, local and international watchdogs have repeatedly raised the alarm over her administration’s alleged campaign of forced disappearances, torture and assault of critics, as well as widespread media repression.\n\nIn June, a panel of United Nations experts said they had documented more than 200 disappearances in the country since 2019."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"5112-11-05","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global technological and scientific developments: Australia is introducing restrictions on children's social media access, the US is advancing nuclear and medical technologies, a new mRNA-based cancer vaccine study offers hope for off-the-shelf treatments, the UK is emerging as an AI hub, China has banned exports of automotive components from Nexperia due to trade tensions, climate change is causing mosquitoes to spread into Iceland, Pakistan has rolled out an HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, AI-related misinformation has sparked legal action, Amazon Web Services suffered a major outage, and emerging technologies are being used to enhance environmental and urban planning.

revelation last week by Israel’s top military lawyer, Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, that she leaked the footage of a gang rape of a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman military detention centre in 2024 has shaken the country’s political and media establishment.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – whose leadership of the genocidal war on Gaza has drawn global condemnation – called the leak “perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the State of Israel has experienced”. Critics of Netanyahu’s view come from establishment voices desperate to defend the judiciary and state institutions, which they believe Netanyahu and his allies are exploiting the leak to undermine.\n\nLost amid headlines fuelled by the leak’s admission is the gang rape of the Palestinian prisoner at Sde Teiman on July 5, 2024. The attack was so brutal that the man was admitted to hospital with what the Israeli daily Haaretz  revealed  was a ruptured bowel, severe anal and lung injuries, and broken ribs – injuries that later required surgery.\n\n“It’s a huge story in Israel, but you won’t see the word ‘rape’ anywhere in it,” Orly Noy, editor of the Hebrew language Local Call, told Al Jazeera. “The contextualisation of the story is entirely different here than anything you or I might see.”\n\nInstead of focusing on the rape and the ongoing legal proceedings against the five suspects, the story has instead centred on Tomer-Yerushalmi and those accused of helping her cover up the leak.\n\nSpeaking on Israeli television on Saturday night, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party, Energy Minister Eli Cohen,  told  viewers that Tomer-Yerushalmi was “supposed to be the bulletproof vest, the protector, of the [Israeli military] soldiers”.\n\n“Instead of that, she stabbed them in the back,” he said about the lawyer who leaked footage of soldiers appearing to rape a prisoner. “In this case, we are talking about treason.”\n\nDefence Minister Israel Katz was no less damning, releasing at least seven statements targeting the military attorney in a week and accusing her of participating in “blood libel” against the five alleged rapists.\n\nFocusing on Tomer-Yerushalmi, rather than the alleged rapists, is nothing new.\n\nThe former chief military advocate had been the subject of political pressure and accusations of covering up the source of the leak since the first reports of the rape emerged in August 2024. That pressure continued to build, culminating in the announcement from Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara in early October of an investigation into the source of the leak.\n\nOn Friday, November 1, Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned and admitted that she had been the source of the leak. Two days later, she was reported missing for several hours following the discovery of what friends and family worried was a suicide note, which prompted a large-scale search.\n\nWithin hours of being found safe, Tomer-Yerushalmi was arrested, and the suicide note was dismissed by Israeli prosecutors as a ploy. She has been charged with multiple offences, including fraud, breach of trust, obstruction of justice, and abuse of office.\n\nSince Sunday, police have also arrested the military’s former chief prosecutor, Colonel Matan Solomosh, on suspicion of helping Tomer-Yerushalmi cover up the leak. There have also been suggestions that the attorney general and her staff may have been involved.\n\n“Rape doesn’t matter,” said political analyst Ori Goldberg, referring to how Israeli authorities are responding to news of the leak. “What matters is the woman who leaked the tape and what they want to call the deep state.”\n\n“For Netanyahu and others, this is evidence that the deep state has gotten too big for its britches and that, by accusing Tomer-Yerushalmi of collaborating with the attorney general, they have evidence of the treachery and a further means of undermining any civilian oversight there may be over their workings.”\n\nNetanyahu and his allies’ fight with the judiciary dates back to what his critics call the “ judicial coup ” of 2023, when he proposed a sweeping legislative overhaul of Israel’s judicial system. He has also faced multiple charges of corruption since  2019 .\n\nThe prime minister’s proposed judicial reforms would grant his right-wing coalition the freedom to act without the check of the Supreme Court, potentially leading to a further crackdown on dissent and the rights of Palestinians.\n\nAttorney General Baharav-Miara has found herself in the firing line for resisting those reforms. In 2023, she issued legal guidance opposing the proposed judicial overhaul, writing that it would undermine Israel’s checks and balances, and that it was “a sure recipe for harming human rights and clean governance”. She also told the prime minister to distance himself from the judicial reforms, noting that it would be a conflict of interest amid his own corruption trial.\n\n“They want to cover up the rape,” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a member of the Israeli parliament representing the left-wing Hadash-Ta’al faction, told Al Jazeera. “That’s why they’re dealing with the prosecutors and not the crime itself.”\n\n“Benjamin Netanyahu is using this, just like the right wing is using this. They’ve been repeating the same messaging ever since the story broke. This is how the judiciary works. These are your so-called checks and balances. Look at them, they’re criminals.”\n\nAmid the political furore, the likelihood of prosecuting the alleged rapists appears to be diminishing.\n\nOn Monday, it emerged that the rape victim had been returned to Gaza in October as part of the exchange of captives, leading to speculation that he might not appear in proceedings against his alleged attackers.\n\nFive of those indicted for the assault saw their charges downgraded to “severely abusing” the detainee on Sunday, when they appeared outside Israel’s Supreme Court wearing balaclavas to hide their identity.\n\nA lawyer for the suspects, Moshe Polsky, told journalists that his clients could not expect a fair trial due to the leak, saying “the wheel cannot be turned back” and that, consequently, the indictment process had been tainted.\n\nOne suspect, who declined to be identified, described himself and his fellow suspects as loyal patriots wrongfully targeted by a legal system they see as undermining their service. “We knew we had to defend the country [following the October 7 attack],” he said.\n\n“Since that day, dozens of fighters are still fighting for justice not on the battlefield, but in courtrooms.”\n\nFor observers such as journalist Noy, however, there is little to do with justice in the saga of accusation, counter-accusation and cover-up that has come to overshadow the brutal rape of a prisoner in Israeli custody.\n\n“For the two sides, this is all about the system and nothing to do with the Palestinian victim,” she reflected.\n\n“One side sees it as [about] the old elite protecting itself, and the other about safeguarding the institutions of the state,” Noy said. “But don’t forget, these are the same institutions they need to protect to continue the abuse of Palestinians. These are the defences they offer up whenever they’re criticised from overseas.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kp8dex14xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-06","timeOfPublication":"00:37:08.986+00:00","title":"US to cut flights at 40 airports if shutdown doesn't end, transportation secretary warns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown enters its 40th day, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Chief Bryan Bedford have announced a phased reduction in air travel capacity at 40 major airports, starting with a 4% cut on Friday and rising to a full 10% the following week.

to cut flights at 40 airports if shutdown doesn't end, transportation secretary warns\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned there will be a 10% reduction in air travel capacity at 40 major airports in the US starting Friday morning, if the government shutdown continues.\n\nThe decision was made because air traffic controllers have been reporting issues with fatigue, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  said at a briefing with Duffy on Wednesday.\n\n\"It is unusual, just as the shutdown is unusual, just as the fact that our controllers haven't been paid for a month is unusual,\" said FAA chief Bryan Bedford\n\nDuring the shutdown, now the longest in US history, controllers have had to keep working without pay, prompting some to call out sick or take side jobs.\n\nThe flight reductions will be gradual, starting at 4% of domestic flights on Friday, then rising to 5% on Saturday and 6% on Sunday, before hitting the full 10% next week, Reuters reported after the announcement, citing four unnamed sources.\n\nThe names of the affected airports - all high-traffic locations - will be released on Thursday, the officials said.\n\nThe cancellations could affect between 3,500 and 4,000 flights per day.\n\n\"We are seeing pressures build in a way that we don't feel - if we allow it to go unchecked - will allow us to continue to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world,\" Bedford said.\n\nDuffy said air travel is still safe, and the decision to cancel the flights was being made to maintain safety and efficiency.\n\nIf the shutdown continues and adds more pressure to the system, additional restrictive measures may be required, Bedford said.\n\nA spokesperson for Southwest Airlines, the fourth-largest carrier in North America, said in a statement that the company is still evaluating how the flight restrictions will affect its services, and will let customers know as soon as possible.\n\n\"We continue to urge Congress to immediately resolve its impasse and restore the National Airspace System to its full capacity,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nDelta Airlines declined to comment. The BBC has also reached out to other major US airlines.\n\nOnce government funds ran out on 1 October, most federal workers were sent home and told they would be paid once the government reopened. Those deemed essential, like controllers, though, had to keep doing their jobs without pay.\n\nAlmost immediately after the shutdown started, airports began feeling the effects. Some had to ground flights for hours after air traffic controllers called out sick, while others relied on controllers from other airports.\n\nNick Daniels, the president of the labor union representing more than 20,000 aviation workers, put the situation into stark terms on Wednesday.\n\n\"Air traffic controllers are texting 'I don't even have enough money to put gas in my car to come to work,'\" he told CNN.\n\n\"We base what we do day in and day out on predictability,\" he said. \"Right now there is no predictability.\"\n\nDuffy warned earlier this week that the  flight cancellations may be coming , as half of the country's 30 major airports experience staff shortages.\n\nHe previously said there's a risk that comes with air traffic controllers taking on additional jobs during the shutdown, and had threatened to fire controllers who do not come to work.\n\n\"They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheque and not put food on the table? Or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables?\" Duffy said on ABC on Sunday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mosquitoes have been detected in Iceland for the first time, marking a significant shift in the country’s long-standing status as one of the world’s few mosquito-free regions.

detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/1/melissa-leaves-50-dead-toll-expected-to-rise-in-jamaica-haiti","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-01","timeOfPublication":"05:03:28+00:00","title":"Melissa leaves 50 dead, toll expected to rise in Jamaica, Haiti","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, a powerful Category 5 storm, devastated Jamaica, Haiti, and Cuba, killing about 50 people and leaving widespread destruction, including power outages, damaged infrastructure, and flooding.

Gaza City, there's almost nothing left to orient you here, or identify the neighbourhoods that once held tens of thousands of people.\n\nThis was one of the first areas Israeli ground troops entered

Today it took a group of journalists, including the BBC, into the area of the Strip occupied by Israeli forces.\n\nThe brief visit was highly controlled and offered no access to Palestinians, or other areas of Gaza.\n\nMilitary censorship laws in Israel mean that military personnel were shown our material before publication. The BBC maintained editorial control of this report at all times.\n\nAsked about the level of destruction in the area we visited, Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said it was \"not a goal\".\n\n\"The goal is to combat terrorists. Almost every house had a tunnel shaft or was booby-trapped or had an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] or sniper station,\" he said.\n\n\"If you're driving fast, within a minute you can be inside of a living room of an Israeli grandmother or child.

Searches are continuing for the missing bodies of another seven hostages.\n\nThe Israeli military base we travelled to is a few hundred metres from the yellow line – the temporary boundary set out in  US President Donald Trump's peace plan , which divides the areas of Gaza still controlled by Israeli forces from the areas controlled by Hamas.\n\nIsrael's army has been gradually marking out the yellow line with blocks on the ground, as a warning to both Hamas fighters and civilians.\n\nThere are no demarcations along this part of the line yet - a soldier points it out to me, taking bearings from a small patch of sand between the grey crumbs of demolished buildings.\n\nThe ceasefire is almost a month old, but Israeli forces say they are still fighting Hamas gunmen along the yellow line \"almost every day\". The piles of bronze-coloured bullet casings mark the firing points on the embankments facing Gaza City.\n\nHamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire \"hundreds of times\", and Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry says more than 240 people have been killed as a result.\n\nCol Shoshani said that Israeli forces were committed to the US-led peace plan, but that they would also make sure that Hamas no longer posed a threat to Israeli civilians, and would stay as long as necessary.\n\n\"It's very clear to everyone that Hamas is armed and trying to control Gaza,\" he said. \"This is something that will be worked out, but we're far from that.\"\n\nThe next stage of the US-led plan requires Hamas to disarm and hand over power to a Palestinian committee overseen by international figures including President Trump.\n\nBut rather than give up its power and weapons, Col Shoshani said, Hamas was doing the opposite.\n\n\"Hamas is trying to arm itself, trying to assert dominance, assert control over Gaza,\" he told me. \"It's killing people in broad daylight, to terrorise civilians and make sure they understand who is boss in Gaza. We hope this agreement is enough pressure to make sure Hamas disarms.\"\n\nIsraeli forces showed us a map of the tunnels they said that soldiers had found beneath the rubble we saw – \"a vast network of tunnels, almost like spider's web\" they said – some already destroyed, some still intact, and some they were still searching for.\n\nWhat happens in the next stage of this peace deal is unclear.\n\nThe agreement has left Gaza in a tense limbo. Washington knows how fragile the situation is - the ceasefire has faltered twice already.\n\nThe US is pushing hard to move on from this volatile stand-off to a more durable peace. It has sent a draft resolution to UN Security Council members, seen by the BBC, which outlines a two-year mandate for an international stabilisation force to take over Gaza's security and disarm Hamas.\n\nBut details of this next stage of the deal are thin: it's not clear which countries would send troops to secure Gaza ahead of Hamas disarmament, when Israel's troops will withdraw, or how the members of Gaza's new technocratic administration will be appointed.\n\nPresident Trump has outlined his vision of Gaza as a futuristic Middle Eastern hub, built with foreign investment. It's a far cry from where Gaza is today.\n\nLargely destroyed by Israel, and seen as an investment by Trump, the question is not just who can stop the fighting, but how much say Gazans will have in the future of their communities and lands."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has expanded its social media ban for children under 16 to include Reddit and Kick, joining platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X, Threads, and YouTube.

2025-11-05T06:55:24+00:00\n\nTitle: Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16\n\nAustralia’s upcoming  social media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3kevkl3pdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"22:00:04.734+00:00","title":"Crime fixer caught by BBC offering to erase £60K fines on migrant workers","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A BBC investigation has exposed a criminal network, led by a man known as Shaxawan (Kardos Mateen), who offers to erase immigration fines of up to £60,000 for migrant workers by registering businesses under false 'ghost directors' and transferring liability to others.

organised crime network has been secretly filmed telling BBC undercover reporters how he can help to erase fines of up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers.\n\nThe self-described \"accountant\" is among a group of Kurdish men, first exposed in  a BBC investigation on Tuesday , who enable migrants to work illegally in mini-marts, by registering the businesses in their own name.\n\nThe man, who goes by the name of Shaxawan, told the two journalists that he and his associates could help migrants - including asylum seekers - to set up businesses illegally and \"confuse\" immigration enforcement.\n\nOperating from a solicitor's office in Huddersfield, he said he had \"customers in every city\".\n\nIn Companies House listings, Shaxawan is named as Kardos Mateen, a British resident in his 30s, and has been the director of 18 businesses across the north of England.\n\nWhen later confronted by us, with details of his claims, he denied any wrongdoing.\n\nTrading Standards confirmed it has found illegal cigarettes being sold in many businesses registered under the name Kardos Mateen, and the BBC was sold counterfeit tobacco in four mini-marts where he was listed as the director.\n\nThe BBC News two-part investigation has revealed the sophistication and scale of criminal networks profiting from undocumented working on UK High Streets. Loose regulation of Britian's labour market is acting as a pull factor for those entering the UK illegally, the government has acknowledged.\n\nShaxawan made several claims to our reporters:\n\nOur reporters also spoke to a paralegal, with Shaxawan present, who offered to \"make documents\", including \"business agreements\", to avoid fines.\n\nIt took months to set up the first meeting with Shaxawan.\n\nHe pulled up at a busy Manchester retail park in a white 4x4 BMW, in the belief he was meeting an asylum seeker who was looking to run a mini-mart and sell illegal cigarettes.\n\nIn fact, he was meeting Saman (not his real name), a Kurdish journalist working undercover for the BBC.\n\nIn a cafe, Shaxawan freely shared details of what he and his associates were able to offer: \"We are a group. Each of us provides a service and works together,\" he said.\n\nHe explained how he worked with an \"English woman who dealt with electricity, gas and bailiffs\". And when Immigration Enforcement issues a fine, he added, \"she makes it zero\".\n\n\"I will… set up your company, provide the [card] machine, get you electricity, speak to your landlord,\" Shaxawan assured him. \"I'll make sure you have no issues.\"\n\nHe told Saman that he should register a mini-mart business in the name of someone else - what is sometimes known as a \"ghost director\". This would cost £400 per month, and getting access to a business bank card would require a one-off payment of £140, he said.\n\nThe ghost director would be the one to \"take the risk\" if the shop was raided by law enforcement and fines issued, he explained.\n\n\"That's why you're paying,\" he said.\n\nTo show he was genuine and to provide reassurance, Shaxawan called someone he said could act as ghost director.\n\nSaman explained to the man on the phone that he did not have asylum status.\n\n\"Don't worry\" came the reply. \"As Mr Shaxawan says, send the money at the end of the month.\"\n\nID documents sent to Saman by phone swiftly after his meeting with Shaxawan, revealed that the potential ghost director was a 28-year-old from Iran called Bryar Mohammed Zada.\n\nMr Zada has racked up company directorships for 20 car washes and mini-marts from Newcastle upon Tyne to Essex in the past 12 months, according to Companies House records.\n\nUndercover journalists found illegal cigarettes being sold at four of Mr Zada's businesses.\n\nMr Zada did not respond to the BBC's questions.\n\nSaman later called Shaxawan asking for a second meeting, and Shaxawan suggested they meet at RKS Solicitors in Huddersfield.\n\nThe firm is registered with the Law Society and has branches in Dewsbury and Sheffield.\n\nThe meeting was arranged on the premise Saman needed help to deal with an illegal working fine which had been given to a family member.\n\nThere is no mention of the names \"Shaxawan\" or \"Mateen\" on the firm's website.\n\nBut Saman had called Shaxawan when he was outside the solicitors, and Shaxawan opened the front door, and welcomed him in.\n\nHe led our reporter upstairs to an office, where he outlined how Saman's family member could avoid the fine, transferring company details to someone else for a fee.\n\nRKS Solicitors told the BBC it had no connection to any alleged immigration or fine-related misconduct.\n\nWe later got our second undercover reporter, \"Ali\", who is also Kurdish, to investigate further by calling the same RKS Solicitors branch - but without mentioning Shaxawan.\n\nPosing as a Kurdish mini-mart owner, he told the woman who answered the phone that he had received a £60,000 fine from Immigration Enforcement for employing two people without the right to work.\n\nHe was given an appointment with Zohaib Hussain, who is listed on RKS's website as a paralegal - someone who can advise on legal matters but is not a qualified solicitor and works under supervision.\n\nAs Ali was arriving for his appointment with Mr Hussain at the RKS offices, he came across Shaxawan outside. On the street, Shaxawan repeated the claim he had made to Saman - that he could make fines go to \"zero\" with no comeback from authorities.\n\nShaxawan again referred to the \"English woman\" he mentioned in the earlier meeting, and said she could make sure that fines for illegal working were reassigned to other people, as if they were the culpable business owner.\n\nShaxawan said these would be Hungarians who \"live nearby\". They would be paid between £2,000-£3,000 and their names would be used to assume liability for the fines.\n\nHe did not give any more details, but an immigration lawyer we spoke to suggested this could work much like receiving a speeding fine, and giving the name of someone else on the paperwork as the person who was driving - and therefore liable to pay the penalty.\n\nShaxawan said the overall cost to Ali would be about £4,600 per illegal worker. He said he had done this successfully in \"Manchester, Birmingham, Blackpool and Leeds\", with the process usually taking about four weeks.\n\nHe added Ali's company would then need to be closed, reopened and re-registered under a new name.\n\nAli was then let into the RKS branch, and Shaxawan came inside too. Inside an office, Shaxawan showed him documents on his phone detailing the people he claimed to have helped before.\n\nShaxawan claimed the scam would confuse Immigration Enforcement officers who would not have time to check the details.\n\nAli was then introduced to the paralegal, Zohaib Hussain. Shaxawan stayed in the room throughout the meeting.\n\nSpeaking quickly and in a hushed tone, Mr Hussain fired questions at our reporter about his cover story - the mini-mart and the immigration fine.\n\n\"How many illegal workers? So how much is the fine? How many times did they catch you?\"\n\nThen, with a chuckle, he asked what was sold in the mini-mart: \"Do you sell vapes? Legal or illegal? Bit of both as well?\"\n\nWhen Ali said his mini-mart was registered under someone else's name, Mr Hussain said: \"Very clever then, already very clever.\"\n\nThe first step, Mr Hussain said, would be to deal with the fine.\n\nIf Ali was not let off the fine, he continued, \"we will look at certain other things that we have to do as precautions\".\n\n\"Sometimes we might have to make documents,\" said Mr Hussain, such as \"business agreements\".\n\nAli then asked if the fine would be transferred to someone else's name. Mr Hussain said that would be \"the last resort.\"\n\nBefore the meeting ended, Mr Hussain warned that the immigration authorities would want to jump on the fine straight away - making a cutting-motion across his throat.\n\nHe said his charges would be £3,500 and he \"would look after us\". He then asked Ali to share any future Immigration Enforcement letters with Shaxawan.\n\nWe showed our undercover filming and translations to senior immigration lawyer Bryony Rest, who told us Hussain was \"clearly offering to falsify documents\".\n\nThere were \"likely fraud and immigration offences\" taking place, she said, and she would expect law enforcement to investigate.\n\nWhen we later contacted Mr Hussain for comment he replied by email saying he denied \"all allegations, insinuations, and claims\" we had put to him.\n\n\"For clarity, the individual named in your correspondence, Mr Shaxawan Jawad, is not associated with me in any capacity; professional, personal, or otherwise.\"\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, RKS Solicitors said the company was carrying out an internal review and \"the individual concerned\" had been suspended pending further investigation.\n\n\"We are already informing\" the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), it added.\n\n\"Mr Hussain is employed as a paralegal under strict supervision… The individual is not authorised or instructed to provide immigration and tax advice.\"\n\nThe firm did not comment on Shaxawan Jawad. It said it did not condone unlawful conduct and was committed to the \"highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and public service\".\n\nShaxawan, otherwise known as Kardos Mateen, told us by email that he categorically denied \"every allegation, insinuation and claim made\" in our reporting, and said that he was \"not employed by, associated with, or acting on behalf of RKS Solicitors in any capacity\".\n\nHome secretary Shabana Mahmood, said the Home Office would investigate the BBC's findings.\n\n\"Illegal working and linked organised criminality creates an incentive for people to come here illegally. We will not stand for it,\" she said.\n\nAdditional reporting Phill Edwards and Kirstie Brewer"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9dyyydjr0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"22:03:16.682+00:00","title":"At least 11 dead in UPS cargo plane crash in Kentucky","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS cargo plane, an MD-11F, crashed during takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Tuesday evening, resulting in at least 11 fatalities and over a dozen injuries.

off from an airport in Louisville, Kentucky on Tuesday evening, the state's governor said.\n\nAndy Beshear said the death toll is expected to rise and likely includes at least one child after the freight plane exploded as it departed Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport at around 17:15 local time (22:15 GMT), he said.\n\nThe left engine caught fire and fell from the wing during takeoff, causing a major fire that sent thick plumes of smoke into the air, the National Transportation and Safety Board said.\n\nMore than a dozen others were injured in the crash, from burns and shrapnel injuries to smoke inhalation.\n\nOfficials said those who survived had suffered \"very significant\" injuries in the incident. Crews were still searching for other victims, as multiple people remain unaccounted for.\n\nThe plane's three-member crew are thought to be among the dead, Beshear has said.\n\nA preliminary investigation is under way but officials have said it is too early to say what caused the crash, though surveillance footage and data from the plane is helping piece it together.\n\nInvestigators have recovered the cockpit flight recorder and the flight data recorder,  known as the black box, said Todd Inman with the NTSB, the agency leading the investigation.\n\nIn an update on Wednesday, Inman said that CCTV surveillance footage showed the left engine of the aircraft \"detaching from the wing during the takeoff roll\". The video has not yet been released.\n\nHe said the plane was able to lift off the ground and cleared a fence at the end of the runway before it hit multiple businesses surrounding the airport.\n\nBeshear declared a state of emergency on Wednesday to help \"move resources more quickly through emergency management and the Kentucky National Guard\".\n\nLouisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that the airport has since reopened its runway so that flights can resume.\n\nAt least 16 different families have reported loved ones unaccounted for, according to Beshear.\n\nTwo workers at the auto business that was struck were still unaccounted for as of Tuesday evening, and it is not known how many customers were on the premises when the crash happened.\n\nIn a statement, UPS said three crew members were on board, adding \"we have not confirmed any injuries/casualties\".\n\nLocal officials said on Wednesday that they were unsure how many victims they were searching for, and that the fire destroyed the plane, creating a large debris zone that would make it challenging to find people.\n\nKentucky Representative Morgan McGarvey said 28 people from the NTSB were on the ground and would \"analyse absolutely every bit of what happened\".\n\nOfficials did note, though, that the massive blaze was caused by the amount of fuel onboard the aircraft, which was beginning a journey of around 4,300 miles (6,920km) to Hawaii.\n\nIt was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel when it crashed.\n\nThis made it look like it was \"raining oil\" in Louisville when the crash occurred, McGarvey said.\n\nIt has not been confirmed what cargo was on board, though officials have said the plane was not carrying anything that would create a heightened risk of contamination.\n\nThe explosion engulfed at least two nearby businesses, including a petroleum recycling company. A shelter-in-place order was initially issued for within five miles of the airport due to concerns of further explosions and air pollution, but was later reduced to just one mile.\n\nAll departing flights for Tuesday evening were cancelled, the airport said in a statement on X.\n\nLouisville Fire Department Chief Brian O'Neal said the amount of fuel spilled at the crash site made it a \"very dangerous situation\".\n\nThe shelter-in-place order was reduced to a one-mile radius as crews worked to contain the blaze on Tuesday night.\n\nAt a press conference, Beshear warned people not to go to the crash site.\n\n\"Anyone who has seen the images and the video knows how violent this crash is,\" he said.\n\n\"There are still dangerous things that are flammable, that are potentially explosive.\"\n\nLouisville Metro Police Dept Chief Paul Humphrey said that the crash site will be \"an ongoing active scene for the next several days\".\n\nHe added: \"We don't know how long it's going to take to render that scene safe for the investigation to take place.\"\n\nThe model of aircraft involved was a MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.\n\nThe aircraft was originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997.\n\nIn 2023, FedEx and UPS both announced plans to begin retiring their fleets of MD-11s over the next decade as part of plans to modernise their fleets.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said it is \"ready to support our customer\" and that \"our concern is for the safety and well-being of all those affected.\"\n\nIt added that it will offer technical assistance to the NTSB.\n\nLouisville is home to UPS Worldport, a global hub for the delivery firm's air cargo operations and its largest package handling facility in the world.\n\nIn a statement, UPS said it was \"terribly saddened\" by the incident and would be halting package sorting operations at Worldport on Tuesday night.\n\nIt added: \"UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, and customers and the communities we serve.

sharp questioning at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, in a case with major implications for the president's agenda and the global economy.\n\nA majority of justices, including several conservatives, expressed doubts about the White House's justification of the import duties, which the president has said are necessary to restore America's manufacturing base and fix its trade imbalance.\n\nThe measures are being challenged by a number of small businesses and a group of states, which contend that the president has overstepped his authority in imposing the levies, which are in effect a tax.\n\nAmerica's top court - which has a 6-3 conservative majority - usually takes months to reach big decisions, but many expect it to move faster in this case, which is also seen as the first major test of the Trump administration's push to expand presidential power.\n\n\"And so is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I mean, Spain? France?\" asked Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed to the court by Trump.\n\n\"I could see it with some countries but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy as are.\"\n\nBillions of dollars in tariff payments are at stake. If the Trump administration loses, the government could have to refund some of the billions of dollars it has collected, a process that Barrett noted could become a \"complete mess\".\n\nThe White House, which sent Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to the hearing, has said that they will turn to other tariff authorities if the court does not rule in its favour.\n\n\"The White House is always preparing for Plan B,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ahead of the hearing.\n\nThe case centres around a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), that gives the president the power to \"regulate\" trade in response to an emergency.\n\nTrump first invoked IEEPA in February to tax goods from China, Mexico and Canada, saying drug trafficking from those countries constituted an emergency.\n\nHe deployed it again in April, ordering levies from 10% to 50% on goods from almost every country in the world. This time, he said the US trade deficit - where the US imports more than it exports - posed an \"extraordinary and unusual threat\".\n\nThose tariffs took hold in fits and starts this summer while the US pushed countries to strike \"deals\".\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that the power to regulate includes the power to impose tariffs and that the nation faced unique crises – ones that were \"country-killing and not sustainable\" - that necessitated emergency action by the president.\n\nArguing for the administration, Solicitor General John Sauer warned that if Trump's tariff powers were ruled illegal, it would expose the US to \"ruthless trade retaliation\" and lead to \"ruinous economic and national security consequences\".\n\nThe justices' questions suggested they were wrestling with the implications of what a ruling in favour of the administration might mean for the future.\n\n\"The justification is being used for power to impose tariffs on any product from any country in any amount, for any length of time,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said.\n\nUnder the Constitution, America's founding legal document, Congress, not the president, holds the power to tax and the court has traditionally set limits in how much of that authority it can hand over.\n\nIf the court ruled for Trump in this case, Judge Neil Gorsuch, another conservative, wondered: \"What would prohibit Congress from just abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce?\"\n\nHe added that he was \"struggling\" to find a reason to buy Sauer's arguments.\n\n\"Could the president impose a 50 percent tariff on gas-powered cars and autoparts to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat from abroad of climate change?\" he asked.\n\nLawyers for the challenging states and private groups say that the law makes no mention of the word \"tariffs\" and argue that Congress did not intend to give the president an \"open-ended power to junk\" other existing trade deals and tariff rules.\n\nNeil Katyal, making the case for private businesses, said the law did give the president power to cut off trade with an embargo or a quota, but a revenue-raising tariff was a step too far.\n\nThe justices spent relatively little time on questions about refunds or whether the president's emergency declarations were warranted.\n\nInstead they focused on the text of IEEPA and its history. While presidents have used it frequently to impose sanctions, Trump is the first to invoke it for tariffs.\n\nSauer urged the justices to understand tariffs as a natural extension of other powers granted to the president under the law rather than a tax.\n\n\"I can't say it enough - it is a regulatory tariff, not a tax,\" he said.\n\nAt another point, he argued the power to raise revenue was \"only incidental\" - despite the president's frequent boasts about the money being raised via tariffs.\n\nThe distinction between tariffs and a tax appeared to be a stumbling block for many of the justices.\n\n\"You want to say that tariffs are not taxes but that's exactly what they are,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.\n\nOthers justices expressed doubts about putting limits, especially in a national security and foreign policy context.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh said that it did not seem like \"common sense\" to give the president the power to block trade, but not impose a 1% tariff.\n\nThe case has implications for an estimated $90bn worth of import taxes already paid - roughly half the tariff revenue the US collected this year through September, according to Wells Fargo analysts. Trump officials have warned that sum could swell to $1tn if the court takes until June to rule.\n\nThe hearing drew a full audience and stretched nearly three hours, far longer than the judges had officially allotted for the arguments.\n\nIf a majority of the Supreme Court rules in Trump's favour, it will overturn the findings of three lower courts that already ruled against the administration.\n\nSarah Wells, the chief executive and founder of Sarah Wells Bags, sat on the steps outside the court with a group of other small business owners listening to the arguments.\n\nHer business, which designs bags for breast pumps and other items that it manufactures overseas, paid roughly $20,000 in unexpected tariffs earlier this year, then stopped bringing in goods, as it tried to switch its supply chain. She has sold out of inventory, halted product development and laid off some staff.\n\nBut she said she had been encouraged by what she heard.\n\n\"I think that they really understood the overreach that I believe the president has done under IEEPA,\" she said. \"I got the sense that they have the sense that this has to be reined in.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jdv0623pno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"18:42:07.534+00:00","title":"Why the fall of Pokrovsk would matter to Ukraine and Russia","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the strategic importance of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, a key road and rail junction in the Donetsk region.

The battle for this strategic point on a big road and rail artery in the Donetsk region has been going on for well over a year.\n\nIf Russia's Vladimir Putin were able to claim victory there, three years and 10 months into his full-scale war, he would be a step closer to his goal of controlling Ukraine's entire industrial east - the Donbas, made up of the neighbouring regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nClaims and counter-claims abound, so it is difficult to say.  But we do know Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops in the area, and hundreds of its soldiers have infiltrated the city in the past few weeks, gradually taking over buildings and streets and overwhelming Ukrainian positions.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kyiv denied its forces in and around the town had been encircled and maintained they were still involved in \"active resistance\" and blocking out Russian troops. One Ukrainian regiment said it had cleared the city council building and posted video with the Ukrainian flag.\n\nHowever, open-source intelligence maps suggest Moscow's troops are probably occupying large areas of Pokrovsk.\n\nWhile Ukraine's official position is that it is holding its own against Russia, military personnel cited by a war correspondent for Ukraine's Hromadske website said Ukrainian troops were outnumbered and more than 1,000 soldiers were at risk of becoming surrounded.\n\nFor its part Russia said it was continuing to advance northwards and thwarting attempts by Ukraine to break its troops out of encirclement. Ukrainian units were trapped in \"cauldrons\", the defence ministry said, although several commentators said that was not the case.\n\nRussia's military has had its sights trained on Pokrovsk since it captured the eastern city of Avdiivka in February 2024.\n\nIts capture deprived Ukrainian of an important military stronghold in the Donetsk region, but it has since taken 21 months for Russia to advance about 40km (25 miles) to the northwest.\n\nSeizing Pokrovsk would put Vladimir Putin a step closer to his goal of occupying the entire Donbas, even if Russia's advance this year has been extremely slow.\n\nIf Pokrovsk falls, defending its satellite city of Myrnohrad becomes almost untenable and Russian troops would then be able to turn their focus to the battle for Kostyantynivka to the north-east and the rest of the so-called \"fortress belt\" cities of Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.\n\nHowever, Ukraine still had defensive lines to withdraw to and could reset its defence, said analyst Michael Kofman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Russian forces lack momentum and the way they have been fighting won't generate it,\" he wrote on X. \"Infiltration yields a creeping offensive but can't yield operationally significant breakthroughs.\"\n\nPokrovsk is largely deserted now, but it has played a significant strategic role for Ukraine's military during the full-scale invasion.\n\nBefore the war it had a population of some 60,000 people and the city is close to Ukraine's only mine producing coking coal, which is vital for the steel industry. But there hasn't been any coal production there since the start of the year, when the town started being evacuated.\n\nMost importantly Pokrovsk is a key road and rail junction in the east, and losing the city could pave the way for Russian forces to advance on the more central Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nRussian forces are already closing in on the main road to Pavlohrad and Dnipro and to the south-west they have advanced near the Donetsk border with Dnipropetrovsk. Another big road leads to Zaporizhzhia, the capital of another embattled region claimed by Russia.\n\nPutin is understood to have demanded the handover of all of Donetsk as a condition for ending the war.\n\nBut even if Pokrovsk falls that does not mean the rest of Donetsk would too.\n\nUkraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has long insisted that Russia's military will have to keep fighting for several more years if it is to have any chance of fully occupying the entire Donbas.\n\nHe is not alone. The Institute for the Study of War believes Russia has no means of \"rapidly enveloping or penetrating the fortress belt\" and says it would likely take several years.\n\nBut losing Pokrovsk would be a blow for Ukrainian morale at the start of a winter of Russian attacks on power supplies. It would also come at significant cost to manpower, resources and equipment that have been committed to defending the city.\n\nIt might also influence US President Donald Trump's push for an end to the war and strengthen Moscow's negotiating position, proving to Trump that Russia is not the \"paper tiger\" he said it was earlier this autumn.\n\nAlthough he called off his bid to set up a summit with Putin out of frustration that the Russian leader would not agree to a ceasefire, Russian officials have not given up hope on a deal.\n\nPutin may hope that a Russian success will convince Trump to agree to his demands, even if Ukraine and its European allies reject them."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjdwje0ywdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"19:47:32.190+00:00","title":"Hamas hands over another coffin containing remains to Israel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hamas has handed over a coffin containing what it claims is the body of a deceased Israeli hostage to the Red Cross, as required under the US-brokered ceasefire agreement.

But trying to quantify those impacts in terms of price increase is almost impossible at the moment.\"\n\nDiane Swonk, the chief economist for KPMG, believes tariff and immigration policy changes have contributed to higher costs.\n\n\"There's no question that those shifts are now starting to show up as inflation pressures,\" she said.\n\nBut she adds that other factors, including weather events, have contributed.\n\n\"On coffee you had climate issues for a very bad growing season and that was exacerbated by a tariff on Brazil and also Colombia,\" she said.\n\nA White House official told BBC Verify President Trump did not control weather patterns in South America and coffee prices hikes were a global phenomenon.\n\nData that tracks the cost of coffee  shows prices have risen globally, peaking in February, but are now falling.\n\nThe same official said the president was addressing rising beef prices by temporarily increasing imports.\n\nWhile grocery prices are up overall, not every item has become more expensive.\n\nWhen Trump succeeded Biden in January,  the price of a dozen large eggs was $4.93  (£3.79), rising to a record high of $6.23 (£4.78) in March following bird flu outbreaks.\n\nSince then prices have fallen to $3.49 (£2.68) a dozen.\n\n\"President Trump's supply-side policies are taming Joe Biden's inflation crisis,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said.\n\nOther items that have fallen in price over the past 12 months include:  butter and margarine (-2%), ice cream (-0.7%) and frozen vegetables (-0.7%) .\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to cut electricity bills sharply.\n\n\"Under my administration we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,\" he told a rally in August 2024.\n\nSince he became president, prices have risen.\n\nThe latest figures show average residential electricity rates reached  17.62 cents per kWh (kilowatt hour) in August 2025  - up from 15.94 cents per kWh in January 2025, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\n\"It was technically impossible [to halve prices] at the time he made the promise,\" according to Professor James Sweeney from the Stanford Precourt Institute for Energy.\n\nElectricity prices not only reflect the cost of generation but also the expense of delivering it through \"the wires and the transformers and everything else\", he explained.\n\nProf Sweeney attributes the increase to both demand and supply issues.\n\n\"We have a surge in demand mostly driven by data centres. People creating images using artificial intelligence are using significant amounts of electricity.\"\n\nHe added that cuts to renewable energy subsidies and tariffs on imported steel - which raise the cost of building new power generators - have also pushed up prices.\n\nSwonk agreed that the AI boom is pushing up prices, especially for those on lower incomes.\n\n\"It exacerbates inequality because consumers that have more access to solar panels and renewables tend to be wealthier households,\" she said.\n\nIn response a White House official said that Trump was expanding coal, natural gas and nuclear power, which was \"the only viable way to meet the growing energy demand and to lower energy prices\".\n\nAt a campaign rally in September 2024, Trump extended his grocery pledge to cars, telling supporters: \"We're going to get the prices down… groceries, cars, everything\".\n\nHowever,  the average price of a new car topped $50,000  (£38,411) for the first time ever in September, up from $48,283 (£37,092) in January according to Kelley Blue Book, a US vehicle valuation research company.\n\nCar prices typically rise 2-3% a year, explained Erin Keating from Cox Automotive.\n\n\"Tariffs, which have been the biggest factor in the automotive industry over the last 12 months, have been nothing but inflationary.\"\n\nShe explained new car prices are increasing by about 4% a year, with tariffs contributing at least one percentage point.\n\n\"We really think in 2026 that's going to go higher because most of the manufacturers are holding their fire on raising prices directly due to tariffs, but they're going to have to come in at some point.\"\n\nKeating did point to tax breaks for people in Trump's spending bill, which she believes may incentivise people to buy new cars.\n\nWhen asked about the rising price of cars, a White House official told BBC Verify the administration had taken historic regulatory actions to \"reverse the left's radical energy scam and save billions annually\".\n\nTrump made a specific campaign pledge of \"getting gasoline below $2 a gallon\".\n\nOn the day he entered the White House the average price for a gallon of \"regular\" gas was $3.125 (£2.33)  according to the American Automobile Association (AAA) .\n\nWhile a long way short of his pledge to get prices below $2, the price of a gallon of gas  has fallen to a national average of $3.079 (£2.36) .\n\nIn response, a White House official  pointed us to a gas price comparison website , which had a slightly lower national average of $2.97 (£2.38) per gallon compared with the AAA's data.\n\nThe official added that President Trump has quickly unleashed American energy to make gas affordable again for families across the country.\n\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40q990g28o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"22:19:46.795+00:00","title":"Miss Universe contestants walk out after organiser berates Miss Mexico","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a pre-pageant ceremony in Thailand, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly berated Miss Mexico Fatima Bosch for not posting promotional content, calling her a 'dumbhead'.

organiser berates Miss Mexico\n\nSeveral contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation.\n\nAt a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.\n\nWhen she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.\n\nVideo of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online. The Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has condemned Mr Nawat's \"malicious\" behaviour, for which he has since apologised.\n\nThe Miss Universe contestants, who are the winners of national pageants in their home countries, attended Tuesday's event in their sashes and gowns.\n\nSome can be heard shouting back at Mr Nawat in the video, after he raises his voice to reprimand Ms Bosch and repeatedly tells her to stop talking.\n\nAs many of them stand to show support, Mr Nawat says: \"If anyone wants to continue the contest, sit down. If you step out, the rest of the girls continue.\"\n\nDespite this, the majority of the women in the video appear standing, with several heading towards the door.\n\nAfter leaving the event on Tuesday, Ms Bosch told the press the 60-year-old executive was \"not respectful\" and said he had called her \"dumb\".\n\nMr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood.\n\nHe is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying she had caused \"damage\".\n\nHis conduct prompted a stern rebuke from the MUO, which has sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.\n\nIn a video statement, MUO President Raul Rocha said Mr Nawat had \"forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\".\n\nHe said the Thai official had \"humiliated, insulted and showed a lack of respect\" to Ms Bosch, and committed the \"serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenceless woman\".\n\nMr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited \"as much as possible\" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking \"legal actions\" against him.\n\n\"I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,\" Mr Rocha said.\n\nAmong those to walk out on Tuesday was reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark.\n\n\"This is about women's rights,\" she said as she left the event. \"This is not how things should be handled. To trash another girl is beyond disrespectful... That's why I'm taking my coat and I'm walking out.\"\n\nMs Bosch later said in an interview: \"I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard. It's here stronger than ever. I have a purpose. I have things to say.\n\n\"We're in the 21st century.

I especially apologised to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.\"\n\nThe Miss Universe competition has pressed on despite this controversy, with contestants taking part in a welcome event in Bangkok on Wednesday.\n\nThe winner will be crowned the new Miss Universe on 21 November."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lq751964mo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"21:19:52.240+00:00","title":"Pope Leo offers his strongest criticism of Trump yet","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo, the first U.S.-born pope, has delivered one of his strongest public critiques of President Donald Trump's immigration and foreign policy, warning that mass deportations by ICE and military actions in Venezuela violate Christian principles of compassion and peace.

on how migrants are treated in the United States, where he said many people were deeply affected by the controversial policy of mass deportation.\n\nIn some of his strongest criticism to date of President Donald Trump's administration, the first ever US-born pope also warned that the US bombing of Venezuelan ships, suspected of carrying drugs, risked increasing tensions in the region.\n\nEmerging to address a bank of TV cameras outside his papal retreat at Castel Gandolfo and offering to answer \"one or two questions\", Pope Leo XIV said there were people who have lived in the US \"for years and years never causing problems, who have been deeply affected\" by Trump's hardline policy on migration.\n\nSpeaking in English, and reaching a US audience directly, he reiterated the Catholic belief that every Christian will ultimately be judged on how they welcomed \"the foreigner\".\n\n\"I was struck by how direct his reference was because he's obviously talking about the ICE round-ups,\" Catholic historian Austen Ivereigh told the BBC, referring to the immigration enforcement body in the US.\n\n\"It's very strong.\"\n\nInitially, after his election in May, Leo's comments on geopolitics were cautious. Then last month he used the word \"inhuman\" in reference to the Trump-led crackdown, shaking conservative Catholics in his own country who had embraced the \"American Pope\".\n\nThey had seen Pope Leo as an ally after a fractious relationship with his predecessor, Francis, who once described Trump as \"not Christian\" for building a wall on the border with Mexico.\n\n\"Now they're waking up to the fact that Leo isn't going to change church teaching for their sake,\" Mr Ivereigh said. \"They realise that he's very different from Francis in his style, but it's the same teaching and priorities. He's very much a continuation.\"\n\nBorn in Chicago, Pope Leo – or Robert Prevost as he was then – spent much of his working life as a missionary in Peru, an experience that has also shaped his approach.\n\n\"I think this is an issue that matters to him personally,\" Professor Anna Rowlands of Durham University said. \"He has lived in countries affected by these policies, and been welcomed himself as a migrant. He was in effect a migrant bishop.\"\n\nIn his first major document, published last month, Pope Leo revealed that the issues of poverty and migration would remain at the heart of his papacy. He stressed that message at a recent meeting in the Vatican with US bishops.\n\n\"Leo offers an entirely orthodox response\" to migration, Prof Rowlands pointed out, \"straight down the line.\"\n\nHe is, she said, citing a church tradition stretching back more than 100 years on the issue, that includes ensuring the rights of families to remain together and protecting their spiritual needs.\n\nThe Pope underlined that last point himself when journalists asked about an immigration facility near Chicago where detainees have reportedly been barred from receiving communion. Many people targeted in the ICE raids are Catholic, from the Americas.\n\n\"I would certainly invite the authorities to allow pastoral workers to attend to the needs of those people,\" he said.\n\nOn Venezuela, and the Trump administration's policy of targeting ships and killing crew members, the Pope called for dialogue and calm.\n\n\"I think that with violence we won't win,\" he said in Italian.\n\nHe suggested that the deployment of US Navy vessels close to Venezuela was increasing tension rather than working to \"defend the peace.\"\n\nSix months on from his surprise election, the contours of Pope Leo's papacy are becoming clearer and his habit of visiting Castel Gandolfo, shunned by Francis, has also brought new transparency: For years, journalists have had to wait for a papal trip abroad to get anywhere near the head of the church and put their questions.\n\n\"When the Pope speaks very definitely like this, it does put pressure on the US administration – particularly those who identify as Catholics,\" Mr Iverleigh said.\n\n\"So far, Leo's avoided getting entangled in the whole Trump machine. Maybe he's taking that risk now.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9pgev02pno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"21:00:41.353+00:00","title":"Mexico president to seek charges after being groped on street","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has announced that she will press charges against a man who groped her during a public appearance near the National Palace in Mexico City.

Around 35 candidates were killed in the lead up to the general election last year in what was considered the bloodiest campaign in modern Mexico.\n\nSince taking office, Sheinbaum has made in-roads in improving the country's dire security situation, particularly clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, President Trump."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9zp55v33o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"23:01:23.974+00:00","title":"Namewee: Controversial rapper held over influencer's death","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Malaysian rapper Namewee has been remanded in custody in connection with the death of Taiwanese influencer Iris Hsieh, who was found dead in a Kuala Lumpur hotel bathtub.

31-year-old Iris Hsieh, according to reports. She was in Malaysia to discuss a commercial video Namewee had agreed to direct, her social media manager told the BBC.\n\nNamewee, who denies charges of  illegal drug use and possession  for which he was granted bail, is now back in custody to \"assist in the investigation\", police said after reclassifying her death as murder.\n\nHe turned himself in early on Wednesday, his lawyer said, and has been put on remand for six days.\n\nThe case has gone through many twists in the last few days.\n\nAccording to Malaysian media reports, Namewee contacted emergency services at 12:30 local time (05:30 GMT) on 22 October, after he found Hsieh unresponsive in the bathroom.\n\nPolice arrested Namewee that same day, after they found nine blue pills believed to be ecstasy in the hotel room.\n\nDespite denying he had used drugs, Namewee tested positive for several illicit substances, including amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine, and THC, police said.\n\nOn Monday, he pleaded not guilty to the drug charges and was released on bail.\n\nNamewee has maintained his innocence over the past few days and accused local media of \"chasing shadows\" with their reports on the case.\n\nThe singer, known for his satirical and profanity-laced music, has 3.6m subscribers on YouTube and 856,000 followers on Instagram. Singing in Mandarin, he is hugely popular in Taiwan and China.\n\nHsieh was previously featured in Namewee's music video for China Reggaeton, a song he released in January 2020.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kuala Lumpur police chief Fadil Marsus told reporters Namewee had \"gone into hiding\" after Hsieh's case was reclassified from \"sudden death\" to murder.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Fadil said police were waiting for post-mortem and toxicology results to determine the cause of death.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, Namewee posted a clip on Instagram saying he had arrived at the police station and would \"fully co-operate with the police to provide answers to the public and the bereaved family\".\n\n\"I won't run away,\" he added.\n\nNamewee, whose real name is Wee Meng Chee, has long courted controversy with his music.\n\nOften seen wearing a beanie and sunglasses, he first gained popularity - and notoriety - in 2007 with his controversial remake of Malaysia's national anthem, Negaraku, which mocked the government.\n\nThe music video quickly went viral on YouTube and authorities considered charging him with sedition, but did not proceed after he made a public apology and removed the clip.\n\nIn 2016, he was arrested for his music video  Oh My God , which features him rapping in front of places of worship around Malaysia. Authorities said the song insulted Islam and jailed him for four days.\n\nHis 2021 song Fragile  poked fun at \"little pinks\"  - young nationalists who rush to the defence of the Chinese government on the internet - and took digs at several sensitive issues, from Xinjiang to Taiwan sovereignty.\n\nThat track went viral among Mandarin-speaking audiences, but was banned by China. Speaking to the BBC in 2021, Namewee said he saw the ban as \"part of my creative work\".\n\n\"Some people think that my work is controversial, or that I have always been crossing the red line,\" he said at the time. \"Sometimes I intend to do so...

administration in his first press conference since winning the mayoral race on Tuesday.\n\nThe 34-year-old announced his transition team and said he would tackle the \"twin crises\" of \"an authoritarian administration and an affordability crisis\".\n\nTrump has referred to the mayor-elect as a communist - a label that Mamdani rejects, and has  implied the administration would withhold federal funding from New York City  if he won.\n\nThe president hinted at a new political rivalry on Election Night, posting \"AND SO IT BEGINS!\" on his Truth Social account shortly after Mamdani won.\n\nTrump has referred to Mamdani as \"extreme,\" and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has said his party will tie Democrats to Mamdani's policies in next years' midterm elections.\n\nMamdani is a self-ascribed democratic socialist. It has no clear definition but essentially means giving a voice to workers, not corporations. Mamdani has promised to tax millionaires to pay for expanded social programmes.\n\n\"I hope it works out for New York,\" Trump said of Mamdani on Wednesday. \"We'll help him a little bit, maybe.\"\n\nIn his election night speech, Mamdani addressed Trump directly, telling him to \"turn the volume up\" on his television to hear the enthusiasm of his supporters.\n\nHe again spoke of the president in his remarks on Wednesday, saying he would not \"mince my words\" when it comes to Trump. But he also acknowledged he would always leave a \"door open\" to have conversations with the Trump administration to discuss his priorities, such as bringing down the cost of living.\n\nIn both his victory speech and his first press conference, Mamdani spoke at length of his plans to deliver on signature campaign promises like free buses and freezing the cost of rent stabilised apartments.\n\nMamdani named several members of his transition team: Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission chair; Elana Leopold, who worked for former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio; and Maria Torres-Springer, a former deputy mayor in the outgoing Eric Adams administration.\n\nThey will be tasked with helping Mamdani assemble his administration ahead of his 1 January 2026 inauguration.\n\nMamdani also confirmed that he would keep Jessica Tisch as New York City Police Department commissioner, after facing questions about his public safety agenda throughout the campaign.\n\n\"It will be my job to stand up for the city and also to ensure that we do not look at Washington DC as if it is the reason for all of the problems right here in New York City,\" Mamdani said.\n\nThe dynamic with Trump will likely hover over Mamdani's transition and the early months of his administration.

Zohran Mamdani won New York City’s mayoral race with over one million votes, becoming the first candidate to reach that threshold since 1969, while Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill flipped the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively. Voter concerns centered on affordability — rent, food, and childcare — which was the top issue across all three races, with a majority of Latino voters supporting Democratic candidates. These victories signal a reversal of the 2024 trend where Trump gained strong support among Latino voters. Experts like Ben Rhodes and Andrew Koneschusky argue that the party’s focus on affordability is resonating across demographics and may give Democrats a unifying message for the 2026 midterms. However, the party now faces internal challenges in balancing progressive and moderate candidates, with calls for a more regionally tailored strategy.

governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, it is clear the Democratic Party will be buoyed by a big election night on Tuesday.\n\nIt is a far cry from the scenes after last year's presidential election, when the party was left searching for answers after Donald Trump and the Republicans scored a hugely dominant victory.\n\nThe results also mark a year until vital midterm elections. So with the picture of the night becoming clearer, here's what we've learned from the results.\n\nThe Democrats notched key victories as they swept the first major elections of Trump's second term.\n\nThere were joyous celebrations at the various candidate headquarters, a stark contrast to the downbeat scenes after the party's bruising 2024 defeat.\n\nAbigail Spanberger won in Virginia, flipping the governorship from Republican, while Mikie Sherrill was elected governor in New Jersey. Both won decisively, securing more than 56% of the vote.\n\nIn New York City, Zohran Mamdani beat independent Andrew Cuomo and became the first candidate to pass one million votes since 1969.\n\nBarack Obama's former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told the BBC that Mamdani had \"changed the electorate\" by urging young people and immigrants to vote.\n\n\"He most importantly built a movement,\" he said.\n\nThe series of decisive victories may well boost a party that has at times struggled to counter President Trump's rapidly-enacted second term agenda, and rebound from its 2024 defeat.\n\n\"The Democrats are back and we're winning,\" said Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin on Wednesday. \"We've got the momentum going into the midterm elections.\"\n\nOf course, much could change before those 2026 elections and there is no guarantee the same patterns seen on Tuesday will play out again.\n\nPledging to bring down the cost of rent, food and childcare was at the core of Mamdani's left-wing campaign, but it was also a winning issue for the more moderate Democrats elsewhere.\n\nSherrill in New Jersey and Spanberger in Virginia both made tackling the high cost of living front and centre in their governor campaigns. And it was seemingly top of voters' minds, too.\n\nExit poll data from the major US networks indicated that in all three races the most important issue for voters was the economy and affordability.\n\nAnd tellingly, according to exit poll data from the BBC's US partner CBS News, a majority of voters who named the economy as their most important issue voted for the Democratic candidate in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nIt may well give the party a message to coalesce around ahead of the crucial midterm elections next year - and pose a challenge for Republicans to counter.\n\n\"I can't see into the future, but I see Republicans losing the House if Americans are continuing to go paycheck-to-paycheck,\"  Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene told Semafor recently .\n\n\"It's clearer than ever that affordability needs to be the centrepiece of the Democrats' message going into the midterms,\" political communications expert Andrew Koneschusky told the AFP news agency.\n\n\"The affordability message cuts across demographics and highlights a major vulnerability for Republicans,\" he said.\n\nWhen Trump scored his decisive victory over Kamala Harris last year, he racked up huge support from Latino voters who had been a key part of the Democratic voter base for decades.\n\nTrump saw a huge 14 percentage-point increase in support from that demographic compared to the 2020 election, according to exit polls. No Republican presidential candidate had ever won a higher percentage with Latino voters.\n\nAnd while he wasn't on the ballot on Tuesday night, there were some potentially concerning signs for his Republican Party. The winning candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey both had wide leads of around 30% with Latino voters, according to exit poll data.\n\nThere are interesting shifts, too, when examining the results more closely.\n\nPassaic County in New Jersey - which census data shows is almost half Latino - is often cited by analysts as a bellwether for Trump's support among those voters. He won it by 3 percentage points in 2024, yet Sherrill won it by 15 on Tuesday over her Republican opponent.\n\nMike Madrid, a Republican political consultant who specialises in Latino voting trends, suggested the cost of living and messaging around the economy again played a key role.\n\n\"No poll taken anywhere in the country in the past month has anything other than the economy as the top issue for Latinos,\" he said.\n\nIn liberal New York, Mamdani ran as a democratic socialist who will tax millionaires and corporations to the tune of $9bn (£6.9bn), in order to pay for policies such as free childcare and buses.\n\nIt was a different story, however, in the governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia, where Republicans have had far more electoral success in the past.\n\nIn those states, the two Democratic candidates were establishment-backed moderates who emphasised pragmatic policies more likely to appeal to voters less liberal than those in New York City.\n\nThe night itself illustrated the broad differences in the party between its left-wing and centrists, and raised questions over how it will approach elections and candidate selection in the future.\n\nKoneschusky suggested Democrats needed to field candidates who reflect the specific electorate, rather than taking a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach.\n\n\"In some cases, that may mean fielding progressive candidates. In other cases, it may mean moderate or centrist candidates,\" he said.\n\nNew York City comptroller and Mamdani ally Brad Lander echoed this point,  telling the BBC's Nada Tawfik  that Democratic leadership must acknowledge different things will work in different parts of the country and they should allow the primary process to play out."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c797r2d3nwyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"17:34:39.523+00:00","title":"Raymond Koh: Wife of abducted Malaysian pastor wins landmark lawsuit against state","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The wife of Malaysian pastor Raymond Koh, Susanna Liew, has won a landmark legal case against the Malaysian government and police, establishing that the state and Royal Malaysian Police were responsible for his enforced disappearance in 2017.

against the police and the government, in a landmark case that has gripped the nation.\n\nRaymond Koh was pulled out of his car  by masked men in a suburb of the capital Kuala Lumpur in 2017. His whereabouts remain unknown - his family has long maintained he was taken by police.\n\nOn Wednesday, the high court ruled he had been forcibly disappeared, with the judge holding the government and police responsible for his abduction. It is Malaysia's first such judgement.\n\nThe court also ruled the state must pay at least 31m ringgit (£5.7m; $7.4m) in damages, which would likely benefit Mr Koh's family. The final sum is set to be the largest in Malaysian legal history.\n\nIn an emotional speech following the decision, his wife Susanna Liew told reporters: \"We are overjoyed and thankful to God that we have a fair and honest judgement.\n\n\"Though this will not bring Pastor Raymond back, it is somewhat a vindication and closure for the family,\" she said.\n\n\"We dedicate this struggle and judgement to Pastor Raymond Koh, a man of compassion and courage, and to all victims of enforced disappearances.\"\n\nThe disappearance of Mr Koh, along with the abduction of activist Amri Che Mat, has long intrigued Malaysia.\n\nBoth cases took place within months of each other between the end of 2016 and early 2017, and led to heated public speculation.\n\nMr Koh's case, in particular, dominated the headlines because his abduction took place in broad daylight and had been captured on a CCTV camera, and was witnessed by passers-by.\n\nBoth families had insisted that the men had been taken by the police, which the police consistently denied.\n\nThe men's disappearances prompted two investigations, one conducted by Malaysia's human rights commission, and another by the government.\n\nBoth investigations eventually concluded that the men had likely been abducted by the elite Special Branch of the police as they were perceived as threats to mainstream Islam in Muslim-majority Malaysia.\n\nThe government report - which was classified as secret until the families sued for access - said that \"rogue cops\" were responsible for the abductions, and the official who led the operation had \"extreme views\" against Christians and Shia Muslims.\n\nMr Koh had been targeted because he was suspected of proselytising to Muslims, which his family has denied. Apostasy is illegal in Malaysia.\n\nAmri Che Mat had come under suspicion as he is a Shia Muslim. Malaysia practises a moderate form of Sunni Islam.\n\nThe wives of Raymond Koh and Amri Che Mat separately sued the state for damages and to force the authorities to reveal their husbands' whereabouts.\n\nOn Wednesday, the high court ruled that police officials, the Royal Malaysian Police, and the Malaysian government were liable for the abduction of Mr Koh.\n\nBesides awarding several million ringgit to Ms Liew for emotional distress, the judge ruled that 10,000 ringgit (£1,830; $2,385) in general damages be paid for each day of Mr Koh's disappearance, starting from when he was abducted and ending on the day his whereabouts are disclosed by the state.\n\nThe judge also ordered the state to reopen the investigation and ascertain Mr Koh's whereabouts.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the rolling sum of the general damages works out to be around 31.8m ringgit. The final figure is expected to become the largest payout in Malaysian history, according to lawyers acting for Ms Liew.\n\nThe money will be deposited into a trust, to which Ms Liew and her children will likely be named as beneficiaries.\n\nThe high court judge also found the government and police liable for Amri Che Mat's abduction. His wife Norhayati, who sued for lesser offences compared to Ms Liew's lawsuit, was awarded about 3m ringgit.\n\n\"The feeling of sadness remains because questions about Amri's whereabouts, whether he is alive, dead, or in good health, are all still unanswered,\" Norhayati told reporters.\n\n\"We sincerely hope that those responsible will be held accountable for what they have done.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lqr30l246o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-06","timeOfPublication":"00:15:58.402+00:00","title":"Prop 50 redistricting passes in California to give Democrats advantage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California voters have approved Prop 50, a redistricting measure designed to shift congressional boundaries to give Democrats a greater chance of winning five House seats in the 2026 midterms.

2025-11-06T00:15:58.402+00:00\n\nTitle: Prop 50 redistricting passes in California to give Democrats advantage\n\nVoters in California have approved a measure to redraw political lines to favour Democrats - launching a counterattack against similar efforts by conservative-led states in a nationwide battle for control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nWith more than 70% of the votes counted, CBS projects the redistricting measure, called Prop 50, has passed.\n\nIt is aimed at reconfiguring the state's voting districts to give Democrats better chances at taking five House seats from Republicans during next year's midterm elections.\n\nWhether this will tip the balance of power in Washington remains unclear as more Republican-led states are redrawing their voting lines under pressure from President Donald Trump.\n\nCurrently, Republicans hold a small, five-seat majority in the 435-member House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nIf Democrats win a majority in the chamber in the 2026 election, they will be able to stunt Trump's legislative agenda for at least the next two years and also lead congressional oversight of his administration - action that could range from investigations, complete with subpoenas, to impeachment.\n\nA look nationally shows the effort in Democrat-heavy California won't be enough on its own to cancel out gains by Republicans who have also redone voting maps. Four Republican-led states have already redrawn their lines so far this year, giving the party a likely advantage in nine new voting districts.\n\nStill, experts told the BBC that even after changing the districts, Republicans might lose control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nThey are called midterm elections, where voters cast ballots for congressional candidates as well as state ones, because they take place in the middle of a president's four-year term. Historically, a president often loses power of at least one chamber in Congress in the midterms.\n\nThe Brookings Institution has found that the party of the president lost House seats in 20 of the last 22 midterm elections - going back to 1938.\n\n\"There are a lot of unknowns still and a lot can happen before the midterms politically, but looking at it historically - this is an uphill battle for Republicans,\" said Galen Sheely, research director for the State Voting Laws Roundup project, a collaboration between the Brennan Center for Justice and the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nRedistricting typically is done once every 10 years, to reflect population changes recorded by the US Census.\n\nRedrawing voting lines in the middle of the decade to try to engineer election gains is \"a new strategy that is pushing boundaries that haven't been pushed before\", Dr Sheely added.\n\nThe tit-for-tat redistricting battle started with Trump pressuring conservative-led states to redraw their congressional districts to help Republicans retain control of the House. Now, more than a dozen US states are openly mulling plans to redraw voting lines - known as political gerrymandering.\n\n\"Regardless of whether it's Democrats or Republicans, this is just not good for our republic in the long term,\" said Erik Nisbet, a professor at Northwestern University. \"The question now is where does this stop? It's political sabotage to our democracy.\"\n\nFrom his viewpoint, the battle runs the risk of both eroding trust in the government, with people seeing their votes and representation in Washington diminished, along with erasing battleground districts where members of both parties have equal shots at winning the seat.\n\nRepresentatives from those districts often are crucial to negotiating deals and finding middle ground - things that have become harder in Congress amid a bitter political divide, he said.\n\n\"It's hard to not mention the ongoing government shutdown in this,\" he added. \"This will worsen polarisation and gridlock in Congress. And the ripple effect of that will mean emboldening this president and future presidents to act unilaterally without Congress.\"\n\nTrump, who began his redistricting push with Texas, has argued that he and Republicans are entitled to more congressional seats due to him winning those states in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nTexas responded to Trump's call by redoing its maps to give Republicans an advantage in five new seats. And in turn, California Democrats introduced Prop, short for \"Proposition\", 50.\n\nCalifornia's governor, Democrat Gavin Newsom, a Trump foe with reported presidential ambitions, championed Prop 50. He is now pushing Democrats to follow his lead and fight fire with fire - something he argues the party hasn't been willing to do in the past.\n\n\"These folks don't play by the rules,\" he has said of Republicans. \"If they can't win playing the game with the existing set of rules, they'll change the rules. That's what Donald Trump has done.\"\n\nHigh-profile Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Rep Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Kamala Harris helped fundraise and generate support for the measure across the country.\n\nCampaigns in support of the measure and against it received $200m total, but Democrats far outraised Republicans, with Newsom telling donors last week that they could stop sending in money.\n\nIf other states do not join in, though, the proposition and its momentum may not lead to a significant change in the House.\n\nWhile it could help score five seats for Democrats, more and more Republican-led states are also changing their maps.\n\nNorth Carolina, Missouri and Ohio have all passed new maps that give Republicans a new edge. Utah has also passed a new map, which would give Democrats an advantage in one district, but it is under legal review.\n\nEach state decides its voting districts differently and many Republican-led states have had an easier time changing their maps, due to their state laws, election deadlines, current districts or political leadership.\n\nTexas, for instance, created its new districts through the state legislature.\n\nCalifornia, though, needed voter support to change its political maps.\n\nUnder a state law intended to halt political gerrymandering, an independent commission usually sets California's voting districts once a decade. To deviate from that, the state had to call a special election, where Prop 50 was the only thing on the ballot, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $200m. The new Prop 50 maps will only be in use until 2030 when the commission will again redraw the districts.\n\nHours after the vote was called in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit challenging Prop 50. They're arguing the congressional maps that voters approved violate constitutional protections against racial gerrymandering, typically where districts are drawn to drown out the votes of minority groups.\n\nAs leaders in both liberal and conservative-leaning states look into redistricting, another factor is looming on the horizon, threatening to make an impact on the 2026 midterms: The  Supreme Court is currently reviewing a case  that - depending on the ruling - could drastically reshape how districts are drawn."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mxkmzyx2eo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"20:46:51.438+00:00","title":"Seven Italian climbers still missing in Nepal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Seven Italian climbers are still missing in Nepal after attempting to climb the Dolma Khang peak (6,332m) in Dolakha district, following an avalanche that killed three climbers.

victory speech, the mayor-elect had a special shoutout for his wife standing beside him.\n\n\"And to my incredible wife, Rama, hayati,\" he said, using the Arabic word for \"my life\". \"There is no one I would rather have by my side in this moment, and in every moment.\"\n\nDuwaji is a New York-based artist with Syrian roots whose work often explores Middle Eastern themes. Her work has appeared on BBC News, and in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Vice and London's Tate Modern museum.\n\n\"Rama isn't just my wife; she's an incredible artist who deserves to be known on her own terms,\" Mamdani wrote in a post on 12 May, announcing they had been married three months earlier.\n\n\"Omg she's real,\" Duwaji joked in a comment on that post.\n\nThe couple met on dating app Hinge, \"so there is still hope in those dating apps,\" Mamdani said in an interview with The Bulwark.\n\nShe was rarely seen at the start of her husband's election campaign, leading opponents to claim that the 34-year-old state assemblyman was \"hiding\" his wife.\n\nHer absence was notable, given that US candidates often put their spouses on full display to show off their commitment to family values.\n\nMamdani addressed the criticism over his wife's absence in his May post, which included a series of photos showing their marriage at the New York City Clerk's office.\n\n\"If you take a look at Twitter today, or any day for that matter, you know how vicious politics can be,\"  he wrote .\n\n\"I usually brush it off, whether it's death threats or calls for me to be deported. But it's different when it's about those you love.... You can critique my views, but not my family.\"\n\nDuwaji opted to stay out of the spotlight - even as her husband's profile ballooned - but is said to have been a driving force behind the scenes, according to CNN.\n\nShe was among those who finalised Mamdani's brand identity, including the bold iconography and font used on his yellow, orange and blue campaign materials, it said.\n\nDuwaji was born in Houston, Texas, and moved to Dubai when she was nine years old, before briefly going to school in Qatar. Her parents are Syrian Muslims originally from Damascus, according to Arabic media.\n\nDespite largely steering clear of the cameras, several of Duwaji's friends have gushed about her in interviews amid speculation about her role in a Mamdani administration.\n\n\"She's our modern day Princess Diana,\" one friend, Hasnain Bhatti, declared to the New York Times last month.\n\nOthers described Duwaji as being excited but overwhelmed by the growing attention, the NY post reported.\n\nDuwaji graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University before earning a master's degree in illustration from the School of Visual Arts in New York City.\n\n\"Using drawn portraiture and movement, Rama examines the nuances of sisterhood and communal experiences,\" Ms Duwaji's professional website reads.\n\nMuch of her work is in black and white, and depicts scenes from the Arab world. Ms Duwaji herself was born in Texas and is ethnically Syrian, a campaign spokesman told the New York Times.\n\nIn 2022, her works appeared in the BBC World Service documentary  \"Who killed my grandfather\"  that investigated the assassination of a Yemeni politician in 1974.\n\nSome of her works listed on Instagram criticise \"American imperialism,\" what she called Israeli war crimes and denounce the \"ethnic cleansing\" of Palestinians, mirroring some of her husband's policy positions. Israel emphatically denies accusations of genocide in Gaza.\n\nHer works also show support for  Mahmoud Khalil , a Columbia University graduate that the Trump administration is seeking to deport over claims that his work advocating for Palestinians amounts to \"antisemitism\" towards Jews.\n\nThe Brooklyn-based artist spent most of the coronavirus pandemic in Dubai, where her family lives, she said in an April interview with website  YUNG .\n\nIn that interview, she was asked about recent events in the Middle East, the return to the White House of Donald Trump and sharp uptick in immigration raids.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, things are dark right now in NYC,\" she said. \"I worry for my friends and family, and things feel completely out of my hands.\"\n\n\"With so many people being pushed out and silenced by fear, all I can do is use my voice to speak out about what's happening in the US and Palestine and Syria as much as I can,\" she added.\n\nShe was also asked about the responsibly that artists have to speak out about global issues.\n\n\"An artist's duty as far as I'm concerned is to reflect the times,\" she said, quoting musician Nina Simone.\n\n\"I believe everyone has a responsibility to speak out against injustice, and art has such an ability to spread it,\" she continued.\n\n\"I don't think everybody has to make political work, but art is inherently political in how it's made, funded, and shared. Even creating art as a refuge from the horrors we see is political to me. It's a reaction to the world around us.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0510463p9do","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"17:01:40.276+00:00","title":"Zohran Mamdani: Ugandans take pride in New York mayor with roots in their country","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights the global celebration of Zohran Mamdani’s election as New York City mayor, emphasizing his Ugandan roots and the pride he has generated among Ugandans and across the African continent.

expressing their pride in the newly elected mayor of New York, Zohran Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and retains dual nationality.\n\nSome have described him as one of \"their own\", saying he inspires them.\n\nA journalist who mentored him during his teenage internship at one of Uganda's leading newspapers told the BBC that there was a \"lot of excitement\" in Uganda about Mamdani's rise especially because of his young age. Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide of just 16.2, according to the CIA World Factbook.\n\nZohran, 34, is the son of Prof Mahmood Mamdani, a prominent Ugandan academic, while his mother, Mira Nair, is an acclaimed filmmaker.\n\nJournalist Angelo Izama told the BBC's Newsday programme that the younger Mamdani was \"initially shy\" while they worked together, but was \"absolutely determined to get things done\".\n\nHe says Zohran is \"very fond of Kampala\", Uganda's capital, which he often mentions.\n\nMahmood Mamdani was raised in Uganda and worked for more than a decade at Makerere University, the country's main and oldest university. He met his wife in Kampala while she was researching Mississippi Masala, a film about the expulsion of Asians from Uganda under Idi Amin.\n\nProf Mamdani is known for his anti-colonialist scholarship, which examines the legacy of colonialism in Africa and its impact on governance, identity and justice.\n\nMakerere University professor Okello Ogwang says he \"feels great\" about Zohran's success, describing him as the \"son of a colleague. This is somebody from home\".\n\n\"We have one of us there,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"It gives me hope that the children we are raising are the hope of this world. As a continent... we are missing out on the greatest resource we have - the youth.\"\n\nWhile many Ugandans had not heard of Zohran until his election, a student at the university said people were \"very happy\", saying it proved that anyone could rise above their background.\n\n\"It gives morale, especially to us as youths,\" said Abno Collins Kuloba. \"Wherever you have grown up, be it poor or rich, you can become something big, like what [Mamdani] has done.\"\n\nAnother student, Chemtai Zamzam, said she was happy, for herself and Ugandans. She said Mamdani was an inspiration to her as a young person, as \"it shows we can become anything we want as long as we put faith and determination\".\n\nThe new mayor is also being celebrated elsewhere in the continent.\n\nAbdul Mohamed, an Ethiopian who is a former senior UN and African Union official, describes Mahmood Mamdani as \"a distinguished scholar of African politics\", a man who interrogated power and justice.\n\nHe says having known Zohran since infancy, he sees him as having inherited his father's \"commitment to pan-Africanism\", his parents' \"courage to think freely,\" and their belief that one can \"belong everywhere\".\n\nHe says Zohran's rise is symbolic and practical especially to young Africans, asking them to draw from him lessons in politics.\n\n\"I think through him, [the] power and beauty of multi-ethnic, multi-religious identity found its voice. And Africa is by and large a multi-ethnic and a multi-religious society,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that as Zohran has demonstrated, young people need to organise and build political action and \"avoid despair and avoid pure anger\".\n\nUganda is holding elections next year, with 81-year-old President Yoweri Museveni seeking another term after almost 40 years in power.\n\nThe Mamdani family also spent at around three years in Cape Town, South Africa, after Mahmood was appointed the Chair of African Studies at the University of Cape Town in the 1990s.\n\nSome South Africans have also been taking pride in his historic election.\n\nHailing his victory as as a \"remarkable achievement\", the imam of Cape Town's Claremont Road Mosque, Rashied Omar, said that Zohran's \"formative years were shaped, in small part, in our congregation\".\n\nHe said that Zohran began his Islamic education at the mosque, and started his schooling at St George's Grammar.\n\n\"It is inspiring to see how Zohran's early South African experiences, though modest, made a lasting impression on his political consciousness and helped shape his creative, community-based approach to politics,\" Dr Omar said.\n\n\"As South African social justice activists, we can now learn from Zohran's example, how to practise progressive politics that resonates with new generations and builds bridges across race, class, and faith,\" he added.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the fourth-biggest party in South Africa which champions left-wing economic policies, also hailed Zohran's victory as historic.\n\n\"His election represents not only a transformative moment for the people of New York but also a powerful signal to the world that progressive justice-driven leadership is rising even in the heart of the global capitalist order,\" the party said in a statement.\n\nIn Nigeria, a Christian pastor who is a supporter of President Bola Tinubu also welcomed Zohran's victory.\n\nPastor Okezie J Atañi said on X that Nigeria \"cannot be threatened\"  by US President Donald Trump, whose \"threats could not subdue\" the 34-year-old Zohran.\n\nLast week,  Trump threatened to take military action to tackle Islamist insurgents in Nigeria , accusing the government of failing to protect Christians.\n\nGovernment officials responded by saying that jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mohammed Allie in Cape Town and Mansur Abubakar in Abuja\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"}]}
