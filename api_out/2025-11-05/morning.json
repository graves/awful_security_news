Mikie Sherrill  won the race for governor in New Jersey, maintaining Democratic control of the seat one year after the state showed signs of shifting toward President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill, who will be the first female Democratic governor in the state’s history, defeated Republican nominee  Jack Ciattarelli , a former state assemblyman and Trump ally making his third run for governor. She is set to follow the term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, marking the first time a party has held the governor’s office in New Jersey for more than two full consecutive terms in the last 50 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s victory likely will be viewed as a repudiation of Trump’s first year in office and demonstrates the Democratic Party’s staying power in New Jersey even as it rebuilds on the national level.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill put opposition to Trump and his agenda at the center of her campaign messaging, often linking Ciattarelli to the Republican president. She hewed to moderate policies and prioritized cost-of-living concerns, including rolling out plans to address  skyrocketing utility costs  in the state.\n \n\n   \n  Along with Abigail Spanberger, who won the race for Virginia governor on Tuesday, Sherrill represents what many Democratic leaders believe is a model for reversing Trump’s gains by running more moderate candidates with backgrounds in national security and public service.\n \n\n   \n  Her win comes a year after Trump made significant gains in the state in the 2024 election. Trump lost New Jersey by 6 points to former Vice President Kamala Harris but reduced his margin of defeat by 10 points compared with 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Polling leading up to the race showed Sherrill with a narrow edge over Ciattarelli, but she eventually won the race by a margin of double digits.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill, a 53-year-old attorney and mother of four, was first elected to Congress in 2018 as part of a blue wave in Trump’s first term in office. A former Navy helicopter pilot, Sherrill featured her military experience in her campaign advertisements, saying in one TV spot, “I know the world feels like it is on fire right now, but I was trained in the Navy that in a crisis, you run to the fight.”\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli, meanwhile, sought to tie Sherrill to the outgoing Democratic administration in Trenton, which he blamed for high energy costs, and to progressive Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City. Ciattarelli, a former critic of Trump, embraced the president throughout much of his campaign,  saying in one debate  that Trump’s second-term performance deserved an “A” grade.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill held a slight edge in public polling over Ciattarelli for most of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  In the final stretch, the candidates traded increasingly personal and heated attacks.\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli  amplified a story  about Sherrill not walking at her graduation from the Naval Academy as punishment connected to a massive cheating scandal, prompting the New Jersey Democrat to defend her military service. Sherrill’s unredacted military records were also mistakenly released by a branch of the National Archives, prompting calls for investigations from her Democratic allies.\n \n\n   \n  In their final debate, Sherrill attempted to blame Ciattarelli for “tens of thousands” of opioid deaths in New Jersey, arguing that his medical publishing company produced materials misleading people about the risks of opioid abuse. Ciattarelli’s campaign strongly pushed back on the claim, at one point threatening to sue Sherrill.\n \n\n   \n  Outside Democratic and Republican groups poured millions of dollars into the race, making it the most expensive gubernatorial contest in New Jersey history. High-profile surrogates campaigned for the candidates in the final stretch.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/asia/typhoon-kalmaegi-deaths-philippines-cebu-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:34:00-05:00","title":"Typhoon Kalmaegi kills at least 66 in the Philippines, heads toward Vietnam","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi, known locally as Tino, killed at least 66 people in the Philippines, including six military personnel who died in a helicopter crash during a humanitarian mission in Agusan del Sur.

from Typhoon Kalmaegi in the Philippines climbed to 66, residents in the hardest-hit province of Cebu are confronting the devastation it left behind: homes reduced to rubble, streets choked with debris, and lives upended.\n \n\n   \n  In Talisay city, survivors sift through the destruction, hoping to salvage what little remains. Among them was Eilene Oken, 38, who walked through what used to be her neighbourhood, only to find her home completely destroyed.\n \n\n   \n  “We worked and saved for this for years, then in an instant, it was all gone,” she said, her voice breaking. But Oken said she remains grateful because her family, including her two daughters, were unharmed.\n \n\n   \n  Scenes of devastation emerged in Cebu, a major tourist hub, as floodwaters receded, revealing destroyed homes, overturned vehicles, and widespread debris.\n \n\n   \n  Among the 66 fatalities were six military personnel whose  helicopter crashed  in Agusan del Sur on the island of Mindanao during a humanitarian mission.

CNN projected  Ghazala Hashmi  as the winner of Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, putting her on a path to become the nation’s first Muslim woman elected to statewide office. And in the attorney general’s race,  Jay Jones  overcame the disclosure of text messages in which he suggested a former legislative colleague should be shot, and CNN projected he will unseat incumbent Jason Miyares.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, 46, is a mother of three who served in law enforcement and the CIA before entering politics. She was first elected to Virginia’s 7th Congressional District after  beating former Rep. Dave Brat , who shocked onetime House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary, and served three terms before leaving the House this year.\n \n\n   \n  She came out to huge cheers from her supporters at her election night event Tuesday night after CNN projected the Democrat would win Virginia’s governor race.\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight we sent a message,” she said. “We sent a message to every corner of the commonwealth, a message to our neighbors and our fellow Americans across the country. We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship.”\n \n\n   \n  The first woman governor-elect said, “A few minutes ago, Adam said to our daughters, ‘Your mom’s going to be the governor of Virginia,’ and I can guarantee those words have never been spoken in Virginia ever before.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is a big deal that the girls and the young women I have met along the campaign trail now know with certainty that they can achieve anything,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  In campaign messaging, Spanberger frequently touted her desire to bring people together and keep communities safe. Her law enforcement background led her to receive the coveted endorsement of Virginia’s Police Benevolent Association, even though the same group endorsed the Republican ticket four years ago. The Virginia PBA this year endorsed Republicans for lieutenant governor and attorney general.\n \n\n   \n  She remained a  disciplined messenger , focusing on economic issues while hitting Earle-Sears on social issues such as abortion access and same-sex marriage. Her ads aimed to portray Earle-Sears as a strident, inflexible conservative and often used versions of the same clip of Earle-Sears telling an unruly crowd, “I am speaking!”\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears tried to recreate  Youngkin’s winning playbook  from four years ago against Democrat Terry McAuliffe, emphasizing deregulatory initiatives that would expand Virginia’s workforce. But she faced doubts from members of her own party throughout the contest about her campaign strategy and was running in a year when a Republican leads the White House. Historically, the party that doesn’t control Washington most often prevails in Virginia’s gubernatorial election.\n \n\n   \n  An immigrant from Jamaica who served in the Marines, Earle-Sears holds socially conservative views on abortion and same-sex marriage. She made transgender youths’ participation in sports and policies around their use of public-school bathrooms a core focus, frequently appearing alongside concerned parents at news conferences across the state.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger declined repeatedly to get into specifics on these issues, saying she preferred local schools and districts enact their own policies.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/entertainment/brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz-mummy-reunion-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in talks for 'The Mummy 4' reunion","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are reportedly in talks to reunite for the fourth installment of the 'The Mummy' franchise, following the success of the original 1999 film.

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Pennsylvania Democrats defended the  liberal majority on the state Supreme Court  Tuesday, blocking GOP efforts to flip the balance of power ahead of the next presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  Justices Kevin Dougherty, Christine Donohue and David Wecht were retained for new 10-year terms. They faced no opponents, only a yes-or-no vote on whether to extend their tenures on the state Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  If even two of the justices had been voted out, liberals could have lost their 5-2 majority on the state’s high court, giving Republicans a chance to flip the ideological balance in replacement elections in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  That could have had significant implications for the court’s approach to potential election litigation around the 2028 presidential election after it played a key role in both 2020 and 2024, as well as the next round of congressional redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  Both parties mounted aggressive campaigns around the retention vote, directing millions of dollars to the state while flooding voters’ screens and mailboxes.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, a potential 2028 contender himself,  cut an ad  in support of the three Democratic justices, while the state’s wealthiest individual, conservative megadonor Jeff Yass, organized an extensive field and advertising campaign through his organizational network.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats put a heavy emphasis on abortion rights in their advertising, warning of  bans in other states  and casting the court’s liberal majority as “ our last line of defense .” Republican opponents, meanwhile, regularly slammed the “ partisan justices ” that they argued “ have not protected our rights .”\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s vote also served as an early test for the rebuilding state Democratic Party under new chairman Eugene DePasquale, who has been working to reset his party’s fortunes after a disappointing 2024 election cycle, with a 2026 gubernatorial race and the next White House campaign around the corner.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the vote, DePasquale had described it as “the most pivotal judicial retention in our state’s history.”\n \n\n   \n  Justices Dougherty, Donohue and Wecht were first elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2015. Along with Chief Justice Debra Todd, first elected in 2007, and Justice Daniel McCaffery, elected in 2023, they form a five-member liberal majority on the seven-member court. Justices Kevin Brobson, elected in 2021, and Justice Sallie Mundy, elected in 2017, form the two-member conservative minority.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania is one of the most important battleground states in the country. It has alternated between the parties at the presidential level over the last four elections and drew more campaign ad money than any other state in the 2024 cycle — over $1 billion, according to data from the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.\n \n\n   \n   The story and headline have been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/sport/basketball-nba-unicycle-performer-red-panda-returns","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Popular performer Red Panda makes NBA return, roughly 4 months after breaking wrist in fall","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Red Panda, the popular halftime performer known as Rong Niu, returned to public performance on November 5, 2025, after breaking her left wrist during a fall at the WNBA Commissioner’s Cup final between the Indiana Fever and Minnesota Lynx on July 1.

Newsom argued that the ballot measure, Proposition 50, was necessary for Democrats to “fight fire with fire.”\n \n\n   \n  Proposition 50’s passage is a personal success for Newsom, a term-limited governor who has positioned himself as one of the president’s most aggressive adversaries ahead of a possible 2028 presidential run.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom invested significant political capital betting that voters would be willing to undermine the state’s independent redistricting commission to push back against the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  The governor made himself the face of the campaign, appearing in ads and teasing at his political future to boost donations.

While Munger targeted independent voters and good government-minded Democrats, the California Republican Party and a group led by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy worked to boost GOP turnout. But McCarthy’s efforts to raise money  fell well short  of what he privately told Republicans to expect.\n \n\n   \n  Former GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger  also came out against Proposition 50 , urging Californians to “terminate gerrymandering.” Newsom met privately with the former governor earlier this year and described him as a friend and colleague.\n \n\n   \n  “We share many of the same values, we certainly share many of the same concerns about the current occupant in the White House,” Newsom told reporters in August.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats made Trump a central part of the campaign in a bid to politicize the race and take advantage of their party’s roughly 20-point voter registration advantage over Republicans. Republicans, meanwhile, focused on Newsom, arguing that the ballot initiative was an effort to boost his future political ambitions.\n \n\n   \n  Opponents of Proposition 50 argued that the measure was a Democratic power grab, and that voters already voted more than a decade ago to strip lawmakers of the right to draw congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Under the new maps, which will be in place through the 2030 election, five Republican incumbents have been drawn into bluer districts. Several Democratic candidates have already announced challenges in anticipation of the more favorable lines.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/business/detroit-bankruptcy-jpmorgan-rocket-mortgage","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Detroit is back from the dead.

Hudson’s department store will eventually feature high-end stores, luxury condos and a five-star hotel.\n \n\n   \n  Detroit “was probably at the bottom of the barrel in this country – from crime and unemployment to everything in between,” Dan Gilbert, the billionaire who has helped catalyze Detroit’s revival, said in an interview with CNN. “It’s been a 180-degree comeback.” Gilbert’s real estate company developed the complex at the former Hudson’s, a shopping mecca for generations that closed in 1983.\n \n\n   \n  Detroit’s population is  growing for the first time in nearly 60 years . General Motors is moving its headquarters to Hudson’s. JPMorgan is heading there too, having announced a big push to invest $100 million in the city more than a decade ago.\n \n\n   \n  But Detroit’s improbable comeback remains incomplete. Its downtown has made a remarkable recovery from the city’s 2013 bankruptcy – the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history. Meanwhile, some parts of the city have been left behind. Others are still vacant.\n \n\n   \n    Detroit’s rise and fall\n \n\n   \n  Detroit was once the fourth-largest city in the country, home to America’s automobile industry. In 1950, Detroit’s population topped 1.8 million.\n \n\n   \n  By 2013, Detroit’s population had fallen to 700,000.\n \n\n   \n  Numerous factors  hurt Detroit  over many years, including a shrinking tax base, high unemployment and poverty, and rising health care and pension costs for city employees. Detroit’s reliance on the auto industry hurt the city as free trade agreements, automation and incentives from southern states sent jobs away.\n \n\n   \n  People with resources also left Detroit for the suburbs. Detroit’s population  declined  roughly 28% between 2000 and 2015, while the population in the surrounding six counties grew 3%.\n \n\n   \n  Detroit’s financial woes led to steep cuts in basic city services like trash pickup and snow plowing. An estimated 40% of street lights were  not functioning  by the time Detroit filed for bankruptcy in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  During the financial crisis in 2009, Detroit’s unemployment rate  skyrocketed to 29%  as the auto industry teetered on the brink of collapse. The average price of a home in Detroit stood at just $7,500.\n \n\n   \n  In bankruptcy, the state took over control of local government, and a state-appointed manager oversaw city spending and operations. Detroit shed $7 billion in debt and thousands of retired city workers were forced to take pension cuts.\n \n\n   \n  The city exited bankruptcy after a year and has rebounded over the past decade, thanks in part to investments from JPMorgan, Gilbert’s Bedrock and other companies and philanthropic organizations.\n \n\n   \n    Downtown vs. neighborhoods\n \n\n   \n  Gilbert, the co-founder of Rocket Mortgage and owner of the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers, went all-in on Detroit when many left the city for dead.\n \n\n   \n  After moving his mortgage lender’s offices downtown, Gilbert went on to buy more than 100 downtown properties, spending $7 billion along the way.\n \n\n   \n  “We certainly jump-started it,” Gilbert said. “A lot of businesses followed from suburbs and other parts of the country.”\n \n\n   \n  JPMorgan, which had a long-standing relationship with Detroit, later stepped up its investment in the city in what has become a model for corporate investment in underserved communities.\n \n\n   \n  Leveraging data and research, JPMorgan’s  years-long effort  has helped tens of thousands of Detroiters get apprenticeships or jobs, led to the creation of preservation of thousands of affordable housing units and provided aid to countless small businesses, according to the bank. In 2021, JPMorgan opened one of its first community branches in  Corktown , Detroit’s oldest neighborhood. The following year, JPMorgan launched a  virtual call center  in Detroit.\n \n\n   \n  In January, General Motors is scheduled to move its global headquarters to Hudson’s Detroit. The move comes 16 years after the bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler that intensified Detroit’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  “GM and the Detroit’s DNA are interwoven. The two things just go together,” said Dave Masseron, GM’s vice president of infrastructure and corporate citizenship. “The city is on an upward trajectory for the first time in my lifetime. It’s a great time to be here.”\n \n\n   \n  But Peter Hemmer, a law professor at Wayne State University, said that corporate and philanthropic investments have been concentrated downtown and have not done enough to help the neighborhoods that need it most.\n \n\n   \n  A report  last year  commissioned by the Detroit City Council that private investments downtown “have not lifted the city to share in any levels of prosperity.”\n \n\n   \n  The city has experienced an influx of White, Hispanic and Asian residents over the last decade. But Detroit, long a majority Black city, has seen its Black population has decline. Since 2013, the largest loss in population has been among Black residents, with 72,000 fewer over that span.\n \n\n   \n  The median income in Detroit is $38,000, half the median income of its broader region. Only 26% of Detroit’s households are middle class, compared to 39% in the region. And 18 out of Detroit’s 139 square miles of land are still vacant, according to  Detroit Future City , a nonprofit organization.\n \n\n   \n  High-paying jobs are often held by people who live in the suburbs and commute into Detroit — while the salaries of Detroit residents, regardless of where they work, are  lower .

EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Zohran Mamdani, the  34-year-old democratic socialist  whose focus on working-class issues and personal magnetism attracted a diverse coalition of supporters to propel a  once-underdog campaign , has won New York City’s general election race for mayor.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani beat former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for a second time, shattering the political scion’s hopes of a comeback after his loss to Mamdani in the June Democratic primary. Also  running in the general election  was Republican Curtis Sliwa, who refused to end his campaign despite pressure from Cuomo and his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Coming out to cheers at his election night event in Brooklyn, Mamdani told his supporters they have ushered in a “new age” of politics in the city.\n \n\n   \n  “For as long as we can remember, the working people of New York have been told by the wealthy and the well connected that power does not belong in their hands, fingers bruised from lifting boxes on the warehouse floor,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “Palms calloused from delivery by candle bars. Knuckles scarred with kitchen burns. These are not hands that have been allowed to hold power. And yet, over the last 12 months, you have dared to reach for something greater,” Mamdani said. “Tonight, against all odds, we have grasped it.”\n \n\n   \n  He told supporters they “have toppled a political dynasty,” referring to Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  “I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life,” Mamdani said. “But let tonight be the final time I utter his name.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s win marks a victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party at a time when national Democrats are divided over how to counter President Donald Trump. The president is himself a native New Yorker who has falsely derided Mamdani as a “communist” and suggested he’d “take over” the city if he is elected.\n \n\n   \n  “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him, and if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power,” Mamdani said after his victory. “This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one.”\n \n\n   \n  The results are likely to echo far beyond New York City, elevating both Mamdani’s profile and platform, including his proposals to freeze the rent for New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments, make public buses free to ride and provide universal childcare by taxing the wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s win completes a meteoric rise a year after the state assemblyman launched his bid for mayor, promising to make the most expensive city in the country affordable for its working class.\n \n\n   \n    Who is Zohran Mamdani?\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani is a three-term state assemblyman who entered the mayor’s race as one of several apparent also-rans to what appeared to be Cuomo’s race to lose.\n \n\n   \n  Born in Uganda and first raised in Cape Town, South Africa, Mamdani moved to New York City when he was 7. He attended the prestigious Bronx High School of Science and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bowdoin College. He is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker whose credits include “Mississippi Masala” and “Monsoon Wedding.”\n \n\n   \n  Before becoming an assemblyman, Mamdani was a housing counselor and self-described C-list rapper who went by the name “Mr. Cardamom.” His short-lived music career was sometimes front and center in his opponent’s attack ads.\n \n\n   \n  The music video for “Nani,” a rap song where Mamdani pays homage to his grandma and New York City’s South Asian culture, also shows him shirtless, donning only an apron, looking directly at the camera while he rocks side to side. The image was plastered across anti-Mamdani campaign ads to poke fun at his past music career and his lack of governmental experience.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Epstein, a campaign aide, noted that Mamdani’s rapping career helped him indirectly in his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “An incredible asset for anybody seeking to run for office is bravery in the face of embarrassment and being able to push through the natural inclination many of us have not to kind of introduce themselves to strangers or do things in a kind of silly way in front of them,” Epstein told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Mamdani made a steady climb in the mayor’s race by producing a constant stream of social media videos, including interviews with voters who had supported Trump in 2024 due to the high cost of living. He ran a groundbreaking digital campaign in which he spoke in multiple languages and connected with supporters with a message anchored to affordability.  During the campaign, Mamdani, who natively speaks Urdu, released campaign videos in Bangla, Spanish, and Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  One of his most memorable viral videos tackled what the candidate referred to as “halal-flation.” He set out to interview street meat vendors about the high cost of running a street food business in New York City. With a mouthful of rice and halal meat, Mamdani detailed how an arcane permit system in the city is in part to blame for the prices of what should be cheap street food.\n \n\n   \n  “This was one of the coldest nights of the year, bitterly cold,” Epstein recalled recently. “We were downtown by Zuccotti Park near Wall Street and Zohran just asking people on the street, ‘Would you rather pay $10 or $8 for halal?’ People were pushing through trying to get home, you know, it was rejection over and over and over and over again, but it never fazed him.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani was cutting into Cuomo’s lead in public polling by the June primary. The city’s traditional power brokers, including the real estate and business sectors concerned with Mamdani’s democratic socialist identity, banded together in support of Cuomo and donated millions of dollars to anti-Mamdani super PACs. Business leaders argued Mamdani would drive wealthy New Yorkers out and discourage businesses from operating in the nation’s financial capital.\n \n\n   \n  Their push ultimately helped Mamdani cast his campaign as a fight between working-class people and billionaires.\n \n\n   \n  Still, his primary victory shocked much of the political world.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think the line is so much between progressives and moderates. It’s between fighters and fakers,” said city comptroller Brad Lander, who ran against Mamdani but allied with him under the primary’s ranked-choice voting system. “What Zohran is showing is that it’s worth putting up big bold ideas for change, standing up and fighting for them, and that’s pretty hopeful. Yes, he’s a democratic socialist, but he had a bold vision for the future of the city and that excited people.”\n \n\n   \n    The general election campaign\n \n\n   \n  After taking a vacation in Uganda to celebrate his wedding, Mamdani returned to a city mourning the deaths of New York police officer Didarul Islam and three others in a Midtown Manhattan shooting. He was confronted with his years of tweets criticizing the police, including references to law enforcement as racist and wicked and calling for them to be defunded.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not defunding the police. I am not running to defund the police,” he would tell reporters after meeting with Islam’s family, part of an overall shift away from anti-police rhetoric that culminated in recent weeks with his commitment to retain the current police commissioner, Jessica Tisch.\n \n\n   \n  He also reached out to New York’s Jewish community, roiled by his criticisms of Israel’s government and questions about democratic socialism. Mamdani is an outspoken advocate for  Palestinian rights, a supporter of the movement to boycott and divest from Israel and a fierce critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n \n\n   \n  “I hate my choices,” said Cydney Schwartz, a 33-year-old liberal Democrat who has lived in Israel and was in line to cast an early vote. She declined to say who she chose.\n \n\n   \n    The last days of the campaign\n \n\n   \n  In the closing days of the campaign, Mamdani referred to the race as a choice between “oligarchy and democracy.”  His omnipresence on the campaign trail was on display during the last days of the race and in the lead-up to the last weekend of early voting in the city.\n \n\n   \n  As more than half a million New Yorkers turned out to cast their votes early, Mamdani was everywhere: He was in church in the morning, calling into radio shows midday, stopping into ethnic supermarkets in the outer boroughs, popping up on influencer live streams, joining a Union Square freestyle rap battle and capping off his Saturday with a whirlwind tour of the city’s nightclub scene.\n \n\n   \n  Paying homage to the city that never sleeps, Mamdani appeared to hardly do so either, stopping at six nightclubs in Brooklyn just to do it all over again on the last Sunday of early voting. He attended a church service with his parents, met campaign volunteers before stopping on the sidelines of the New York City Marathon, went to Queens for a meet-up with Gov. Kathy Hochul to cheer on the Buffalo Bills, and popped up in the nosebleeds of Madison Square Garden for a New York Knicks game.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo also campaigned across the city. Notably, he tried to cut into Mamdani’s core support of South Asian and Muslim voters by highlighting Mamdani’s opposition to criminal penalties for prostitution. He also laughed when a radio host suggested Mamdani would cheer another 9/11 attack, drawing allegations from Mamdani and others that he was playing to Islamophobia. Cuomo denied he was doing so.\n \n\n   \n  Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams ended his independent bid and endorsed Cuomo. But Cuomo was unable to push Sliwa, the Republican nominee, out of the race, denying anti-Mamdani voters the chance to consolidate behind one opponent. Sliwa repeatedly and colorfully vowed he would die before making way for Cuomo, arguing he owed it to his supporters to keep running.\n \n\n   \n  For Cuomo, Tuesday’s results are likely a coda to a long and eventful political career. He was governor of New York for nearly 11 years before resigning in 2021 after he was accused of sexual harassment, allegations he has denied, and amid criticism of how his administration handled Covid-19 cases in nursing homes. Running for mayor, Cuomo leaned into his executive experience, often pointing out Mamdani’s short career in politics and relative lack of work history.\n \n\n   \n  He relaunched his mayoral bid as an independent after losing to Mamdani in June. He remained focused on public safety, promising to hire additional police officers and build more housing. Cuomo, who has a longstanding relationship with Trump, also sought to portray himself as the better candidate to fend off the president’s attacks on New York City.\n \n\n   \n    A history-making mayor\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani will be inaugurated on January 1, 2026. He inherits a deeply complex city home to 8.5 million people, a large bureaucracy, a municipal workforce of roughly 300,000 and a city budget of $115 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani will make history as New York City’s first Muslim mayor, the first South Asian to hold the office and one of the youngest mayors elected in modern times. He recently married Rama Duwaji, an artist of Syrian descent who was born in Texas and moved to New York City to complete a master’s degree in illustration. Duwaji skipped traditional campaigning alongside her husband on the trail and while it remains unclear whether she will have any role in his administration, at 28, she will be the first member of Gen Z to serve as New York City’s first lady.\n \n\n   \n  While Mamdani’s identity as both an immigrant and a South Asian New Yorker was central to his campaign, his connection to that community began to take shape long before he launched his run for City Hall. He first made national headlines in 2021 when he joined New York City cab drivers on a 15-day hunger strike seeking relief from excessive debt.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani has a strong connection to the cab driver community in New York City, which is largely made up of immigrants, including thousands of South Asians who were among his fiercest supporters. In the last days of the campaign, Mamdani made a stop at LaGuardia Airport’s taxi stand at midnight, catching cabbies at shift change.\n \n\n   \n  “Without the night shift, there is no morning,” Mamdani told them.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/europe/oleron-french-island-car-ramming-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:59:00-05:00","title":"Car ramming injures 10 people on French island, interior minister says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A motorist rammed pedestrians and cyclists on the French island of Oléron, injuring ten people with at least two in critical condition.

About 75% of Americans had received  at least one dose  of the first versions of the vaccine by early 2022, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. But only about 23% of American adults got a covid shot during the 2024-25 virus season, well below the 47% of American adults who got a flu shot. The vaccination rates for  flu ,  measles , and tetanus are also going down.\n \n\n   \n  Yet covid remains a serious, potentially deadly health risk, listed as the primary cause of death on roughly 31,400 death certificates last year. By comparison, flu killed  about 6,500  people and pneumonia, a common complication of the flu, killed  an additional 41,600 ,  CDC data shows .\n \n\n   \n  As millions of Americans decide whether to get a covid shot this season, public health researchers worry vaccination rates will slide further, especially because Hispanic and Black Americans and those under 30 have lower rates, exposing them to serious complications such as long covid. Under the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the federal government has narrowed its recommendations on the covid vaccine, leading to a hodgepodge of rules on pharmacy access, with Americans living in Republican states often facing more barriers to getting a shot.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of misinformation is going around regarding covid,” said  Alein Haro-Ramos , an assistant professor of health, society, and behavior at the University of California-Irvine. “Vaccine hesitancy is going to increase.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, the Food and Drug Administration  narrowed approval  for covid vaccines to those 65 or older and to adults and children with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for serious complications from covid.\n \n\n   \n  A month later, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  voted to recommend  “shared clinical decision-making” on the vaccine, pulling back from advising all adults to get vaccinated. The committee advised doctors to emphasize to adults under 65 and children that the benefits of the vaccine are greatest for those with underlying health conditions.\n \n\n   \n  The guidance is rebutted by infectious disease experts who say most adults and children should get both the flu and covid vaccines, which are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. Several independent medical organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics have reiterated their support for broad adoption of covid vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen states have taken steps to ensure most people can get a covid shot at the pharmacy without a prescription, with many states tying their policies to the advice given by medical organizations. And many of those states require insurers to cover vaccines at no cost, according to  a KFF analysis . In several other states, predominantly Republican, pharmacy access to vaccines may require a prescription.\n \n\n   \n  Among the most commonly cited reasons for covid vaccine hesitation are fears about side effects, long-term health consequences, the effectiveness of the vaccine, and mistrust of pharmaceutical corporations and government officials, according to  a 2024 review  of multiple studies, published in the journal Vaccines.\n \n\n   \n  Covid vaccine hesitancy in the 2024-25 virus season was higher among Latinos; African Americans; men; uninsured people; and people living in Republican-leaning states, CDC data shows.\n \n\n   \n  Latino adults were significantly less likely than adults from most other racial and ethnic groups to get a covid shot last season, with a vaccination rate around 15%.\n \n\n   \n  Same of that may be due to age: A  disproportionate share  of Latinos are young. But public policy actions may also be a factor. The first Trump administration, for example, tied Medicaid to “public charge,” a rule allowing the federal government to deny an immigrant a green card or visa based on their dependence on taxpayer-funded programs. Some Latinos may be afraid to sign up for social services even after the Biden administration reversed those first-term Trump actions.\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos co-authored  a study  published in 2024 that found many Latinos were hesitant to get vaccinated because of fears about their immigration status, and that experiencing health discrimination like care denials or delays increased their vaccine hesitancy.\n \n\n   \n  “Do you trust the health care system, broadly speaking? Do you want to provide your information — your name, your address?” Haro-Ramos said. “Trust is critical.”\n \n\n   \n  Haro-Ramos said the problem has likely worsened since her study was published. The Trump administration  revealed this summer  that it would give the personal information of Medicaid enrollees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many Latinos are  canceling doctor appointments  to head off possible confrontation with immigration enforcement officials.\n \n\n   \n  “People are avoiding leaving their homes at all costs,” Haro-Ramos said.\n \n\n   \n   Janani Rajbhandari-Thapa , an associate professor at the University of Georgia College of Public Health, recently  co-authored a study  of covid vaccination among nearly 1,500 African Americans living in south Georgia. The study found that participants were more likely to listen to their health care providers than faith leaders or co-workers when seeking advice on getting vaccinated.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of those studied had received at least one dose of the vaccine, but those who were unvaccinated were more likely to agree with false statements that tied vaccines to miscarriages, components’ remaining in the body for a long time, or even to the conspiracy that they implant a computer chip in the body.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s the clinicians who can take the messages about vaccination — that these are myths,” Rajbhandari-Thapa said.\n \n\n   \n  Even though covid hospitalization and death rates have fallen dramatically since the worst days of the pandemic, fatal complications related to covid remain most common among older people.  Around 89%  of U.S. covid deaths last year were among people 65 and older, compared with  about 81%  of flu and pneumonia deaths.\n \n\n   \n  As the pandemic falls into the rearview, young people have developed a sense of invincibility. Only 11% of Americans 18 to 29 received a vaccine during the 2024-25 virus season, the lowest vaccination rate among adult age groups. That’s far below the  70% of young adults  who got at least one dose of the initial covid vaccines by November 2023.\n \n\n   \n  While many people get covid after receiving a covid shot, because the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection wears off pretty fast, some misunderstand the purpose of the shot, said  Otto Yang , an infectious disease specialist at UCLA Health.\n \n\n   \n  “They think, ‘Well, the vaccine didn’t prevent me from getting covid, so the vaccine didn’t work,’” Yang said. “And what they’re not seeing is that the vaccine prevented them from getting severely ill, which is ultimately the most important thing.”\n \n\n   \n  And the vaccine can help prevent long covid, which is a problem for all ages, Yang said. A recent Northwestern University study  found that  younger adults suffer worse symptoms of long covid than older adults.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, Yang said, it is not a consistent choice to get a flu vaccine but forgo a covid vaccine, since both are safe, effective, and prevent serious illness. It is clear, he added, that people with compromised immune systems and those at higher risk should get a covid shot. The decision is “a little bit less clear” for others but “probably most adults should be getting vaccinated, just like it’s recommended for the flu vaccine, as well as most children.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/us/teacher-shot-abby-zwerner-lawsui","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Closing Arguments Set in Lawsuit Filed by Virginia Teacher Shot by 6-Year-Old Student","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-profile civil lawsuit valued at $40 million, former Virginia teacher Abby Zwerner is suing assistant principal Ebony Parker after being shot by a 6-year-old student at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.

Last night, we received the bittersweet news of his return home to Israel,” his family said in a statement. The family also said the bodies of the remaining hostages held in Gaza “must be brought back.”\n \n\n   \n  Chen, a staff sergeant who served in the Armored Corps, had been stationed at the Gaza border on October 7. His remains were taken into Gaza after he was killed, the Israel Defense Forces said.\n \n\n   \n  Chen was the second of three sons, a former Boy Scout and an avid basketball player, his father Ruby Chen previously told CNN. Friends described him “as the center of attention wherever he went, always cheerful and full of jokes,” according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\n \n\n   \n  The office of the Israeli prime minister said the government “shares in the deep sorrow of the Chen family and of all the families of the fallen hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  The latest transfer comes after Hamas handed over the bodies of three deceased hostages on Sunday. US President Donald Trump confirmed one of them was Omer Neutra, an Israeli-American dual national killed in the initial Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Last Thursday, Hamas released the remains of two other hostages, identified as Amiram Cooper, 84, and Sahar Baruch, 25.\n \n\n   \n  The solidity of the Trump-brokered ceasefire had previously been tested   after Hamas said it handed over the remains of three deceased individuals on October 28, but Israeli authorities were unable to identify them as belonging to any of the hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was resorting to “pathetic attempts to deceive us, the United States, and the world” and instructed the military to carry out “immediate, powerful strikes” in Gaza. Those strikes killed at least 104 Palestinians, including dozens of children, in what was the deadliest day since the beginning of the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, however, the releases of the remains of hostages have proceeded as planned, and the ceasefire has largely held. In an interview with “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday, Trump said the ceasefire he helped broker is “not fragile” and was “very solid,” warning that “Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don’t behave.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Israel has been rocked by a  scandal  surrounding Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, the military’s top lawyer tasked with enforcing the rule of law within the armed forces. She has been placed under arrest as part of a criminal investigation into the leak of a video showing the alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of Palestinian detainees in Israel’s notorious Sde Teiman military prison.\n \n\n   \n  The video was first aired by Israel’s Channel 12 in August 2024. In May of that year, CNN spoke to three whistleblowers who detailed allegations of abuse at the prison.

Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the US  passes the record  for the longest government shutdown in history on Wednesday, civilian employees of the Defense Department — many of whom are veterans and military family members — are questioning how the agency is treating their federal service as some struggle to make ends meet amid missed paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Eight Defense Department civilians, stationed everywhere from Hawaii to Germany, told CNN morale is low and falling fast as the government shutdown drags on with no clear end in sight. Several said they and others they know are actively looking to leave federal service after years or even decades of prior commitment, while others said they feel a responsibility to stay despite the increasingly hostile environment they find themselves in.\n \n\n   \n  Almost all of the civilians who spoke to CNN are veterans themselves. As of 2021, nearly half of the Pentagon’s civilian employees were veterans. That can add an additional layer of frustration to how civilians have been spoken about and treated as they work side by side with those in uniform keeping the Defense Department running.\n \n\n   \n  “Me and my veteran friends are like, do they not know? When you disrespect the civilians who are working in federal service, do they not know that so many of them are actually veterans?” one Navy veteran who is a Defense Department civilian in Hawaii told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a slap in the face,” said another civilian who works in human resources overseas, and who is a military spouse and parent.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense Department employs nearly a million civilian employees, more than half of whom are continuing to work during the shutdown. A majority of those who are still working aren’t getting paid. Hundreds of thousands more – 334,900 according to agency contingency plans – have been furloughed and aren’t working nor receiving paychecks while the government lacks spending authority.\n \n\n   \n  By contrast, despite a lack of Congressional action to provide funding, the Trump administration has  moved money between accounts  to pay service members in uniform during the shutdown, though it’s unclear where funds will come from for future paychecks. Unpaid civilians have in at least some cases also been the ones processing payment for their military counterparts, the civilian working in HR said.\n \n\n   \n  Each of the civilians who spoke to CNN said they find great value and pride in their work for the US military; several described a deep commitment to serving their country as a civilian after leaving their own time in uniform. DoD civilians serve as medical professionals at military hospitals, firefighters on military bases, intelligence analysts and teachers at on-base schools for military children, among other jobs.\n \n\n   \n  But they said the rhetoric around government civilians throughout this year by the Trump administration, and the seemingly constant efforts to cut down the civilian workforce, has left them feeling abandoned by leaders they say don’t understand the critical nature of their work.\n \n\n   \n  One civilian – a military veteran – described concerns for US national security the longer the shutdown drags on. A person’s debt and financial concerns are a key question in the process to get a security clearance, they explained, and many civilians are being forced to take out loans to stay afloat while missing paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the things we look for when it comes to counterintelligence threats, insider threats, is financial hardship,” the civilian said. “And I am in a building surrounded by super top-secret operations, and people who are running the f**k out of money.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to an email outlining the concerns civilians voiced in this article, Pentagon press secretary Kinglsey Wilson said the reporting was a “completely off base and partisan story devoid of facts.”\n \n\n   \n  “If [Defense Department] civilians are upset about anything, it’s the Democrats voting over a dozen times to withhold their pay, making it hard for our federal workers and uniformed servicemembers to pay rent, enjoy Thanksgiving, and buy Christmas presents for their children,” Wilson said.\n \n\n   \n  Several civilians who spoke to CNN expressed exhaustion at what has been a year full of hurdles for those who just want to do their jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Being in human resources, the civilian working in HR overseas and their coworkers have become counselors at times, they told CNN, as people have been repeatedly pushed to tears navigating the stress of wondering how to pay rent or their child’s college tuition back home. Suicide “has come up several times,” the civilian said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s humiliating,” the civilian said bluntly. “As much as I love my country, as much as I love my Department of Defense and Department of the Army, I have never felt so humiliated and degraded in my life.”\n \n\n   \n  While several civilians said they are actively looking to leave federal service to find more stability there is also a sense of anxiety with how their replacements might respond to the current pressures of working for the Pentagon.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m nervous about how they will behave when told to do something that maybe they shouldn’t do,” a senior Army veteran-turned-civilian said. “I have the luxury that if I’m given an order that I feel is illegal, unethical, or immoral, saying f**k you I’m not doing that. I don’t know if the next person will feel that way.”\n \n\n   \n    Months of pressure\n \n\n   \n  Almost from the very start of the Trump administration, many of the civilians who spoke to CNN said, they felt their value being diminished.\n \n\n   \n  Federal agencies began pushing buyouts and delayed resignation programs in an attempt to shrink the civilian workforce, leaving many angry and confused. Wilson said in her statement to CNN that civilians who took the delayed resignation opportunity, a key feature of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency effort that aimed to find massive cost saving across government, “are happy because they got a great deal.”\n \n\n   \n  Employees also began receiving instructions to send in five bullet points explaining what they’d done that week, with little to no clarity on where those lists were going, who would be reviewing them, or what it was exactly that they wanted to see.\n \n\n   \n  In her statement, Wilson said that in “all jobs, whether government or not, tracking metrics and submitting reports is the norm.” But the Navy veteran-turned-civilian employee in Hawaii rejected the idea that the five-bullet-points ask was standard, if only because there was so little clarity on how the reports would be used.\n \n\n   \n  “We had seen how our peers were getting let go from their jobs for seemingly not big deals, it put all of us on notice. The rhetoric in which they were talking about civilian service put all of us on notice – that we were replaceable, our service didn’t matter,” the civilian said. “So sure, [the five bullet points] wasn’t a big deal, but they had already proven that tasks that were not a big deal were fireable offenses.”\n \n\n   \n  Several civilians working outside of the continental US told CNN a deep sense of anxiety and distrust set in after watching counterparts at USAID, for example, get abruptly laid off and left to facilitate and fund their own move back to the US on short notice. CNN  reported in February  that scores of USAID employees around the globe — some in dangerous areas — were left scrambling and in shock as they were abruptly locked out of secure systems and left to manage the next steps alone.\n \n\n   \n  Another DOD civilian, also a Navy veteran who is serving overseas, told CNN that watching the dismantling of USAID was “terrifying,” particularly given the surprising nature of so many announcements at the beginning of the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “That really set the tone for a lot of us overseas, in a no-shit panic,” the civilian said, adding that panic has “ebbed and flowed” ever since.\n \n\n   \n  In February, the Pentagon began requiring supervisors to submit lists of probationary civilian employees for potential termination, while some defense officials started raising concerns that the broad firings could harm US military readiness and even break the law.

   \n  By Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The ongoing government shutdown isn’t just the longest in American history. It’s likely the most damaging, too.\n \n\n   \n  Historically, the economic damage from shutdowns is fleeting, quickly reversing when the government reopens. However, the 36-day lapse in funding that began on October 1 is already dealing a significant – albeit temporary – blow to the world’s largest economy.\n \n\n   \n  Millions of Americans are  not getting food stamp benefits  needed to feed their families. Roughly 1.4 million federal employees  haven’t been paid  – even though many are still working. And investors and policymakers are  in the dark about what’s happening  in the US economy because the release of government data has stalled.\n \n\n   \n  “The current shutdown looks likely to have the greatest economic impact of any shutdown on record,” Alec Phillips, chief political economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.\n \n\n   \n  Even if the shutdown ends by next week, it will likely slow down the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) — the broadest measure of economic output, without considering inflation — by 1.15 percentage points during the fourth quarter, according to Goldman Sachs.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the shutdown will reduce GDP by one to two percentage points.\n \n\n   \n  “Those effects will intensify the longer the shutdown lasts,” the CBO wrote in a  letter  last week.\n \n\n   \n  Although “most of that decline” will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates between $7 billion and $14 billion will be permanently lost during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n    In 2025, a ‘much greater hit’ to US economy\n \n\n   \n  Goldman Sachs is now penciling in weaker fourth-quarter GDP growth of just 1%. That would represent a significant slowdown from the 3%  or even 4% growth  that was projected for the third quarter.\n \n\n   \n  Phillips wrote that the current shutdown is expected to result in a “much greater hit to growth than any prior shutdown” because it’s the longest on record and is much broader than previous shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  The 2018-2019 shutdown, previously the longest on record at 35 days, was only a partial shutdown, impacting just 10% of government spending, according to Goldman Sachs. The 2025 shutdown, by comparison, has derailed 100% of appropriations.\n \n\n   \n  The current shutdown also comes at a bad time, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management: “The economy was already going to slow down, and this just made it worse.”   \n \n\n   \n  Kelly cited a range of factors slowing the economy in the fourth quarter, including historically high tariffs, low immigration and the return of student debt payments.\n \n\n   \n  He added that it’s “shocking” to see “how much public pain (Democrats and Republicans) are willing to inflict just to get a political gain.”\n \n\n   \n    Economic data blackout\n \n\n   \n  The precise economic damage from the shutdown is difficult to measure, in part because of the information blackout caused by the shutdown itself.\n \n\n   \n  “We are flying blind in this economy,” Kelly said.\n \n\n   \n  Only one major economic report has been released by the federal government during the shutdown: the September  consumer price index  (CPI), the  final piece of data required  to determine annual cost of living adjustments for Social Security benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Other data releases, including the all-important monthly jobs report and the Fed’s go-to inflation metric as well as key insights on consumer spending, have been sidelined.\n \n\n   \n  That’s a major shift from the 2018-2019 shutdown, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics still received funding. That allowed the agency to continue collecting and releasing key economic data.\n \n\n   \n  Policymakers have been forced to make decisions with limited information. Last week, for the first time ever, the Federal Reserve  decided on interest rates without the monthly jobs report .\n \n\n   \n  If the government shutdown continues to limit Fed officials’ visibility, it could persuade the central bank to forgo cutting rates at the December policy meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” Fed Chair  Jerome Powell said  during a press conference last week. “I’m not committing to that, I’m just saying it’s certainly a possible that you would say, ‘We really can’t see, so let’s slow down.’”\n \n\n   \n  Even after the government reopens, the quality of economic data could be eroded by the fact the BLS was unable to conduct critical surveys of businesses and consumers during the shutdown period.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown will also likely inflate the unemployment rate for the month of October because the BLS typically counts furloughed workers as unemployed unless they find work elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n     A bounce-back in 2026? \n \n\n   \n  The good news is most of the shutdown-induced damage to the economy is expected to quickly unwind after the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  Goldman Sachs expects the shutdown effect to “more than reverse” in the first quarter, boosting GDP by 1.3 percentage points as furloughed workers return and delayed federal spending recovers. The bank expects that reversal to lift first-quarter GDP growth to a solid pace of 3.1%.\n \n\n   \n  The CBO estimated that some of the output lost due to employee furloughs would be permanently lost, costing the economy up to 14 billion in an eight-week shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, those forecasts for a rebound hinge on a key element of shutdowns: Federal workers are repaid once the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  However, President Donald Trump has questioned the policy of paying furloughed workers – despite signing a law during his first term that has been widely interpreted as guaranteeing back pay for furloughed workers.\n \n\n   \n  The White House on Tuesday  would not commit to paying furloughed workers  at the end of the shutdown, raising the risk of lasting economic damage.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Tami Luhby contributed reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/business/nvidia-palantir-michael-burry-stock","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"‘The Big Short’s’ Michael Burry is back with cryptic messages — and two massive bets","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Michael Burry, the investor behind 'The Big Short' and known for predicting the 2008 housing collapse, is now betting against artificial intelligence stocks by purchasing puts on Nvidia and Palantir.

with cryptic messages — and two massive bets \n       \n  By John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Michael Burry, the famed investor behind “The Big Short,” is betting artificial intelligence is more of a bubble than a revolution.\n \n\n   \n  Burry’s fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed on Monday that it bought puts — bets that share prices will fall — on two stars of the AI wave: Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Palantir ( PLTR ). Scion bought roughly $187.6 million in puts on Nvidia and $912 million in puts on Palantir, according to Securities and Exchange Commission  filings .\n \n\n   \n  Burry is known for his prophetic call that the US housing market would collapse in 2008. He was profiled in the 2010 book “The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,” by Michael Lewis, and portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2015 film adaptation.\n \n\n   \n  Now Burry is betting against the hottest AI stocks on the market at a time when concerns are mounting about a bubble. Tech and AI stocks have carried the market in recent months.  The S&P 500, which is increasingly concentrated in tech companies, is trading at historically expensive levels.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the  circular financing  of AI deals has raised eyebrows on Wall Street, with many tech companies entwined in a massive web of deals with each other. Some investors are also skeptical whether future profit growth will continue to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place.\n \n\n   \n  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.04% on Tuesday, posting its worst day since August. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 1.17%.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Sometimes, we see bubbles’\n \n\n   \n  Burry made a splash among investors on Thursday, when he posted on X for the first time since 2023. In his post, he shared a photo of Bale portraying him in “The Big Short” and wrote: “Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.”\n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Burry’s fund disclosed its bearish positions in Nvidia and Palantir. The SEC filings are for the third quarter of this year. Scion Asset Management did not respond to a request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research, said a pullback in tech stocks was overdue, given how far they have rallied in recent months. He said Burry’s comments likely exacerbated concerns.\n \n\n   \n  Burry has made public calls about the market in the years since “The Big Short.” He has not always been correct. The hedge fund manager in January 2023 infamously posted on X, “Sell,” before posting two months later, “I was wrong to say sell.”\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, his words carry weight on Wall Street.\n \n\n   \n  Burry’s return to social media comes at a time when investors have voiced concerns about expensive valuations, a market concentrated on a handful of large companies and rising investor expectations.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Palantir beat Wall Street forecasts in earnings reported Monday. Yet it wasn’t enough to impress traders after a series of strong earnings results.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, its shares tumbled 7.95% — their worst day since August.\n \n\n   \n  Palantir was the top performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024 and is in the top five performing stocks this year. Its shares are still up 152% this year.\n \n\n   \n  The company’s earnings results on Monday were “stellar,” according to CFRA Research’s Zino, but the company’s valuation — a measure of how pricey it is — “is a bit extreme.”\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the great results, when you coincide that with the comments that Michael Burry made and everybody already talking about concerns about an AI bubble, I think the combination of those factors really helped drive a pullback in the shares, the broader tech index and as a result the broader markets,” Zino said. “We’re not overly concerned about the pullback, but I would say it’s one of those situations where you’ve got to keep an eye on it.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Nvidia shares fell 3.96% on Tuesday. Shares are still up 48% this year.\n \n\n   \n  Alex Karp, CEO at Palantir, told CNBC on Tuesday that people betting against the company — including Burry — are “crazy.”\n \n\n   \n  “When I hear short sellers attacking what I believe is clearly the most important software company in America, therefore in the world, in terms of our impact, … it just is super triggering,” Karp said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s crazy motivating,” Karp said. “Every time they short us, we are just like tripling down on getting the better numbers, in part honestly, to make them poorer.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/us/ups-louisville-plane-crash-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:01","title":"UPS freight plane crash devastates Louisville, where ties to the shipping giant run deep","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS freight plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on November 5, 2025, killing at least seven people, including three crew members and four civilians on the ground.

Gainor, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:01 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the sun set and businesses started to close in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday, the evening calm was suddenly shattered by a giant explosion near the city’s airport.\n \n\n   \n  A UPS freight plane crashed shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport –– ripping through several businesses, including a waste recycling company that keeps storage tanks of oil and propane.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 38,000 gallons of fuel on board the cargo flight bound for Hawaii, the crash created a massive ball of fire – punctuated by smaller explosions from flammable material on the ground – and sent a towering plume of thick black smoke into the sky.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven people are dead and 11 injured from the crash, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said on social media late Tuesday, warning those numbers could climb as an investigation into the crash continues.\n \n\n   \n  The only three people on the flight –– all crew members –– are presumed dead, officials said. The four others confirmed to have died were not on board the plane, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said in a news briefing late Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  A ground crew member told CNN she got word of an explosion on the UPS side of the airport and ran over to see what was happening. Once she was there, she heard several more explosions while watching the smoke grow.\n \n\n   \n  “I kept looking for the firefighters and the first responders and couldn’t breathe until I saw those flashing emergency lights, the fire trucks pulling up,” said the crew member, who asked to remain anonymous.\n \n\n   \n  Five miles from the airport, Louisville resident Amanda Rhye was at a grocery store when she saw the smoke and immediately knew “it had to be something major,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone else around me realized it too. A couple of dozen people all stopped what they were doing and stared as the cloud quickly grew … within 20 minutes, the massive black cloud was over us in the sky,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of firefighters were deployed to contain the fire and search the surrounding area for victims, Louisville Fire Department Chief Brian O’Neill said at the Tuesday briefing.\n \n\n   \n  “When you have such a large-scale incident and fire that spread over such a massive area, we have to use hundreds of personnel to surround it, contain it, and then slowly bring it in,” O’Neill said, adding the site is now safe enough for crews to put out remaining spot fires and “create a formal grid” to search the surroundings.\n \n\n   \n  “These are trained firefighters from all around the region that are handling this to search, grid by grid, very carefully to make sure we can find any other victims,” the chief said.\n \n\n   \n    How the crash unfolded\n \n\n   \n  Josh Mitcham had just boarded a flight at the Louisville airport when he looked out the window and saw a dark cloud of smoke emerging into the sky.\n \n\n   \n  “We didn’t really know what happened,” Mitcham told CNN. “The captain came over and said that there had been an accident and that it wasn’t good and that they recommended that we go ahead and get off the plane.”\n \n\n   \n  The UPS cargo flight MD-11 crashed shortly after 5 p.m. after taking off on its way to Honolulu, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA is investigating the cause of the crash alongside the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  In audio from Louisville firefighters, a dispatcher tries to remain calm as initial details came in about a “possible explosion.” When one person asks how many buildings are on fire, someone responds that it’s at least two structures.\n \n\n   \n  Gov. Beshear later said at least two businesses were hit: an auto parts store and Kentucky Petroleum Recycling. A nearby Ford Motor plant also lost power after the plane crash, Beshear said.\n \n\n   \n  O’Neill said the crash ruptured some tanks at the recycling facility and sparked “secondary explosions.” He noted some of what might have sounded like explosions were actually relief valves releasing pressure as they’re designed to do.\n \n\n   \n  The fire from the crash is largely “controlled and contained” but the area around the facility is “still going to be a mess … because of the fuel leaks and the oil,” O’Neill said.\n \n\n   \n  The plane was not carrying any hazardous cargo that would “create an environmental issue,” Beshear said. Still, officials are monitoring Louisville’s air quality in the wake of the crash, the mayor said.\n \n\n   \n  A shelter-in-place order was initially issued for all locations within five miles of the airport but was later reduced to a one-mile radius, emergency officials said.\n \n\n   \n  After the crash, Louisville resident Justin Dunn and his son watched as what appeared to be debris fell out of the sky.\n \n\n   \n  “My son was like, ‘Hey, look in the sky,’ and it was coming down out of the sky and he picked it up,” Dunn told  CNN affiliate WAVE , holding up a piece of paper he said was among the debris.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s definitely debris all through here, probably within 10 miles,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are asking residents not to touch any debris they find and to take a picture and report it to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Because of the shelter-in-place order, Louisville’s Jefferson County Public Schools – the largest school district in Kentucky – will be closed Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The Louisville airport shut down after the crash but is expected to reopen Wednesday, according to the mayor.\n \n\n   \n    “This is a UPS town”\n \n\n   \n  Louisville hosts UPS’s worldwide air hub, called Worldport, which serves as a cornerstone to the city’s economy. More than 12,000 employees process over 22 million packages daily, according to the company.\n \n\n   \n  “Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved. UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities we serve. This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers,” UPS said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Big Four Bridge connecting Louisville and Jeffersonville, Indiana, over the Ohio River, was lit up in yellow lights Tuesday night in honor of the crashed UPS flight Greenberg  said  on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “This tragedy has touched every corner of our city. As Louisville’s skyline glows in yellow, we’re thinking of the lives lost, the families forever changed, and the entire community that calls Louisville home,” he wrote, accompanying a picture of the bridge.\n \n\n   \n  Louisville “is a UPS town,” city councilwoman Betsy Ruhe said at a news conference Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “My cousin’s a UPS pilot. My aide’s tennis partner is a UPS pilot. The intern in my office works overnight at UPS to pay for college,” Ruhe said.\n \n\n   \n  “We all know somebody who works at UPS –– and they’re all texting their friends, their family, trying to make sure everyone is safe. Sadly, some of those texts are probably going to go unanswered,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Kentucky state Sen. Keturah Herron described the accident as “jarring” after hitting “so close to home.”\n \n\n   \n  “To happen in a place where many of us frequent on a regular basis, that many of us watch our family members and loved ones pass through on a regular basis … it’s very hurtful,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Dunn, the Louisville resident who found some of the plane’s debris, said he hadn’t been able to make contact with his friends who work for UPS. “I just hope everyone made it out of it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The Teamsters union, which counts UPS as its  single-largest employer in the country , issued a statement saying it was monitoring developments from the crash.\n \n\n   \n  “As this horrific scene is being investigated, prayers on behalf of our entire International Union are with those killed, injured, and affected, including their families, co-workers, and loved ones,” the union  wrote on X .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/historic-firss-tuesday-election-winners","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"20:02:00-05:00","title":"The Historic Firsts of Tuesday’s Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tuesday’s 2025 elections marked a historic wave of firsts across Virginia, New Jersey, New York, and Michigan.

But the silvery orb will be below the horizon at that time, so take the time to look outside during the evening hours for the best view.\n \n\n   \n  The moniker  beaver moon  marks the time of year when beavers begin preparing for the winter by fortifying dams and lodges and stocking up on food. This full moon is also referred to as the digging moon by the Tlingit people, deer rutting moon by the Dakota and frost moon by the Cree, according to the almanac.\n \n\n   \n  This lunar event will be the second of three back-to-back supermoons this year. A supermoon happens when the moon reaches perigee, or its  nearest point  to our planet, making it appear larger and fuller.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so subtle that the human eye does not pick up the superness of it. But we still give it a fun name, I guess, to indicate that technically, this is the moon at its biggest and brightest, just not that much bigger on average than it usually is,” said Dr. Alissa Bans, director of undergraduate studies of Emory University’s department of physics.\n \n\n   \n  If clouds obscure the view in your area, the Virtual Telescope Project will share a  livestream of the full moon  over Manciano, Italy, beginning at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n    Keep an eye out for fireballs\n \n\n   \n  The second celestial event this week is the Southern Taurid meteor shower, which will peak at 8 a.m. ET Wednesday, according to  EarthSky .\n \n\n   \n  This meteor shower does not have a strong peak — there may only be five meteors an hour, said Robert Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the American Meteorological Society. “But anytime it’s dark in that period (October through early November), you’ll be able to see these slow meteors coming from the constellation of Aries in October and Taurids in November.”\n \n\n   \n  The Taurids are the result of Earth’s passing through debris left by the small comet  2P/Encke . It has the shortest orbit of any comet that’s been discovered — just 3.3 years, compared with long-period comets that have orbits lasting between 200 and 1,000 years. In previous years, this meteor shower has produced fireballs during Halloween, so they’ve also been called the “Halloween fireballs.”\n \n\n   \n  “The entire encounter with Taurids this year is special because we’re predicted to encounter some fresh material that’s a little bit larger than your average Taurid meteor. And these tend to cause fireballs,” Lunsford said.\n \n\n   \n  For those planning to look for these meteors, they may be difficult to spot since the moonlight will drown out most activity, but there is still a chance to see a fireball, Lunsford said.\n \n\n   \n  For best viewing, find an area with clear skies away from tall buildings and bright lights. You should aim to be outside any time after the sun sets and before the moon reaches its highest point Wednesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “They slightly favor the Northern Hemisphere, but they are visible in both (hemispheres). Your only problem down in Australia or South Africa is the radiant is lower in the sky, so more of the Taurid meteors will be obscured by the horizon,” Lunsford said.\n \n\n   \n    Upcoming meteor showers\n \n\n   \n  Here are the peak dates of other meteor showers anticipated this year, according to the  American Meteor Society  and  EarthSky . \n \n\n   \n    Upcoming supermoons\n \n\n   \n  Look out for  the last full supermoon  this year:\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/new-york-south-asian-community-mamdani-victory","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"02:41:00-05:00","title":"‘Mamdani Mubarak!’: New York’s South Asians celebrate the ascension of one of their own","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, New York City’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, has been celebrated by South Asian and immigrant communities across the city, particularly in diverse neighborhoods like Jackson Heights.

November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As  Zohran Mamdani  took the stage for his victory speech Tuesday night, the staff at Kabab King paused to listen. They recorded his speech and listened to his every word. The dining cutlery that was clanking away just moments before fell silent.\n \n\n   \n  “New York City, breathe this moment in,”  Mamdani said .\n \n\n   \n  Locals had flocked to the mayor-elect’s go-to biryani spot in the  Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens  hoping that he might show up — he has made the venue a frequent campaign stop — or just to celebrate the longtime neighborhood institution where biryani and kebabs are on virtually every table.\n \n\n   \n  “Most people think this is a hole in the wall, but he comes here,” says Lakshmi Shubha, a Roosevelt Island resident, who came to Kabab King with two of her friends.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after being elected New York City’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, Mamdani gave a speech in neighboring Brooklyn heavy on the  biography on which he campaigned  and the homages he has long given to his roots.\n \n\n   \n  “New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant!” Mamdani hailed in his victory speech.\n \n\n   \n  Viewers in the restaurant clapped and cheered in that moment.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been saying Mamdani Mubarak!” said Shahrukh Ali, the owner of Kabab King.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a people’s person for sure. He reminds me what New York City is all about,” said 21-year-old Mamdani voter Sameha Jamal. “It’s nice to embrace that again.”\n \n\n   \n  Jamal’s father, who also voted for Mamdani, said most of the democratic socialist’s  proposals  appealed to him, but as a homeowner, he wanted to see more specifics about Mamdani’s plan to freeze hikes on rent-stabilized apartments. He rents out part of his multi-story family home and hopes that the rent freeze does not affect small homeowners like him. Otherwise, he said he won’t vote for Mamdani in the next election.\n \n\n   \n  Other diners spoke about seeing someone who reflects their identity on the national political stage. They described watching Mamdani be declared the winner of this race as a moment that filled them with hope and excitement.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson Heights is an extremely diverse neighborhood. About 64% residents are foreign-born, 50% Hispanic or Latino, 32% Asian, 15% White, and 1% African American, according to  a report from the NYC Small Business Services .\n \n\n   \n  “In my lifetime, I would not have imagined a city such as New York City, which is one of the biggest cities in the world but also a city that had gone through 9/11, have a Muslim socialist, like, South Asian leader be so prominent and so many people supporting him. I think it just shows the direction that the young people in our country want to go for,” said Sehrish Munir, who voted for Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  South Asians are reliably Democratic because minority religions feel at home in the party, according to Karthick Ramakrishnan, executive director of AAPI data at the University of California, Berkeley. “They identify more with Democrats, and then, over time, they support the policies of the Democratic Party that go beyond, you know, race and religion.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s South Asian identity may give cause for celebration to the South Asians who feel represented in all the things he is, but there’s also something very New York about him, Munir said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s apparent in his beliefs. The way he talks, the way he approaches people, his campaign where he’s spoken so many languages. Like, he knows. What other city in the world is going to do that?” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/china/china-shenzhou-20-astronauts-return-delayed-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"02:54:00-05:00","title":"Chinese astronauts’ return to Earth delayed over fears spaceship damaged by debris","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chinese astronauts Chen Dong, Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie have been delayed in their return to Earth due to concerns that their Shenzhou-20 spacecraft may have been hit by space debris.

journey home was postponed due to a suspected impact on their Shenzhou-20 spaceship, China’s National Space Administration said Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “The impact analysis and risk assessment are under way,” the space agency said, without specifying details of any damage or how long it might take to check the ship.\n \n\n   \n  No alternative dates have been given for the return of the trio of taikonauts – Chinese astronauts – who blasted off from the country’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in April.\n \n\n   \n  The news came just days after China, which has rapidly ramped up its space ambition in recent years, celebrated the successful launch of Shenzhou-21.\n \n\n   \n  The newer model spacecraft successfully ferried the next batch of astronauts to China’s space station Tiangong –

Among the new cohort was Wu Fei, 32, feverishly touted by local media as  China’s youngest astronaut  ever to make it to space.\n \n\n   \n  On arrival, state-owned CCTV aired a handover ceremony involving the crews of both ships huddling in a narrow compartment to sign documents on a floating board.\n \n\n   \n  “We are about to return to Earth, and now I am handing over the hatch key that symbolizes the right to maintain operations on this Chinese space station to you,” said Chen Dong.

alone.’ This time, Mar-a-Lago beckons \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The last time the federal government ran out of money, President Donald Trump wanted the world to know he was making sacrifices.\n \n\n   \n  “I am all alone (poor me) in the White House,” he tweeted on Christmas Eve 2018, left behind in dreary, shutdown Washington, DC, as his family made merry at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n \n\n   \n  “I haven’t actually left the White House in months,” he said a few weeks later, bemoaning the long stretches of cooped-up time. So lonely was Trump that he took to waving forlornly out the window at machine gun-toting guards patrolling the White House grounds (“They don’t, like, wave,” he observed).\n \n\n   \n  Back then, Trump seemed aware that weekly visits to his seaside mansion or lengthy trips overseas might appear insensitive as federal workers went without pay and government services ground to a halt. He called off a trip to Switzerland for the glittering World Economic Forum in Davos, but did make a surprise stop in Iraq to greet troops around Christmas.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a different story this year. Trump has spent two weekends at Mar-a-Lago since the shutdown began on October 1, and played a round of golf at his club in Virginia. On Wednesday — as the  shutdown becomes the longest  in American history — he will travel to Miami for a speech to a financial conference. He’s expected back at his Palm Beach estate by Friday evening.\n \n\n   \n  He’s also made two separate trips abroad: to  Israel and Egypt , to preside over the Gaza ceasefire he helped broker; and a three-nation swing through Asia, where he brokered several trade deals while being met with lavish receptions and  golden tributes , including an ancient Korean crown and a brownie.\n \n\n   \n  If Trump is concerned about appearing disconnected from the struggles of furloughed workers, stranded travelers or worried  food stamp beneficiaries , there isn’t much evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Before leaving for Florida last week, Trump posted 24 photos of a  guest bathroom  he renovated in the White House residence, capturing details like a gold hand shower, crystal chandelier and terrycloth bathrobe embroidered with the presidential seal, all encased in “highly polished statuary marble.” From the window, one could glimpse the  torn-apart East Wing , whose demolition to make way for Trump’s long-desired 90,000-square-foot ballroom began a few weeks into the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  A few hours later, he was walking into the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago for a “Great Gatsby”-themed Halloween party, where dancers in beaded fringe performed atop oversized champagne coupes. If F. Scott Fitzgerald’s disillusioned narrative of Jazz Age hedonism struck any of the guests as odd on the day food stamps were set to expire, they didn’t show it. “A little party never killed nobody” was the theme, apparently devised without reaching the end of the novel.\n \n\n   \n  Before leaving Florida last weekend, Trump made a detour at the airport to inspect his private black-and-red Boeing 757, which he used to travel the country during his presidential campaign last year. The jet is upholstered in cream leather; its seatbelt buckles are plated in 24-carat gold.\n \n\n   \n  Back aboard the comparatively un-golden Air Force One, Trump departed Palm Beach on schedule. Around the rest of the country on Sunday, more than 5,000 flights traveling from and to US airports were delayed, in part because of staffing shortages among  unpaid air traffic controllers .\n \n\n   \n  The White House didn’t offer an exact explanation for why Trump’s approach to travel had changed since the last government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “While Democrats shut down the government to use struggling American families — by their own admission — as ‘leverage’ for their radical political agenda, President Trump is continuing to work night and day on behalf of American people,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. “Whether it be ensuring troops were paid, forging historic peace deals, removing dangerous criminals from the streets, lowering prices, or securing more investments for America, President Trump will never stop delivering.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not only his own past practice Trump is shrugging off by maintaining his regular routine. Other presidents have canceled plans when government funding lapsed, including President Barack Obama’s decision to scrap a trip to South Asia in 2013 and President Bill Clinton’s cancellation of a trip to Japan in 1995.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s memories of his self-imposed isolation in the last shutdown could be informing his decisions this time around. As that shutdown neared its end, the president’s cabin fever was evident, according to aides. He started several meetings muttering, “Welcome to paradise.”\n \n\n   \n  By the time it was over, it wasn’t clear what if anything Trump had gained from the ordeal, aside from most Americans’ blame. His decision to forgo weekends in Florida didn’t appear to yield much political benefit. He agreed to reopen the government having secured none of the border wall funding he was demanding.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Trump’s aides were eager to portray the president tapping his toe, waiting around the White House for Democrats to return for talks to end the funding impasse.\n \n\n   \n  Now, it is Democrats who say they are waiting for Trump to engage in negotiations to reopen the federal government. They have insisted health care programs be addressed as part of any funding measure.\n \n\n   \n  “If the president engages, we will find a deal I think within hours,” Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n \n\n   \n   Quiet discussions  this week between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have led to some optimism the shutdown may be approaching its end.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, however, has shown little willingness to negotiate. He told “60 Minutes” he won’t be “extorted” by Democrats. And he’s insisted the quickest way to end the shutdown is for Senate Republicans to  jettison the filibuster  and reopen the government without Democrats’ help.\n \n\n   \n  “If we do terminate the Filibuster, we will get EVERYTHING approved, like no Congress in History,” he wrote Tuesday on social media, brushing off  resistance from Republican leaders  who worry eliminating the 60-vote threshold for passing legislation might come back to haunt them if Democrats regain the majority.\n \n\n   \n  What, exactly, the president was willing to do to convince Republicans to fall in line wasn’t clear.\n \n\n   \n  “I think you’ll see the president continue to engage very strongly and consistently with his friends on Capitol Hill,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday. “I don’t have any meetings to read out for you at this time, but I think you should stay tuned and keep your eyes on Truth Social on this matter.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump appears convinced Democrats will catch the blame for the shutdown, though polls show Americans  mostly holding him  and the Republican Party responsible.\n \n\n   \n  His strategy has focused, in part, on maximizing the pain in the hopes Democrats will relent, including by  attempting to  permanently lay off federal employees, threatening to  withhold back pay  for workers once the shutdown ends and halting funding for certain projects in Democratic-led states.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump and his budget officials have found pots of money to keep military service personnel paid, he initially resisted tapping into contingency funds to sustain food assistance programs, which 42 million low-income Americans benefit from.\n \n\n   \n  After two federal judges found fault in the administration’s refusal to fund the benefits, the administration  said it would do so .\n \n\n   \n  As he was flying to Florida Friday, Trump maintained he wouldn’t meet Democrats until they voted with Republicans to fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll meet very quickly, but they have to open up the country. It’s their fault. Everything is their fault. It’s so easily solved,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Before then, however, the Mar-a-Lago ballroom beckoned.\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight, we have a big celebration of Halloween,” he said, “and I’ll see you later.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/middleeast/analysis-cheney-middle-east-legacy-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"13:19:00-05:00","title":"Dick Cheney helped design the ‘war on terror.’ It opened a Pandora’s box that still hasn’t been closed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dick Cheney, a prominent U.S. political figure who served as defense secretary and vice president, played a central role in promoting the false claim that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which justified the 2003 Iraq War.

Bush during Operation Desert Storm. He was vice president under the younger Bush during the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Dick Cheney, who  passed away  Tuesday at the age of 84, was arguably one of the most powerful and influential US vice presidents in history.\n \n\n   \n   Cheney  was, it was said again and again on the day of his passing, President George W. Bush’s chief operating officer.\n \n\n   \n  And as COO, he was one of the most forceful and outspoken proponents for regime change in Iraq – perhaps his most lasting, and darkest, legacy.\n \n\n   \n  “Simply stated,” he said at the annual convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in August 2002, “there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has  weapons of mass destruction . There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.”\n \n\n   \n  Simply stated, the Iraqi president  didn’t  have any weapons of mass destruction. He was not amassing them to use against anyone. Yet those mythical “WMDs” were the pretext for a war and subsequent costly, clumsy, and heavy-handed occupation that opened a Pandora’s box of bloodshed, displacement, terrorism and tyranny. The box is still open.\n \n\n   \n  The US-led military campaign, which Cheney helped plan, was brilliant from a US perspective. Fast and decisive, it took just 20 days for American and coalition troops to invade Iraq and reach Baghdad.\n \n\n   \n  The occupation, for which Cheney must also bear some responsibility, was a catastrophe.\n \n\n   \n  Within weeks of Hussein’s fall in April 2003, trouble began in cities like Fallujah and Ramadi and after a few months the US-led coalition was struggling, and in many areas failing, to maintain order.\n \n\n   \n  The failures of that occupation were many, relating to security, governance, the economy, and provision of basic municipal services.\n \n\n   \n  Simply put, the Americans had willingly stumbled into a situation where they were largely clueless (or, critics would argue, willingly indifferent) to the complexities of an ancient society.\n \n\n   \n  “Saddam knew his opponents, and killed them,” Baghdad shop owner Abu Kazim told me a year after the US-led invasion. “But the Americans, even if they don’t mean it, don’t know who is who. They’ve put us all in danger.”\n \n\n   \n  This was also when a torture scandal emerged at Baghdad’s Abu Ghraib prison. Images of Iraqi detainees being stripped naked and abused, published by the media, shocked the world.\n \n\n   \n  “They were cursing at us. ‘Shut up! F**k you! Shut the f**k up!” Haydar Sabbar Ali told me.\n \n\n   \n  Haydar was prisoner 13077 at Abu Ghraib, one of those photographed by the American army prison guards in various positions of agony.\n \n\n   \n  “If you talked, they hit you hard in sensitive places, in the kidney, in the chest, in the throat,” Haydar told me in April 2004. “Our bodies were full of bruises.”\n \n\n   \n  A traffic policeman during Hussein’s rule, Haydar was never charged, and in early 2004 was released.\n \n\n   \n  Then Vice President Cheney condemned those behind the torture scandal, while at the same time defending water-boarding as a useful means of extracting vital intelligence (many intelligence experts say water-boarding is torture, and its victims will say anything to avoid further abuse).\n \n\n   \n  Today, Iraq has stabilized. Baghdad is no longer a war zone. The country is still crippled by corruption, and it was only a few years ago that it managed (with US and coalition help) after several years of war, to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), itself a direct result of the US invasion and occupation. Iran, Baghdad’s arch enemy during Hussein’s rule, now enjoys significant influence in Iraq – another direct result of the US invasion.\n \n\n   \n  Apart from the moral morass and human cost of America’s foreign military misadventures, there is the lasting economic damage of the wars of which Cheney was such an avid advocate. According to Brown University’s Costs of War Project, post September 11, 2001, conflicts cost the United States  8 trillion dollars .\n \n\n   \n  The post 9/11 blunders in which Cheney played a part can be tied to the rise of ISIS, perennial instability in the Middle East, the migrant crisis and the crushing debt burden ($38 trillion and counting) that looms over the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  It would be unfair to blame Iraq’s plight, and the broader plight of the Middle East, on Cheney alone. After all, he is just one in a long line of American leaders who has played fast and loose in the region with dire consequences and left the United States in an ever more precarious state.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/himalaya-peak-avalanche-nepal-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"13:05:00.000Z","title":"Foreign climbers and Nepali guides among 7 killed in avalanche on Nepal mountain","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche on Mount Yalung Ri in Nepal killed at least seven people, including five foreign climbers and two Nepali guides, while also injuring eight others.

Monday has killed at least seven people, including five foreign climbers and two Nepali guides, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  At least 15 people were climbing the 5,630-meter (18,471–foot) mountain when the avalanche struck base camp around 10:30 a.m. local time, Gyan Kumar Mahato, the deputy superintendent of police in Nepal’s Dolakha district, said.\n \n\n   \n  Two Italian nationals, two Nepalis and climbers from France, Germany and Canada were among the dead, according to the Dolakha district administration office.\n \n\n   \n  The bodies of two of the climbers have been recovered, Mahato told CNN, and rescuers were digging through the ice and snow to reach the other five bodies.\n \n\n   \n  Eight people were injured in the avalanche, according to the administration office. Mahato previously said five Nepali guides and porters were able to make their own way back to base camp, located at 4,900 meters (16,070 feet).\n \n\n   \n  Authorities initially said three people had died, before updating that figure, as well as the number of climbers on the mountain, on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Weather has been deteriorating since last week in Nepal, with snowstorms reported on the mountains, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  Search and rescue teams launched an hours-long operation to reach the climbers but the weather conditions, high altitude and difficult terrain complicated their efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a problem of oxygen also,” Mahato told CNN. “Only trained people who live in hilly, mountain areas can conduct rescue operations.

However, hundreds of foreign climbers come to scale smaller peaks during the autumn months between the rainy monsoon months and winter, according to AP.\n \n\n   \n  Mahato said that while the avalanche occurred “suddenly,” authorities had warned climbers in the region about the rain and imminent monsoon.\n \n\n   \n  “But they had started their climb before the monsoon occurred,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  In a separate incident, the bodies of two Italian climbers were recovered on Tuesday during search and rescue operations on the 6,887-meter (22,595-foot) Mount Panbari, in Nepal’s western Manaslu region.\n \n\n   \n  Three Italian climbers had been reported missing on the mountain after they lost contact on October 29 following heavy snowfall, the district’s deputy superintendent of police, Gorkha Raj Kumar Shrestha, told CNN.

Abigail Spanberger  turned in the strongest Democratic performance in the state’s recent history as she coasted to victory. And in New Jersey, another moderate, Rep.  Mikie Sherrill , busted apart the coalition Trump and her Republican rival, former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli, had put together to close the Garden State’s gap in recent elections.\n \n\n   \n  In New York City, democratic socialist  Zohran Mamdani’s win  marked the second time this year he’d defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo — first in the Democratic primary, and then in the general election, with Cuomo running as an independent backed by Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic wins by candidates with sharp ideological differences will do little to settle the party’s long-raging internal debate about its way forward, with a host of competitive midterm primaries just months away and the 2028 presidential primary already looming.\n \n\n   \n  But their campaigns had some things in common. Though their solutions were different, the candidates focused on the issue of affordability. And they were all fiercely critical of Trump’s performance.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not just a message about Democrats; it’s a message about our entire country. I think Americans are appalled by what they are seeing coming out of this administration,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN from Mamdani’s victory party.\n \n\n   \n  In California,  voters approved  a redistricting ballot measure intended to boost Democrats’ chances in next year’s battle for control of the House. And in Pennsylvania, Democratic state Supreme Court justices won their retention votes, allowing Democrats to keep their majority on the high court in a perennial battleground state where legal challenges over voting rules are all but certain.\n \n\n   \n  Here are six initial takeaways from Tuesday’s elections:\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani defeats Cuomo — again\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani drew immense national attention over his progressive ideology and his courtship of voters who were eager for a fresh face. But in New York City, his relentless focus on driving down costs might have proven more persuasive — and voters were on course to give his forthcoming efforts a boost by also approving a series of ballot measures intended to reduce red tape on building affordable housing.\n \n\n   \n  If he delivers on his promises, it would turn New York City into a blueprint for cities across the country where the cost of living has soared. If Mamdani fails, he could be used as a warning against progressives more broadly as the 2028 presidential primary approaches.\n \n\n   \n  For Cuomo, who was attempting a political comeback after resigning from the governor’s office in 2021, the outcome was an embarrassment. It was also a failure for Trump, who late in the race supported Cuomo rather than Republican Curtis Sliwa, saying Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that “if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time.”\n \n\n   \n    A big suburban swing\n \n\n   \n  The first big win for Democrats on Tuesday came in Virginia, where Spanberger, a former CIA officer who had won a competitive congressional district in 2018 and held it until retiring this year to focus on the governor’s race, pulled away from Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n \n\n   \n  One window into her dominance came in Loudoun County — a closely-watched mix of suburbs and exurbs in Northern Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  With most of the expected vote counted there at 9 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday, Spanberger had more than 64% of the vote there. That was 8 percentage points better than former Vice President Kamala Harris did in the 2024 presidential election, and 9 points better than the party’s losing 2021 gubernatorial nominee, Terry McAuliffe. Spanberger was nearly 5 points ahead of former Gov. Ralph Northam’s performance in Loudoun County in 2017 — a big Democratic win in Trump’s first term that presaged the party’s strong 2018 midterm performance.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger outperformed recent Democratic candidates across the map in Virginia, likely fueled in part by the Trump administration’s gutting of the federal workforce. Thousands of current and former federal workers live throughout the region.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s exit poll found that Spanberger won 61% of the vote of those who have a federal worker or federal contractor in their household, compared to 52% support from those who do not.\n \n\n   \n  Her margins were large enough to pull Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general who was rocked by the disclosure of text messages in which he suggested a former legislative colleague should be shot, across the finish line, even though he lagged Spanberger by about 5 points. Jones defeated Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.\n \n\n   \n    A barrier falls in Virginia\n \n\n   \n  No matter the outcome, Virginia’s election was going to make history: The winner would become the first woman to serve as its governor.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger noted that history, relaying to supporters that her husband had told their children that their mother would become the governor of Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “I can guarantee, those words have never been spoken in Virginia before,” she said. “It’s a big deal that the girls and young women I have met along the campaign trail now know with certainty they can achieve anything.”\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey reveals anti-Trump sentiment\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, candidate quality was a factor in the outcome, as Republicans grumbled for months about their nominee, Earle-Sears.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey was a different story.\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli had a strong statewide performance under his belt after his near-miss in the 2021 governor’s race. He also had his own brand — a “Jersey guy” appeal that he hoped would give him some separation from Trump, despite the president’s endorsement, Ciattarelli’s praise for his performance in office and Democrats’ relentless advertising campaign tying him to Trump in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000.\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, those realities made New Jersey the better barometer of anti-Trump sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  One key question was whether Ciattarelli could replicate Trump’s performance with Latino voters: They swung hard in the GOP’s favor nationally last November, with the president winning 46% support to Harris’ 51% with Latinos, CNN’s exit poll found. On Tuesday in New Jersey, the answer was no: Sherrill won 64% of Latino voters to Ciattarelli’s 32%, per CNN’s exit poll.\n \n\n   \n  She also won 91% of Black voters. And she won independents by a 7-point margin. Moderates backed Sherrill, 58% to 39%.\n \n\n   \n  Ciattarelli won handily among the 34% of voters who said taxes was the most important issue facing New Jersey. But 32% said the economy — which Republicans had hoped would be a strength, since the state is currently controlled by Democrats — was the most important issue, and those voters backed Sherrill, 61% to 37%, according to CNN’s exit poll.\n \n\n   \n    Newsom’s big redistricting moment\n \n\n   \n  California voters gave Democrats’ hopes of winning a House majority in next year’s midterms a massive boost on Tuesday — and gave Gov. Gavin Newsom  a signature moment  on the national stage, demonstrating to Democratic voters that he can stand up to Trump ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s voters approved a ballot measure that would scrap the current congressional district boundaries drawn by an independent commission in favor of new maps that would hand Democrats five more favorable districts.\n \n\n   \n  The mid-decade redistricting is Newsom’s answer to Texas, which redrew its maps in an effort to hand the GOP five more winnable districts at Trump’s behest as the president searched for ways to retain the GOP’s narrow House majority next year.\n \n\n   \n  Amid a short but pitched advertising battle ahead of the vote, Newsom made himself the face of the redistricting effort. He raised $108 million for the effort, and appeared in advertisements backing it. He pitched it in a series of interviews and podcast appearances.\n \n\n   \n  “With Prop 50, The Election Rigging Response Act, we can stop Trump cold,” Newsom said in one spot, standing in front of an American flag. National audiences may be seeing him a lot more in the years to come.\n \n\n   \n    Down-ballot Democratic wins\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the big-ticket victories in Virginia, New Jersey, New York and California, Democrats won lower-profile contests that could pay dividends in the years to come.\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Supreme Court justices retained their seats for new 10-year terms — preserving the party’s court majority in a state where presidential elections can be won and lost, and voting rules are regularly challenged.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s elections also had ramifications for the national redistricting arms race. Democrats are on track to expand their narrow majority in the Virginia House of Delegates, clearing the way for the party to pursue a constitutional amendment that would allow them to draw new congressional maps.\n \n\n   \n  And in Maine, a critical state in next year’s battle for Senate control, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have required voters to present photo identification at the polls and when requesting absentee ballots, among other restrictive measures.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"1117-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:27:00-05:00","title":"Tracking States’ Unprecedented Redistricting Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, the United States has experienced an unprecedented surge in politically motivated redistricting, with Republicans, particularly under President Donald Trump’s influence, actively redrawing congressional maps to preserve their narrow majority in the House.

states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps.

Voters’ dissatisfaction with Trump helped fuel Democratic wins in key races \n       \n  By Ariel Edwards-Levy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:41 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Last November, Donald Trump won a return to the White House amid broad national dissatisfaction with the state of the country. A year later   CNN exit polling finds voters expressing similar pessimism and anti-incumbent sentiments — this time, helping to fuel a sweep of Democratic victories in some of the first  major electoral tests  of the second Trump presidency.\n \n\n   \n  Across four  closely watched contests  — the governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey, the mayoral race in New York City and the redistricting-related Proposition 50 in California — majorities of voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance. In Virginia, New Jersey and California, more than half of the electorate sees their vote as sending a  message to Trump . That message, largely one of opposition, helped to propel Democratic gubernatorial wins by Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia. In California, it helped seal support for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s push to redraw the state’s congressional maps.\n \n\n   \n  Democrat Zohran Mamdani’s win in New York City’s mayoral race, meanwhile, may owe more to local concerns about issues like cost of living. But it also reflects a loss for former governor Andrew Cuomo, whom  Trump endorsed at the last minute .\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s Democratic victories come despite middling ratings for the Democratic Party, with Spanberger, Sherrill and Mamdani winning 16% to 33% of the vote among voters who dislike their party.\n \n\n   \n  In New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City, voters call economic issues – taxes, cost of living or the economy as a whole – their top concern. Only voters in Virginia see their state’s economy as excellent or good, while those in California, New York City and New Jersey take a more pessimistic view of their state or city’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  CNN Exit Polls are from the Voter Poll conducted by SSRS, which combines thousands of pre-election interviews with those conducted at polling places to reflect the opinions of the full electorate. That scope makes them a powerful tool for understanding the demographic profile and political views of voters in this year’s election. And their findings will eventually be weighted against the ultimate benchmark: the results of the elections themselves. Even so, exit polls are still polls, with margins for error — which means they’re most useful when treated as estimates, rather than precise measurements. That’s particularly true for the earliest numbers, which haven’t yet been adjusted to match final election results. Learn more about how this year’s surveys were conducted  here .\n \n\n   \n  Even in a political environment with sharply national overtones, tonight’s results also reflect factors deeply specific to each election. Here’s a closer look at each of these key races:\n \n\n   \n    Virginia\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, Spanberger’s victory in the governor’s race was powered in significant part by unhappiness with the state of the nation. A majority of voters said they disapproved of Trump — and roughly 9 in 10 of those voters supported Spanberger over her rival, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears.\n \n\n   \n  Closer to home, voters give Glenn Youngkin, the state’s outgoing Republican governor, majority approval. But Earle-Sears wasn’t able to hold onto enough of his supporters: Roughly one-quarter of voters who think he did a good job as governor still backed Spanberger to succeed him.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a similar pattern when it comes to key issues in the state. While about half of voters said that societal support for transgender rights has gone too far, more than one-fifth in that group still support Spanberger over Earle-Sears, who made attacks on transgender rights a cornerstone of her campaign. By contrast, just over half of voters also say that the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far — and Spanberger won more than 9 in 10 of them.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger won among voters who identify as political independents — a group that makes up roughly a third of this year’s electorate — and among female voters, voters with college degrees and the majority of voters in the state who say abortion should be legal in most or all cases. She also notched a significant advantage among voters from households where someone worked this year as a federal employee or was employed as a federal contractor.\n \n\n   \n  Earle-Sears did win among the roughly 45% of voters who say that  texts sent  by Democratic state attorney general nominee Jay Jones are disqualifying — although Spanberger did get the votes of about 20% in that group. Spanberger denounced the texts but did not call for Jones to drop out.\n \n\n   \n  Downballot, about 41% of voters said that  texts sent  by Jones were disqualifying, with 37% calling them concerning but not disqualifying or describing them as not a concern, and 18% saying they hadn’t heard enough to say. Jones also won his race, as did the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, Ghazala Hashmi.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s victory over Republican Jack Ciattarelli took place in the shadow of two unpopular incumbents: Trump’s approval rating stands at about 42% among voters in this year’s election, with the state’s outgoing Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, also seeing an approval rating that’s slightly underwater.\n \n\n   \n  Those factors map closely onto Tuesday’s race: Roughly 9 in 10 voters who disapprove of Trump cast their vote for Sherrill, while roughly 8 in 10 who disapprove of Murphy backing the Republican to replace him.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill’s favorability rating is about 10 points higher than Ciattarelli’s, and about half say her campaign against him was mostly fair, while voters are split on the fairness of Ciattarelli’s campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 7 in 10 voters say that property tax rates are a major problem where they live, and about 6 in 10 say the same of electricity costs. More than half also call political corruption in the state a major problem.\n \n\n   \n  Most voters who call the economy or health care the top issue in the state backed Sherrill, while voters who are more focused on taxes or immigration largely supported Ciattarelli.\n \n\n   \n    New York City\n \n\n   \n  New York City’s multi-candidate  mayoral race  was marked by sharp demographic divides.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani won with a coalition that included majority support among voters younger than 45, college graduates, first-time voters and renters. He also won most of the city’s Democratic voters.\n \n\n   \n  Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo won a majority of Jewish voters. He also outpaced Mamdani among older voters, those without a college degree and those born in the city. Independents in the city, meanwhile, were closely split between Mamdani and Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  There were also big differences between the bases of support for Mamdani and Cuomo. Nearly 90% of Mamdani’s supporters say their vote is to support him, rather than to oppose his rivals. (Republican Curtis Sliwa’s voters also saw their ballot as a statement of support.) By contrast, Cuomo’s voters are closely split between voting to support him and voting to oppose the other candidates.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani voters overwhelmingly called cost of living the top issue facing the city, while Cuomo voters were divided between cost of living and crime. And a plurality of Mamdani’s supporters say it was most important either that their candidate would bring needed change, while Cuomo’s supporters broadly say they were looking for the candidate with the right experience.\n \n\n   \n  Although most voters say they’re holding steady or getting ahead financially, nearly 60% call cost of living the city’s most important issue. And more than 7 in 10 say the cost of housing where they live is a major problem, compared to just about one-third who say crime is a major problem. About 4 in 10 call the candidates’ positions on Israel a major factor in their vote.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani won a majority of that big swath of voters who said they were highly concerned with housing costs, while those highly concerned about the candidates’ positions on Israel split about evenly between him and Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n    California\n \n\n   \n  California voters were keenly aware of the stakes of Proposition 50, the ballot measure to temporarily enact a new congressional map drawn by Democrats in response to Republican-driven  redistricting in other states . Roughly two-thirds who voted said that it’s very important to them which party controls Congress, rising to about 76% among “yes” voters.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of California voters — including those who backed Proposition 50 — say they’d generally prefer state congressional district lines to be drawn by a non-partisan commission than the party in power. But the majority who voted “yes” on the measure also see it as a response to GOP-led redistricting elsewhere: around 82% say they see it as a way to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, rather than the best way of drawing congressional districts.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, about half of California voters say that neither party is handling the redrawing of congressional district lines fairly, with the rest more likely to say that only the Democrats are taking a fair approach than that only the Republicans are.\n \n\n   \n  Around three-quarters of California voters say they’re dissatisfied with or angry about the way things are going in the U.S., and about half say they view their vote as a way to oppose Trump. More than 6 in 10 say that the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far, and most say the governor should not cooperate with the Trump administration on its enforcement efforts. A majority also oppose the idea of the federal government sending the National Guard into major cities in California.\n \n\n   \n  More than 80% say that the cost of living in their area is unaffordable, and the economy far outpaces immigration, health care, crime or climate change as the top issue facing the state.\n \n\n   \n   The CNN Voter Poll conducted by SSRS was conducted from October 22nd -November 4th, and includes representative samples of 4,490 voters in California, 4,336 voters in New Jersey, 4,522 voters in Virginia and 4,447 voters in New York City. The Voter Poll combines data collected from verified registered voters online and by telephone, with data collected in-person from Election Day voters at 30 precincts each in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City. Respondents could complete the poll in English or Spanish. The overall margin of sampling error for voters, accounting for design effects, is approximately plus or minus 2.1 percentage points in California, 2.0 percentage points in New Jersey, 2.2 percentage points in New York City, and 2.0 percentage points in Virginia. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/jared-isaacman-nasa-trump-nomination-withdrawal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:22:00-11:00","title":"Trump again taps tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA after previously pulling nomination","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has re-nominated tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to serve as NASA administrator, reversing his earlier decision to withdraw the nomination amid political tensions and concerns over political affiliations.

By Alejandra Jaramillo, Kristen Holmes, Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:22 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump is nominating tech billionaire Jared Isaacman for a second time to serve as administrator of NASA, he announced on social media Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman, an Elon Musk associate who has twice traveled to space on private SpaceX missions, was  previously tapped for the position  before Trump unexpectedly  withdrew his nomination  earlier this year, citing a “thorough review of prior associations.”\n \n\n   \n  “This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday. “Jared’s passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  previously reported  that Trump and Isaacman reopened lines of communication over the summer and it soon became clear to officials that Isaacman was not only back in the mix to lead NASA, but a frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the president’s post, Isaacman thanked Trump and pledged to uphold the agency’s mission to “inspire the world once again.”’\n \n\n   \n  “To the innovators building the orbital economy, to the scientists pursuing breakthrough discoveries and to dreamers across the world eager for a return to the Moon and the grand journey beyond–these are the most exciting times since the dawn of the space age– and I truly believe the future we have all been waiting for will soon become reality,” he said in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday’s announcement came as some Trump officials have in recent weeks expressed frustration with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who has been serving as NASA’s acting administrator, with internal wrangling over who will lead the agency spilling into public view, two sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy had said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently and fold NASA into the Department of Transportation, one source said.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the secretary told CNN he said that “NASA might benefit from being part of the Cabinet, maybe even within the Department of Transportation,” but denied Duffy said he wanted to keep the NASA administrator job.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy on Tuesday congratulated Isaacman on his nomination and praised the work the agency has done under his interim leadership.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve made giant leaps in our mission to return to the Moon before China. It’s critical for our national security and national pride that we win the next space race,” he said on X. “Congratulations to  @rookisaacman  . I wish him all the success and will ensure the transition is seamless.”\n \n\n   \n  The abrupt withdrawal of Isaacman earlier this year left a bad taste in the mouths of many within the White House, with some pointing fingers at a top Trump aide for convincing the president that Isaacman’s past Democratic donations disqualified him.\n \n\n   \n  That frustration only grew when the decision was announced as Trump and Musk kicked off a messy, monthslong feud.\n \n\n   \n  As CNN previously  reported , Sergio Gor, a longtime Trump ally, moved to oust Isaacman after Musk left his brief, unofficial role in Washington several months ago, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s departure, which came when he was presumably days away from being confirmed for the NASA job by the Senate, was an act of retribution against Musk who had “rubbed a couple people wrong,” the source told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    NASA’s looming moon race\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s reinstatement comes as NASA is headed for a crucial few years. The space agency is racing to return astronauts to the moon amid a geopolitical standoff with China, which aims to send its taikonauts there by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  NASA’s moon landing plan, called Artemis, is currently at an inflection point. Recently, Duffy suggested he and the space agency may  sideline  SpaceX from its roster of private-sector partners for the lunar touchdown mission, called Artemis III.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy’s team said it intended to send a “Request for Information,” or RFI, to the space industry when the government shutdown concludes. The request would ask companies to detail how they may rapidly produce a lunar lander vehicle and get NASA astronauts to the moon quicker than SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear if NASA will move forward with the RFI. Isaacman is viewed as a close ally of Musk and SpaceX, though he has emphasized that he intends to foster competition across the commercial space industry as head of NASA.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman would also take on the top job as NASA’s workforce is showing signs of discontent amid job cuts and looming budget reductions — including a proposed 47% cut to the agency’s science budget mapped out in Trump’s budget request earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has called those proposed cuts suboptimal.\n \n\n   \n  During an April  confirmation hearing , Isaacman faced wide-ranging questions about how NASA’s priorities might change under his leadership and signaled an interest in Mars — the longtime focus of Musk and SpaceX.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman faced questioning from national security hawks who raised concerns that relinquishing NASA’s focus on the moon could cede ground to China. In response, Isaacman had struck a conciliatory tone, saying, “We don’t have to make a binary decision of Moon versus Mars.”\n \n\n   \n  After the confirmation hearing, Isaacman’s remarks were met with praise throughout the space industry — as well as skepticism about how NASA would pay for such bold ambitions as the Trump administration seeks to tighten federal spending.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/spanberger-sherrill-roommates-similar-paths-to-office","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:17:00-05:00","title":"Spanberger and Sherrill Make History as First Female Governors in Virginia and New Jersey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, once roommates on Capitol Hill and members of the centrist 'Mod Squad' in Congress, have made history by becoming the first female governors in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.

and Sherrill were roommates on Capitol Hill. They’re now making history in their states \n       \n  By Arit John, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:17 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Six years ago,  Abigail Spanberger  and  Mikie Sherrill  were roommates and freshmen members of Congress, part of a record-breaking wave of women who helped Democrats win back the US House.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the two made history once more. CNN projected that Spanberger will be Virginia’s first female governor and Sherrill will be the first Democratic woman elected as governor of New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n  Their wins come at a time when Democrats are navigating difficult questions over who the next leaders of the party should be and what messages will work to win over voters who shifted toward President Donald Trump last year.\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger and Sherrill’s victories offer at least one path forward for Democrats. Both ran aggressively on affordability issues and promises to lower health care, housing and utility costs. It appears to have resonated with voters: Spanberger and Sherrill both surpassed the total number of votes their predecessors won in 2021 before votes were fully tallied in their states.\n \n\n   \n  “Tonight we sent a message,” Spanberger told supporters at her election night rally. “We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, a former CIA officer, and Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot, both won Republican-held seats in 2018 by running as national security-minded centrists. In Congress, they – along with Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and former Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia – formed the Mod Squad, a more centrist version of the progressive Squad.\n \n\n   \n  Years after they ran and won their first races, the two newest members of the Democratic Governors Association will enter this next phase of their careers side-by-side as well. Spanberger described the feeling of running in one of this year’s few competitive races alongside her friend as “amusing.”\n \n\n   \n  “Being able to compare notes has been fun,” she told CNN recently. “But I think what I’m most excited about is just — I know what I’m about to say sounds cheesy, but I mean it sincerely — how hardworking she is … I think there will be some really interesting value in thinking through different issues or different challenges because we’re aligned in many places, but we get to the same place from different directions.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger, 46, and Sherrill, 53, moved in with each other after growing tired of living on Capitol Hill on their own. The pair ate dinner off Sherrill’s gold-rimmed wedding china and sat on a two-decade-old couch Spanberger brought out of storage,  they told the Washington Post last year .\n \n\n   \n  They’re both eldest of three girls. They both have multiple children – Spanberger has three kids, Sherrill has four. The Virginia governor-elect was born in New Jersey, while the incoming New Jersey governor grew up in northern Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think either of us thought we were going to run for office until in 2018 we felt called to serve again and have been in it ever since,”  Sherrill told CNN last month .\n \n\n   \n  During a campaign event this summer, Spanberger told reporters they were both eager to meet voters across their districts when they challenged longtime incumbent Republicans in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “I maintain my friendship with her, so I know a bit about what she’s been doing across the campaign trail, and she’s been traveling everywhere in New Jersey,” Spanberger said. “The common thread is that we’re relentlessly focused on the issues that people across our communities bring to us.”\n \n\n   \n  After their races were called, the two governors-elect also reflected on the historic nature of their wins. Sherrill mentioned “the little girls who come up to me and say they’re going to be a governor, or they’re going to be a president.”\n \n\n   \n  Spanberger noted that her husband had told their three daughters minutes earlier that their mother would be the state’s next governor.\n \n\n   \n  “And I can guarantee that those words have never been spoken in Virginia ever before,” she said. “The history Virginia is making tonight is yours.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/americas/venezuela-maduro-app-spy-us-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00.000Z","title":"Fearing US effort to remove him, Maduro urges Venezuelans to snitch via app","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In response to growing fears of U.S. military intervention, particularly under the Trump administration’s authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro has expanded the use of the VenApp mobile application—originally created for reporting utility issues—to encourage citizens to report 'suspicious' people or activities.

remove him, Maduro urges Venezuelans to snitch via app \n       \n  By Stefano Pozzebon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EST, Wed November 5, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Faced with the prospect of  armed conflict  with the United States, Venezuela’s government seems to be encouraging citizens to spy on each other by using a revamped mobile application to report suspicious people or activities.\n \n\n   \n  The software, called VenApp, was originally launched by Venezuelan President  Nicolás Maduro  in 2022 as a hybrid application, integrating a messaging service with a helpline for people to report issues with utility services, such as power outages and water disruptions.\n \n\n   \n  Now it is being used as a tool for Venezuelans to inform the government of anything that it might consider seditious or disloyal, raising alarm among Maduro opponents and human rights groups about a possible surge in political detentions.\n \n\n   \n  “This initiative represents a serious concern for privacy, freedom of expression, and security, because it promotes a system of social vigilance and the militarization of public order,” the online activist group Venezuela Sin Filtro wrote in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Venezuelan Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on criticism of the app.\n \n\n   \n  Fearing that US pressure, including President Donald Trump’s recent authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela, could stir upheaval in his country, Maduro last month invited the armed forces to oversee the creation of “a new app, so that the people can safely report everything they hear, everything they read.”\n \n\n   \n  Within a week, the update was made.\n \n\n   \n  Adding to the government’s anxieties that the United States may be pursuing “regime change” in the South American nation, the US military is deploying warships, fighter jets, and up to 10,000 troops to the southern Caribbean Sea, allegedly to combat drug traffickers.\n \n\n   \n  The operations, which the Trump administration claims have killed  more than 60 alleged “narcoterrorists,”  have been criticized by the United Nations and some US lawmakers, as well as several governments in the region. They are concerned about the abuse of presidential powers in committing what they say are extrajudicial killings without disclosing any proof of guilt.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has ruled Venezuela with an iron fist since 2013 and has clung to power despite an apparently decisive loss in the 2024 presidential election. The country’s electoral authority, stacked with Maduro sympathizers, proclaimed him the winner amid allegations of vote-rigging, which the government denied.\n \n\n   \n  When widespread street protests erupted after that election, Maduro invited citizens to use VenApp to report opposition activities. Human Rights groups such as Amnesty International then weighed in. Amnesty warned that the app could be used “to not only limit people’s right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, but also potentially contribute to unlawful arrests, detention, and other serious human rights abuses.”\n \n\n   \n  The furor prompted Apple and Google to remove VenApp from their play stores.\n \n\n   \n  But even though it could no longer be downloaded, the app never stopped working: Those who had VenApp before August 2024 can access it on their smartphones, and the government also created and sponsored a mobile version that runs in browsers.\n \n\n   \n  In the capital, Caracas, CNN took a rare look at the application.\n \n\n   \n  Citizens were invited to inform the government if they see drones or the presence of “suspicious people” in Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Human rights organizations have renewed their criticism, airing concerns about the persecution of dissent in a country where more than 800 people are behind bars for political reasons, according to the legal rights organization Foro Penal. The government denies holding political prisoners.\n \n\n   \n  Among VenApp users who support the government’s aims is a resident of a slum on the outskirts of Caracas who spoke anonymously, fearing government retaliation for speaking to a foreign journalist and retribution from neighbors who oppose Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  The app worked beautifully to resolve public utility hiccups, he told CNN, and he would not hesitate to use it to inform on other Venezuelans if he felt the country was under attack from foreign forces.\n \n\n   \n  “We are prepared to defend the fatherland, our country, as the good revolutionaries we are!” said the man, who is in his 50s and does odd jobs in Venezuela’s vast “informal economy.”\n \n\n   \n  It is hard to quantify how many other Venezuelans support Maduro.\n \n\n   \n  According to electoral tallies collected by the opposition, which CNN’s analysis found to be legitimate, Maduro won about 30% of the vote in last year’s election. The European Union and independent electoral monitoring organizations such as the Carter Center and the Colombian Electoral Mission also backed the opposition’s claim.\n \n\n   \n  It is similarly difficult to gauge the support that a US offensive on Venezuelan territory would receive. Most Venezuelans who spoke to CNN in Caracas were wary of sharing their opinions publicly.\n \n\n   \n  VenApp could be part of the reason.\n \n\n   \n  “I would never even dream of downloading it. It’s scary that there’s now an app for citizens to denounce each other,” one opposition supporter told CNN, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n \n\n   \n  “On top of that, how do we know that the app is not spying on you?” said the woman, who is in her 40s and works for a private media company. “This is a government that spies on its people.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/shein-fast-fashion-sex-dolls-france-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:12:00.000-05:00","title":"Ultra-fast fashion and ‘childlike’ sex dolls: Why Shein isn’t winning friends in France","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Shein, a Chinese fast-fashion e-commerce platform, is facing intense backlash in France as it launches its first physical store in Paris at BHV, a landmark department store.

not welcome.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese-founded e-commerce giant Shein is set to open its first brick-and-mortar store in the world in Paris Wednesday, amid a storm of outrage in France over the platform’s reputation for throwaway fashion and a headline-roiling  scandal  over the sale of “childlike” sex dolls.\n \n\n   \n  From Wednesday, Shein will set up shop in BHV, one of the French capital’s most famous department stores, before rolling out its clothing range in five of France’s well-known Galeries Lafayette malls elsewhere in the country. Galeries Lafayette and BHV both belong to the Société des Grands Magasins (SGM) group.\n \n\n   \n  “The city of Paris reaffirms that Shein is contrary to its values,” Paris Deputy Mayor Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj told journalists outside BHV Tuesday. “We ask the Minister of the Economy to go further than just making threats and to ban the Shein platform in France.”\n \n\n   \n  Such is the strength of feeling around Shein’s touchdown in France that Galeries Lafayette published a statement in late October slamming SGM’s decision to force Shein – a brand “in contradiction with their offer and their values” – upon them.\n \n\n   \n  In retaliation, SGM Tuesday ordered five of the Galeries Lafayette malls to rebrand as BHV, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, dealing a crippling blow to a household name brand in France.\n \n\n   \n  “Our capital cannot become the showcase for disposable goods and exploitation,” Ian Brossat, a senator for Paris from the French Communist Party, said in a  statement  Monday. “This partnership goes against all the commitments taken by France and Paris to more firmly regulate the fashion industry.”\n \n\n   \n  This week, Frédéric Merlin, head of SGM, pushed back against criticism of the deal with Shein, pointing to its popularity with consumers.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re speaking of a brand that is regularly bought by 25 million French customers, who are today considered bad people because they buy from this platform?” he said in an interview Tuesday with RTL radio.\n \n\n   \n  But critics believe that Paris’ reputation for haute couture, bespoke elegance and exclusive design couldn’t be further from the disposable culture epitomized by Shein’s ultra-low-price, accessible-to-all clothing.\n \n\n   \n  Some see a double irony in Shein making landfall in Paris, home to the eponymous landmark climate agreement signed in 2016, given  wide concerns  over its environmental impact.\n \n\n   \n  The Chinese platform has become the bogeyman figurehead of the  fast-fashion industry , accused of paying scant regard to sustainable manufacturing and the environmental costs of mass global shipping. Shein, however, says its model allows it to avoid waste and overproduction.\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, Paris has sought to make itself a leader on “green” issues, championing bicycle travel and low-carbon business practices, and making sustainability a key pillar of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n \n\n   \n    Evacuate the building\n \n\n   \n  In response to Shein’s arrival, 12 brands have already announced they will remove their products from BHV’s shelves, among them prominent French clothes makers like Figaret and Armor Lux, known for their rootedness in French design and manufacturing.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the biggest name to distance itself from BHV is Disney, with Disneyland Paris abandoning plans to design BHV’s famous Christmas window displays this year, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, BHV director Karl-Stéphane Cottendin played down the significance of the brands’ departure from a flock of “more than 2,000 brands” in BHV’s stable. “Everyone is free to make their own decisions,” he said in an interview with BFMTV. “We have no problem at all with that.”\n \n\n   \n  Opposition to Shein’s arrival in Paris was clear from the earliest announcement of its partnership with BHV. But the mall’s boss has looked to exploit the controversy.\n \n\n   \n  A storeys-high poster showing SMG president and BHV owner Frederic Merlin with Shein boss Donald Tang was hung on the BHV façade in Paris last week, emblazoned with the words: “The poster that we shouldn’t have made?”\n \n\n   \n  The taunting nature of the poster was only heightened by its location, flying literally in the face of Paris’ city hall – one of the most vocal opponents to Shein’s arrival – which sits across the street from BHV.\n \n\n   \n    Hard landing\n \n\n   \n  Shein’s touchdown in Paris was almost scuppered by a scandal that rocked France over the weekend. The French finance minister threated to ban the Chinese platform from the country after revelations that “childlike sex dolls” were being sold on the e-commerce site.\n \n\n   \n  France’s High Commissioner for Children Sarah El-Haïry slammed the availability of the products on Shein’s site. “No one has the right to buy pedo-criminal dolls.

violent protests in Mexican state \n       \n  By Max Saltman, Mauricio Torres, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:46 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Violent protests have broken out in the  Mexican  state of Michoacán over the murder of  an outspoken anti-crime mayor , who was killed over the weekend while taking part in a Day of the Dead celebration.\n \n\n   \n  The protests  began on Sunday   in the state capital Morelia under the slogan “enough of abuses and omissions.” The demonstration turned violent, and some people stormed Morelia’s Government Palace. Local authorities confirmed the arrest of eight people.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, authorities in the city of Apatzingán confirmed that people had set fire to the city hall saying in a Facebook post that the violence was carried out by “shock groups whose objectives are far from the true construction of peace.”\n \n\n   \n  The shocking murder of Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan, on Saturday was one of the episodes of violence that sparked these protests in the state. There was also latent anger over the murder of Bernardo Bravo Manríquez, the head of a local citrus growers association in Apatzingán, who was found dead in October just days after calling for tighter security for agriculture workers.\n \n\n   \n  The back-to-back killings of both men, who occupied different sectors of society, showed how violence has touched every part of Michoacán life, David Mora, senior Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The protests are “an honest reaction of the citizens of Michoacán… who for many years have been living under a context of extreme insecurity and high violence,” Mora said.\n \n\n   \n  Saturday’s murder of Manzo  adds to the wave of violence  affecting the southwestern Mexican state, where in December 2006 then-President Felipe Calderón launched what he called a “war” on organized crime. Since then, despite changes in government at the state and federal levels, violence has persisted.\n \n\n   \n  Instability has forced residents of some towns in Michoacán and neighboring Jalisco to abandon their homes completely, creating numerous “ghost towns” in the rural areas between the two states.\n \n\n   \n  Demonstrators referenced both Manzo and Bravo at this week’s protests.\n \n\n   \n  “For my family, for you, for Mexico, for Carlos, for Bernardo, for all who have fallen, sons of bitches!” one man shouted in a video taken by Reuters  on Monday. Other clips from protests across Michoacán, show many wearing cowboy-style hats as a nod to the late mayor’s sartorial style.\n \n\n   \n  Protesters who spoke with Reuters railed against the extortion and violence common in Michoacán, where lemon and avocado farmers are often forced to pay exorbitant bribes to drug trafficking groups.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re tired as a people,” one protester said. \n \n\n   \n     A ‘plan for peace’ \n \n\n   \n  Manzo was attacked at an event for the Day of the Dead on Saturday shortly after finishing  a livestream  on social media. The suspected attacker, who was killed at the scene but has not been identified, is a teenager believed to be between the ages of 17 and 19, Michoacan’s attorney general said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The official added that authorities believe the crime was planned by an organized crime group, but did not offer further details.\n \n\n   \n  Manzo was a popular figure in local politics in Michoacán, who was elected on a tough-on-crime platform.\n \n\n   \n  In a typical video posted on social media  in May , Manzo addressed local police while wearing a bullet-proof vest and his signature cowboy hat, warning them against providing criminals with “leniency.”\n \n\n   \n  “Any criminal you encounter who is armed and resists arrest or attacks citizens, if you detect them during operations, you must take them down; there should be no leniency with them,” Manzo said.\n \n\n   \n  The late mayor was also a fierce critic of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and her party’s approach to the country’s security issues. Manzo often posted announcements of new arrests on his  Facebook page , along with pleas to Sheinbaum’s government for better security in the face of crime and extortion in his city.\n \n\n   \n  One recent post, which Manzo implored his followers to share widely, demanded that Sheinbaum “not leave Uruapan alone in the fight against federal crimes, which are the responsibility of the federation to address.” CNN reached out to Sheinbaum’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Sheinbaum spent most of her morning press conference addressing Manzo’s death and her government’s “plan for peace and justice” in Michoacán.\n \n\n   \n  “Our commitment is to get to the truth and do justice in the case of the cowardly murder of Carlos Manzo,” Sheinbaum said.\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum said her plan would take aim at the roots of crime through strategic investments in education, living wages for farm workers, and strengthening rural infrastructure. The plan also includes “strengthening the presence of federal forces in Michoacán,” according to a document released by the president’s office after the press conference.\n \n\n   \n  Mora does not see much new in Sheinbaum’s proposal, particularly around more federal troops in Michoacán.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s doubling down on things that we’ve seen are not necessarily working in other states, in other parts of Mexico,” Mora said. “She’s sending more troops in, and that’s basically what they have been doing in Sinaloa for the past year.”\n \n\n   \n  He said the presence of troops in Sinaloa, home to Mexico’s  oldest and most  violent criminal organizations, has not reduced the crime and murder rate.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at the homicide numbers and other crimes,” Mora continued, “there’s not a direct connection between the presence of federal forces in the state and the lower numbers of murders and other crimes.”\n \n\n   \n  Mora pointed out that violence is not new in Michoacán, either. Between January and September of this year, official data shows 1,024 intentional homicides in Michoacán, placing it as  the seventh highest Mexican state for homicides in 2025 .\n \n\n   \n  The figures are lower than those of 2024, although there are no details on how many are directly linked to organized crime. Civil society organizations believe the true figure to be much higher.\n \n\n   \n  “But this reaction,” Mora said, referring to the protests, “Organic and honest, fed up with the security situation in the state – is something new.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/sport/college-football-playoff-rankings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:44:00-04:00","title":"Ohio State tops first College Football Playoff rankings but nothing is settled","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses the early release of College Football Playoff rankings, with Ohio State ranked first, and highlights the resulting fan reactions and debate.

       10:44 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  First the disclaimer: it’s early November. There is no need to overreact.\n \n\n   \n  Well, let’s be serious. The entire purpose of releasing the  College Football Playoff  rankings 33 days before it counts is to encourage fomenting, handwringing and angst.\n \n\n   \n  What else are we supposed to do? Let it play out, for heaven’s sake? How rational. How dull.\n \n\n   \n  There would be neither armchairs from which to quarterback nor watercoolers from which to debate if we simply opted to wait and see. Besides, this is college football, where  governors  insert themselves into the decision making. Melodrama reigns.\n \n\n   \n  Were the season to end tomorrow, the rankings released on Tuesday night combined with the rules - the five highest-ranked conference champions make the 12-team field via a straight seed model - would mean  Ohio State ,  Indiana , Texas A&M and Alabama would receive first-round byes. The first-round games would feature Memphis at Georgia, Virginia at Ole Miss, Notre Dame at BYU and Oregon at Texas Tech.\n \n\n   \n  So have at it. Screech your outrage, ACC schools disrespected by just one bid and pound your shoes on a desk somewhere, Notre Dame haters, especially those in the commonwealth of Kentucky and in the sunny setting of Miami.\n \n\n   \n  The Irish have two losses, Louisville has one and one of the two Notre Dame Ls came at the hands of Miami, which the Cardinals beat. (There has to be a transitive theory argument in there somewhere.) The Hurricanes, in the meantime, also have two losses and beat Notre Dame and they are a very distant 18th in the standings.\n \n\n   \n  Then exhale because there are, to paraphrase Robert Frost, still miles to go before we sleep on this college football season.\n \n\n   \n  The actual bracket will be created on December 7 and if this sport has taught us anything this season, things escalate quickly.\n \n\n   \n  It was, in fact, just one month ago to the day that Penn State made Jerry Neuheisel look like the second coming of Bear Bryant, losing to UCLA and beginning a downward spiral that  cost a coach his job , the school millions and has no signs of finding rock bottom just yet.\n \n\n   \n  Because, to borrow from another great poet - one Theodor Geisel - these first rankings ought to come with a dramatic reading of ‘Oh, the Places You’ll Go!’ It is not entirely about where you start, as where you might end up.\n \n\n   \n  From the next great QB to the next big bust, Arch Manning has found something of a sweet spot of normalcy, having steered Texas to wins against Oklahoma and Vanderbilt in the last month. With Georgia, Arkansas and Texas A&M left on the docket, the Longhorns can make their own case.\n \n\n   \n  Georgia Tech is similarly on the outside looking in, currently sitting at No. 17. But if the Yellow Jackets were to win out, that would include a season-ending win over Georgia and just one loss, which could overcome the ranking clunker of a loss to N.C. State.\n \n\n   \n  The inherent problem with rankings is whether you have four teams, 12 or 16, someone always has an argument that they’ve been overlooked. Just ask the folks who’ve made the college basketball committee which is currently pondering expanding its beautiful bracket to 76 teams. Whoever is 77th will be sure to be offended.\n \n\n   \n  The CFP selection committee this year has made a big deal about its adherence to new metrics to better evaluate strength of schedule which will, according to a release issued in August, “reward teams defeating high-quality opponents while minimizing the penalty for losing to such a team.’’\n \n\n   \n  They have not, however, come out and said exactly what those metrics look at, nor have they said how they’ll be weighted versus the eye test. In reality, they can’t.\n \n\n   \n  Analytics and metrics have offered all sorts of advances in sports. Kick the point after touchdown or go for two in football? Foul a player up three points or let it play out in basketball? Better to bunt or swing away in baseball? There’s a statistical answer for all of it.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, asked specifically about the fine hairs separating the top three undefeated teams in this first ranking, Mack Rhoades, the committee chair and athletic director at Baylor, sounded like a man torn between numbers and gut feelings.\n \n\n   \n  He explained that the committee had “robust” conversations about the trio but that ultimately they split the hair based on the fact that Ohio State “when we looked at the tape, and we looked at the metrics, we felt that Ohio State was a little better up front on the offensive line and we thought they were better defensively.’’\n \n\n   \n  Because no matter what the numbers say, eventually very real humans have to make the very hard decisions. And well, going back to the poets, to err is human.\n \n\n   \n  Of course, Alexander Pope also suggested the follow up - to forgive divine.\n \n\n   \n  But then again, the Englishman’s football team probably wasn’t sitting 13th in a 12-team playoff.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/ups-plane-crash-louisville-airport","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-05:00","title":"UPS Plane Crashes Near Louisville Airport; Investigation Begins","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS MD-11 freighter crashed shortly after takeoff near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on November 4, 2025, during a flight to Honolulu.

to cave on shutdown \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:30 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Some of the most prominent liberals in Congress are seething at an emerging deal to end the 35-day government funding stalemate without a clear win for Democrats, showcasing a massive splinter within the party that will soon be on full display.\n \n\n   \n  The divide among Democrats inside the Capitol over strategy offers a gloomy portrait of how a possible deal could land in the broader party — likely spurring ugly infighting at a critical moment as Democrats are seeking to define their future ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  There is still no official agreement within a group of Senate centrists that have been privately meeting to discuss a shutdown exit ramp. But multiple sources involved in discussions told CNN that a deal could be reached as soon as this week to pass a temporary stopgap bill to reopen the government alongside several full-year spending bills — with a promise of a future vote to extend billions in enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly a dozen Senate Democrats have privately signaled that they are willing to support a stopgap funding deal to reopen the government in exchange for a future vote on health care, two Democratic sources familiar with the discussions told CNN Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Negotiations are still ongoing on exactly what kind of stopgap funding bill the Senate would take up and how it would pass the House, the sources familiar said, but that level of party support in the Senate would be more than enough for Congress to end the funding standoff that has ground Washington to a halt for more than a month.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a reflection of the mounting frustration of many Democratic senators who can’t stomach any more shutdown pain, after this week’s partial cut-off in food aid, with the shutdown set to break the 35-day record on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Still, it won’t appease the scores of liberal senators now warning that the party will lose its leverage, and alienate voters, if it accepts such an offer.\n \n\n   \n  “If the Democrats cave on this, I think it would be a betrayal to millions and millions of working families who want them to stand up and protect their health care benefits,” a furious Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent told reporters on Tuesday when asked what message the centrist-led talks would send to voters.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’re suckers to believe that a party that is opposed to extending the subsidies now is all of a sudden going to be supportive of that a month from now,” Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut put it plainly, referring to the billions of dollars in enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire next month.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet clear whether these liberal Democrats will attempt to pressure Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to scuttle the dealmaking by the centrists or whether he would have any interest in doing so.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats huddled for nearly three hours Tuesday on the path forward, but remained uncharacteristically tight-lipped as they left. Schumer was also mum on whether he endorses the emerging plan, telling reporters: “We discussed all of the options.”\n \n\n   \n  Leaving Tuesday’s marathon meeting, retiring Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan called it “really one of the most productive caucus meetings I’ve been in.” He stressed there were no “whip counts” and instead, “everybody had a chance to really talk about ideas and issues.”\n \n\n   \n  And among the centrist Democrats, few are willing to speak publicly about where talks stand with Republicans – but many acknowledged the progress made in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  Inside the lunch on Tuesday, senators were briefed on the state of the negotiations and about the “opportunities to work together,” according to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said after the lunch meeting that the pace “has definitely picked up” but declined to get into specifics of the talks.\n \n\n   \n  “I think when there’s a deal and I get something on health care, I’ll be ready to vote,” Slotkin said, but wouldn’t say whether an ACA subsidies vote is sufficient.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told reporters that Democrats were still talking to Republicans and acknowledged the massive gulf between the two parties on health care.\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously we’re in different universes on how we’re trying to address this issue of rising costs for people,” Kelly said when asked whether a future vote on ACA subsidies could end the stalemate. “We want to bring down their health care costs, or at least make sure it’s what it was last year. My Republican colleagues and the White House seem not to care about that.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “But, you know, this thing can’t go on forever.”\n \n\n   \n  Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine similarly signaled willingness to engage with Republicans on future health care talks — as long as the bill included protections for thousands of federal workers in his own district.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got to have a path to fixing the ACA, but all the I’s and T’s don’t have to be dotted and crossed,” Kaine said, stressing that his priority in a funding deal was blocking President Donald Trump from freely firing workers and canceling federal projects, rather than a guaranteed extension of the Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Stop the mischief, no more firings, no more furloughs, no more cancellation of projects,” Kaine said.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said she wanted to establish a working group to lay out a framework to address the rising cost of health care but didn’t want to state what she would or wouldn’t accept in order to vote to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to negotiate in the press,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Still, some Democrats were adamant they would not relent without a clear agreement from Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  “A promise ain’t good enough for me,” Sen Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/california-prop-50-explained","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:19:00-05:00","title":"California Voters to Decide on Proposition 50: Redistricting Battle Over Future Congressional Maps","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California voters are being asked to approve Proposition 50, a ballot initiative that would allow state lawmakers to temporarily override the independent redistricting commission’s congressional maps until the 2030 election.

Gavin Newsom, after Texas Republicans redrew their maps to create five new seats that will favor the GOP at the behest of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom has made himself the face of the effort, investing  his own political capital  into his party’s efforts to win back control of the US House next year.\n \n\n   \n  But while Texas Republicans were able to pass new maps through the legislative process, California Democrats had to first seek voter approval. That’s because Californians amended their state Constitution in 2010 to give an independent redistricting commission the power to set congressional lines.\n \n\n   \n  Proposition 50 would give lawmakers the right to temporarily override that map through the 2030 election, after which the commission would draw the next decade’s maps.\n \n\n   \n  Supporters of the measure have argued it will level the playing field ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when Democrats hope to retake control of the US House, and serve as a check on the Trump administration.

White House says it will partially fund SNAP benefits after Trump threatens to withhold them until shutdown ends \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:40 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The White House said Tuesday it would follow through on plans to partially fund critical food aid during the government shutdown, despite President Donald Trump’s threat just hours earlier that he would withhold the federal assistance.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that she had spoken with Trump and that the administration would be “fully complying” with a court order to keep some Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits flowing.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting that partial payment out the door as much as we can and as quickly as we can,” Leavitt said of the program, which is more commonly known as SNAP or food stamps.\n \n\n   \n  Trump sparked widespread confusion earlier Tuesday when he appeared to abruptly reverse course on the  administration’s funding plan,  writing on Truth Social that SNAP “will be given only when those Radical Left Democrats open up the government, which they can easily do, and not before!”\n \n\n   \n  That move would have left millions of people without the monthly federal assistance they rely on to purchase food and sparked a fresh legal showdown. More than two dozen states and a coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses sued in separate cases last week to force the administration to keep at least some of the aid flowing.\n \n\n   \n  “This is immoral. See you in court,” Skye Perryman, the CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organization involved in the coalition’s lawsuit that also sought continuation of the SNAP benefits,  wrote on X  in response to Trump’s post.\n \n\n   \n  The administration is tapping into a roughly $5 billion contingency fund to support partial benefits into November. The Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, issued guidance earlier Tuesday to states for distributing the partial payments.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans  receive SNAP benefits , which amount to roughly $350 per household per month on average when paid out in full.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA last month said it could not pay November’s benefits, citing concerns over whether it could legally use the contingency fund or move money from other accounts. But the courts ruled that the government must tap into the contingency fund to pay partial benefits and could shift other money to enable it to fully pay the more than $8 billion in benefits, as well as other costs. And Trump himself previously indicated he had instructed the administration’s lawyers to ask the courts how it could legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible.\n \n\n   \n  “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,” he wrote Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The administration ultimately opted to use the contingency fund to pay out partial benefits.\n \n\n   \n    Varying benefit amounts\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone will receive half their benefit amount this month, according to the USDA guidance issued to states on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Those who receive the maximum monthly allotment – which in most of the country is $994 for a family of four – will receive half that amount. And one and two person households who receive the minimum monthly benefit will get $12, instead of the usual $24.\n \n\n   \n  But those in between will likely see less than half of their usual allotment, with the amount depending on their household size and income, according to Stacy Dean, who ran the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, during the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  States will have to recalculate these recipients’ benefit amount based on the reduced maximum allotment tables that USDA issued in its guidance, which is a faster way to get the payments out the door than to cut all recipients’ assistance in half. (States already base SNAP benefits on the agency’s maximum allotment tables.)\n \n\n   \n    Push to provide full benefits\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Rhode Island, meanwhile, scheduled a Thursday hearing to consider a fresh request for an order requiring the Trump administration to provide full food stamp benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  The hearing before US District Judge John McConnell will be the latest episode in a dramatic showdown over the benefits that is playing out in two federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  After the government notified McConnell of its plans on Monday that it would provide only partial SNAP benefits, the coalition that brought the legal challenge pressed the judge to intervene yet again, arguing USDA’s choice did not comport with the requirements of his order last week.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs are asking the judge to issue a new order that would tap into unused tariff funds meant for child nutrition programs to provide SNAP benefits for November. As part of that bid, they seized on Trump’s social media post in their lawsuit challenging the decision not to fully fund SNAP.\n \n\n   \n  “In addition to threatening defiance of the Court’s order, the post makes plain what Plaintiffs explained in their motion to enforce: Defendants are withholding SNAP benefits from individuals and families who need vital food assistance for partisan political gain,” attorneys for the coalition wrote in court papers.\n \n\n   \n  But the USDA told the court Monday that it would not utilize the tariff revenue because it would endanger the nation’s free and reduced-price school meals program, which serves about 29 million children a day. (The agency has transferred $750 million in tariff revenue to the WIC food assistance program for pregnant women, new moms and young children.)\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s hearing is set for 3:30 p.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/colombia-us-trump-payments-rubio","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:53:00-05:00","title":"US has yet to follow through on Trump promise to halt ‘all payments’ to Colombia as Rubio stresses importance of relationship","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite President Donald Trump's public pledge to halt all US payments to Colombia, no such interruption has occurred as of November 2025.

Trump promise to halt ‘all payments’ to Colombia as Rubio stresses importance of relationship \n       \n  By Kylie Atwood, Jennifer Hansler, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:53 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  More than two weeks after President Donald Trump said he would   halt “all payments”  to Colombia, there has not been any interruption to the assistance, even after the administration sanctioned the country’s President Gustavo Petro accusing him of playing a “role in the global illicit drug trade.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no comprehensive ongoing interagency review of all the US assistance programs to Colombia being carried out, US officials said. They pointed to a strong country-to-country relationship, built on decades of investment and singled out Petro as the biggest impediment to shoring up the joint efforts to tackle illicit drug production and trafficking inside the country. Though a review is ongoing at the State Department, a senior department official said.\n \n\n   \n  Days after Trump’s social media post deeming Petro a drug trafficker and calling for a cutting of all payments and subsidies to the country, there was an interagency meeting planned with all of the Cabinet heads to discuss US support to Columbia, US officials said. But that meeting was canceled for unknown reasons and has not been rescheduled.\n \n\n   \n  The axing of the inter-agency meeting meant that Trump’s national security adviser and Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who has been instrumental to the administration’s overall policy approach to the region – was again left as the most influential voice in the president’s ear in shaping the policy. Rubio’s staff began working with the Treasury Department to quickly put sanctions on Petro into place, sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio, following Trump’s initial Truth Social post, publicly cited the “excellent” US-Colombia relationship, founded on strong partnership.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the status of the policy, a senior administration official highlighted to the country’s difficulty tackling drug trafficking under Petro’s leadership, and pointed to a review of US assistance at the presidential level.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite billions of US taxpayer dollars invested in Colombia’s counterdrug efforts, cartels are thriving under President Petro’s failed policies. President Trump is carefully reviewing every program and only investing in projects that show clear value to protecting US citizens,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has both imposed sanctions on Petro and decertified Colombia as a partner in the fight against drug trafficking, citing the Colombian president’s “disastrous and ineffective counternarcotics policies,” State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement announcing the decertification in late October.\n \n\n   \n  As part of that decertification, Rubio approved a “significant cut to security assistance in Colombia,” a senior State Department official said.\n \n\n   \n  “That reduction is now being implemented, and there is an active and comprehensive review of FY25 funds that is underway,” they said, without providing further details.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio has made clear publicly that the administration’s issues are with Petro, not the institutions in Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  “The politics of Colombia are not actually reflected by the current president,” the top US diplomat said as he prepared to head to Asia with Trump. “Our problem with the current president, in addition to his behavior, which has been erratic and counterproductive, is that in fact he is not cooperating on our counter-drug, and we felt that was best addressed at the individual level.”\n \n\n   \n  Rubio’s remarks came as a relief to US officials who had been privately hoping that the administration would climb down and draw a distinction between penalizing the country and targeting the actions and bellicose rhetoric of the president.\n \n\n   \n  Rubio went on to say that the targeting of Petro – whom he called a “hostile foreign leader” – is “separate” from any effort to punish the joint efforts at the working level between the two countries, which the US has invested in for decades.\n \n\n   \n  While the administration has pointed to both Colombia and Venezuela as driving the drug trade, their approach to tackling the problem in each country greatly differs because of contrasting diplomatic histories. Tough sanctions have been imposed on Venezuela by both Republican and Democratic administrations given a rupture in diplomatic relations after the country’s National Assembly declared Nicolás Maduro was not the country’s legitimate leader in 2019, which was a position the US backed.\n \n\n   \n  And, in 2024, the  US accused Maduro  of stealing the country’s election.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, US-Colombia relations remain intact despite tensions at the top. Trump administration officials have also drawn up plans for  strikes inside Venezuela , while there are no plans for the same kind of action inside Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials are keenly aware of the political calendar in South America’s largest country: Petro’s presidency will end next year as he is constitutionally barred from running for a second term in the 2026 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  “Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they’re going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s anger towards Petro comes after the Colombian leader has taken on the US president very personally in addition to harshly criticizing the administration’s drug war and its support for Israel.  US officials were stunned and angry when Petro joined pro-Palestinian protests in New York in September and called on US soldiers to “disobey the orders of Trump.” It prompted the US  to revoke Petro’s visa .\n \n\n   \n  But days later, back in Colombia, the left-wing leader doubled down.\n \n\n   \n  “If Mr. Trump keeps being complicit in the genocide, as he is up to today, he deserves nothing but jail, and his army should not obey him,” Petro said in Bogota.\n \n\n   \n  Petro’s hostile stance towards Trump continued as the US drug boat strikes in the Caribbean have continued  at a steady pace  for the last two months. After one strike he accused the US of murdering a Colombian fisherman, fueling tensions and ultimately triggering Trump to declare that the US would halt payments to the nation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported that at least one US military strike in the Caribbean over the last two months  targeted Colombian nationals on a boat  that had left from Colombia, according to two people briefed by the Pentagon about the strikes.\n \n\n   \n    The ‘failures and incompetence’ of Petro\n \n\n   \n  When the US rolled out sanctions against Petro and two of his family members in recent weeks, Rubio also officially decertified Colombia as a partner in combatting drug trafficking. But the State Department’s language announcing the decertification made clear that US support for the country’s institutions are expected to endure.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain steadfast in our support for Colombian security forces, its justice sector, and departmental and municipal officials, and we will continue to partner with them in our joint efforts to combat drug trafficking,” the State Department announcement said. “Today’s decision is not a reflection on these institutions but rather the failures and incompetence of Gustavo Petro and his inner circle.”\n \n\n   \n  The senior administration official pointed to the sanctioning of Petro and his family as a Trump decision after the Colombian president failed to strengthen efforts to tackle the drug problem.\n \n\n   \n  “The decision to impose sanctions on Petro and his family was ultimately made at the Presidential level, as is every action. President Trump made it clear that Colombia is ‘failing demonstrably’ to uphold its drug control responsibilities, and Petro has since doubled down in defense of his failed policies,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  Some US foreign assistance to the country had already stopped after the destruction of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) early in Trump’s second term. However, the US has continued to provide funding from the State and Defense departments, including on counternarcotics. The US has provided about $210 million in assistance to Colombia this fiscal year, including about $31 million in agricultural support, according to  data  from the US Department of State.\n \n\n   \n  While US officials believe that the strategy to target Petro instead of the whole of Colombia’s security institutions is settled for the time being, they warn that things could always quickly change.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking a day after Rubio last month, Sen. Lindsey Graham said that Trump believes that both Venezuela and Colombia “have been safe havens for narco-terrorists for too long.” Graham added, during his CBS interview, that Trump said there were plans to brief members of Congress after his trip to Asia “about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.”\n \n\n   \n    Unintended consequences\n \n\n   \n  The US has been working to establish the close relationship it has with Colombia since the late 1990s. The Clinton administration launched Plan Colombia in 2000, which was a $1.3 billion program primarily to support the military and security forces’ fight against growing and trafficking narcotics.\n \n\n   \n  But before that period in 1997 the US had cut off assistance to Colombia and decertified it as partner in combatting drug trafficking. Many reflected that the action did not produce the intended results.\n \n\n   \n  “US officials concluded that we actually did more damage to ourselves by cutting off assistance to Colombia than actually punish Ernesto Samper,” said Juan Gonzalez, a former NSC official focused on the Western Hemisphere during the Biden administration who is currently a fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute.\n \n\n   \n  The US support to the Colombian police was robust before that cutoff: helping pay for judicialized wiretaps, training police and vetting them. Gonzalez said that the cutoff in assistance during that period of time limited the US Department of Justice’s ability build cases against the cartels inside of Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  Experts say that today’s continued funding to Colombia’s security and defense forces – which includes ongoing intelligence sharing between the two nations – is critical to achieve the administration’s own goals for fighting drug trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Colombia, said the US support on defense is “really, really significant.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re talking about two militaries that are deeply integrated and cooperating, and they work more closely together, I think, than any other country that the US works with that’s not in NATO,” she told CNN. “We’re talking about sort of an institutional relationship, sharing of intelligence, sharing of capabilities, day to day collaboration on logistics, operations.”\n \n\n   \n  “If that were to go by the wayside,” Dickinson said, “the capability of the Colombian security forces would be debilitated significantly” at a time when the country is facing major security challenges.\n \n\n   \n  And if intelligence sharing were to be cut, it would leave the US “flying blind,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “85% of all actionable intelligence that the US uses to interdict drugs in the Caribbean comes from Colombia,” Dickinson said.\n \n\n   \n  “If you are not sharing humint (human intelligence), electronic intel on shipments, routes, organizations, schedules, methods – you’re cutting off what’s needed to do the stated thing you want to do – stop the flow,” a former US diplomat who worked on the issue told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Another former US diplomat who worked on the issue said cutting the security funding would be “cutting one’s nose to spite one’s face.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/harvard-university-explosion-arrests","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"17:47:00-05:00","title":"Two Arrested in Connection with Explosion at Harvard Medical School, FBI Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two young men from Massachusetts, Logan David Patterson and Dominick Frank Cardoza, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to damage a federally assisted building after an explosion occurred at Harvard Medical School’s Goldenson building on the weekend of November 1–2, 2025.

arrested in connection with explosion at Harvard Medical School, FBI says \n       \n  By Michelle Watson, Melissa Gray, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:47 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tips from the public led to the arrests Tuesday of two men who authorities say are responsible for a weekend explosion inside a Harvard Medical research lab — an act that one official called “selfish” and “shortsighted.”\n \n\n   \n  Logan David Patterson, 18, and Dominick Frank Cardoza, 20, both of Massachusetts,  were arrested  and charged with conspiracy to damage by means of fire or an explosive a building belonging to an institution that receives federal financial assistance, according to a criminal complaint. It’s unclear whether the two have attorneys.\n \n\n   \n  It’s too early to speculate on the motive, as the investigation is ongoing, said Leah Foley, the US attorney for the district of Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  But a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN the two men filmed the explosion and later showed it to friends. The official added so far, the two men did not appear to be driven by political ideology.\n \n\n   \n  The men were arrested Tuesday morning at their homes, said Ted Docks, special agent in charge at the FBI’s Boston division. Members of the public had called authorities to identify them after police released surveillance camera images, said Leah Foley, the US attorney for the district of Massachusetts.\n \n\n   \n  The incident came after a tense year for Harvard students, teachers and staff who were thrust into the national spotlight amid the White House’s push to reshape higher education. Officials from Harvard and the White House have been in  discussions for months  about a high-dollar deal to restore all federal funding to the university and end its ongoing lawsuits against the administration.\n \n\n   \n    How the explosion unfolded\n \n\n   \n  An officer responded to the Goldenson building just before 3 a.m. ET Saturday and saw two people fleeing after a fire alarm was activated, according to Harvard police.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage circulated by police showed two masked people, one of them wearing what appeared to be a gray ski mask and the other a long face mask and black hoodie.\n \n\n   \n  The video, according to court documents, shows two people “lighting what appear to be roman candle fireworks,” around 2:24 a.m. The two then climbed over the fence and ended up near a construction area surrounding the building.\n \n\n   \n  A little over 10 minutes later, the two “climbed scaffolding erected beside the Goldenson Building and accessed the building’s roof,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  At 2:45 a.m., Harvard police received the fire alarm alert.\n \n\n   \n  Around the same time, the two made a stop on the fifth floor “before exiting the building through a first-floor emergency exit leading into a courtyard,” and then fled on foot in opposite directions, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  They also tried “to conceal or dispose of articles of clothing” that they had worn in the Goldenson Building, the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  When authorities arrived, they found what is believed to be a large commercial firework that had been detonated inside a wooden locker, court documents allege.\n \n\n   \n  Docks called the incident “selfish” and “shortsighted.”\n \n\n   \n  “What’s equally disturbing, these two men allegedly boasted about what they did to their friends,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  A  message sent  to the community from the Harvard Medical School Sunday afternoon said there was no structural damage to the building.\n \n\n   \n  “The small section of the fourth-floor hallway where the explosion took place has been cleared and is fully operational,” the message said. “There was no structural damage to the building, and all labs and equipment remain intact.”\n \n\n   \n  The Sunday message also said the building “will be fully open and accessible to all who work in the building.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Miller contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/europe/russia-nuclear-burevestnik-poseidon-awards-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"18:01:00Z","title":"Putin hails developers of nuclear-powered Burevestnik missile, in latest signal to the West","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded state honors to developers of the Burevestnik cruise missile and Poseidon underwater torpedo, highlighting their long-range capabilities and strategic significance.

\nUpdated: \n        6:01 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin has given state awards to the developers of the  Burevestnik  cruise missile and the Poseidon underwater torpedo, the latest signal in what analysts have cast as efforts by the Kremlin to discourage the West from supporting Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  At an awards ceremony in the Kremlin on Tuesday, Putin claimed the two nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable weapons were of “historic significance” for Russia and “for the entire 21st century.”\n \n\n   \n  “In terms of flight range, the Burevestnik … has surpassed all known missile systems in the world,” Putin said in a speech, praising the state of Russia’s defense technology.\n \n\n   \n  Putin also said that Russia has begun serial production of the  Oreshnik , another nuclear-capable missile. Russia used the hypersonic Oreshnik in a strike on the Ukrainian region of Dnipro in November 2024 – the first time in history an intermediate-range ballistic missile has been used in battle.\n \n\n   \n  The awards ceremony comes amid growing tension between Moscow and Washington, after US President Donald Trump – frustrated by Putin’s prevarications over ending the war in Ukraine – last month imposed  sanctions  on two Russian oil giants and cancelled a proposed  summit  with the Russian leader in  Hungary .\n \n\n   \n  Days after Trump’s sanctions, Putin announced on October 26 that Russia had successfully tested the Burevestnik cruise missile. In a video released by the Kremlin, Putin – wearing military garb – was shown meeting with Russia’s chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, who told the president that the Burevestnik flew 8,700 miles (14,000 kilometers) over 15 hours.\n \n\n   \n  On October 28, Putin claimed the Poseidon – another “invincible” Russian weapon with a range of more than 6,000 miles (9,650 kilometers) – had been successfully tested.\n \n\n   \n  Neither weapon is new. Putin unveiled both weapons in 2018, and even announced a successful test of the Burevestnik in  2023 .\n \n\n   \n  But analysts say Russia is using previously announced missile technology to send new nuclear threats to the West, and the US in particular.\n \n\n   \n  “The repeated emphasis on the long range of the weapon and ability to overcome any missile defense system also indicates that the intended target would be the United States, not a regional adversary that Russia could strike with much cheaper shorter-range systems,” the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said in a report published Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The report noted the Trump administration’s plan to build a  “Golden Dome”  missile defense system to shield the US from foreign attacks. Although Putin did not explicitly reference the Golden Dome in his October 26 announcement of the Burevestnik test, he has repeatedly stressed the missile’s ability to evade missile defenses.\n \n\n   \n  “Putin is using this test to create fear in the United States to discourage US decisionmakers from pursuing policies that threaten Russian interests,” the CSIS report said.\n \n\n   \n  The awards ceremony in the Kremlin comes days after Trump  ordered  the resumption of US nuclear weapons tests. The US president said he gave the order “because of other countries’ testing programs.”\n \n\n   \n  In his speech Tuesday, Putin claimed that Russia “is not threatening anyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “Russia, like all other nuclear powers, is developing nuclear potential and its strategic potential.

 \n  By Betsy Klein, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:17 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While condolences for  former Vice President Dick Cheney  have poured in from both sides of the aisle,  President Donald Trump  has not addressed his death on Tuesday nor shared anything about it among his many posts on social media.\n \n\n   \n  Neither has Vice President JD Vance. The White House offered a muted reaction, including a perfunctory response from press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who told reporters at Tuesday’s press briefing that Trump was “aware” of Cheney’s death and noted that flags have been lowered to half-staff.\n \n\n   \n  The reaction was in keeping with Trump’s long-standing disdain for the former vice president, which he voiced long before he ever campaigned and won on dismantling the GOP establishment at the crux of Cheney’s ascent to power.\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t like Cheney when he was a vice president. I don’t like him now,” Trump said in a 2011  video  taped from his Trump Tower desk.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, a hardline conservative,  endorsed  Trump’s 2016 run for president, but crossed the aisle in 2024 to endorse Kamala Harris.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump-Cheney relationship deteriorated significantly after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The former vice president sharply  criticized  Trump as a “coward” and a threat to the republic in an ad supporting his daughter, then-Rep. Liz Cheney, in her 2022 reelection campaign, which she lost in the primary to a Trump-backed challenger. Liz Cheney served as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the attack.\n \n\n   \n  In  endorsing  Harris, Dick Cheney said in a statement that citizens “have a duty to put country above partisanship.”\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt on Tuesday did not respond to inquiries as to whether Trump planned to speak at Cheney’s funeral or if he had spoken with members of the Cheney family.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president is aware of the former vice president’s passing, and as you saw, flags have been lowered to half-staff in accordance with statutory law,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  White House flags were lowered hours after Cheney’s death was announced on Tuesday morning, but the moment was not accompanied by a presidential proclamation.\n \n\n   \n  Federal laws govern flying American flags at half-staff. According to the  Department of Veterans Affairs , flags at all federal buildings, grounds and naval vessels must fly at half-staff for 30 days after the death of a president or former president, and 10 days for a vice president, Supreme Court chief justice or speaker of the House. For former vice presidents, flags must fly at half-staff between the day of death and interment.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump took office on January 20, the White House flag was flying at half-staff in honor of former President Jimmy Carter, who died on December 29, 2024. Trump, who once called the Democrat a “nice man” but “terrible president,”  signed  a presidential proclamation within hours of his swearing-in, requiring the flag to be raised to full-staff on Inauguration Day.\n \n\n   \n  But flying the flag at half-staff for other officials is at the president’s discretion. Trump has extended the honor three times during his second term: to assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September, to the victims of a school shooting at a Minneapolis church in August, and Pope Francis in April.\n \n\n   \n  Trump reflected on his relationship with Cheney briefly during a town hall with Tucker Carlson days before the 2024 election – weeks after Cheney endorsed Harris.\n \n\n   \n  “I was surprised a little bit with Dick Cheney. I didn’t know him at all,” Trump said, adding that they had spoken after Trump  pardoned  ex-Cheney aide Scooter Libby in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  He added: “I was a little surprised because I actually thought that Dick Cheney would go with me over his daughter and he didn’t. And you know what? I understand it. It’s your daughter and you go.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/obesity-drugs-trump-pharmaceutical-companies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"17:44:00Z","title":"Trump administration nears deals with pharmaceutical companies to offer obesity drugs for $149 a month","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is nearing agreements with pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to offer popular obesity drugs such as Wegovy, Zepbound, Mounjaro, and Ozempic at a drastically reduced price of $149 per month, potentially making them more accessible to consumers.

The list price of the drugs range from roughly $1,000 to $1,350, though the price consumers pay depends on their insurance and on discounts.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump is expected to announce the deals as soon as Thursday, though the people familiar with the negotiations cautioned that they are not finalized and that officials are still working through key policy details.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that “discussion about deals that have not been officially announced by the administration should be regarded as speculation.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday declined to confirm the planned announcement, but said a deal that cuts the cost of the obesity drugs was “something that the administration has been engaged and looking into.”\n \n\n   \n  The negotiations over Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk’s obesity drugs represent perhaps the highest-profile element of a broader White House push to cut drug prices by striking individual deals with pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n \n\n   \n  The “Most Favored Nation” initiative has so far resulted in agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and other companies to sell certain products directly to consumers at a reduced price — often in exchange for relief from the threat of targeted tariffs.  Eli Lilly  and  Novo Nordisk  already provide their weight loss drugs at a discount directly to consumers who pay cash.\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump has fixated in particular on striking a deal for GLP-1 medications that have exploded in popularity in recent years for helping with weight loss and a range of chronic conditions. The president has referred to them in both public and private as the “fat-loss drug.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to be paying, instead of $1,300, you’ll be paying about $150,” Trump said of the GLP-1 drugs during a mid-October event highlighting a separate drug price deal, prompting US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Mehmet Oz to jump in and emphasize that the negotiations were still ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  Endpoints News first  reported  that deals were approaching the finish line.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear exactly which of the companies’ drugs will be sold for $149 and whether there will be restrictions on consumers’ access to them. The deals are related to a pilot program that CMS is in the final stages of developing aimed at capping the cost of the obesity drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries, one of the people familiar with the negotiations said.\n \n\n   \n  The expected deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk follow a yearslong debate on both sides of the aisle over whether Medicare and Medicaid should cover the pricey drugs. The Biden administration last year officially proposed expanding coverage of them, though the plan was not finalized before Trump took office. The Trump administration said in April that it was  halting  the proposal but left the door open to consider future policy options for covering the drugs.\n \n\n   \n  Also, notably, Ozempic and Wegovy were selected in January for second round of  Medicare drug price negotiations , which is expected to result in savings for the program and, possibly, for enrollees depending on their drug coverage.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., vehemently opposed efforts to make the medications more accessible, telling Fox News  ahead of last November’s election  that Novo Nordisk — which makes Ozempic — was “counting on selling it to Americans because we are so stupid and so addicted to drugs.” But since joining the administration, he has struck a far more accommodating tone, expressing openness to patients using them if prior efforts to improve their health have failed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:59:00-05:00","title":"Timeline of US Strikes on Boats That Have Killed 67","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States military conducted 16 strikes between September 2 and November 4, 2025, targeting vessels allegedly involved in drug trafficking, resulting in 67 deaths and the destruction of 17 boats.

\n  By Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:59 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military conducted another strike against an alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, killing two people, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has killed 67 people in 16 strikes that have destroyed 17 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy conducted a search for the person, who is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on  another vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n    November 4\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the US military struck another vessel “involved in illicit narcotics smuggling” in the eastern Pacific, killing two people on board.\n \n\n   \n  The US Defense secretary again posted an unclassified video of the strike  on X , noting that US forces were not harmed and the vessel was struck in international waters.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/federal-immigration-enforcement-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00Z","title":"Judge hears testimony about crowded cells and overflowing toilets at Chicago-area immigration site","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. District Judge heard testimony from detained immigrants about appalling conditions at the Broadview detention facility in Chicago, including overcrowded cells with up to 150 people, no beds, no hygiene supplies, and water that tasted like sewer.

hears testimony about crowded cells and overflowing toilets at Chicago-area immigration site \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:31 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A judge heard testimony Tuesday about overflowing toilets, crowded cells, no beds and water that “tasted like sewer” at a  Chicago-area building  that serves as a key detention spot for people rounded up in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  People who were held at the building in Broadview, just outside Chicago, offered rare public  accounts about the conditions  there as U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman considers ordering changes at a site that has become a flashpoint for protests and confrontations with federal agents.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want anyone else to live what I lived through,” said Felipe Agustin Zamacona, 47, an Amazon driver and Mexican immigrant who has lived in the U.S. for decades.\n \n\n   \n  Zamacona said there were 150 people in a holding cell. Desperate to lie down to sleep, he said he once took the spot of another man who got up to use the toilet.\n \n\n   \n  And the water? Zamacona said he tried to drink from a sink but it “tasted like sewer.”\n \n\n   \n  A lawsuit filed last week accuses the government of denying proper access to food, water and medical care, and coercing people to sign documents they don’t understand. Without that knowledge, and without private communication with lawyers, they have unknowingly relinquished their rights and  faced deportation , the lawsuit alleges.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not an issue of not getting a toilet or a Fiji water bottle,” attorney Alexa Van Brunt of the MacArthur Justice Center told the judge. “These are a set of dire conditions that when taken together paint a harrowing picture.”\n \n\n   \n  Before testimony began, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman said the allegations were “disgusting.”\n \n\n   \n  “To have to sleep on a floor next to an overflowing toilet — that’s obviously unconstitutional,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Jana Brady of the Justice Department acknowledged there are no beds at the Broadview building, just outside Chicago, because it was not intended to be a long-term detention site.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have “improved the operations” over the past few months, she said, adding there has been a “learning curve.”\n \n\n   \n  “The conditions are not sufficiently serious,” Brady told the judge.\n \n\n   \n  The building has been managed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for decades. But amid the Chicago-area crackdown, it has been used to process people for detention or deportation.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who has led the Chicago immigration operation, said criticism was unfounded.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they’re doing a great job out there,” he told The Associated Press during  an interview  this week.\n \n\n   \n  Testifying with the help of a translator, Pablo Moreno Gonzalez, 56, said he was arrested last week while waiting to start work. Like Zamacona, he said he was placed in a cell with 150 other people, with no beds, blankets, toothbrush or toothpaste.\n \n\n   \n  “It was just really bad. … It was just too much,” Moreno Gonzalez, crying, told the judge.\n \n\n   \n  Claudia Carolina Pereira Guevara testified from Honduras, separated from two children who remain in the U.S. She said she was held at Broadview for five days in October and recalled using a garbage bag to clear a clogged toilet.\n \n\n   \n  “They gave us nothing that had to do with cleaning. Absolutely nothing,” Guevara said.\n \n\n   \n  Another witness,  Ruben Torres Maldonado , said he slept on the concrete floor and would fill water bottles to use as pillows.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said he could make a decision Wednesday on the request for a restraining order.\n \n\n   \n   For months  advocates have raised concerns about conditions at Broadview, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.\n \n\n   \n  The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, leading to the arrests of numerous protesters. The demonstrations are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using  tear gas  and other weapons on them.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/airspace-controller-shortages","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00-05:00","title":"DOT May Close Parts of US Airspace Due to Air Traffic Controller Shortages During Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a federal government shutdown in early November 2025, the U.S. Department of Transportation warns that parts of the national airspace may be closed due to a shortage of air traffic controllers and unpaid TSA workers.

Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Department of Transportation may close some parts of US airspace if enough air traffic controllers don’t show up to work, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “If you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos,” Duffy said at a news conference on Tuesday. “You will see mass flight delays, you’ll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it because we don’t have the air traffic controllers.”\n \n\n   \n  Controllers received a partial paycheck early in the shutdown, and last week missed one entirely. On Thursday, Duffy said, controllers will be sent another paystub that reads $0. He said many controllers cannot go without two paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Controllers, like Transportation Security Administration workers, are essential employees and are required to work during federal government shutdowns despite not being paid. This past week, TSA and Federal Aviation Administration employees not showing up for work caused massive security wait times in Houston and delays at airports across the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t just go find money and pay air traffic controllers,” Duffy said. “That’s not the way our constitution works and our government works.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the DOT hired 2,000 controllers to try and address a decades-long shortage, but Duffy said the shutdown “will have an impact.”\n \n\n   \n  “These young people have a choice to make: do they want to go into a profession where they can have a shutdown and they cannot be paid? That’s affected our pipeline,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy also reaffirmed if the airspace wasn’t safe, the DOT would “shut it down.” He said some controllers may work two positions versus one because of the callouts, which is allowed and safe, but does pose a greater risk.\n \n\n   \n  “We delay flights, we cancel or tell airlines to cancel flights if we don’t have enough controllers to effectively and safely manage our skies, Duffy said. “With this shutdown, it would be dishonest to say that more risk is not injected into the system. There is more risk in the system.”\n \n\n   \n  While  most aviation experts  agree it is safe to fly during the shutdown, the union representing air traffic controllers, which has pushed hard for the government to reopen, says each day it stays closed, the less safe the system gets.\n \n\n   \n  “Every single day that this goes on, tomorrow is now less safe than today,” said Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, on CNN News Central Monday. “We’re supposed to go to work and be 100%, 100% of the time. I’m going to work right now, and I’m thinking about, ‘how do I pay my rent?’”\n \n\n   \n    TSA also sees staffing shortages\n \n\n   \n  TSA workers under the Department of Homeland Security are also going without pay and some of them are not showing up for work.\n \n\n   \n  Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport warned travelers of up to three-hour waits for security screening this week. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport warned of long lines last month caused by the shortage of workers.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, Delta Air Lines, whose largest hub is Atlanta, said it is utilizing a “years-long partnership” with TSA to assist workers near screening checkpoints and “free up” certified TSA screeners to process passengers.\n \n\n   \n  “Delta Air Lines implores Congress to immediately pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government so that our air traffic controllers, TSA and CBP officers charged with the safety and efficiency of our national airspace can collect the paychecks they deserve,” a Delta spokesperson said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/longest-government-shutdown-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"16:55:00Z","title":"The US Government Shutdown: A Timeline and Analysis of Recent Closures","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. federal government remains in a full shutdown as of November 4, 2025, due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills.

Here’s how long the current shutdown has been going on:\n \n\n   \n  The last time the government shut down — which started on December 22, 2018, and went until January 25, 2019 — it lasted 35 days. It cost the United States an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n \n\n   \n    Here are all the government shutdowns since 1981\n \n\n   \n  US agencies were first instructed in the early 1980s to stop normal operations during government funding lapses, and resume operations when Congress appropriated more money.   The first federal government shutdown happened in 1976, according to CNN research.\n \n\n   \n  While government shutdowns have become less common in recent decades — there have been six since 1990 — an increasingly partisan Washington has left Congress unable to resolve sticking points on spending for longer periods of time.\n \n\n   \n  With Republican Speaker Mike Johnson overseeing one of the  narrowest House majorities in history,  and the GOP lacking the 60 votes needed to overcome a Senate  filibuster , the path to avoiding a shutdown was murky in the 11th hour as negotiations stalled.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Tami Luhby  has more on which government services are expected to halt , and which are likely continuing, during this shutdown.\n \n\n   \n    The last government shutdown\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown that began in December 2018 was a partial shutdown, where Congress had approved annual funding for certain agencies, allowing them to continue operations while other federal departments went dark. During that time, an estimated 800,000 people were employed at the shuttered federal agencies, and about 300,000 of those were furloughed, meaning they were not paid and asked not to report to work, according to the CBO.\n \n\n   \n  The rest were considered exempt from furlough, meaning they needed to report to work but could not receive pay. Both furloughed and exempted employees received backpay when their agencies reopened after the funding agreement was passed.\n \n\n   \n  The current Congress has not passed any of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the US government.

showdown with Trump \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:02 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Justice Department is facing several court orders that land it in a position it often seeks to avoid: Revealing the private statements of its top political leaders.\n \n\n   \n  Judges’ attempts to confidentially review executive branch records and hold hearings where Justice Department attorneys could take the stand are bearing down in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  In one case, regarding the migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Justice Department is fighting to keep Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche from having to testify about prosecutorial decision-making in a hearing next month.\n \n\n   \n  And this week, federal Judge Cameron McGowan Currie will look closer at Eastern District of Virginia US Attorney Lindsey Halligan’s work with a grand jury before the recent indictment of Trump political opponents James Comey and Letitia James.\n \n\n   \n  The examples in court reflect how trust has been lost by the Justice Department this year while President Donald Trump and his top allies and appointees have repeatedly attacked the courts and challenged even temporary orders with emergency appeals.\n \n\n   \n  If officials are forced to testify and the Justice Department hands over internal communications, the proceedings may expose the Justice Department’s inner workings in a way that could have implications for multiple ongoing, high-profile and intensely challenged criminal cases.\n \n\n   \n  “What a mess,” said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams about the latest turns in the criminal cases.\n \n\n   \n  “The government always plays with fire whenever it takes an aggressive action that might end up in court one day,” he added. “When that happens, they really do risk having secrets and strategy that they’d rather not have in plain view.”\n \n\n   \n  An order from Currie on Tuesday also puts more scrutiny on Halligan’s handling of Comey’s indictment. The judge said she wanted to review more complete statements than the Justice Department already has provided from the grand jury proceedings in Comey’s case.\n \n\n   \n  It is highly unusual for a US attorney to single-handedly secure indictments before a grand jury – which Halligan did against both Comey and James days after Trump appointed her to the top prosecutor job. But it’s also somewhat unusual for a federal judge to demand looking at internal records privately, called “in camera.” Typically, prosecutors can summarize their positions for courts without judges needing to double-check or dig further.\n \n\n   \n  Currie is set to hear arguments from both defense teams and the Justice Department on November 13 about Halligan’s role in the cases.\n \n\n   \n  The defense teams hope to have the criminal cases dismissed, arguing that Halligan doesn’t have the authority because the Eastern District of Virginia hasn’t had a Senate-confirmed US attorney for longer than the 120 days interim appointees are allowed, and that the former Trump personal attorney and White House staffer hadn’t come from another job within the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  Currie said in a court order on Monday she “finds it necessary to determine the extent of the indictment signer’s involvement in the grand jury proceedings.” And in an atypical follow-up on Tuesday, Currie said the Justice Department, in initially providing records to the judge, didn’t include transcripts that captured remarks Halligan made before and after a witness testified to the grand jury in the Comey case.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also wanted to see the transcript of an initial attempt to secure an indictment, where the grand jury rejected one charge against Comey. The ex-FBI director was ultimately charged with two counts: making a false statement and obstructing a congressional proceeding. He has pleaded not guilty.\n \n\n   \n    Tension in Tennessee \n \n\n   \n  In the criminal case against the mistakenly deported then criminally charged Abrego Garcia, federal Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr. in Nashville ordered prosecutors to send their internal communications to him. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys contend he has been unfairly prosecuted for political reasons.\n \n\n   \n  A hearing where the No. 2 leader of the Justice Department may have to testify is now scheduled for early December. The judge wants to privately review communications between Blanche’s office in Washington, DC, and the Tennessee-based federal prosecutors’ office, which charged Abrego Garcia.\n \n\n   \n  The judge also told the Justice Department to send to the court under seal other records it might have related to the federal government’s decision to prosecute him rather than deport him this spring. He was returned to the US after being wrongfully deported to a Salvadoran prison and then was charged with human smuggling linked to a traffic stop years ago. He is fighting the charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department submitted some documents under seal last week. But Crenshaw in recent days said they needed “more time to finish collecting and producing documents.”\n \n\n   \n  Crenshaw said that the Justice Department said it had no documents “for entire categories of information requested by the court,” but then said “the Government certainly has additional responsive documents” on its decision to prosecute Abrego Garcia over deport.\n \n\n   \n  “The Government shall continue to solicit responsive documents” and keep sending them to the judge, Crenshaw has ordered.\n \n\n   \n  But the matter isn’t totally resolved. The judge’s efforts to weigh whether Abrego Garcia was unfairly prosecuted will continue in a larger standoff slated for next month in Crenshaw’s courtroom.\n \n\n   \n  Abrego Garcia’s attorneys seek to question under oath Justice Department officials, including a former prosecutor on his criminal case in Tennessee who had resigned, and three attorneys from the Deputy Attorney General’s office, including Blanche himself.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors on the case have said Blanche’s and his deputies’ testimony would be unnecessary, despite Blanche speaking on national TV about the decision to charge Abrego Garcia and return him to the US from El Salvador. They also argue official decision-making should be protected from being disclosed in court because of executive branch confidentiality.\n \n\n   \n  “Given that undisputed evidence shows that there is no link between the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and the decision to prosecute, there is no basis for subpoenas seeking to compel testimony from high-ranking officials in that office, including the Deputy Attorney General himself,” prosecutors wrote to the court on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors in the case say, however, the former acting US Attorney in Nashville, Homeland Security investigators and a state trooper who stopped Abrego Garcia for speeding on the interstate highway in 2022 could testify.\n \n\n   \n  The department has also indicated it has wanted to deport Abrego Garcia imminently, which could end the criminal proceedings, and Abrego Garcia’s attorneys are advocating to have his charges dismissed if Blanche won’t testify.\n \n\n   \n  “The very officials whose testimony is required to meet that burden” to show in court the case should stay alive, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys wrote this week, “are resolutely unwilling to show up. For anyone interested in good government, that is profoundly troubling.”\n \n\n   \n  The depth Crenshaw ultimately decides to probe into top Justice Department decision-making could factor into the Comey and James cases, too.\n \n\n   \n  Both of those defendants are fighting their charges, and asking judges to dismiss their cases because they say Trump unfairly pushed for their indictments.\n \n\n   \n  “Objective evidence,” Comey’s team wrote to the court, noting dozens of angry social media posts the president has made about Comey, “establishes that President Trump directed the prosecution of Mr. Comey in retaliation for Mr. Comey’s public criticisms and to punish Mr. Comey because of personal spite. Such a vindictive prosecution serves no legitimate government interest and contradicts fundamental constitutional values.”\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department this week argued that years of  Trump commenting on social media  that he wanted to see Comey indicted didn’t mean the Justice Department was unfairly targeting the former FBI Director with criminal charges now.\n \n\n   \n  And on Tuesday afternoon, federal prosecutors also told the court it didn’t immediately plan to hand over documents to defense lawyers related to the decision to charge James with mortgage fraud.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Department prosecutors say, according to the filing, that James shouldn’t have more access to their internal records unless there are further court proceedings.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/sandwich-thrower-case-washington","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:49:00-05:00","title":"It Smelled of Onions and Mustard: Border Patrol Officer Hit by Sandwich as Trial Begins","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a high-profile federal trial in Washington, D.C., Sean Dunn is accused of throwing a Subway-style sandwich at a Border Patrol officer during a confrontation over federal law enforcement presence.

trial begins \n       \n  By Holmes Lybrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:49 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “He did it. He threw the sandwich.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s how the defense counsel for Sean Dunn, the man who threw a sub-style sandwich at a Border Patrol officer in Washington, DC, this summer began the federal trial against him Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  The United States government, Dunn’s attorney Julia Gatto told the jury, “turned that moment, a thrown sandwich, into a criminal case. A federal criminal case charging a federal criminal offense.”\n \n\n   \n  The case serves as a certain symbol in the backlash the Trump administration’s deployment of federal troops in DC this summer faced from residents. The sandwich-throwing incident also became a moment of resistance in the city, with spray-painted posters popping up around the capital in the wake of the alleged assault.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the Border Patrol officer testified about his experience.\n \n\n   \n  Greg Lairmore told the jury that Dunn “became really irritated and started yelling obscenities” at him and other officers that night before throwing “a subway style sandwich at me that struck me in the chest.”\n \n\n   \n  “It smelled of onions and mustard,” Lairmore said of the sandwich, which “exploded all over my chest.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Can you tell if it’s a turkey sandwich?’\n \n\n   \n  Another attorney for Dunn, Sabrina Shroff, pressed Lairmore on that response, showing a photo of the sandwich on the ground, still wrapped in the Subway paper.\n \n\n   \n  “Can you tell if it’s a turkey sandwich?” Sabrina pressed, emphasizing that the sandwich remained wrapped. “Lettuce? Tomatoes?”\n \n\n   \n  Lairmore said he could not tell from the picture, but claimed he had mustard stains on his uniform and pieces of the sandwich hanging from his radio equipment that night.\n \n\n   \n  “From the photo it looks bent and out of shape,” the officer said of the sandwich.\n \n\n   \n  Lairmore also said he had received gag gifts related to the sandwich incident from some of his colleagues, including a plush sandwich and a patch that said “felony footlong.”\n \n\n   \n  Lairmore chuckled when he described the gifts. Of the stuffed toy sandwich, he said, “I put it on top of my shelf in the office.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the incident and after leaving the Subway restaurant, Dunn soon became “red-faced and enraged,” Lairmore testified, “calling me and my colleagues all kinds of names. Saying we were fascist.”\n \n\n   \n  “I didn’t respond. That’s his constitutional right to express his opinion,” Lairmore, a division chief who has been with Customs and Border Protection for 23 years, said.\n \n\n   \n  During the trial, body-worn camera footage taken from the night of Dunn’s arrest was played for the jury, including a portion where Dunn told an officer: “I was trying to draw them away from where they were. I succeeded.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘You can’t go around throwing stuff at people when you’re mad’\n \n\n   \n  As neither party disputes the basic facts of the case, jurors will need to determine whether the sandwich-throwing is enough to convict Dunn on the misdemeanor assault charge.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, I understand you may all have views of the federal law enforcement presence in DC,” Assistant US Attorney John Parron told the jury during opening statements Tuesday. “And that’s fine, we’re not trying to convince you otherwise. But respectfully, that’s not what this case is about. This case is about the fact that you can’t go around throwing stuff at people when you’re mad.”\n \n\n   \n  “When we have disputes, we settle them verbally,” Parron added, concluding that Dunn threw the sandwich and “forcibly assaulted him.”\n \n\n   \n  Gatto argued that the throwing of the sandwich served “as an exclamation mark at the end of a verbal outburst,” from Dunn, who was upset by the surge of federal officers in DC and the Trump administrations’ deportation efforts.\n \n\n   \n  “He is not a fan. He thinks recent immigration enforcement is racist,” Gatto said, adding that Dunn saw the local federal takeover of DC law enforcement as “fascism.”\n \n\n   \n  Of the charge her client faces, Gatto said, “bodily injury, that’s the standard.”\n \n\n   \n  “They will not come close to convincing you beyond a reasonable doubt the conduct was forcible,” Gatto concluded.\n \n\n   \n  The trial, which presiding Judge Carl Nichols called the “simplest case” in the history of the world, will continue Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  A DC jury recently acquitted a different resident who was also charged with assault for allegedly moving her knee up toward an officer while being restrained after filming officers as they made immigration-related arrests.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated to include additional testimony. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/shutdown-congress-tied-longest-bipartisan-talks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:44:00-05:00","title":"Congress ties record for longest shutdown as bipartisan talks pick up steam","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress is tied for the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with bipartisan talks gaining momentum as lawmakers work to resolve the impasse.

Yet the potential off-ramp doesn’t appear to deliver Democrats any real win on their biggest demand of the shutdown: health care.\n \n\n   \n  Talks over reopening the government are focused on putting together a funding package and giving Democrats a stand-alone vote to extend expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, according to sources familiar with the high-stakes negotiations. The deal would also include a pathway to move ahead with three bills to fund major agencies of the federal government through next September.\n \n\n   \n  But given that there is no guarantee that an extension of ACA subsidies will pass the Senate – much less the House — it’s unclear whether enough Democrats will accept that proposal to reopen the government, the sources said. So it is bound to prompt sharp division among Democrats about whether a vote is enough after the damaging consequences of the shutdown standoff.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Susan Collins, the Senate’s top GOP spending leader, has been involved in a flurry of conversations in recent days to end the impasse by funding both parties’ priorities in bipartisan year-long funding bills.\n \n\n   \n  “I do believe that we are finally making progress. It’s too soon to declare that this nightmare of a shutdown is over, but I’m very cautiously hopeful that it will be resolved by the end of this week,” the Maine Republican told.\n \n\n   \n  There’s still a long way to go. Party leaders are still not talking. On Tuesday, the Senate failed its 14th vote on the GOP’s stopgap plan to reopen the government. And neither side expects tangible progress on Election Day with key races from New Jersey to California on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune is not yet certain the end is in sight. He said Monday he is “optimistic” but not necessarily “confident” bipartisan senators will reach a deal to fund the government by week’s end.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on sort of my gut of how things operate, I think we’re getting close to an off ramp,” Thune said, but he cautioned: “This is unlike any other government shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Thune also acknowledged Monday that the Senate will likely have to draft a new stopgap bill — replacing the House’s version that goes through November 21 — in order to buy Congress more time to pass those full-year spending bills. Democrats see this as an opening to support something other than the same GOP funding plan, and to have input on the new version. (One person involved in the discussions said the likely end date for the new bill would be January, though spending leaders like Collins want Congress to aim for around Christmas instead.)\n \n\n   \n  That semblance of movement comes as shutdown damage is quickly racking up. Already on day 35 of the shutdown,  food banks nationwide are swamped  with new families, furloughed workers are  applying for unemployment benefits  and air traffic is  snarling across the country .\n \n\n   \n  Collins and others involved in the talks have been mostly secretive about exactly who and what is involved. Leadership in both parties had for days largely downplayed the talks, though they are being kept up to speed by those involved, according to one person involved in the talks. For the first time, Collins said Democrats are now contributing to these appropriations talks, but there’s still a huge problem — it doesn’t solve the looming health care cliff next year.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if that’ll work or not. … This has nothing to do with health care, and that’s what my Democratic colleagues have harped on,” GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said bluntly.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats will soon be faced with a key question: What will they accept from Republicans after their month-long push to extend expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies? Thune has publicly offered Democrats an up-or-down vote on those subsidies — but Democrats have said it is not enough.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about her view, Sen. Elizabeth Warren stressed that Republicans need to sit down and negotiate and signaled that her party would not cave just because the shutdown effects were getting more painful.\n \n\n   \n  “He thinks he can use hungry children as a bargaining chip against Democrats, saying, in effect, that it’s only Democrats who care whether or not kids go hungry,” the Massachusetts Democrat said. “Well, it is Democrats who care, and it’s Americans who care. Republicans should come to the table and negotiate.”\n \n\n   \n  The internal Democratic debate comes at a delicate time for the party, with internal cracks already beginning to show over the momentum of Zohran Mamdani in New York’s mayoral election this week, which has bolstered progressives while ringing alarm bells for its more establishment wing.\n \n\n   \n  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders delivered an  even starker  warning to Democrats in an op-ed over the weekend, warning the party not to cave to  President Donald Trump  on the shutdown: “This may be the most consequential moment in American history since the civil war.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Running out the clock’\n \n\n   \n  There’s one notable Republican absent in the discussions: Trump, who returned from a week abroad to find little had changed on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials have largely steered clear of major visible involvement in the day-to-day dynamics of the shutdown, consulting frequently with Republican congressional leaders but letting House Speaker Mike Johnson and Thune dictate much of the party’s direction. Trump aides have sought instead to demonstrate that the administration is still pushing ahead on major priorities and policy announcements.\n \n\n   \n  Yet behind the scenes, officials have grown increasingly antsy as the shutdown drags on far longer than any of them expected.  Polling shows  Americans still placing significant blame on Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, complicating a messaging war that the White House initially anticipated it would decisively win.\n \n\n   \n  The health care rate hikes that Democrats initially shut down the government over more than a month ago are also now starting to hit consumers, further amplifying the issue at a moment in which voters are already unhappy with the cost of living.\n \n\n   \n  Within the White House, officials have had running debates over the administration’s health care platform, consulting with GOP lawmakers and outside policy experts in preparation for post-shutdown talks with Democrats over the restoration of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But those conversations have only progressed so far, stymied by the White House’s own hardline position against any negotiations during that shutdown. That stance, people involved in the discussions said, has made it difficult for the administration to counter Democrats’ attacks on health care, beyond offering vague assurances that officials are developing a health plan — a well-worn promise the GOP has failed to deliver on for nearly a decade.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s created a range of critical unknowns that under the current stalemate will go unanswered until the shutdown is over. Among them: what policies could win bipartisan support, the level of appetite on Capitol Hill for negotiating a broader health reform package, and what the health care landscape will look like whenever the shutdown is finally over.\n \n\n   \n  “We can come up with the policy in 30 seconds,” said one of the people involved in the discussions. “It’s just a question of what politically is going to be acceptable to the Republicans and what Democrats are going to think is enough of a fig leaf to move it forward.”\n \n\n   \n  “People see that there’s an issue that has to be fixed,” added GOP Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York.\n \n\n   \n  “The speaker and Thune have both said this is something they want to address. The willingness is there,” Garbarino told CNN last week. “But the fact that nobody’s talking to each other right now, because they haven’t opened the government, it’s kind of running out the clock.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/policy-ideas-zohran-mamdani-nyc-election","dateOfPublication":"1104-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00-05:00","title":"Here’s a look at Zohran Mamdani’s policy ideas","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee and frontrunner in the New York City mayoral race, has introduced a series of ambitious policy initiatives designed to make the city more affordable.

frontrunner in the city’s mayoral race, has multiple proposals that have garnered significant interest throughout the campaign as he aims to make the city more affordable.\n \n\n   \n  They include a plan to create New York City’s first universal childcare program, making city buses free and freezing the rent for 1 million rent-stabilized tenants in the city.\n \n\n   \n  He has also proposed a

need the state legislature and the governor to approve a tax hike. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who endorsed Mamdani, has said she will not support a tax increase on the most wealthy, arguing she doesn’t want business leaders leaving the state.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s more on some of his policy ideas, which have provoked intense interest as well as skepticism throughout the campaign.\n \n\n   \n    Universal childcare\n \n\n   \n  The  cost of childcare  is at a crisis level in New York City, which is one of the most expensive cities in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s proposal would implement free childcare for all New York City children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old and would expand existing pre-K and 3-K programs launched during Bill de Blasio’s administration.

Mamdani’s free bus proposal would be funded by raising the state’s corporate tax rate as well as income taxes on New Yorkers who earn more than $1 million per year.\n \n\n   \n  Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running in the race as an independent candidate, has  criticized the proposal  as “unnecessary benefits to wealthy New Yorkers who take the bus and can afford the fare.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has proposed making subways and buses free for the lowest-income New Yorkers.\n \n\n   \n    City-run grocery stores\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani would also like to create five government-subsidized grocery stores, one in each New York City borough.

Tanke suggests that healed bone injuries on the tail vertebrae of hadrosaur dinosaurs—specifically at the base of the tail—may be caused by mating behavior, where male hadrosaurs mounted females, pressing down on their tails and breaking the neural spines. This pattern, observed across multiple species and continents, supports the hypothesis that such injuries can indicate the sex of the dinosaur, with females being more likely to bear these injuries.

dinosaurs’ sex \n       \n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:09 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Paleontologists have long wrestled with how to differentiate between male and female dinosaurs based on their fossils.\n \n\n   \n  But new research may bring scientists closer to identifying the sex of one group of  dinosaur.\n \n\n   \n  Hadrosaurs, also known as duck-billed dinosaurs, were common during the Late Cretaceous Period (100.5 to 66 million years ago), and the bones of these herbivores have been found across multiple continents.\n \n\n   \n  Some hadrosaur fossils show evidence of healing from traumatic bone injuries, all in the same location: on their vertebrae past the base of the tail.\n \n\n   \n  No soft tissues preserving evidence of dinosaur reproductive organs have been found in the fossil record, and differences observed in fossils are often thought to be due to species or age, rather than sex. Additionally, evidence of dinosaurs containing fossilized eggs has been hard to come by.\n \n\n   \n  The authors of a  new study  published Tuesday in the journal iScience believe the injuries occurred during mating — and they could be used to indicate which fossils belong to female hadrosaurs.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be a game changer since it will enable other questions to be answered about differences between male and female dinosaurs,” said lead study author Dr. Filippo Bertozzo, a researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences’ Operational Directorate Earth and History of Life.\n \n\n   \n    Identifying a pattern in fossils\n \n\n   \n  Canadian paleontologist Darren H. Tanke first noticed the injuries on hadrosaur vertebrae on bones he discovered in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park throughout the 1980s.\n \n\n   \n  Tanke’s original hypothesis was that they were caused by male hadrosaurs mounting females during the mating process, but he based his claims largely on fossils found in Canada.\n \n\n   \n  Bertozzo noticed the same injury while studying a fossil belonging to the hadrosaur species Olorotitan arharensis, during a research trip to Russia in 2019. He was working on his PhD about disease in duckbilled dinosaurs while at Queen’s University Belfast. Bertozzo invited Tanke to join him in conducting new research.\n \n\n   \n  “In order to support behavioral claims, you need to have an extensive dataset able to possibly cover bias from fossilization, preservation, and collection,” Bertozzo said. “Also, the dinosaur biomechanical simulations weren’t as developed as those of today, and Darren couldn’t test his hypothesis.”\n \n\n   \n  Together, the researchers and their collaborators analyzed nearly 500 tail vertebrae across different hadrosaur species kept at museums in North America, Europe and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  The injuries and deformities they discovered on the middle part of the tail across different specimens were strikingly similar.\n \n\n   \n  “At the base of the tail, between the sacrum and the mid-point of the tail, the neural spines (the elongated bars atop the vertebra, what we call the “spinous process” in human anatomy) are broken on their tip, sometimes along the main body of the spine,” Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  The tips were either tilted, swollen, inclined or even missing — meaning the injury caused the tip to break off and become reabsorbed by the body, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The injuries were visible on several vertebrae for each specimen, suggesting the damage was spread along the main line of the tail, Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  The team carried out multiple simulations to see if the injuries could have been sustained through other activities during the dinosaurs’ daily lives, like accidentally stepping on each other’s tails, muscular strain during motion, fighting, being hunted, feeding or walking. But none of the scenarios would have consistently produced the injuries seen on the fossils, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the authors think the males may have mounted the females , who were lying on their sides, and pressed down on the females’ tails during mating, accidentally breaking the neural spines.\n \n\n   \n  “The mating hypothesis is the one that, at the moment, best explains our observations and data,” Bertozzo said. “The best evidence is the fact that we find this condition in many different species in different localities and times, suggesting it wasn’t something species-specific, but rather an event that would be conservative across all of them, happening to all of them, that is mating.”\n \n\n   \n  The injuries also didn’t appear to be fatal because signs of healing, and even evidence of a second injury, were visible.\n \n\n   \n  “Aggressively pursuing a female during reproduction might sound evolutionary disadvantageous for the continuation of the species but we already witness similar occurrences in many modern species, such as in sea lions, turtles, and some species of birds,” said study coauthor Gareth Arnott, professor in the school of biological sciences at Queen’s University Belfast, in a statement. “Reproductive competition is one of the most complicated topics in animal biology, especially for extinct species.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Albert Prieto-Márquez, a researcher in the dinosaur ecosystems research group at the Autonomous University of Barcelona’s Miquel Crusafont Catalan Institute of Paleontology, believes the consistent injury pattern of healed middle tail fractures is most likely a genuine signal, rather than coincidence. He was not involved in the study, and applauds the creative insight of the researchers, but believes more evidence is needed.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, we can’t identify male and female dinosaurs just by looking at tail injuries,” he said. “To be sure, we’d need to find the same pattern in specimens that we know are female, for example with eggs or medullary bone preserved.”\n \n\n   \n  Medullary bone is temporary tissue that forms inside a cavity in long bones of birds and dinosaurs to provide calcium for eggshells, and was previously used in research to  identify a pregnant Tyrannosaurus rex  in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  For example, in chickens, medullary bone forms one to two weeks before the first egg is laid, and is reabsorbed about three weeks after the last egg is laid, according to the study.\n \n\n   \n  If the same pattern occurred in dinosaurs, any containing this evidence would have died within a time range of about five weeks during the reproduction period, the authors wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Telling female from male\n \n\n   \n  If the hypothesis can be proven, it could open up a whole new way to understand complete hadrosaur fossils that bear such injuries, Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  “This might bring a cascade of implications, such as testing whether skull crests vary between sexes, or identify anatomical features that were previously assigned to new species,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  But more data is required. Although the team compiled a large dataset, they are eager to study fossils from China and South America to continue their comparisons. They also want to use more powerful computer simulations to include tail movements and muscle volumes across different injury scenarios, Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  Bertozzo is also curious to see if the injuries are present in other types of dinosaurs, like long-necked sauropods. He was surprised not to find similar lesions in iguanodons, which were ancestors of hadrosaurs and are also very common in the fossil record.\n \n\n   \n  “The story is just at the beginning, and I hope ours is only one of the initial steps to better understand this aspect of the life of dinosaurs,” Bertozzo said.\n \n\n   \n  Determining male from female dinosaurs based on bones requires a high burden of proof, something that has historically been difficult, said Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who did not participate in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “The authors have laid out their case and I think they provide a compelling argument, but as with so many aspects of dinosaur behavior, we just weren’t around tens of millions of years ago to observe them as real animals, so there will always be some degree of doubt, some degree of uncertainty in these interpretations,” he said. “We often just can’t tell the boys from the girls.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, a professor of vertebrate paleontology at the Hokkaido University Museum in Japan, found the study to be one of the most imaginative he’s seen in recent dinosaur paleobiology and believes the modeling in the study rules out other possible causes. While Kobayashi has  discovered new species of hadrosaurs , he was not involved in the new research.\n \n\n   \n  However, while Kobayashi finds the hypothesis intriguing, he regards it as a bold starting point rather than conclusive evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “This study opens a fascinating window into the private lives of dinosaurs,” he wrote in an email. “Even if not all the conclusions hold, it shows that bones can preserve traces of behavior we never thought we’d see. It’s exciting to think that even the scars of these ancient creatures can reveal moments of their most intimate lives, quite literally, the ‘love life’ of dinosaurs written in their bones.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/health/obesity-glp1-gene-therapy-research","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:06:00Z","title":"The race is on to turn your body into a GLP-1 factory","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two biotech startups, RenBio and Fractyl Health, are pioneering gene therapies aimed at turning human cells into natural GLP-1 factories to treat obesity and improve blood sugar regulation.

Both companies have completed initial tests showing that their approaches work, at least in mice, and both have started tests in larger animals — pigs and monkeys — to see whether their gene therapies can work in larger animals.\n \n\n   \n  With continued success and enough funding, they hope to bring the therapies to human patients — although it may take years more research to prove that their ideas work and are safe.\n \n\n   \n  Newer GLP-1 medications – available as injections and pills – have proven to be highly effective for weight loss, ushering in a new era of obesity treatment.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1, which stands for glucagon-like peptide-1, is a hormone made by the body that helps signal to the brain and the gut that it’s full and doesn’t need to eat any more. The new weight loss drugs mimic the action of this hormone by increasing the secretion of insulin to lower blood sugar. They also slow the movement of food through the digestive tract, which helps people feel full more quickly and for longer, and they work in the brain to reduce appetite.\n \n\n   \n  In less than two years, the percentage of American adults using these meds for weight loss has roughly doubled, rising from 5.8% to 12%, according to  a recent Gallup report . Their popularity may finally be making a dent in the nation’s obesity rate, which dropped from 39.9% in 2023 to 37% in 2025, according to Gallup.\n \n\n   \n  But the medicines can be expensive, and up to half of users say they have side effects including nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Studies suggest that people need to continue using them to maintain their weight loss, but many people don’t love the idea of staying on them indefinitely. A  recent study  found that nearly two-thirds of people without diabetes who started GLP-1 drugs stopped within a year.\n \n\n   \n  The next wave of research has sought to capitalize on the benefits of GLP-1s with fewer downsides. That’s where companies like Fractyl and RenBio come in.\n \n\n   \n  Fractyl is presenting  the latest results  from its trial of a gene therapy called Rejuva in mice at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society, called ObesityWeek, which is being held in Atlanta this week.\n \n\n   \n  RenBio shared its results from ongoing mouse studies as a  preprint paper , meaning it has not been peer reviewed or accepted into a medical journal, last month.  RenBio will also present updated findings at ObesityWeek.\n \n\n   \n    Turning muscle cells into GLP-1 factories\n \n\n   \n  RenBio calls its technology “Make Your Own,” and it’s a relatively simple idea. They use a plasmid — a ring of naked DNA — in saline solution.\n \n\n   \n  DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the instructions that the body uses to build and constantly refurbish itself. It lives in the nucleus, or brain, of every cell as a twisting, double-sided ladder. The ladder is made up of four individual nucleic acids, like the letters that make up words in a book, strung together in long chains that spell out the instructions for proteins.  The order of the letters tells the body how to make the proteins.\n \n\n   \n  In RenBio’s case, the researchers spelled out the instructions to make a GLP-1 receptor agonist protein — essentially the same active ingredient in medicines like Ozempic and Mounjaro — and looped it into a small circle called a plasmid. They injected saline solution containing these plasmids into muscle tissue and used short electrical pulses — milliseconds long — to zap the muscle cells.\n \n\n   \n  “It works really efficiently. Basically, the electrical pulses transiently make little pores in the cell membrane that allow the DNA rings to slip into the cell,” said Dr. Rachel Liberatore, president and chief scientific officer at RenBio.\n \n\n   \n  From there, the plasmids migrate to the nucleus, where they hang out in the jelly-like cytoplasm. When the cell gets ready to translate its own DNA, the plasmid DNA is read and translated right alongside it. When the cell reads the instructions, it builds the GLP-1 receptor agonist protein and releases it into the body.\n \n\n   \n  Liberatore said that although RenBio’s therapy uses a genetic technology, it’s not a traditional gene therapy: The researchers aren’t trying to fix a broken gene. Rather, they’re using the cell’s own machinery to turn it into a protein factory.\n \n\n   \n  “The DNA we’re injecting, the plasmid DNA, doesn’t interfere with your own DNA in any way. So it doesn’t interfere with your own chromosomes. It doesn’t integrate. It’s not something you’re going to pass on to your children,” Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  RenBio is also using this platform to make protein therapies that can be built in the same way, like antibodies to the Zika virus. The work is supported by the federal government’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or DARPA, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA.  It’s also supported by the Wellcome Trust, a health research foundation.\n \n\n   \n  In RenBio’s most successful experiments, mice injected with the plasmids lost about 15% of their body weight, which was significantly more than mice in a placebo group. The loss was maintained for at least a year after they received the plasmid DNA.\n \n\n   \n  In each formulation tested, the weight loss leveled off in mice treated with the plasmids. In essence, they hit a plateau. But that’s a good thing if you’re using a long-acting therapy, Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  “We were actually quite happy to see that, because you don’t necessarily want continued weight loss for a year, a year and a half,” Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  Glucose tolerance tests show that blood sugar was better regulated, too.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers aren’t sure how long the plasmids may remain active. The idea is that a doctor might give their patients a shot every year or two.\n \n\n   \n  “I think what our take on it is, it’s really ideally suited for the sort of maintenance phase that people are starting to talk about with GLP-1s,” Liberatore said.\n \n\n   \n  The plasmid platform has also been tested on monkeys, and the researchers even used the device to inject themselves – albeit with pure saline, not with any plasmids.\n \n\n   \n  RenBio hopes to begin testing its plasma platform to deliver instructions for making antibodies against the Zika virus in people next year.\n \n\n   \n    Targeting cells to help the body make more GLP-1\n \n\n   \n  Another company called Fractyl Health is taking a slightly different approach. It uses a more traditional gene therapy technique in which the outer shell of a small virus — called an adeno-associated virus — slips DNA into cells and givens them the instructions to make GLP-1.\n \n\n   \n  In rare cases, when viruses are used to deliver genes, they can trigger an immune response in the body, leading to potentially dangerous inflammation, allergic reactions or organ damage. In other cases, gene therapy vectors like viruses may wind up where they’re not supposed to be and can introduce errors into the genomes of cells, which  can lead to cancer .\n \n\n   \n  The idea is that a single treatment delivered directly to the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas would never need to be repeated.\n \n\n   \n  “Because we are delivering it locally, we believe that we will need a very low dose of this virus, which helps gives us confidence in the potential safety in people,” said Dr. Harith Rajagopalan, co-founder and CEO of Fractyl Health.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers have tried this in mice and pigs, and both tests were successful, Rajagopalan said. But mice and pigs aren’t humans, and many therapies that have succeeded in lab animals have gone on to fail in people.\n \n\n   \n  “There is promise, but much more data would be needed to consider human clinical trials, as it likely would be irreversible,” said Dr. Donald Kohn, a distinguished professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics, at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at the University of California – Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  “The concern would be, the genetic change would be permanent so if there is over-expression … which may change with various states — weight loss, illness, aging, hormonal changes — it could cause problems from over-expression with no way to reverse, except remove the pancreas or treated muscle,” Kohn said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Kohn said there has long been a debate in gene therapy about whether it should be used for non-disease treatment, such as enhancement of height or muscle mass. In general, the feeling is that it should not be used for enhancements.\n \n\n   \n  “This certainly is near that line between Medicine and enhancement and so I think that’s another reason that needs to be considered whether this is something that should be gone into,” Kohn said.\n \n\n   \n  Fractyl says it has filed the regulatory paperwork in Europe to start human trials.\n \n\n   \n  “We anticipate seeing human data in the next year, in 2026,” Rajagopalan said.\n \n\n   \n  Viruses are experts at infecting cells, so scientists use that capability to slip DNA into a cell, so the cell can start building the proteins the researchers want it to build – in this case, GLP-1.\n \n\n   \n  Gene therapy like this can be risky, however, so in order to minimize the risk, the researchers designed their DNA to recognize the promoter sequence for insulin. Promoter sequences are short stretches of DNA that tell the cell’s copying machinery where a new protein starts. It acts like an on/off switch in the DNA.\n \n\n   \n  By having the DNA sequence for GLP-1 recognize the insulin promoter, the researchers tied the function of their sequence to the production of insulin, another hormone that helps regulate blood sugar.\n \n\n   \n  That means only cells that make insulin will also make GLP-1, limiting the dose that’s delivered to the body.\n \n\n   \n  It also creates a way to dial up or down the volume of extra GLP-1. When a mouse eats a high-fat, high-calorie meal, its body will make more insulin but also more GLP-1, to guard against weight gain. When it eats a more moderate serving of its normal chow, it won’t make as much GLP-1, so it won’t lose weight when it doesn’t need to.\n \n\n   \n  In mice, the results have been encouraging, said Dr. Randy Seeley, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies hormone signaling as it relates to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Fractyl hired Seeley to test the gene therapy, and he owns stock options in the company.\n \n\n   \n  Obese mice that were treated with the gene therapy, which Fractyl calls Rejuva, lost about 20% of their body weight within three weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “It outperformed semaglutide,” the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, Rajagopalan said.\n \n\n   \n  When researchers treated normal-weight mice with the gene therapy and then fed them a high-fat diet, the mice did not gain weight. Their blood sugar also stayed normal.\n \n\n   \n  When they gave the gene therapy to lean mice who ate their normal diet, the lean mice didn’t lose excessive amounts of weight. They also didn’t seem to develop dangerously low blood sugar, suggesting that it might be safe to use to prevent obesity as well as treat and maintain it.\n \n\n   \n  It might also be a way to prevent diabetes.\n \n\n   \n  Rajagopalan envisions a day when it might be possible to identify people at risk of obesity, because of a family history or other factors, and give them gene therapy to prevent that fate.\n \n\n   \n  In a food environment where processed foods have been engineered to trick the brain into eating unhealthy amounts, he sees this gene therapy as potentially helping people regain control over their appetite and health.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is cheaper per calorie and more widely available than at any point in human history,” Rajagopalan said. “We’re just not built to make enough GLP-1 for the world around us.”\n \n\n   \n  The solution, he said, may be helping the body make more of its own.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a long way to go before you get there, and we can’t minimize the work involved. I mean, that’s equivalent to saying we’re going to colonize Mars, in terms of the magnitude of effort involved to get there,” Rajagopalan said. “But why not aspire to aspire to that?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/jeanine-pirro-reverses-fbi-firings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:07:00-05:00","title":"Jeanine Pirro Intervenes to Reverse FBI Agent Firing Amid Trump Administration Purge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro intervened to reverse the firings of at least four FBI agents linked to the Arctic Frost investigation into former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, citing their work on investigations she has promoted.

reverse the firings of at least 4 FBI agents. It was short lived. \n       \n  By Katelyn  Polantz, Evan Perez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:07 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro intervened Monday to reverse the firings of at least four FBI agents axed in the latest Trump administration purge at the bureau, according to multiple sources familiar with the developments this week.\n \n\n   \n  While their jobs were briefly restored Monday, the FBI leadership prevailed and fired them again on Tuesday, multiple sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources told CNN that some of the agents Pirro tried to save from termination were involved in President Donald Trump’s  crime crackdown across the capital city  — which Pirro has championed — and which the administration has made clear is a priority in its law enforcement agenda.\n \n\n   \n  The reversals marked an unusual moment where the  Trump-appointed US attorney  has tried to override a decision of other political appointees as the FBI weathers dozens of firings. It also highlights the continued push by some leaders in the Trump administration to gouge the bureau of experienced investigators who had worked on past cases tied to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The agents the FBI tried to remove had ties to the probes into Trump’s efforts to  overturn the 2020 presidential election , specifically the investigation known as Arctic Frost, which focused on the fake electors scheme where Trump allies sought to have Trump electors counted as electoral college votes from states that Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   \n  In the past few days, Pirro went directly to FBI leadership after learning these agents were being fired, and told them she had an interest in at least some of the agents continuing to work on an investigation out of her prosecutors’ office. That intervention prompted the bureau to reverse the firings, three sources told CNN this week.\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel has suggested to Republicans in Congress that he plans to remove anyone involved in the Arctic Frost probe.\n \n\n   \n  At least two other agents removed in the last week were tied to the Arctic Frost probe and their firings were not reversed.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Pirro did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n \n\n   \n  In recent weeks, Republicans have released FBI records showing details of the Arctic Frost investigation and accused former special counsel Jack Smith and FBI leaders of political motives in using grand jury subpoenas to obtain  phone records  of nine GOP lawmakers. The records, obtained in 2023, covered four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The FBI didn’t obtain the contents of the calls. Smith has denied any political motives and said the subpoenas were routine investigative tools.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement issued Tuesday, the FBI Agents Association, a membership-based advocacy organization that represents current and retired agents, condemned FBI leadership for wanting to fire the agents who had been associated with the Arctic Frost investigation, and abandoning due process in making personnel decisions.\n \n\n   \n  “The actions yesterday — in which FBI Special Agents were terminated and then reinstated shortly after, and then only to be fired again today — highlight the chaos that occurs when long-standing policies and processes are ignored,” the association said. “An Agent simply being assigned to an investigation and conducting it appropriately within the law should never be grounds for termination.

actions of train employee and driver saved many lives in England stabbing attack, police say \n       \n  By Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:09 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  There were just 11 minutes between the moment British police received an emergency call about a  stabbing on a train  heading to London and the moment the suspect was arrested.\n \n\n   \n  Eleven victims were hospitalized in the attack, including one railway worker who is in critical but stable condition, according to authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have said the casualties would have been far worse if not for the actions of the “heroic” railway worker who tried to stop the attacker on the train and the driver who arranged for the train to be diverted to a nearby station.\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train, which was taking passengers from northern England to the British capital on Saturday evening, had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place. The first emergency call to Cambridgeshire police was at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time. By 7:50 p.m., officers had arrested the 32-year-old British suspect on the platform at Huntingdon station, police told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The train worker, who was critically injured after confronting the attacker, has been named as 48-year-old Samir Zitouni, who has worked for LNER for more than two decades.\n \n\n   \n  “In a moment of crisis, Sam did not hesitate as he stepped forward to protect those around him,” LNER managing director David Horne said. “His actions were incredibly brave, and we are so proud of him, and of all our colleagues who acted with such courage that evening.”\n \n\n   \n  His family added in a statement: “We are immensely proud of Sam and his courage. The police called him a hero on Saturday evening, but to us – he’s always been a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday paid tribute to him saying he “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  British Transport Police (BTP) said that “detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Three other casualties remain stable in the hospital, BTP said in an update on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander also paid tribute to emergency services and, in particular, the train driver, “who had the presence of mind to phone the signals in Network Rail and get the train onto that slow line into Huntingdon station and a place of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed train was scheduled to pass through the station on a fast line, but driver and signalers quickly arranged for it to divert onto a slow track so it could stop alongside the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Open-source data shows that a signaler made the first alteration to the train’s planned route at 7:40 p.m. local time – only one minute after police received the first call about the attack. Another local train was already at the platform at Huntingdon – once it had left, the signaler was able to guide the LNER train safely into the platform where it stopped by 7:44 p.m.\n \n\n   \n  Huntington station happens to be around the corner from the Cambridgeshire Constabulary police headquarters, and both response officers and armed officers were quickly on the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Train driver Andrew Johnson told ITV News: “I was only doing my job. It was my colleague who is in hospital who was the brave one.” Johnson, from Peterborough, served in the Royal Navy for 17 years, according to LNER.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has been praised for remaining calm as the attack unfolded and choosing not to make an emergency stop between stations, where it would have been more difficult for authorities to respond. Instead, the swift decisions by Johnson and the signaler enabled the train to be stopped at Huntingdon; the next opportunity would have been a station seven minutes further down the line.\n \n\n   \n  Train drivers in the United Kingdom have extensive route training and are required to know the location of every signal and track layout on their route, including in the dark. Signalers have similar detailed knowledge.\n \n\n   \n  Nigel Roebuck, an organizer for the train drivers’ union ASLEF and a lead officer with LNER, told British media that “the driver did everything he was trained to do, at the right time and in the right way.”\n \n\n   \n  “He showed real courage, real dedication, and real determination in the most difficult of circumstances,” Roebuck added. “Our thoughts tonight are with his colleague who is still in intensive care.”\n \n\n   \n    Suspect charged with multiple attempted murders\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive for the attack but said that there was no evidence to suggest it was terror related. Mahmood said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n  The man apprehended, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article. He was also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with an incident that happened earlier on Saturday at a station in London. Williams was remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  A second man was initially arrested at the scene, but he was later released without charge.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, police are investigating three more knife incidents they believe are linked to the attacker that took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n    Witnesses describe running from attack\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  At first she thought it was a Halloween prank, but it became clear it was a genuine attack when the man shouted that someone had a knife and more people came running down the train.\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses. Other passengers were able to hide themselves in the train’s buffet carriage.\n \n\n   \n  Another witness, Thomas McLachlan, told the BBC: “There were definitely many heroes on that day, many kind people who just wanted to help those around them – people handing out blankets, hand warmers.”\n \n\n   \n  McLachlan said he saw one injured man who had been slashed in the face. He and another witness told local media that he heard the man had been “trying to protect a young girl from being attacked” when he was stabbed.\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Catherine Nicholls and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/science/nasa-goddard-building-closures-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"14:55:00Z","title":"NASA may be quietly gutting an iconic campus with what it calls strategic closures, workers fear","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is facing a wave of sudden and unexplained building closures during a federal shutdown, with 13 buildings — including 100 laboratories — being emptied and padlocked.

gutting an iconic campus with what it calls strategic closures, workers fear \n       \n  By Ella Nilsen, Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:55 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Alarm is growing among federal workers at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center’s main campus in Greenbelt, Maryland — the nerve center for groundbreaking missions like the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes — as more than a dozen buildings on the campus are being emptied and padlocked during the federal shutdown, with very little notice to employees, said four sources who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. NASA leadership has pushed back against those concerns.\n \n\n   \n  In one instance, furloughed employees were given just days to temporarily return to work and help empty entire buildings of highly specialized equipment, according to sources and internal emails obtained by CNN. In the communications, NASA managers wrote that equipment not moved in time — including one-of-a-kind hardware — could be thrown away or donated.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a NASA spokesperson said the building closures are part of a “strategic consolidation” plan mapped out by Goddard leaders that should not impact ongoing projects.\n \n\n   \n  But some of the sources CNN spoke with say they fear the sudden moves are part of an effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to quietly gut the Maryland Goddard campus while the government remains unfunded — a claim the spokesperson denied.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s April budget proposal would have slashed the center’s funding and workforce, including  reducing Goddard’s science staff by 42% . Funding bills passed by congressional lawmakers since then have largely excluded the President’s proposed science cuts.\n \n\n   \n  “Getting rid of Goddard removes the entire nation’s capability to build, develop and analyze data from space science satellites,” one Goddard engineer, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One document reviewed by CNN, which was compiled by more than a dozen Goddard workers concerned about the steps taken at the campus, states that 13 buildings are being shuttered, including about 100 laboratories. The roughly 1,270-acre campus  includes  more than 30 large buildings and dozens of smaller structures.\n \n\n   \n  Uncertainty around the closures has left workers perplexed and concerned that management is moving forward with plans to enact sweeping cuts before Congress passes a funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  In their statement, the NASA spokesperson said that the agency is “planning for multiple FY26 scenarios” — including the president’s budget request — “but it is important to note that NASA has and will continue to comply with the law.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘A devastating loss’\n \n\n   \n  The changes described by sources have the space agency’s engineers concerned they could permanently lose access to equipment and facilities that are crucial to keeping current and future projects on track.\n \n\n   \n  The closures could impact  the  2027  launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope, a powerful successor to the Hubble and James Webb telescopes that could revolutionize scientists’ understanding of the cosmos and the beginnings of the universe, two sources told CNN. Roman is a “super Hubble” that can take full sky surveys in space and is meant to study potentially habitable planets and dark matter.\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN the closures could also affect NASA’s Dragonfly program, which aims to send a car-size helicopter to study Saturn’s largest moon for signs of habitability and is scheduled to launch in 2028. Both Roman and Dragonfly received continued funding and support even in the President’s budget request.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond those two more imminent projects, sources told CNN the sudden changes at Goddard this month could severely hurt space science and exploration in the next decade.\n \n\n   \n  “Stopping development of what’s in the pipeline now, you’re cutting off the next three decades of missions to explore the universe, to learn more about the planets and to learn more about the Earth,” the Goddard engineer said. “It’s a really devastating loss to think about for the country.”\n \n\n   \n  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, the NASA spokesperson said that “Dragonfly and Roman will remain operational as their excepted work continues throughout the shutdown,” noting leadership does not expect projects to be delayed by the Goddard Greenbelt campus changes.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Taking a Maserati to the junkyard’\n \n\n   \n  Goddard and NASA leadership had already been working through a master plan —  hashed out years ago  — to revamp the Goddard campus, aiming to cut costs and eventually modernize some of the center’s aging infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  However, several of the buildings currently being emptied are not scheduled to be closed until the early 2030s, according to documents and first-hand accounts from sources. And workers say they haven’t seen signs of new laboratories being constructed or renovated, as is spelled out in the master plan.\n \n\n   \n  The NASA spokesperson said in their statement that “Goddard leadership proposed and was approved to initiate a consolidation of buildings at the Greenbelt and Wallops campuses” earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  The new plan was hashed out in response to an exodus of employees who  took deferred resignations . About 841 Goddard employees took such offers this year, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  “Buildings vacated were approximately 40% unoccupied on average,” the spokesperson’s statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  One building that has been shuttered, however, houses Goddard’s ElectroMagnetic Anechoic Chamber, or GEMAC, a one-of-a-kind radio-proof room that is essential for testing spacecraft antennas before they are launched.\n \n\n   \n  Components for NASA’s Davinci mission, slated to conduct an unprecedented study of Venus after launch in the early  2030s, were set to be tested in the GEMAC, a source noted.\n \n\n   \n  And closing the facility would have far broader implications, impacting untold numbers of current and future projects because the unique design of the GEMAC allows for the testing of large pieces of communications equipment that would not fit in other, similar facilities, the source noted.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s like taking a Maserati to the junkyard to get crushed because your driver’s license expired,” another source said. “The GEMAC is fully operational and could go on for many more years to support in-house, out of house, and the industry (like it has for several decades).”\n \n\n   \n  A NASA spokesperson said the GEMAC was in poor condition and would remain closed. The Davinci spacecraft could be tested in alternative facilities, the spokesperson said, and no other projects were slated to move through GEMAC for testing in the next 15 years.\n \n\n   \n  Sources told CNN, however, that they were concerned GEMAC was the only facility of its kind with an expansive doorway suitable for accommodating large pieces of hardware — and decommissioning the facility would have a long-term impact on NASA’s spacecraft testing capabilities.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Sabotage’\n \n\n   \n  Another building that is being emptied on Goddard’s campus includes labs for teams that have been working on the Roman telescope’s propulsion subsystem, one of the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “In terms of future missions, once this lab goes away, we won’t be able to do anything like it again,” one Goddard employee said.\n \n\n   \n  That employee questioned whether the cost of moving equipment from one building to another, possibly misplacing or throwing away equipment in the process, was actually saving Goddard and the federal government money.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t understand why our management would want to internally sabotage our capabilities,” the source said. “They haven’t communicated any rationale other than they’re trying to save money, but the things they’re doing don’t actually seem to save money.”\n \n\n   \n  Infrastructure and equipment slated to be given away or disposed of at Goddard cannot be easily replaced, sources said.\n \n\n   \n    Alleged ADA violations\n \n\n   \n  Some of the workers who spoke to CNN also raised concerns that shuttering offices and ordering furloughed workers to return to the office to pack boxes may violate the Antideficiency Act, or ADA.\n \n\n   \n  The ADA is a federal law that impacts how shutdowns should be carried out and stipulates that “employees cannot ‘volunteer’ their services to agencies — i.e., provide services without payment — except in very limited circumstances,” such as being “necessary to protect human life and government property,” according to a government  definition .\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, the NASA spokesperson said “two exceptions were approved to mainta﻿in our schedule for facility movements throughout the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Those exceptions mostly involved moving technical equipment, not office spaces, the spokesperson said, and “over 100 office space moves have been put on hold until the government reopens.” The statement also denies that any of the building closures or return-to-work directives related to the changes violate federal laws.\n \n\n   \n  Still, employees have also been left wondering why the moves needed to take place when so many employees remained furloughed and unaware of how sensitive hardware was being handled. It’s also unclear whether employees who were asked to help with the moves will ever be compensated for returning to work to move boxes.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in this shutdown that is not like every other shutdown,” said Charles Tiefer, a former acting general counsel for the US House of Representatives and a professor emeritus at the University of Baltimore School of Law. Tiefer also noted that Trump has already said he is  considering not giving back pay  to all federal employees once the government shutdown ends, a stark departure from precedence.\n \n\n   \n  “My circle of people fell out of our chairs when we heard that,” he added, referring to attorneys and experts familiar with government spending laws.\n \n\n   \n    ‘An existential crisis’\n \n\n   \n  The purported chaos at Goddard is further affecting the morale of an employee base that has been  reeling  from job losses, looming budget cuts and discordant communication from leadership, the sources who work at the center told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Goddard in particular has been a hotspot of contention in an already tumultuous year for the space agency. The center’s leader, Makenzie Lystrup, abruptly resigned in July on the same day hundreds of scientists and current and former NASA employees signed a declaration lambasting what they perceived as “ rapid and wasteful changes ” being implemented under the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Some NASA scientists were also angered and confused earlier this year over the decision to cancel a lease for the Goddard Institute for Space Studies — an offshoot laboratory located in New York City.\n \n\n   \n  Goddard has been involved in all of the space agency’s moon rovers and has sent spacecraft to Jupiter and other planets in the solar system. Employees at the center said that if the campus is seriously crippled or shut down altogether, it will be a massive loss to the US space program and hamper scientists’ efforts to better understand the universe.\n \n\n   \n  “Not many people are sending missions to Jupiter except for NASA Goddard,” the Goddard employee said. “It’s not profitable, so private industry wouldn’t do it.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels like an existential crisis; Goddard will either no longer exist at all or no longer exist the way it should.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/middleeast/trump-administration-un-resolution-gaza-security-force-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:11:00Z","title":"Trump administration advancing UN resolution for Gaza security force, source says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is advancing a United Nations Security Council resolution to deploy a multinational International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza to implement the US-brokered ceasefire deal.

Mostafa Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:11 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration is working on a United Nations Security Council resolution to deploy a multinational force to Gaza to uphold the US-brokered ceasefire deal, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  The details of a temporary security force in charge of demilitarizing Gaza and training a new Palestinian police force are under discussion as part of the work on the resolution, according to the source. US troops would not be part of the force on the ground in Gaza, instead operating in a coordination role outside of the territory.\n \n\n   \n  Early drafts of the resolution have been shared with other members of the Security Council, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Setting up an international stabilization force (ISF) is a key part of Trump’s  20-point  Gaza ceasefire plan, but many of the nations considering taking part have made clear that they would only join under the mandate of a UN resolution.\n \n\n   \n  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said while visiting Israel  last month  that some of the potential participants would only join the force if it had “some sort of international mandate,” adding that this could take the form of a UN resolution or an “international agreement.”\n \n\n   \n  Once established, the ISF would operate under a unified command in close coordination with Israel and Egypt, the source told CNN. The US has established a coordination center in southern Israel to manage the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan, including the planned reconstruction effort and the entry of humanitarian aid. According to US Central Command, nearly 40 different nations and international organizations have representation at the coordination center.\n \n\n   \n  The ISF, working together with a trained Palestinian police force, will stabilize the security situation in Gaza and ensure the demilitarization of the enclave, according to the draft resolution. That includes the destruction of military infrastructure used by Hamas, a step that risks putting the new force in direct conflict with the militant organization, which has worked to re-establish its authority since the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  The  US-brokered ceasefire plan  also calls for the international force to carry out the disarmament of Hamas, but countries have been reluctant to agree to such a task.\n \n\n   \n  Several Muslim-majority nations that are  considering participation in the ISF  met in Istanbul on Monday to discuss the mission. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who attended the meeting, told a news conference that the countries will decide whether to participate in the mission depending on the definition of the force and the UN mandate.\n \n\n   \n  “We are ready to shoulder the burden for peace. We are ready to make any sacrifice. But… it’s crucial that the documents and framework that emerge are of a quality we can clearly support. Therefore, our diplomatic contacts and efforts on this matter continue,” Fidan told a news conference after the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what role Turkey will play in the force but Israel has made it clear that it will not tolerate the presence of Turkish troops in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Israel was reluctant to agree to a UN mandate for the international force but backed down under US pressure, according to a senior Israeli official. Even so, Israel was involved in drafting the resolution and is still trying to influence its wording, the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “At the moment, there aren’t any major issues for us — the question is whether it will stay that way,” the official said. The current working draft does not include any reporting requirement to the Security Council, and Israel wants it to stay that way.\n \n\n   \n  “Some countries will try to increase the Security Council’s involvement as much as possible, and Israel will seek to prevent that,” the official added.\n \n\n   \n  Under the draft resolution, the ISF would operate until the end of 2027, at which point it would require renewal for its mandate in consultation with Israel, Egypt and members of the Security Council.\n \n\n   \n  Lucy Kurtzer-Ellenbogen, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute, said that ideally an international force would have begun operating the moment the ceasefire went into effect in early October. The agreement calls for the “immediate” deployment of the force.\n \n\n   \n  “These matters of composition, lack of clarity around the specifics of the disarmament mandate, and the uncertainties around what interaction and coordination will inevitably entail with the (Israel Defense Forces), undoubtedly raise challenges for launching,” Kurtzer-Ellenbogen told CNN.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/uk/uk-train-attack-wwk-intl-gbr","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"13:09:00-05:00","title":"British man charged over mass stabbing attack on a train in England","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A British man, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm, and one count of possession of a bladed article in connection with a mass stabbing that occurred on a London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday evening.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, Catherine Nicholls, Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:09 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A man has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder over a  mass stabbing attack  on a British train on Saturday evening that targeted passengers as they traveled through central England on their way to London.\n \n\n   \n  The attack left eleven people hospitalized with injuries, one of whom is still fighting for his life in the hospital after confronting the attacker, according British Transport Police (BTP).\n \n\n   \n  The man charged, Anthony Williams, 32, of Peterborough, was remanded in custody after appearing in court on Monday. While in court, he wasn’t asked to enter pleas and he said “no fixed abode” when he was asked about his address, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency. His next appearance in court is due to be on December 1.\n \n\n   \n  He is further charged with one count of actual bodily harm and one count of possession of bladed article in connection to the mass stabbing in Cambridgeshire, according to BTP.\n \n\n   \n  The man is also charged with another count of attempted murder in connection with a separate incident that happened earlier on Saturday at Pontoon Dock Station in London.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, police are investigating three more knife incidents they believe are linked to the attacker that took place in Peterborough on Friday evening and Saturday morning. One of those included a stabbing in Peterborough city center, in which a 14-year-old was hospitalized with minor injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Police are working to determine a motive but previously said that there was no evidence to suggest the attacks were terror-related.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the stabbing on the train.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6:25 p.m. local time on Saturday, bound for London.\n \n\n   \n  The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place.\n \n\n   \n  Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.\n \n\n   \n  After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.”\n \n\n   \n  People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train restrooms, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood.\n \n\n   \n  Cambridgeshire police received their first emergency call at approximately 7:39 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within about 11 minutes of the call, two initial suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned stop at Huntingdon station. One of those suspects was later released.\n \n\n   \n  Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralize any ongoing threat, PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  The train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.\n \n\n   \n  Police had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before rescinding it later.\n \n\n   \n  Williams was charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article in connection to another incident on Saturday at Pontoon Dock station in London, which is about 100 miles from Peterborough.\n \n\n   \n  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday said the suspect was not known to security services, counter-terror police or the Home Office’s Prevent program, a central plank of Britain’s strategy to combat terrorism.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the victims?\n \n\n   \n  A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. Ten people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, while another person later self-presented that evening.\n \n\n   \n  As of Tuesday evening, four people remain in hospital, one of whom is in critical but stable condition, BTP said. The critically injured man, an LNER staff member who was on the train, had “tried to stop the attacker,” police said earlier.\n \n\n   \n  LNER named him as 48-year-old Samir Zitouni, who has worked for the train company for more than two decades as a customer experience host.\n \n\n   \n  “Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people’s lives,” BTP said.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood paid tribute to the worker, saying that he “ran toward danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.”\n \n\n   \n  Zitouni’s family said in a statement: “We are immensely proud of Sam and his courage. The police called him a hero on Saturday evening, but to us – he’s always been a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the victims who was hospitalized is Scunthorpe United player Jonathan Gjoshe, the soccer club said in a statement, which said he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\n \n\n   \n  Little other information has been given at this stage about other victims, including their ages.\n \n\n   \n  Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.\n \n\n   \n    How common are such attacks in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.\n \n\n   \n  Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.\n \n\n   \n  In comparison, knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday’s attack and offered their condolences to victims.\n \n\n   \n  “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” Starmer wrote on X.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”\n \n\n   \n  The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK’s busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King’s Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/fbi-investigation-michigan-terrorist-plot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:49:00.000-05:00","title":"How phone calls, sessions at gun ranges and secret meetings in parks led the FBI to charge suspects in alleged terrorist plot","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The FBI uncovered an alleged ISIS-linked terrorist plot in Michigan in 2024 through a series of encrypted phone calls, including a cryptic reference to Paris, which mirrored the 2015 Paris attacks.

  \n  By Chelsea Bailey, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:49 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A series of encrypted phone calls – secretly recorded by a confidential FBI source – tipped off federal agents that a group was allegedly planning to carry out a  terrorist attack  in Michigan on behalf of ISIS, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali, 20, and Majed Mahmoud, 20, face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to the criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officials have yet to charge a third person – a juvenile described throughout the complaint as Person 1 – in connection with the alleged plot.\n \n\n   \n  But the complaint details how agents doggedly surveilled the alleged co-conspirators for two months as they visited multiple gun ranges and held late-night meetings in local parks during what authorities allege was preparation for a possible terrorist attack.\n \n\n   \n  Then, based on what they believed to be references to a possible attack on Halloween, agents swooped in to seize the weapons and take the men into custody in the predawn hours of October 31.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about how the investigation unfolded:\n \n\n   \n    A cryptic reference to Paris prompts suspicion\n \n\n   \n  According to an FBI affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, the agency began surveilling a man, described as “co-conspirator 1,” in 2024 as he traveled in the US and overseas.\n \n\n   \n  In June, agents allegedly tracked the man’s phone to Dearborn, Michigan, and physical surveillance led them to Ali’s home there, where he stayed for two nights.\n \n\n   \n  The following month, according to the FBI, the man joined a group call from overseas with five others – including an FBI confidential source, who recorded the meeting. Person 1, Mahmoud and Ali do not appear to have been part of this call.\n \n\n   \n  During the call, the group allegedly discussed “traveling together to Syria to join ISIS” and co-conspirator 1 said they were “gonna die there … unless,” he told the group, “the Amir sends you to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  A review of co-conspirator 1’s cellphone allegedly revealed he had “Person 1’s phone number saved in his phone under ‘Athari’ and ALI’s phone number saved in his phone as ‘Bukhari.’”\n \n\n   \n  According to the complaint, one of the participants on the call also stated, “Athari and Bukhari said they were going to stay back and do the ‘same thing as France.’”\n \n\n   \n  “Knowing Athari, it’s (the attack) probably going to be at like a club, a disco,” co-conspirator 1 said, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The reference to Paris stood out to FBI counterterrorism experts. They concluded it was a thinly veiled nod to the coordinated ISIS-linked terrorist attacks that unfolded across Paris in  November 2015 . More than 130 people were killed in the attacks and scores more were wounded.\n \n\n   \n  After studying the call, the FBI concluded an attack could be imminent and began keeping close tabs on Ali and Mahmoud.\n \n\n   \n    Talk turned to action with purchase of firearms, complaint alleges\n \n\n   \n  According to the complaint, in the months following the June meeting with “co-conspirator 1,” Ali allegedly purchased a Beretta A300 Ultimata Black Shotgun, a “Sabre” Forged 16” rifle, as well as a holographic sight “built for close-quarter engagements with fast moving targets.”\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud also allegedly purchased a rifle and two boxes of ammunition with more than 800 rounds in each box. In October, he allegedly purchased a red dot sight, which provides “the shooter a single point of focus during the aiming process,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Then, in September and October, Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 began practicing at local shooting ranges, under the watchful eye of FBI agents, the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  Security footage obtained by the FBI shows all three men visiting local gun ranges over the course of several weeks.\n \n\n   \n  On multiple occasions, undercover FBI agents entered the range and surveilled the men from nearby as they practiced firing weapons. Although the agents did not identify themselves, according to the complaint they observed the men practicing with guns and ammunition like those they had previously purchased.\n \n\n   \n    FBI tailed trio as they allegedly scouted locations\n \n\n   \n  Although Ali, Mahmoud and Person 1 are all under 21, the complaint noted in September they began traveling to a popular area in Ferndale, Michigan, known for its bars and clubs.\n \n\n   \n  “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community,” the complaint states.\n \n\n   \n  The following month, FBI agents “observed three individuals appearing to match the physical description” of Person 1, Ali, and Mahmoud meeting at a local park in Dearborn, Michigan, around 9 p.m. They met up again the following week at another park.\n \n\n   \n  Since the men all live with their families, the FBI concluded the late-night meetups at the park “reflect their efforts to meet to plan an attack without being detected.”\n \n\n   \n    References to ‘pumpkin’ trigger arrest on Halloween\n \n\n   \n  In September and October, the FBI received court-approved authorization to surveil communications between Person 1, Ali and Mahmoud.\n \n\n   \n  In calls and messages, they found multiple mentions of “pumpkin,” which agents concluded was a reference to “Halloween as the potential day for the attack they were plotting, an attack that they understood could result in their deaths and martyrdom.”\n \n\n   \n  “So ya, I talked to my brothers. We are going to do pumpkin,” Person 1 allegedly told Ali on October 24, according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  The FBI later notes in the complaint references to “brothers” likely mean “other ISIS supporters.”\n \n\n   \n  As the Halloween weekend loomed, a judge authorized the execution of search warrants on Ali and Mahmoud’s homes.\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of October 31, FBI agents descended on the Detroit suburb where the men lived and detonated smoke bombs before storming into their homes.\n \n\n   \n  Both Ali and Mahmoud were arrested.\n \n\n   \n  FBI Director Kash Patel later tweeted about the foiled terrorist plot but offered little additional detail. As a result, some Dearborn residents  speculated  whether the arrests were justified, or perhaps a way to profile the city’s large Arab population, which has long been targeted for Islamophobic attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But on Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi boasted on X the unsealed criminal complaint revealed “a major ISIS-linked terror plot.”\n \n\n   \n  “Our American heroes prevented a terror attack,” Bondi wrote.\n \n\n   \n    Court process begins with hearing\n \n\n   \n  Both Mahmoud and Ali were shackled as they were escorted into court Monday, according to CNN reporters who attended the hearing. Both men acknowledged they had read the complaint against them and understood the charges.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for both of the men briefly spoke to reporters after the hearing, but declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  Co-conspirator 1 has not been charged.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Holly Yan, Jeff Winter and Leigh Waldman contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/dick-cheney-death-obit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:07:00-05:00","title":"Dick Cheney, influential Republican vice president to George W.

Bush, dies \n       \n  By Stephen Collinson, Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:07 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dick Cheney, America’s most powerful modern vice president and chief architect of the “war on terror,” who helped lead the country into the ill-fated Iraq war on faulty assumptions, has died, according to a statement from his family. He was 84.\n \n\n   \n  “His beloved wife of 61 years, Lynne, his daughters, Liz and Mary, and other family members were with him as he passed,” the family said, adding that he died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,” the family added.\n \n\n   \n  “We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”\n \n\n   \n  The 46th vice president, who served alongside Republican President George W. Bush for two terms between 2001 and 2009, was for decades a towering and polarizing Washington power player.\n \n\n   \n  Bush described Cheney in a statement Tuesday as a “decent, honorable man.” “History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation – a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position,” Bush said.\n \n\n   \n  In his final years, Cheney, still a hardline conservative, nevertheless became largely ostracized from his party over his intense  criticism of President Donald Trump  whom he branded a “coward”   and the greatest-ever threat to the republic.\n \n\n   \n  In an ironic coda to a storied political career, he cast his final vote in a presidential election in 2024 for a liberal Democrat, and fellow member of the vice president’s club, Kamala Harris, in a reflection of how the populist GOP had turned against his traditional conservatism.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was plagued by cardiovascular disease for most of his adult life, surviving a series of heart attacks, to lead a full, vigorous life and lived many years in retirement after a  heart transplant in 2012  that he hailed in a 2014 interview as “the gift of life itself.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney, a sardonic former Wyoming representative, White House chief of staff and defense secretary, was enjoying a lucrative career in the corporate world when he was charged by George W. Bush with vetting potential vice-presidential nominees. The quest ended with Cheney himself taking the oath of office as a worldly number two to a callow new president who arrived in the Oval Office after a disputed election.\n \n\n   \n  While caricatures of Cheney as the real president do not accurately capture the true dynamics of Bush’s inner circle, he relished the enormous influence that he wielded from behind the scenes.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney was in the White House, with the president out of town on the crisp, clear morning of September 11, 2001. In the split second of horror when a second hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center in New York, he said he became a changed man, determined to avenge the al Qaeda-orchestrated attacks and to enforce US power throughout the Middle East with a neo-conservative doctrine of regime change and pre-emptive war.\n \n\n   \n  “At that moment, you knew this was a deliberate act. This was a terrorist act,” he recalled of that day in an interview with CNN’s John King in 2002.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney reflected in later years on how the attacks left him with overwhelming sense of responsibility to ensure such an assault on the homeland never happened again. Perceptions however that he was the sole driving force behind the war on terror and US ventures into Iraq and Afghanistan are misleading.\n \n\n   \n  Contemporary and historic accounts of the administration show that Bush was his own self-styled “ The Decider .”\n \n\n   \n  Multiple former presidents paid tribute to Cheney on Tuesday, with Bill Clinton and Joe Biden highlighting the former vice president’s “public service.”\n \n\n   \n    A changed man\n \n\n   \n  From a bunker deep below the White House, Cheney went into crisis mode, directing the response of a grief-stricken nation suddenly at war. He gave the extraordinary order to authorize the shooting down of any more hijacked airliners in the event they were headed to the White House or the US Capitol building. For many, his frequent departures to “undisclosed” locations outside Washington to preserve the presidential chain of succession reinforced his image as an omnipotent figure waging covert war from the shadows. His hawkishness and alarmist view of a nation facing grave threats was not an outlier at the time – especially during a traumatic period that included anthrax mailings and sniper shootings around Washington, DC, that exacerbated a sense of public fear even though they were unrelated to 9/11.\n \n\n   \n  The September 11 attacks unleashed the US war in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, which was harboring al Qaeda, though the terror group’s leader Osama bin Laden escaped. Soon, Cheney was agitating for widening the US assault to Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein, whose forces he had helped to eject from Kuwait in the first Gulf War as President George H.W. Bush’s Pentagon chief.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s aggressive warnings about Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction programs, alleged links to al Qaeda and intent to furnish terrorists with deadly weapons to attack the United States played a huge role in laying the groundwork for the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Congressional reports and other post-war inquiries later showed that Cheney and other administration officials exaggerated, misrepresented or did not properly portray faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction programs that Iraq turned out not to possess. One of Cheney’s most infamous claims, that the chief 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta, met Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, was never substantiated, including by the independent commission into the September 11 attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But Cheney insisted in 2005 that he and other top officials were acting on “the best available intelligence,” at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While admitting that the flaws in the intelligence were plain in hindsight, he insisted that any claim that the data was “distorted, hyped, or fabricated” was “utterly false.”\n \n\n   \n  The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan also led the US down a dark legal and moral path including “enhanced interrogations” of terror suspects that critics blasted as torture. But Cheney – who was at the center of every facet of the global war on terrorism – insisted methods like waterboarding were perfectly acceptable.   Cheney was also an outspoken advocate for holding terror suspects without trial at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba – a practice that critics at home and abroad branded an affront to core American values.\n \n\n   \n    No regrets\n \n\n   \n  Cheney became a symbol of the excesses of the anti-terror campaigns and the fatally false premises and poor planning that turned the initially successful invasion of Iraq into a bloody quagmire. He left office reviled by Democrats and with an approval rating of 31%,  according to the Pew Research Center. \n \n\n   \n  To the end of his life, Cheney expressed no regrets, certain he had merely done what was necessary to respond to an unprecedented attack on the US mainland that killed nearly 3,000 people and led to nearly two decades of foreign wars that divided the nation and transformed its politics.\n \n\n   \n  “I would do it again in a minute,”  Cheney said , when confronted by a Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2014 that  concluded  enhanced interrogation methods as brutal and ineffective and responsible for damaging US standing in the eyes of the world.\n \n\n   \n  Of the Iraq war, he told CNN in 2015: “It was the right thing to do then. I believed it then and I believe it now.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘He’s a coward’\n \n\n   \n  Cheney’s aggressive anti-terror policies fit into a personal doctrine that justified extraordinary presidential powers with limited congressional oversight. That was in line with his belief that the authority of the executive branch had been mistakenly eroded in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of his first presidential boss, President Richard Nixon.\n \n\n   \n  Yet in his final years, Cheney emerged as a fierce critic of a man who had an even more expansive view of the powers of the presidency than he did – Trump. Cheney had supported Trump in 2016 despite his criticism of Bush-Cheney foreign policies and his transformation of the party of Reagan into a populist, nationalist GOP. But the ending of the president’s first term, when his refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat led to the January 6 insurrection, caused Cheney to speak out, in a rare, public manner.\n \n\n   \n  The former vice president’s daughter, then-Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, meanwhile, sacrificed a promising career in the GOP to oppose Trump after his attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. In an  ad for his daughter’s unsuccessful campaign  to fight off a pro-Trump candidate’s primary challenge in 2022, Dick Cheney – who was, by then, rarely seen in public – looked directly into the camera from under a wide brimmed cowboy hat and delivered an extraordinary direct message.\n \n\n   \n  “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said.\n \n\n   \n  “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election, and he lost big. I know it. He knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know.”\n \n\n   \n    Early days out West\n \n\n   \n  Richard Bruce Cheney was born January 30, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska. While living in the small mountain town of Casper, Wyoming, he met his high school sweetheart and future wife Lynne Vincent. Cheney was  accepted  to Yale University on a scholarship, but he struggled to fit in and maintain his grades. By his own admission,  he was kicked out .\n \n\n   \n  He returned West to work on power lines and was twice arrested for driving under the influence. In a turning point for Cheney, he was given an ultimatum from Lynne, who had “made it clear she wasn’t interested in marrying a lineman for the county,” he told  The New Yorker . “I buckled down and applied myself. Decided it was time to make something of myself,” he told the magazine.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney went back to school and earned a bachelor’s and master’s in political science from University of Wyoming. The couple was married in 1964.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney is survived by Lynne, his daughters Liz and Mary Cheney and seven grandchildren.\n \n\n   \n    A veteran Washington power broker\n \n\n   \n  Cheney began honing his inside power game – at which he became a master – as an aide to Nixon.\n \n\n   \n  He was later picked by Donald Rumsfeld as his deputy White House chief of staff under President Gerald Ford and then succeeded his mentor and close friend in the job in 1975 when Rumsfeld departed to become defense secretary. Cheney was instrumental in reviving their partnership in 2001 when he recalled Rumsfeld from the political wilderness to return to the Pentagon.\n \n\n   \n  The pair formed an extraordinary backroom alliance in the Bush administration throughout the war on terror and the Iraq war – much to the frustration of more moderate members of the administration including then-Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice – who took over from Powell in the second term.\n \n\n   \n  While Democratic President Jimmy Carter was in the White House, Cheney decided to run for Congress and was elected to Wyoming’s sole US House seat in 1978. Cheney served six terms, rising to become House minority whip, and racked up a  very conservative voting record .\n \n\n   \n  In 1989, President George H. W. Bush, who had served with Cheney in the Ford administration, tapped him to serve as his defense secretary, calling him a “trusted friend, adviser.” He was confirmed by the Senate in a 92-0 vote.\n \n\n   \n  As Pentagon chief, Cheney showed considerable skill in directing the US invasion of Panama in 1989 and Operation Desert Storm in 1991 to push Iraq’s troops out of Kuwait. Following his stint as defense secretary, Cheney briefly explored a run for president in the 1996 election cycle but decided against it.\n \n\n   \n  During Clinton’s presidency, Cheney joined Dallas-based Halliburton Co. serving as its chief executive officer.\n \n\n   \n  It wouldn’t be until the younger Bush decided to run for office that Cheney was chosen to lead the Republican candidate’s search for a running mate and, after initially turning down the job, ended up being added to the GOP ticket.\n \n\n   \n  “During the process, I came to the conclusion that the selector was the best person to be selected,” Bush said in the 2020 CNN film “President in Waiting.”\n \n\n   \n  Cheney brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to areas where critics complained Bush was weak. As a former Texas governor, Bush had no elected experience in Washington and little military and foreign policy background compared with Cheney.\n \n\n   \n  Early in Bush’s presidency, Cheney led a task force to develop the administration’s energy policy and sought to keep its records secret in a fight that lasted Bush’s first term and went all the way to the US Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  He was, however, at odds with Bush over the issue of same-sex marriage, saying that it should be left to the states to decide. In a 2004 town hall, he noted his daughter Mary’s sexual orientation reportedly for the first time publicly, according to  The Washington Post . “With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone. People … ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to,” he said, the Post reported.\n \n\n   \n  His relationship with Bush was complicated in later years, including by Bush’s refusal to pardon Cheney’s chief of staff Scooter Libby, who had been convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in 2007 after a probe into who leaked the identity of a CIA operative. Libby was eventually pardoned by Trump in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  In one of the most notorious moments in his personal life, which added to his grizzled legend in 2006, Cheney accidentally  shot a hunting partner  in the face with birdshot, causing relatively minor wounds.\n \n\n   \n    Health issues\n \n\n   \n  Cheney’s health issues began in 1978, when he had his first heart attack at age 37 while running for Congress. Three more followed in 1984, 1988 and November 2000, just a few days into the Florida presidential ballot recount that resulted in a Bush-Cheney win.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney at the time said that he’d be the “the first to step down” if he learned he’d be unable to do the job and had a resignation letter in case he was deemed incapacitated. Cheney completed both terms under Bush, attending Barack Obama’s inauguration in January 2009 in a wheelchair.\n \n\n   \n  A year after a fifth heart attack in 2010, Cheney received a heart pump that kept the organ running until his transplant in 2012.\n \n\n   \n    Life after the White House\n \n\n   \n  After leaving office, Cheney returned to private life, penning two memoirs — one about his personal and political career and the other about his struggles with heart disease as well as a book with his daughter, Liz. He became one of the most strident GOP critics of President Barack Obama, who had based his election campaign on promises to end the wars and other changes from what he called failed policies of the Bush-Cheney administration.\n \n\n   \n  Years later, Cheney was decrying his own party — especially its leadership’s response to the attack on the Capitol — when he returned to the US Capitol with then-Rep. Liz Cheney   on the one-year anniversary of January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply disappointed at the failure of many members of my party to recognize the grave nature of the January 6 attacks and the ongoing threat to our nation,” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  In a remarkable moment,  Democrats lined up  to greet the former Republican vice president and shake his hand. Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  hugged Cheney . The former vice president slammed Republican leaders in Congress, saying they do not resemble the leaders he remembered from his time in the body.\n \n\n   \n  It was a scene that would have been unthinkable two decades earlier and an illustration of how the extraordinary changes in American politics wrought by Trump had made former bitter political foes find common cause in the fight for democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” Cheney said at the Capitol in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Cheney continued his criticism of Trump in the following years and went as far as to  endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris , a Democrat and Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential campaign. He said he would vote for Harris because of the “duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.” Cheney emphasized his disdain for Trump at the time and warned that he “can never be trusted with power again,” though Trump would go on to win the presidency a couple of months later.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Jamie Gangel and Shania Shelton contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/us/dearborn-fbi-raid-terror-attack-skepticism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:47:00-05:00","title":"Suspects Charged in Alleged Terror Plot Cited ISIS and May Have Tried to Replicate Paris Terror Attack on US Soil, FBI Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two young men, Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, face federal charges for allegedly plotting an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in the U.S. on Halloween, potentially mirroring the scale of the 2015 Paris attacks.

terror attack on US soil, FBI says \n       \n  By Alaa Elassar, Leigh Waldman, Jeff Winter, Holly Yan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:47 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two men face federal charges for allegedly plotting an ISIS-inspired Halloween attack in the US – possibly on the scale of the  2015 Paris terror attacks  that killed at least 130 people, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  An FBI raid on Halloween morning stunned neighbors in Dearborn, the  second-safest city in Michigan  and home to the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud face charges of “Receiving and transferring, and attempting and conspiring to transfer, firearms and ammunition knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition would be used to commit a Federal crime of terrorism,” according to a criminal complaint.\n \n\n   \n  “Our newly unsealed complaint reveals a major ISIS-linked terror plot,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi  posted on X .\n \n\n   \n  “According to the complaint, subjects had multiple AR-15 rifles, tactical gear, and a detailed plan to carry out an attack on American soil,” she said, thanking officials for averting an attack “before innocent lives were lost.”\n \n\n   \n  If convicted, Ali and Mahmoud could face up to 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud’s attorney, William “Bill” Swor, told CNN his client and Ali are both 20 years old. He declined to provide additional details.\n \n\n   \n  CNN asked Ali’s attorney for comment after the criminal complaint was released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A detention hearing for both men is scheduled for November 10.\n \n\n   \n    Suspects bought AR-15-style rifles and over 1,600 rounds of ammo, agent says \n \n\n   \n  Ali and an unidentified juvenile were “planning to conduct a terrorist attack in the United States on behalf of the designated foreign terrorist organization ISIS,” an FBI agent wrote in the criminal complaint, citing communications on an encrypted app.\n \n\n   \n  Further investigation revealed Mahmoud and others were co-conspirators in the plot, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n  Ali purchased a shotgun, an AR-15-style rifle and multiple accessories, including “a forced reset trigger that allows a shooter to increase the rate of fire in a semiautomatic weapon,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud also bought an AR-15-style rifle and more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition that could be used in AR-15 style rifles he and Ali had purchased, the agent said.\n \n\n   \n    A suspect mentions doing the ‘same thing as France’ on Halloween\n \n\n   \n  In addition to meeting in person, Ali, Mahmoud, the juvenile and co-conspirators chatted online, sharing “extremist and ISIS-related materials that encourage attacks similar to what they planned,” the FBI agent wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Ali and the juvenile “discussed when to conduct their attack, which they appeared to set for Halloween,” the complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  The pair allegedly said they were going to do the “same thing as France,” the complaint says. And a conversation with a co-conspirator included mention of someone potentially going “to Paris for a 2015.”\n \n\n   \n  The agent took this to be a reference to the multifaceted terror rampage in France, which  killed at least 130 people in 2015 . ISIS claimed responsibility for those attacks.\n \n\n   \n  ISIS also claimed responsibility for a 2016 mass shooting in Orlando. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub, which was popular with the LGBTQ community,  killed 49 people .\n \n\n   \n  Ali, Mahmoud and the juvenile traveled to clubs in Ferndale, Michigan, the FBI complaint says.\n \n\n   \n  “All three of these clubs are located on Woodward Avenue near East Nine Mile,” the agent wrote. “Many of the clubs and bars in this area intentionally attract members of the LGBTQ+ community.”\n \n\n   \n    How a Halloween raid unfolded\n \n\n   \n  In the predawn hours of Halloween, residents of a quaint Michigan neighborhood were jolted awake by the blasts of detonated smoke bombs and a voice shouting in Arabic.\n \n\n   \n  “This is the FBI. We have a warrant. All residents inside … come out with nothing in your hands,” a man yelled before armed federal agents stormed the home in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after, FBI Director Kash Patel  boasted on X  the agency had “thwarted a potential terrorist attack” and arrested “multiple” people in Dearborn “allegedly plotting a violent attack over Halloween weekend.”\n \n\n   \n  Considered to be the heart of Arab America, Dearborn is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States and has frequently faced Islamophobic and hateful remarks.  Abdullah Hammoud , the son of Lebanese immigrants, became the first Arab American mayor of Dearborn when he was elected in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Members of the community, including neighbors and attorneys for the people taken into custody, say they are skeptical of the allegations.\n \n\n   \n  One of the neighbors is Laraib Irfan, who says his Dearborn community is a close-knit, peaceful place where everyone looks out for each other like family.\n \n\n   \n  Irfan was woken up Friday morning by his sister, telling him the FBI agents were outside. He heard two bangs he described as so loud they sounded like bombs and gunfire.\n \n\n   \n  He watched in shock as FBI agents surrounded the house two doors away from his. To his knowledge, the house was home to a family of seven – a mother, father and five sons.\n \n\n   \n  At the sound of the FBI’s command, the residents stepped out of their home with their hands behind their backs, Irfan said. For hours afterward, agents filed in and out, carrying materials to gather evidence, as Michigan State Police cordoned off the surrounding streets, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were arrested, and three others questioned, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told CNN on Friday; their ages range from 16 to no more than 29. Amir Makled, who represents Ali, told CNN on Sunday three people were arrested and two were questioned. CNN has reached out to the FBI for clarification.\n \n\n   \n  “We are confident that, once the facts are reviewed objectively, it will be clear there was never any planned ‘mass-casualty’ event or coordinated terror plot of any kind,” Makled told CNN before the criminal complaint was released.\n \n\n   \n  The two law enforcement sources told CNN about a reference to “pumpkin day,” an online chat about an ISIS-inspired attack and a shooting range visit to practice high-speed reloads with AK-47s.\n \n\n   \n  “The reality here involves a small group … with a lawful interest in recreational firearms, not a terrorist cell or organized attack. All firearms were legally obtained and registered,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  Attorney Hussein Bazzi, who said he is representing another suspect arrested in the raid, told CNN the “pumpkin” day reference may have been “online gamer chat that was misinterpreted.”\n \n\n   \n  The FBI told CNN it was conducting law enforcement activities in the cities of Dearborn and nearby Inkster, Michigan, but has not responded to CNN’s request for additional comment.    \n \n\n   \n  Patel’s initial X post applauded the FBI for “crushing our mission to defend the homeland,” yet he gave no explanation or evidence to support claims of a foiled terrorist plot.\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s curious to me,” Colin Clarke, a domestic terrorism and international security expert, told CNN prior to the release of the criminal complaint. “What it makes me think is that the plot wasn’t maybe as mature as they led people to believe.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke, executive director of the security research nonprofit The Soufan Center, says authorities may be holding back details to protect a potential prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re waiting to comment on it so they don’t go out and say anything that ends up hurting them in a court case,” said Clarke, who has no direct knowledge of the investigation. “Or there’s not much to this, the plot, there wasn’t much there.”\n \n\n   \n  Only time will reveal the full story, he said. The delay in charges often depends on how long the FBI has been tracking an alleged plot. His central concern, he added, is whether the claim the plot was inspired by ISIS has any basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Was there an actual ISIS operative communicating with these individuals, or were they just communicating with one another?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But for Dearborn’s community, the prolonged silence from authorities is raising serious concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “An allegation like this is dangerous to this community,” Makled said. “So when you have the national director of the FBI putting out a statement that there was a thwarted terrorist attack and then the news covers the raids of homes in the city of Dearborn, immediately the backlash on the internet is homegrown terrorist cell.”\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the raid posted on  Facebook  sparked bigoted comments: “A real shocker that they reside in Dearborn,” one person wrote. “Well, Dearborn does have a major Islamic population who aren’t exactly friendly to anyone else,” said another. Some accused the people in the home of being “sleeper cells.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Dearborn’s large Arab population, which makes up nearly half the city, makes it an easy target for Islamophobic, racist comments, the city has been ranked the second-safest large city in Michigan, according to the FBI’s  2024 annual crime report .\n \n\n   \n  “This community has been part of the state of Michigan for generations,” Makled, a Lebanese American and lifelong Dearborn resident, said. “They’re deeply ingrained in the American fabric here and this community, they’re sick and tired of being held to a different standard.”\n \n\n   \n  A neighbor, who asked to only be identified as “Ahmed,” said the people who lived in the home were kind, and he was not convinced the raid was based on credible suspicion.\n \n\n   \n  “You never hear anything from them, they are perfect, smiling, and I do not believe anything happened (from them), they are very good people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When asked about the FBI’s claim they stopped a terrorist plot, Ahmed interrupts and rejects the possibility completely: “No, no, no, no,” he says. “I don’t think so.”\n \n\n   \n  Another neighbor, Kathy Sisson, also speaks highly of her community; she says she’s disabled and her neighbors, who are from Brazil, Pakistan and Iraq, are constantly checking on her to make sure she’s OK.\n \n\n   \n  A person in the home where the FBI activity took place who did not want to share their name told CNN the people taken into custody “were just kids” and the situation was “being blown out of proportion and shouldn’t have happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Clarke warned against hasty conclusions but expressed skepticism that officials could credibly claim a foiled terrorist plot without clear, compelling evidence.\n \n\n   \n  “For the administration to come out and say they thwarted a plot, I feel like they (would need) stronger evidence than just a bunch of teenagers talking sh*t in a chat room,” Clarke said.\n \n\n   \n  Makled said his client’s mother has not stopped crying.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think that my client has stopped thinking or slept for one second since the moment he’s been taken into custody because of how deeply concerned he is about what the future is bringing,” he said. “He has no control in terms of what the federal government is going to say about him.”\n \n\n   \n    Muslim American communities are exhausted\n \n\n   \n  For many, the incident harks back to the post-9/11 era, when Arab Americans were routinely subjected to false stereotypes, covert surveillance, unequal restrictions and, all too often, threats from people who were violent and driven by hate.\n \n\n   \n  “I know what went on after 9/11 and how our Arab and Muslim communities felt after that,” Clarke said. “Of course they’re under the microscope, even with the New York City  mayor’s race , you see a lot of Islamophobia kind of rearing its head again. We just don’t know.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the attack on the Twin Towers in New York, the FBI has prevented  numerous  suspected terrorist attacks by running undercover operations, where agents say they have infiltrated extremist networks to catch people who would have committed crimes.\n \n\n   \n  However, Muslims have often borne the brunt of racialized state surveillance. Many were suspected of domestic terrorism, through everyday actions that were disproportionately scrutinized and subjected to FBI attention solely because of their faith, according to a  2018 study published in Critical Sociology  examining patterns of surveillance targeting Muslim communities.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to be targeted and always looked at with a sense of suspicion. Dearborn’s used to this,” Makled said. “This community doesn’t want to be held in that light of suspicion anymore, and it doesn’t deserve to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Michigan chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations criticized the FBI’s lack of transparency in the days after the arrests. Executive Director Dawud Walid stressed that, no matter what the investigation uncovers, Muslims in Dearborn and across the US do not owe anyone an apology for the actions of others.\n \n\n   \n  “People in the community are getting tired of this idea of collective guilt, or somehow we have to answer for the alleged actions of a couple of people,” Walid told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Makled urged the public to withhold judgment and wait for the results of the investigation before making assumptions about the community as additional details from the FBI are still pending.\n \n\n   \n  If Patel put out a statement prematurely, “I would demand an apology from the national director,” Makled said.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s how you create unity,” he added. “And that’s how you cure any error or harm that was caused by a mistake. This community is very forgiving, and we would accept that.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/michigan-terror-plot-arrests-key-questions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:37:00.000-05:00","title":"5 Key Questions About How Arrests in Michigan Terror Plot Went Down","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early November 2025, the FBI arrested two 20-year-old men, Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, in Michigan, alleging they were plotting an ISIS-inspired Halloween attack.

Lopez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:37 PM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  At 7:32 a.m. on Friday,  FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X  that his agency “thwarted a potential terrorist attack and arrested multiple subjects in Michigan.”\n \n\n   \n  “More details to come,” Patel said.\n \n\n   \n  Two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case told CNN about a cryptic reference to “pumpkin day,” online chats about an ISIS-inspired attack, and activity at a shooting range.\n \n\n   \n  The more details Patel promised ultimately arrived Monday in the form of a 73-page criminal complaint accusing Mohmed Ali and Majed Mahmoud of  plotting an ISIS-inspired Halloween attack in the US .\n \n\n   \n  Mahmoud’s attorney, William “Bill” Swor, told CNN his client and Ali are both 20 years old. He declined to provide additional details. CNN asked Ali’s attorney for comment after the criminal complaint was released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A detention hearing for both men is scheduled for November 10.\n \n\n   \n  CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller on Monday addressed five key questions related to the case.\n \n\n   \n   How atypical was the process here? The FBI director announces arrests on X, and three days later the details are released in the form of a criminal complaint. \n \n\n   \n  It’s not typical to announce a case before charges are filed. But there were a number of considerations here. When it seemed like the alleged attack was becoming   imminent, the FBI decided to move in on the suspects early. The social media post from the FBI director was likely his way of being transparent in a case where multiple high-profile FBI raids in a tight-knit community were definitely going to   leak out. He has said before he is the most transparent FBI director in the agency’s   history. His forward lean on these things is deliberate.\n \n\n   \n   What kind of complications can arise going forward when the FBI director goes public with the case so early? \n \n\n   \n  Just the kind we saw. The early announcement left the public with more questions than answers and allowed for a lot of speculation. They may have tried to compensate for that by the enormous amount of detail that they included in the 73-page public document released Monday  charging two men in the alleged plot. \n \n\n   \n   What did we learn from the criminal complaint that makes a case for prosecutors? \n \n\n   \n  We learned, according to the FBI, just how close we may have come to a horrific terrorist attack. The complaint tells us that these individuals have been using encrypted apps and chat groups to communicate for months. Talking about potential attacks, martyring themselves for ISIS. What the date of the attack should be, looking at potential targets. According to the complaint, the youngest member of the group, a 16-year-old boy, was the one who was pushing the hardest not to wait any longer, to do the attack on Halloween. We also learned from the complaint that they purchased multiple AR-15 rifles and a shotgun and equipped them with laser-pointed sights and flashlights to be able to pick out targets in the dark. They went to target practice in groups multiple times, according to the complaint. The lead agent in the FBI investigation believes that two trips they made just days before the arrest to look at a strip of nightclubs and bars were likely a reconnaissance mission, the complaint alleges, and the agent believed the targets under consideration were LGBTQ+ nightclubs.\n \n\n   \n   What did we not learn from the complaint that may be beneficial to the defense? \n \n\n   \n  We did not learn full details about the role of a “confidential human source” referred to in the complaint. This was likely an FBI informant, but there were also references to an FBI “undercover employee” who may have also been an agent. For the FBI, having two people on the inside providing information would give them a real advantage. From the defense standpoint, there is always the “agent provocateur” defense, that people not predisposed to this may have been entrapped into the plot. Well, that defense has been raised in many, many cases since 9/11. It has done much better on the courthouse steps in the lawyer’s press conferences than it has fared in court in front of a jury.\n \n\n   \n   What are next steps for investigators? \n \n\n   \n  There are two people charged in the federal complaint, and both are adults. So one question is, where is the 16-year-old who was such a high-profile driver of this   alleged plot? Is he cooperating? Is he charged in a separate document that is sealed because of his age? Or is he facing state charges in Michigan that may be coming later? Beyond that, the complaint describes other people involved in the conspiracy who have also not been charged. I think we can expect more arrests. This didn’t come together the way these things usually do. The FBI had to move quickly at the end of last week to prevent what they believed was then an imminent plot. So they will go over the evidence they gathered in the search warrants, what they find in the computers and on the phones, and what they learned by questioning these suspects after they were arrested in the early morning hours of Halloween. There’s definitely more to come.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/jeep-recall-hybrids-fire","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-05:00","title":"Stellantis Recalls 375,000 Jeep SUVs Over Fire Risks, Urges Owners to Park Outside","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Stellantis is recalling 375,000 plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee SUVs worldwide due to a fire risk linked to battery defects, particularly in models from 2020 to 2026.

But the plots and subplots are still important. And there will be plenty to learn from the results.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the  most significant contests  of Election Day 2025: races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, the New York City mayor’s race, a much-watched redistricting ballot measure in California, and key state Supreme Court retention elections in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  Below are some of my big questions today.\n \n\n   \n    1. Can Democrats show real momentum?\n \n\n   \n  The 2026 midterm elections pose a conundrum.\n \n\n   \n  On the one hand, President Donald Trump and many of his actions are quite unpopular. (A CNN poll this week showed his disapproval rating  hitting an all-time numerical high of 63% , in fact.) And presidents in that position usually lose big in midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  On the other hand, the Democratic brand is in the tank. And that’s called into question whether the party would be able to take full advantage of Trump’s problems. Its lead on the so-called generic ballot, for instance,  hasn’t been that convincing .\n \n\n   \n  The verdict this year has been strong for Democrats. They’ve  routinely overperformed by wide margins  in special elections and other races. But Tuesday’s elections should provide the best clues to date.\n \n\n   \n  The big question is whether Democrats continue to benefit from the kind of turnout advantage they’ve seen in those special elections, now that we’re getting into higher-turnout races.\n \n\n   \n  The CNN poll this week provided some encouraging signs for Democrats on that front.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, 67% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said they were “extremely” motivated to vote in the midterms, compared with just 46% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters.\n \n\n   \n  Also, the gap between voters who said they intended to vote to support the president (21%) and to oppose him (41%) was bigger than at any point since 2006. George W. Bush and the GOP got drubbed in those midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats definitely want to win the New Jersey and Virginia governor’s races. But that’s more of a baseline than anything.\n \n\n   \n  What they’d really love to see is their side turning out in huge numbers to send a message — and Republicans continuing to suffer the turnout problems they usually do when Trump isn’t on the ballot.\n \n\n   \n    2. Can Mamdani get close to 50?\n \n\n   \n  It would be a shock if the New York City mayor’s race resulted in anything other than a win for state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani. He’s led by double digits in most polls.\n \n\n   \n  But the forces trying to stop the 34-year-old democratic socialist are still throwing everything at the wall.\n \n\n   \n  Most recently, they’ve tossed a Hail Mary if there ever was one: Trump effectively endorsing his former nemesis, ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Cuomo actually leaning in on it. Trump on Monday night  urged supporters to back Cuomo  over Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani critics have been suggesting Sliwa drop out of the race for a long time, arguing he’s splitting the anti-Mamdani vote.\n \n\n   \n  The 50% mark is something of an artificial guidepost — even if Mamdani gets in the high 40s, it suggests Cuomo never really had a chance.  Polling  shows not all Sliwa supporters would have reverted to Cuomo in a two-man race.\n \n\n   \n    3. Do voters send a message about violent rhetoric?\n \n\n   \n  Even if it’s a good night for Democrats, that could come with a major and potentially significant exception: the Virginia attorney general’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Most polls there show a competitive race between Republican incumbent Jason Miyares and Democratic former state Delegate Jay Jones. And the reason is clear: Jones’ recently unearthed  violent text messages , in which he suggested a political opponent’s children should die.\n \n\n   \n  The polls signal there could be a sizeable gap between this race and the top of the ticket. A recent  Washington Post-Schar School poll  showed Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger leading the governor’s race by 12 points, but Jones in a tie with Miyares.\n \n\n   \n  If that gap shows up in the results — and especially if Jones loses — it would send a strong message about voters’ tolerance for violent rhetoric in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination and a number of other high-profile examples of political violence.\n \n\n   \n    4. Are there any shutdown impacts?\n \n\n   \n  The federal government shutdown is poised to become the longest in history on Wednesday, when it is set to enter its 36th day.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s been a relatively minor subplot in these races. And that includes in Virginia, which is home to many federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, we shouldn’t necessarily expect any major clues about how the shutdown is playing, politically.\n \n\n   \n  But the results  could still impact the shutdown moving forward .\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats underperform, for instance, they might start to fear they are overplaying their hands politically. And if they win big, they might feel emboldened to keep pushing the envelope and holding out for an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies they’ve been demanding.\n \n\n   \n  Polling shows Americans are more likely to blame the shutdown on Republicans than on Democrats, which has instilled Democrats with confidence in their strategy. Tuesday will test whether they feel like pressing forward.\n \n\n   \n    5. How do Newsom and Shapiro emerge?\n \n\n   \n  California’s Proposition 50 and the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court retention elections won’t get the attention of the more preeminent contests.\n \n\n   \n  But they’re worth watching for a number of reasons. And a big one is how they reflect on a pair of ambitious Democratic governors who are thought to be 2028 presidential contenders.\n \n\n   \n  In California, Proposition 50 is looking like a significant triumph for Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n \n\n   \n  Basically, Newsom launched the ballot initiative in response to Texas Republicans’ politically brazen effort to draw five new Republican-leaning congressional districts. Newsom wanted to offset that with new districts that favor Democrats in California.\n \n\n   \n  But he needed voters’ consent to do it. And that looked  potentially dicey , given he was effectively asking for permission to gerrymander.\n \n\n   \n  It looks like the bet paid off, given Republicans seem to have thrown in the towel on trying to defeat the measure. The situation also helped put Newsom center stage nationally in the process. If Prop 50 can rack up a huge margin of victory, all the better for him.\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, Shapiro has  invested significant political capital  in trying to get voters to grant new 10-year terms to a trio of Democratic state Supreme Court justices. Such “retention” votes almost always succeed, but Republicans have fought hard to defeat the justices.  Trump even weighed in  this week.\n \n\n   \n  There’s probably more downside than anything in this for Shapiro, given how unusual it would be for justices to lose the retention votes. But again, the margins are worth watching.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/climate/climate-target-overshoot-united-nations-global-temperature","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"09:49:00-05:00","title":"World will overshoot 1.5 degree climate goal, UN says","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that the world is on track to exceed the 1.5°C temperature rise goal of the Paris Agreement within the next decade due to insufficient global action on greenhouse gas emissions.

    \nUpdated: \n        9:49 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: Reuters\n \n   \n  The world has failed to meet its main climate change target of limiting the rise in global temperatures  to 1.5 degrees Celsius , and will likely breach this threshold in the next decade, the United Nations’ Environment Programme said on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The annual Emissions Gap report said because of countries’ slow action to reduce planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions, it was now clear that the world would exceed the core target of the 2015 Paris Agreement — at least temporarily.\n \n\n   \n  “This will be difficult to reverse – requiring faster and bigger additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to minimize overshoot,” UNEP said.\n \n\n   \n  Lead report author Anne Olhoff said deep emissions cuts now could delay when the overshoot happens, “but we can no longer totally avoid it.”\n \n\n   \n  The 2015 Paris Agreement commits countries to limit the global average temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Yet governments’ latest pledges to cut emissions in future, if met, would see the world face 2.3 to 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming, UNEP said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s around 0.3 degrees Celsius less warming than the UN’s projection a year ago — indicating that new climate pollution-cutting plans announced this year by countries including top CO2 emitter China have failed to substantially close the gap.\n \n\n   \n  China pledged in September to cut emissions by 7-10% from their peak by 2035.  Analysts  note the country tends to set modest targets and exceed them.\n \n\n   \n  The findings add pressure to the UN’s COP30 climate summit this month, where countries will debate how to kick-start and finance faster action to rein in global warming.\n \n\n   \n  The Paris Agreement temperature goals were based on scientific assessments of how each increment of global warming fuels worse heatwaves, droughts and wildfires. For example, 2 degrees of warming would more than double the share of the population exposed to extreme heat, compared with 1.5 degrees . Warming of 1.5 degrees would destroy at least 70% of coral reefs, versus 99% at 2 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Current policies — the ones countries already have in place — would lead to even more warming, of around 2.8 degrees, UNEP said.\n \n\n   \n  The world has made some progress. A decade ago, when the Paris Agreement was signed, the planet was on course for around a 4 degree temperature rise.\n \n\n   \n  But heat-trapping carbon emissions continue to rise, as countries burn coal, oil and gas to power their economies.\n \n\n   \n  Global greenhouse gas emissions increased by 2.3% in 2024, UNEP said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/food/dennys-private-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"10:18:00.000Z","title":"Denny’s is being taken private and Pizza Hut may be for sale","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Denny’s, a 72-year-old diner chain, is being taken private in a $322 million deal with private equity firm TriArtisan Capital Advisors and major franchisee Yadav Enterprises, ending its nearly six-decade run on the public stock market.

Chang’s, and Yadav Enterprises, a major Denny’s franchisee, in a $322 million deal (excluding its substantial debt load).\n \n\n   \n  Denny’s board approved the deal. If accepted by shareholders, Denny’s stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq, ending a nearly six-decade run on the public stock market.\n \n\n   \n  Shares jumped 50% in early trading Tuesday. Prior to Tuesday, the stock had lost about a third of its value this year.\n \n\n   \n  Denny’s had reached out to more than 40 potential buyers and received multiple offers, but decided that this transaction “maximizes value and has determined it is fair to and in the best interests of stockholders and represents the best path forward for the company,” CEO Kelli Valade said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Denny’s recent  struggles began during the pandemic . One of its main selling points was being open 24/7. However, that requirement temporarily ended during the height of pandemic. Since 2021, about a quarter of its roughly 1,600 restaurants have not returned to those around-the-clock hours, so Denny’s eased up on the requirement for a franchise to do so.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also facing competition for cash-strapped customers from rapidly growing chains like First Watch,  fast food competitors  or people opting to eat at home in a bid to save money.\n \n\n   \n  Denny’s also  announced 180 closures  over the last two years, with the chain attempting a turnaround plan that involves remodels and new menu items to jumpstart traffic.\n \n\n   \n  Sales at locations open at least a year declined 2.9% in the most recent quarter and it only completed 10 remodels, Denny’s also  reported  late Monday.\n \n\n   \n    Pizza Hut for sale?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Yum! Brands announced it launched a “formal review of strategic options” for Pizza Hut, including a possible sale for the chain that was once owned by PepsiCo.\n \n\n   \n  “The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut’s performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum! Brands,” said Chris Turner, CEO of Yum! Brands, in a press release.\n \n\n   \n  The chain has struggled against  Domino’s , which recently reported another strong quarter of sales, and Papa John’s. Pizza Hut, meanwhile, has struggled for the past several quarters and is  attempting to juice sales  with new value-driven menu items that haven’t taken hold.\n \n\n   \n  The parent company didn’t set a deadline for the completion of the review and won’t comment further.\n \n\n   \n  Yum! reported earnings Tuesday, with Pizza Hut recording a stunning 6% drop in same-store sales at its US restaurants opened at least a year.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Yum’s other brands fared better. Taco Bell had another high-flying quarter with a 7% increase in US same-store sales and KFC is perhaps starting to experience a turnaround, posting a 2% rise for the quarter ending on September 30.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/middleeast/major-general-tomer-yerushalmi-israel-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"11:28:00-04:00","title":"A leaked video, a frantic search, and the top military lawyer: What to know about the scandal rocking Israel","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A leaked video showing alleged sexual abuse of a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman military prison in Israel ignited a national scandal in 2024.

Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was the  Israeli  military’s top lawyer, tasked with enforcing the rule of law within the nation’s armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  Now, she is under arrest as part of a criminal investigation into the leak of a video showing the alleged abuse, including sexual abuse, of Palestinian detainees in a  notorious Israeli military prison .\n \n\n   \n  A longstanding target of Israel’s right-wing, Tomer-Yerushalmi’s rapid fall has quickly emerged as a national scandal, overshadowing the video at the center of the case.\n \n\n   \n  The affair dates back to July 2024, when legal authorities in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) opened an investigation into soldiers who were allegedly shown sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee arrested during the Gaza war as some two dozen other detainees lay face-down nearby at the Sde Teiman military prison.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation and subsequent arrest of the soldiers fueled an intense political backlash, with some right-wing members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition even joining protests and riots outside the Sde Teiman facility and the military court where the soldiers were taken.\n \n\n   \n  The video was first aired by Israel’s Channel 12 in August 2024, but it wasn’t the first report to raise concerns about conditions at the base. In May 2024, CNN spoke to  three whistleblowers who detailed allegations of abuse  at Sde Teiman. A month later, Israel said it would begin phasing out the facility.\n \n\n   \n  But that did little to dull the vitriol targeting the military’s top lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, Tomer-Yerushalmi was suspended from her role as military advocate-general, as Israel’s Attorney General Gali Baharav‑Miara announced a criminal investigation into the leak. Two days later, Tomer-Yerushalmi submitted her resignation letter, acknowledging that she approved the release of the video and taking “full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from within the unit.”\n \n\n   \n  She wrote in her letter that an “incitement campaign” against her had reached its peak following the decision to investigate soldiers at Sde Teiman. “This campaign continues to this very day and causes deep and serious harm to the IDF, to its image, and to the resilience of IDF soldiers and their commanders,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “There are things that cannot be done even against the worst of the detainees,” she wrote. “Officers of the (legal) unit have faced repeated personal attacks, harsh insults, and even real threats. All of this because they stood guard over the rule of law in the IDF – together with the commanders and alongside them.”\n \n\n   \n  For Israel’s right-wing political echelon, the resignation and investigation weren’t enough. Hours after Tomer-Yerushalmi stepped down, Defense Minister Israel Katz said he would take “all necessary sanctions against her,” including stripping her of her rank. Katz, who issued no fewer than seven statements against the chief military attorney in less than a week, accused her of involvement in a “blood libel” against the soldiers, even though the veracity of the video has not been questioned, and five soldiers were indicted in February 2025 for the abuse of the detainee. They have denied wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Worst PR disaster’ for Israel\n \n\n   \n  Netanyahu called the leak “an enormous reputational blow,” describing it on Sunday as “the worst PR disaster in Israel’s history.”\n \n\n   \n  National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir dubbed the lawyer’s conduct “criminal behavior under a legal guise” and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the leak.\n \n\n   \n  Then, Tomer-Yerushalmi went missing.\n \n\n   \n  For several hours on Sunday, the Israeli military and police were unable to locate the woman who had, until just days earlier, been the top lawyer for the country’s armed forces. The IDF said in a statement that it would “employ all means available” to locate her “as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  After an extensive search, she was found on a beach north of Tel Aviv.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday evening, police arrested Tomer-Yerushalmi on suspicion of multiple offenses: fraud and breach of trust, abuse of official power, obstruction of justice, and disclosure of information by a public official.\n \n\n   \n  She has not been formally charged yet or entered a plea. Her next hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. A lawyer representing Tomer-Yerushalmi declined to comment on the case.\n \n\n   \n  Tomer-Yerushalmi is also suspected of allegedly misleading the High Court of Justice, and senior military and justice officials, about the leak of the footage and even submitting a false affidavit to the court. Alongside Tomer-Yerushalmi, other senior legal officials in the military prosecutor’s office are also implicated in the leak and its alleged cover-up. According to the police, there are five suspects in the investigation.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Palestinian detainee at the center of the alleged abuse has been returned to Gaza as part of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement, raising questions about the prospects of an effective prosecution of the soldiers accused in the case since the alleged victim is not available to testify.\n \n\n   \n  The affair has become a part of a larger attack on Israel’s judiciary from Netanyahu’s coalition.   Justice Minister Yariv Levin is attempting to bar Baharav-Miara – also a  frequent target  of the right wing – from probing the leak, suggesting the attorney general’s own involvement in the case should also be examined. “Anyone involved in conflicts of interest will not be part of the investigation,” Levin insisted in a statement last week.\n \n\n   \n  “The lies that have been built here over the years, while trampling on the rights of entire populations and severely harming the security of the state and IDF soldiers, are gradually falling apart,” said Levin. “One group that has gotten used to treating the country as its own is being replaced.”\n \n\n   \n  Baharav-Miara’s office responded in a letter, saying Levin was trying to “unlawfully interfere” with the investigative process, which “impedes its progress.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/sport/tennis-sabalenka-kyrgios-battle-of-the-sexes-match","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"09:18:00-05:00","title":"Aryna Sabalenka to play Nick Kyrgios in ‘Battle of the Sexes’ exhibition match","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Aryna Sabalenka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, will play Nick Kyrgios in a 'Battle of the Sexes' exhibition match in Dubai on December 28, 2025, borrowing the name from the historic 1973 match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs.

In fact, some have grown so popular that they’ve become tourist attractions in their own right.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s CNN Travel’s rundown of some of the top Christmas markets taking place around the world this year:\n \n\n   \n    Wiener Christkindlmarkt, Austria\n \n\n   \n  With a reindeer train, a giant Ferris wheel and a giant Advent wreath, Vienna’s magical spectacle encapsulates the festive spirit fantastically.\n \n\n   \n  Although the Austrian capital holds around 20 Christmas markets, Wiener Christkindlmarkt (or Rathausplatz) is one of its oldest and most traditional events.\n \n\n   \n  The event, also known as Viennese Dream Christmas Market, is held in front of City Hall and features a 110-square-meter children’s ice rink. The famous Tree of Hearts, a giant maple tree decked out with hundreds of glittering hearts, is a favorite with visitors and a great photo opportunity.\n \n\n   \n  Plenty of stalls   offer tasty treats such as Austrian sausages and gingerbread cookies, along with homemade Christmas punch.\n \n\n   \n   Wiener Christkindlmarkt  runs from November 14 to December 26.   The ice rink, or Ice Dream at the Christmas Market, will be open until January 6, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Basel Christmas Market, Switzerland\n \n\n   \n  It’s hard to find a destination that does Christmas better than Switzerland.\n \n\n   \n  Most Swiss towns are taken over by festive markets at this time of year, and the atmosphere is incredible. Basel Christmas Market is the biggest and arguably the best around.\n \n\n   \n  Separated into two sections, at Barfüsserplatz and Münsterplatz, it hosts around 150 decorated stalls selling everything from Christmas spices, decorations and candles.\n \n\n   \n  Family attractions include the Christmas fairytale forest at Münsterplatz with activities such as gingerbread and candle decorating, a star-making workshop and a puppet show.\n \n\n   \n  Attendees can take a walk up the stairwell of St. Martin’s tower for views of the lights illuminating the old town or sip on mulled wine at the  13-meter-high Christmas pyramid  on Barfüsserplatz.\n \n\n   \n   Basel Christmas Market  opens on November 27 and is scheduled to run until December 23. \n \n\n   \n    Strasbourg Christmas Market, France\n \n\n   \n  One of Europe’s oldest Christmas markets,  Strasbourg’s  began back in 1570, but has evolved considerably since then.\n \n\n   \n  Spread over more than 10 locations, the hugely popular market lights up the city with thousands of twinkling lights and festive ornaments.\n \n\n   \n  Drawing in over 2 million people a year, it features hundreds of wooden chalet stalls selling everything from decorations and presents to local Alsatian wine.\n \n\n   \n  Place Kleber is probably its most popular spot thanks to the Great Christmas Tree. But visitors will be treated to countless magical sights while wandering through the city’s narrow alleyways and pretty squares.\n \n\n   \n   Strasbourg Christmas Market  begins on November 26 and closes on December 24. \n \n\n   \n    Brussels Winter Wonders, Belgium\n \n\n   \n  Brussels really comes to life at Christmas time thanks to Winter Wonders, which is more akin to a festival than a market.\n \n\n   \n  One of Belgium’s biggest and most popular events, the annual extravaganza extends across the open spaces of the Bourse, Place de la Monnaie, Grand Place, Place Sainte Catherine and Marche aux Poissons.\n \n\n   \n  A light and sound show, ice skating and fairground rides are among the activities and places to enjoy. Visitors can also browse through about 200 chalets serving  glühwein  (mulled wine), Belgian beers and waffles while staring in wonder at the enormous Christmas tree in Grand Place.\n \n\n   \n   Brussels Winter Wonders  will run from November 28  to January 5. \n \n\n   \n    Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square Christmas markets, Prague, Czech Republic\n \n\n   \n  To say the city of Prague goes all out at Christmas is an understatement. The Czech capital is the very definition of a winter wonderland during the festive period.\n \n\n   \n  While there’s no shortage of markets throughout the city, the main ones can be found in Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Thankfully these spots are only a few minutes’ walk apart, so revelers can easily visit both in a day.\n \n\n   \n  Old Town Square provides entertainment in the form of live shows, dance performances and creative workshops. Wenceslas Square is great for handmade gifts and local treats such as klobasa (Czech sausage) and mulled wine.\n \n\n   \n   The markets will be open from November 29 to January 6, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Fira de Santa Llucia, Barcelona\n \n\n   \n  Dating from 1786, Fira de Santa Llucia has grown from a one-day event to commemorate the December 13 feast day of Santa Llucia to a three-week fair.\n \n\n   \n  Held right outside Barcelona Cathedral, the bustling market is separated into four sections.\n \n\n   \n  The first is Nativity and Figurines, where visitors can pick up decorations and models to create traditional Bethlehem manger scenes. The Greenery and Plants section is packed with both natural and artificial trees and, of course, plants.\n \n\n   \n  The Crafts section features handmade products and jewelry, while the Simbombes section is mainly made up of musical instruments.\n \n\n   \n  There are also many festive activities such as storytelling, a Christmas parade and the  Caga Tió , an enormous, piñata-style Christmas log that spills out candy and gifts when beaten with a stick.\n \n\n   \n   Fira de Santa Llucia  2025 dates TBC \n \n\n   \n    I Mercati Natale, Piazza Santa Croce, Florence\n \n\n   \n  There’s much to see at this enchanting market, but nothing can top the beautiful backdrop supplied by Santa Croce’s Franciscan Basilica.\n \n\n   \n  Although this traditional fair, also known as Weihnachtsmarkt, is based on German street markets, it’s a very Italian affair in many ways thanks to the scenery and the many local treats, such as panforte, for sale.\n \n\n   \n  However, there’s certainly no shortage of gingerbread, strudel and traditional Heidelberg Lebkuchen cookies.\n \n\n   \n  Those who take a walk to the nearby Piazza del Duomo will be treated to a magnificent nativity scene, as well as an impressive Christmas tree that’s lit up ahead of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8.\n \n\n   \n   I Mercati Natale  begins on November 15 and runs to December 24. \n \n\n   \n    Advent in Zagreb, Croatia\n \n\n   \n  It’s easy to see why Zagreb was voted the “best Christmas market destination” in travel portal European Best Destinations’ online poll for three consecutive years.\n \n\n   \n  Made up of around 25 Christmas markets spread across the Croatian capital, Advent in Zagreb is a magical sight.\n \n\n   \n  Think live Nativity scenes, ice sculpture carvings, outdoor gigs, pop-up bars and a Christmas tram complete with Santa and his elves.\n \n\n   \n  Advent in Zagreb also has an area devoted to “fooling around” (or “fuliranje”) where you’ll find delighted revelers dancing in the street while eating street food and listening to live entertainment.\n \n\n   \n   Advent in Zagreb 2025  is scheduled to run from November 29 to January 7. \n \n\n   \n    Christmas in Tivoli, Copenhagen, Denmark\n \n\n   \n  Visited several times by Walt Disney before he developed Disneyland, this Danish amusement park and pleasure garden is a dazzling place to visit any time of year.\n \n\n   \n  But you’ll struggle to find anywhere as enchanting as Tivoli Gardens during the festive period.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 1,000 beautifully decorated Christmas trees adorning the beautiful grounds, and everything from fairground rides to a traditional Pixie Band for entertainment, it’s a winter experience like no other.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s line up of activities also includes a magical light installation of luminous “fireworks.”\n \n\n   \n  The annual Lucia procession on December 13, where more than 100 girls process through the gardens carrying candles and singing to mark St. Lucia’s Day, is a particular highlight, along with the firework displays that take place between December 25 and 26, as well as New Year’s Eve.\n \n\n   \n   Christmas in Tivoli  is taking place from November 14 to January 4. \n \n\n   \n    Tallinn Christmas Market, Estonia\n \n\n   \n  The Estonian capital’s annual affair is one of the more modern European Christmas markets.\n \n\n   \n  Set inside Tallinn’s Town Hall Square, it’s packed full of stalls with traditional Estonian cuisine, artisan bread and handicrafts for sale.\n \n\n   \n  On the entertainment front, there are carousels, a winter grotto and a Santa who rolls up on a sleigh complete with reindeer.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors are also treated to performances by dance troupes and choirs.\n \n\n   \n  But as with many such markets, the Christmas tree is the main event. Tallinn’s tree has been displayed here since 1441.\n \n\n   \n   Tallinn Christmas Market 2025  is due to take place from November 21 to December 28. \n \n\n   \n    Skansen’s Christmas Market, Stockholm\n \n\n   \n  Stockholm isn’t exactly lacking when it comes to Christmas markets, but none are more traditional than Skansen.\n \n\n   \n  Set on the island of Djurgarden in the world’s oldest open-air museum, it’s a wonderful exhibit of Swedish culture with some added yuletide magic.\n \n\n   \n  The historical houses on display in the museum are decked out in colorful decorations for the occasion, and all the tables inside are set up for Christmas dinner.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors can join the dancing games around the tree at Bollnäs Square, Skansen’s main site.\n \n\n   \n   Skansen’s Christmas Market  is open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from November 28 until December 21. \n \n\n   \n    Tuomaan Markkinat, Helsinki\n \n\n   \n  This wonderfully Nordic Christmas market is held in Helsinki’s Senate Square, near the Emperor Alexander II statue.\n \n\n   \n  Tuomaan Markkinat’s centerpiece is a vintage carousel, but the countless vendors selling traditional Christmas delicacies,  glögi  (Finland’s take on mulled wine) and handicrafts are also a big draw.\n \n\n   \n  Younger attendees can visit Santa Claus, who has his own wooden cabin here, and join festive activities such as Christmas cookie decorating. The market’s food court is particularly impressive with a host of top eateries from which to choose.\n \n\n   \n   Tuomaan Markkinat  is set to run from November 28 to December 22, 2025.  \n \n\n   \n    St. Stephen’s Basilica and Vörösmarty Square markets, Budapest, Hungary\n \n\n   \n  Budapest has two main festive markets: St. Stephen’s Basilica Christmas market, or  Advent Bazilika , and Vörösmarty Square Christmas market.\n \n\n   \n  The former takes place in front of the famous basilica, where crowds gather to watch the regular 3D light shows that are projected onto its facade. In addition, there are around 150 stalls with vendors selling sweet treats, wine and arts and crafts.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Vörösmarty Square market is positioned in the heart of the city and attracts more than 800,000 visitors annually.\n \n\n   \n  Its main highlight is usually a giant Advent calendar that reveals a new window display on a daily basis from December 1 to 23, although the  Hungarian foods that line its stalls — langos and chimney cake — are also particular standouts.\n \n\n   \n   Advent Bazilika opens on November 14 and runs to January 1. \n \n\n   \n   The Vörösmarty   Square Christmas market will open on November 14 and close on December 31. \n \n\n   \n    Christkindlesmarkt and Gendarmenmarkt, Germany\n \n\n   \n  Open-air winter street markets have long been associated with Germany, and the European country is home to some of the oldest and most visited festive markets.\n \n\n   \n  Capital city Berlin has around 80 of them, but Gendarmenmark is perhaps its most renowned.\n \n\n   \n  Positioned between the Franzosischer Dom and Deutscher Dom, it’s a maze of wooden huts with bratwurst, mulled wine and ginger bread for sale, along with special Christmas gifts. Visitors can enjoy nightly concerts with dance and musical performances.\n \n\n   \n  In Nuremberg, Bavaria’s second-largest city, the famous Christkindlesmarkt has been around since the 16th century. During the Christmas period, around 200 stalls are erected in the city’s central market square, and the whole area is abuzz with activity.\n \n\n   \n  The market usually draws in around 2 million people every year and is undoubtedly one of Nuremberg’s annual highlights.\n \n\n   \n   Nuremberg Christkindlesmarkt 202 5  kicks off on November 28 and ends on December 24. \n \n\n   \n   Gendarmenmarkt   opens on November 24 and is set to close on December 31 .\n \n\n   \n    Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, London\n \n\n   \n  Hyde Park Winter Wonderland is one of the most highly anticipated winter events in the UK capital.\n \n\n   \n  The festive favorite, which began in 2005, brings in huge crowds every year thanks to its 200-plus fairground rides, including a 70-meter-high big wheel, mulled wine stations and an outdoor skating rink.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors can also join ice sculpting workshops, watch a circus show, listen to live music at the lively Fire Pit bar or tuck into some of the many foods on offer at the Street Food Village.\n \n\n   \n   Hyde Park Winter Wonderland  is scheduled to open on November 14 and will continue until January 1, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Edinburgh at Christmas, Scotland\n \n\n   \n  From an ice rink to immersive light displays, the Scottish capital’s historic city center is abuzz with festive markets and attractions throughout winter.\n \n\n   \n  Over in popular urban park East Princes Street Garden, there’s a traditional Christmas market with up to 70 stalls, a Ferris wheel and an 80-meter star flyer fairground ride — the world’s largest transportable star flyer.\n \n\n   \n  Revelers are treated to spectacular views of the iconic Scott Monument, along with Edinburgh Castle, where the after-dark Castle of Light attraction will be held from late November to early January.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, a Christmas tree maze can be found at St. Andrew Square Garden and new attraction, the Ice Queen’s Castle, which features ice carvings and wall etchings, will be erected on George Street, one of the city’s top shopping spots.\n \n\n   \n   The Christmas market at East Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh’s main festive market, will be open from November 15 until January 4, 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Krakow Christmas Market, Poland\n \n\n   \n  Stretched across a huge section of Rynek Glowny, the Polish city’s central square, Krakow Christmas Market is among the largest in Europe.\n \n\n   \n  Historic landmark St. Mary’s Basilica serves as a stunning backdrop to the yearly event, which has been around since the early 14th century, as does the Renaissance Cloth Hall.\n \n\n   \n  Revelers can tuck into Polish delicacies such as  kiełbasa  (sausage), shop for handcrafted gifts or treats and take in live music from folk bands and carol singers.\n \n\n   \n  The market usually hosts a competition in which participants, including schoolchildren and local artists, create small Nativity scenes, or cribs. They are displayed at the statue of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, situated in the square, before a winner is chosen.\n \n\n   \n   Krakow Christmas Market  will be held from November 28 to January 1 2026. \n \n\n   \n    Bratislava Christmas Fair, Slovakia\n \n\n   \n  Dotted across various locations around the Slovakian capital, including the Main Square and Franciscan Square, the Bratislava Christmas Fair is a  magical affair.\n \n\n   \n  With stalls selling everything from mulled wine to traditional delicacies, a huge Christmas tree and live performances, the annual market showcases some of the best traditions of the Slovakian Christmas season.\n \n\n   \n  While there are various ways to reach the main event, a ride on the free Christmas tram, which runs through the city center throughout the festive period, is probably the most fun method.\n \n\n   \n   Bratislava Christmas Fair  will be held from November 27 to January 6. \n \n\n   \n    Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay, Singapore\n \n\n   \n  Now in its 12th year, Singapore’s Christmas Wonderland is continuing to grow in popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Staged at the famous Gardens by the Bay nature park, the event lasts around four weeks and covers more than 27,000 square meters.\n \n\n   \n  Packed with attractions, it features fairground rides, a Christmas train, light and sound shows, carnival games and live performances.\n \n\n   \n   Christmas Wonderland at Gardens by the Bay   opens on November 29 and closes on January 1. \n \n\n   \n    The Distillery Winter Village, Toronto\n \n\n   \n  Formerly known as the Toronto Christmas Market, the Distillery Winter Village is an intimate and charming take on the traditional European festive market.\n \n\n   \n  Held in the historic Distillery District, it features outdoor shopping cabins and food vendors, Christmas carol sing-a-longs, and a special village inspired by “Bad Hats’ Narnia,” an adaptation of C.S.

described as his “proudest moment.”\n \n\n   \n  The former England soccer captain accepted the knighthood for his services to sport and charity on Tuesday at a ceremony at Windsor Castle, where Japanese-British author and screenwriter Kazuo Ishiguro, and West End and Broadway star Elaine Paige also received honors.\n \n\n   \n  Beckham was named earlier this year in the King’s Birthday Honours list.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been very obviously lucky in my career to have won what I’ve won and done what I’ve done but to receive an honor like this, of a knight, is beyond anything that I ever thought that I would receive,” Beckham told Britain’s PA Media news agency after the ceremony.\n \n\n   \n  “To be honest, a young boy from the east end of London, born in Leytonstone, and here at Windsor Castle, being honored by His Majesty the King – the most important and the most respected institution in the world – it’s quite a moment,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Beckham was accompanied by his wife, Victoria, who made the suit he wore to accept the award.\n \n\n   \n  The father-of-four said the King had “inspired quite a few” of his looks over the years. “I looked at old pictures of him when he was quite young in morning suits and I was like, ‘OK, that’s what I want to wear,’ so I gave it to my wife and she did it.”\n \n\n   \n  He added that King Charles “was quite impressed” with his suit.\n \n\n   \n  The honor comes more than two decades after the 50-year-old, who represented England in 115 international games and won league titles in four different countries, was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II.\n \n\n   \n  Beckham, who retired from professional soccer in 2013, is also a UNICEF goodwill ambassador. In 2015, he launched  the “7” fund  to support children at risk of dangers such as the Ebola crisis – a fund named after the number on his Manchester United shirt.\n \n\n   \n  He made a notable return to soccer in 2018 when he was  awarded a Major League Soccer franchise  in Miami, Florida, and went on to form the football club  Inter Miami .\n \n\n   \n  Beckham has a good working relationship with King Charles, having  exchanged “beekeeping tips”  in the Cotswolds, England, last year, when he became an ambassador for The King’s Foundation.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Max Foster contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/climate/un-climate-summit-cop30-brazil-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"How the US could shape the COP30 climate summit without even being there","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is not sending a high-level delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, and has publicly stated it will not participate, signaling a major withdrawal from international climate negotiations.

could shape the COP30 climate summit without even being there \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration does not intend to send a high-level delegation to the  COP30 climate summit  — or possibly any delegation at all. But that doesn’t mean the country’s influence won’t be felt at the talks.\n \n\n   \n  As nations prepare to gather in Belém, Brazil, for the negotiations, which begin on Thursday with the leaders summit, the US is set to play the part of the elephant in the room. Even operating from afar, the US could have the power to blow up a deal in Belém. The Trump administration has recently taken aggressive stances to try to influence other countries’ climate policies, mainly by threatening hostile trade measures.\n \n\n   \n  The US   has estranged itself   from official international climate negotiation processes while simultaneously exerting pressure on trading partners to water down or reject climate commitments. This paradox could have an impact on COP30, experts tell CNN.\n \n\n   \n  It is not known whether the US will simply ignore COP or try to intervene to secure preferred outcomes.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has publicly criticized the COP process and stated it does not plan to participate. “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The US will not send any high-level representatives to COP30, Rogers said. “The President is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  This practice of linking trade and climate so closely is an innovation of the Trump administration, said Kelly Sims Gallagher, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University who worked on US climate negotiations with China for the Obama administration.\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of US leadership, she said that China, which is the world’s top emitter, may seek to assume more of a prominent, steering role at the talks. The European Union is also likely to take a strong role, though internal rifts have emerged within the EU regarding how aggressively to cut its own emissions.\n \n\n   \n    Weakening resolve\n \n\n   \n  Other countries have not followed the US out of the Paris Agreement, but the abrupt shifts in policy in Washington have affected the global mood. An administration that now heavily favors fossil fuels over renewables has reduced the incentives for other countries to submit ambitious plans for cutting emissions through 2035, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  These plans were supposed to be delivered by virtually every country in the world in the run up to COP30. However, only about 60 countries delivered theirs to the UN on time, and the actions they outline fall far short of achieving the temperature targets contained in the Paris Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there’s an undeniable fact, which is that with the US withdrawal for a second time, it’s definitely seeming to undermine ambition,” Gallagher said. “I think it’s just getting harder to make the case that global ambition is going to rise without pretty substantial engagement from the United States,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  And now, instead of constructive engagement or simply disengagement, America has demonstrated a trend toward behavior that undermines aggressive climate goals. This was the case last month at a  meeting of the International Maritime Organization  (IMO), which regulates pollution from the international shipping fleet, where US diplomats acted in concert with major oil-producing nations to scuttle what would have been the world’s first carbon tax.\n \n\n   \n  The long-heralded proposal would have imposed a tax on carbon pollution from global shipping to encourage a switch to cleaner-burning fuels. Officials in Washington — including President Donald Trump who  released a scathing Truth Social post  — were involved in turning up the pressure on diplomats at that meeting. The US threatened to retaliate via trade measures against countries who voted in favor. Neither Gallagher nor other experts expect similarly disruptive behavior from the US during COP30, but they couldn’t rule it out, either.\n \n\n   \n  However, Kaveh Guilanpour of the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, for one, thinks any US intervention would be less effective at COP30 than it was at the shipping meeting.\n \n\n   \n  “The rest of the world continues to be committed to the Paris Agreement. Countries realize that it is ultimately in their long-term interest that the Paris Agreement succeeds,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “The situation [with the global carbon tax] is very different from that of the Paris Agreement,” he said. “There was a very specific normative proposal under the IMO that the US pushed back against. Negotiations under the Paris Agreement, on the other hand, are largely over. It is now about implementing promises already made.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite those differences, the IMO episode is an example of the US prioritizing its own trade interests over global interests to cut planet-warming pollution. Gallagher said it’s possible that the Trump administration will again seek to disrupt negotiations, from the sidelines of COP30. Only this time, the point of contention would likely be climate finance :  Funding climate adaptation and renewable energy in the developing world is a big topic at COP30.\n \n\n   \n  America’s options for swaying the negotiations themselves, however, are ironically limited, she said, because of the Paris withdrawal and lack of attendance.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s very little that the Trump administration could do in Brazil,” Gallagher said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/africa/sudan-un-secretary-general-guterres-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:36:00-05:00","title":"UN Secretary-General Warns That War in Sudan Is 'Spiraling Out of Control'","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres, issued a stark warning in Qatar that the war in Sudan is spiraling out of control after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized El Fasher in the Darfur region.

It’s the same mistake that haunted Biden \n       \n  Analysis by David Goldman, Matt Egan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:19 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  “We have no inflation,” President Donald Trump said in his  “60 Minutes” interview  Sunday evening. “Our groceries are down.”\n \n\n   \n  And with  those two false claims , Trump is repeating a political mistake that haunted his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and contributed to the Democrats losing the White House: Trump appears to be denying the economic reality that people are experiencing﻿ in their everyday lives.\n \n\n   \n  Whether or not Trump is making a similar political miscalculation remains to be seen. Today’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City could serve as an indication.\n \n\n   \n  Inflation is far from the crisis levels of the Biden years, but it never went away. And inflation is on the rebound again, rising in September to the highest annual rate since January in part because of the president’s tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  Grocery prices aren’t down, either – they’re up across all major product categories, rising 1.4% since Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n \n\n   \n  Denying that reality is a tough sell to Americans, many of whom seriously hate this economy, mainly because they feel those higher prices every time they go to the store.\n \n\n   \n  A new  CNN poll conducted by SSRS  showed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the country.\n \n\n   \n  Biden  polled miserably on the economy , too.\n \n\n   \n  In June 2022, as millions of Americans were grappling with the highest gas price of their lifetimes and inflation hit a four-decade high, Biden highlighted strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, here’s where we are. We have the fastest growing economy in the world,” Biden said on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,”  a claim that CNN later deemed false .\n \n\n   \n  Biden conceded that inflation is “the bane of our existence,” but downplayed it by saying it’s “mostly in food, and in gasoline.”\n \n\n   \n  That dismissiveness probably hurt the Democrats in last year’s election, considering Americans in 2024 said affordability was their chief concern. Even if inflation was falling, prices were still rising – just more slowly, and from painfully high levels. So voters weren’t exactly swayed by the Biden administration’s frequent statements that the  economy was on fire .\n \n\n   \n  “Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% — the lowest in the world and trending lower,” Biden  said  during his 2024 State of the Union address. “It takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.”\n \n\n   \n  Voters didn’t buy it. Biden’s speech dismissed the cumulative effect of rising prices that voters were living through.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tactics aren’t exactly  Biden’s . In 2023 and 2024, Biden correctly argued that price hikes were slowing. And when Biden acknowledged high prices, he typically tried to assign blame to corporations, lambasting “ greedflation ” and “shrinkflation.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump is just straight-up doling out untruths – and  blaming Biden .\n \n\n   \n  But either way, the effect may be the same. Americans don’t take kindly to politicians who refuse to see voters’ lived experiences – especially when they’re smacked in the face with high prices on every supermarket trip.\n \n\n   \n    Acknowledging reality\n \n\n   \n  Interestingly, Trump identified Biden’s flaw, and he and his campaign frequently criticized the former president for failing to sufficiently acknowledge the pain inflation had inflicted on Americans. Trump at campaign stops would sometimes pose with groceries, commenting on how unaffordable they had become.\n \n\n   \n  The consequence of becoming president, of course, is that those inherited problems  quickly became Trump’s . But blaming Biden or denying reality doesn’t seem to be working. Trump is already starting to shoulder much of the blame for the bad economic vibes: About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump’s policies have worsened US economic conditions, according to CNN’s poll.\n \n\n   \n  Americans aren’t just kvetching about high prices; they’re (not) putting their money where their mouths are, and they’re changing their behavior.  Chipotle, Coke, Crocs  and other consumer brands said during earnings calls with Wall Street analysts last month that middle-class and lower-income customers are closing their wallets.\n \n\n   \n  Despite a still-robust economy, on paper anyway, lackluster hiring is adding to Americans’ frayed nerves, as is the erosion of federal safety-net benefits.  Loan defaults  and delinquencies are on the rise again among some of America’s most vulnerable.\n \n\n   \n    Inflation’s snowball effect\n \n\n   \n  The problem with inflation is that it’s cumulative. There is a snowballing effect from years of price hikes – even if those price increases are smaller today than under Biden after the pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  The typical American household is spending $208 more per month to buy the same goods and services as they were in September 2024, according to Moody’s Analytics data based on the most recent inflation report. Keep in mind that in September 2024, Trump was on the campaign trail claiming inflation was out of control.\n \n\n   \n  Zooming out further, Moody’s found that due to inflation, the typical household is spending $1,043 more per month than they did at the start of 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In other words, to buy the same amount of stuff that Americans purchased four years ago, they ne﻿ed to spend $1,000 more of their paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week explained why Americans don’t care about metrics that politicians like to cite, including strong spending or gross domestic product booms.\n \n\n   \n  “Consumers are not interested in that story,” Powell said in a media briefing Wednesday. “Their prices are higher. More than that, the reason they are so unhappy about inflation is the inflation we had in 2021, 2022 and 2023. You can say prices aren’t going up as much, but that doesn’t mean that people aren’t feeling those higher prices from the inflation we had two or three years ago.

of war. Now in the US, he’s looking for a way forward \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:11 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Motaz Azaiza has witnessed the horrors of war. Now he’s trying to restore his faith in humanity. For 107 days, he was a photojournalist on the front lines of a warzone in his own familiar neighborhoods, documenting the carnage wrought by relentless Israeli airstrikes in such raw and unedited detail that it was impossible to ignore.\n \n\n   \n  Since mainstream news organizations were unable to film inside Gaza, Azaiza, like other Palestinian journalists in the strip, recorded the early days of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past two years, more than 68,000 people have been killed, according to local health officials in the enclave, and with over 90% of the residential buildings destroyed, most of the population has been internally displaced.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza knows that he’s lucky to be alive. “My life is worth more now than if I was dead,” he told CNN earlier this month. “A lot of Gazans got killed. Nobody mentions their names.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 21 months since Azaiza escaped with his immediate family to Qatar; he’s now living in New York. He’s been working with aid groups to help the people of Gaza, and says he has helped raise $60 million and saved numerous lives. He recently launched a foundation to continue fundraising for Palestinians in Gaza, saying it will help to provide food and pastries, tanker trucks of clean water, blankets and shelter. “A candle in the darkness” is how he describes the Motaz Foundation to his Instagram followers, encouraging those in need to personally reach out for help.\n \n\n   \n  When asked at a recent event at the Muslim Wellness Center in Roswell, Georgia, why he named it after himself, he said that he simply couldn’t think of anything else to call it. But he’s proud of the work and it’s giving him purpose as he works through the traumatic upheaval of his life.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe this makes me forget the mental suffering that I’m in,” he pondered, leaning on the back of a pickup truck behind a Yemeni coffee shop which had just hosted a fundraising event for the foundation. “The moment I wire funds to people and get aid, support, and food, I feel high!” As he navigates a maelstrom of emotions, both his torment and his exhilaration are evident. “I’ve never been a useless person,” he said, “I’m always trying to be useful at every step.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 240 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led terror attack, in which more than 1,200 were killed and about 250 taken hostage, prompting Israel’s fierce military response. Israel denies targeting reporters, but Gaza has become the deadliest conflict zone ever for them, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he was receiving death threats via anonymous phone calls shortly before he left the strip and he knows that his story could easily have ended there. Does coming so close to death make him feel more alive? It’s complicated. “Yeah,” he responds, “because you don’t have anything to lose.”\n \n\n   \n  He says he has lost countless friends in Gaza. But he also feels as though he is dead inside. “My soul is turned off,” he said. Sometimes he felt lucky to survive – and luckier to escape – wrestling even now with survivors’ guilt, as do others who managed to flee the war  or  have witnessed it unfold from afar. “This is the feeling that people want me to feel,” he explains. “Or Israel wants me to feel, because if they defeat you inside then they don’t need to do anything else. I have it, but I’m trying not to allow it to control (me).”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he always wanted to be a photographer, but if violence hadn’t beaten a path to his door, then he would never have sought it out. He preferred taking artistic shots of bustling marketplaces or kids playing on the beach and resented that the outside world only seemed to be interested in paying for his work when he and Gaza’s other photojournalists competed for images depicting the most visceral scenes of the aftermath of an airstrike. His documentation of Israel’s response to the October 7 attack delivered him a massive social media following and professional success – his photo from October 31, 2023 of a woman trapped in a pancaked apartment building in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was recognized as one of Time magazine’s  top 10 photographs of the year . But unlike his industry peers in other countries, he couldn’t celebrate the achievement because only his community’s extreme suffering had given him the opportunity to succeed.\n \n\n   \n    Dreams of war\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza says he feels that, somehow, fate chose him to be a bridge between the carnage in Gaza and the world outside, and he confides now that he foresaw his future many times before the war. Azaiza  would often dream of running through the streets in a press vest, a building next to him would blow up and he would bang his head on the ground before waking up, he said. The dream made no sense to him. “And then I found myself in the vest,” he said, “in the helmet, in the car (passing) the building that I saw in my dream. It was on fire. A lot of things that I imagined happened.”\n \n\n   \n  A young lady stood up to address him during one of the fundraising events in Georgia. “Thank you for opening our eyes,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion as she wiped tears from her cheeks. “Thank you for being alive, for being here. I’m so grateful for you.” Another man stood and hailed him a hero. “I’m not a hero,” Azaiza deflected, “I’m not Superman. I still have to wait in line for the toilet.”\n \n\n   \n  Azaiza never wanted to be famous and, although he has more than 15 million followers on Instagram, he says that he’s the same man he was on October 6, 2023, just with more pressure on his shoulders. He’s learned the hard way that it’s impossible to stay out of politics when it comes to Gaza, where so many competing factions have their own agendas to promote; some of the people who used to applaud him now envy him and troll him with abuse on social media instead, he said. The hateful words are in some ways worse than the bullets, he said, because at least one knows how a bullet will hurt.\n \n\n   \n  “But this,” he paused for emphasis, “eats you from the inside, makes your heart tight, makes your stomach not able to eat, makes you overthink. And it hurts others around you, hurts your mom. The keyboard warriors, this is how Israel (can) win. They don’t need to divide us, we’re already divided.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s grateful for the ceasefire, and an end to the killing, but he doesn’t think it’s fair to the Palestinians. “I just wanted the genocide to stop,” he explained. “We’ve been calling for it to stop since October 9. Give them (Israel) the hostages. But nobody listened to us until we lost it all.\n \n\n   \n  “Now it sounds like peace that is giving Israel more peace and more power, they got what they wanted after the massacre, the whole strip. Maybe it’s going to last, because, like, there’s nothing left.”\n \n\n   \n  An independent UN inquiry concluded in September that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, echoing the findings of other genocide experts and human rights groups, all of which Israel has rejected.\n \n\n   \n  For now, Azaiza is focused on his humanitarian work but living in a kind of limbo. He dreams of returning to Gaza to build a home by the sea but wonders what kind of life he would be returning to. He says he’d like to be Gaza’s Minister of Youth one day but knows that many politicians become corrupt; he’d love to start a family too.\n \n\n   \n  Most of all, he dreams of working with his camera in a simpler life. “You know Tarzan?” he asked rhetorically. “I want to be Tarzan with a camera. I wish to go to Tanzania with my camera, capture lions and animals. I don’t want to capture any human anymore, humans bring problems, bring pain, and bring troubles. No humans anymore, only animals, that’s it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/uk/stabbings-uk-knife-crime-intl-cmd","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"08:33:00-05:00","title":"Why Are There So Many Stabbings in Britain?

stabbing  that left nine people with life-threatening injuries over the weekend has put the spotlight back on the United Kingdom’s widespread knife-crime problem.\n \n\n   \n  A 32-year-old British man has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder in connection with the attack, which took place on a train traveling through central England to London on Saturday evening. He has not yet entered a plea.\n \n\n   \n  British politicians condemned the attack, with Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood telling the House of Commons on Monday that knife crime “claims far too many lives in our country.”\n \n\n   \n  Successive governments have vowed to tackle knife crime but it remains a significant issue in a country where access to firearms and other weapons is tightly controlled.\n \n\n   \n  A total of 51,527 knife crime offenses were recorded in England and Wales in the 12 months up until June 2025, excluding the region of Greater Manchester, according to the UK’s Office of National Statistics (data is recorded differently in Manchester). Of these offenses, 196 were homicides, the ONS said.\n \n\n   \n  Notably, the overall number of recorded knife crime offenses in the year leading up to June 2025 fell 5% when compared with the year before.\n \n\n   \n    How common are lethal stabbings in the UK?\n \n\n   \n  While the issue of knife crime is a “serious social concern,” it “should not be a source of moral hysteria,” Iain Overton, executive director of the non-governmental organization Action on Armed Violence told CNN on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  In the year leading up to March 2024, 570 homicides took place in England and Wales,  according to ONS , with 262 homicides committed using a knife or other sharp instrument. The most commonly used instrument in these homicides was a kitchen knife, ONS said. Shooting killed only 22 of the victims.\n \n\n   \n  A total of 64 teenagers aged between 13 and 19 were killed in this time frame, ONS said, with 83% of these victims being killed by a knife or sharp instrument.\n \n\n   \n  Because not all knife crime offenses are reported to police, hospital data can also help in understanding the extent of the issue.\n \n\n   \n  From April 2024 to 2025, there were 3,494 instances in which patients were admitted to hospital in England for assault by sharp object, according to NHS England data. Nearly 90% of patients treated were male, with 16% of patients aged 18 or under.\n \n\n   \n  Scotland and Northern Ireland record crime separately to England and Wales. A total of 28 homicides were committed by sharp instrument in Scotland from 2023 to 2024, and four in Northern Ireland in the same time frame.\n \n\n   \n  In the United States, a total of 1,704 people were killed by a “cut” or “pierce” in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This type of crime is the result of “an incision, slash, perforation, or puncture by a pointed or sharp instrument, weapon, or object,” according to US public service organization  The National Safety Council. \n \n\n   \n  The homicide rate for England and Wales was 9.5 per million people in the year from March 2023 to 2024, according to the ONS. In the US, the rate was much higher, with 68 homicides per million people in 2023, according to the CDC.\n \n\n   \n  In the European Union, home to nearly 450 million people, there were 3,980 intentional homicides in 2023, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU.\n \n\n   \n    What are the root causes of the problem?\n \n\n   \n  In a briefing issued in October, the UK’s Local Government Association called knife crime a “multifaceted issue that cannot be solved through enforcement alone.”\n \n\n   \n  Deprivation, mental health issues, exclusion from school and family struggles can all contribute to a person’s involvement in knife crime, Siddhartha Bandyopadhyay, economist and director of the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Crime, Justice and Policing, told CNN on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While a decade ago the majority of knife crime perpetrated by young people was related to gangs, this is no longer the case, James Alexander, an associate enterprise fellow in criminology at London Metropolitan University, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really predictable,” Alexander said. “Now with young people, you can’t predict it. There are people getting involved in knife crime, getting arrested for carrying knives or being stabbed or stabbing people that have got no criminal record whatsoever, no indications (that they might commit knife crimes),” he said.\n \n\n   \n  With violence, or the threat of it, being so pervasive in today’s society, many young people now carry knives out of fear for their own safety, Alexander said. If they feel threatened, instead of running away or fighting without weapons, they resort to using knives, often with devastating consequences.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the young people who have grown up in a “culture where violence is accepted” then go on to become violent adults, Alexander said.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ve got a lot of unsupported young men becoming adults that are not developing in the way that they would if they were supported. Then they’re taking their violent tendencies into adulthood, which is a big concern for lots of people.”\n \n\n   \n    What is being done to tackle knife crime?\n \n\n   \n  During campaigning for Britain’s 2024 parliamentary elections, the now-governing Labour Party pledged to try to “halve knife crime in a decade.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the Home Office, “nearly 60,000 knives have been removed from streets in England and Wales through new knife surrender schemes and police operations” since Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government took office.\n \n\n   \n  Weapons including so-called zombie knives and ninja swords have also been banned, and age verification checks for the online sale and delivery of knives are being strengthened,the Home Office said. The progress made this year includes a 5% fall in all knife crimes, including an 18% reduction in homicides by knife, the Home Secretary told lawmakers on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  However, Overton from Action on Armed Violence said that while enforcement helps in combating knife crime, “this is not simply a policing issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “Cuts to youth and mental-health services, poverty, exclusion, and the exploitation of children by drug networks have all helped create the conditions for violence,” he said. “The real work lies in prevention: through education, community investment, and early intervention.”\n \n\n   \n  One example of effective prevention is  Operation Divan , a police-led initiative that aims to discourage the carrying of knives by young people in the English county of North Yorkshire, Bandyopadhyay said.\n \n\n   \n  Under the initiative, if there are concerns that a young person might be interacting with knives, the police will work with local services to discuss the dangers of knives with that young person. This also helps authorities to learn more about why young people are interacting with knives.\n \n\n   \n  There is a “significant opportunity for (the) early diversion” of young people away from knife crime through “voluntary educational interventions,” Bandyopadhyay said.\n \n\n   \n  Alexander from London Metropolitan University said that while he had evaluated “quite a few amazing interventions” when it comes to knife crime, they often only run for a few years due to a lack of funding.\n \n\n   \n  “The government is doing some really practical things” when it comes to clamping down on the sale of sharp weapons, Alexander said. “But I think actually, when you look at a lot of young people, they (are)… quite damaged young people.”\n \n\n   \n  They need support, he continued, “but it doesn’t necessarily need to be done by a therapist. They just need a space where they can be a child” and feel safe without needing a knife.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/baseball-salary-cap-2027","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00+00:00","title":"After Dodgers’ win, a salary cap is looming large over baseball.

Here’s why that might be a bad idea \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It may be easy to look at the Los Angeles Dodgers’ record-setting payroll and back-to-back World Series titles and think that baseball desperately   needs a salary cap.\n \n\n   \n  After all, the Dodgers’ total payroll of $350 million is roughly double the league’s average and $84 million more than the previous record for a series champ, which was set by the Dodgers themselves just one year earlier.   \n \n\n   \n  And there are indications team owners will be pushing for a cap in labor negotiations a year from now when the labor deal between the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), the labor union representing nearly 8,000 players in the majors and minors.\n \n\n   \n  “No one argues that the Kansas City Chiefs are ruining football by dominating the sport because the Chiefs didn’t buy their way to a championship, and it’s perceived that the Dodgers did,” said Victor Matheson, economics professor and expert in the business of sports at the College of the Holy Cross. “And, of course, it’s perceived that the Dodgers did so because they (spend) about $100 million more on batters and pitchers in their lineup than the (runner-up Toronto Blue) Jays did.”\n \n\n   \n  But the facts don’t back up the idea that money is everything in baseball, or that a salary cap would solve the Dodgers’ dominance. Because despite the Dodgers’ recent success and deep pockets, there is greater competition within the sport than it appears.\n \n\n   \n    Dollars don’t equal wins\n \n\n   \n  Had the Blue Jays pulled off the victory over the Dodgers on Saturday, it would have given baseball its 10th different champion in the last 12 years, a period during which the NFL, with its salary cap, has had only six different teams win the Super Bowl, and the NBA, with its cap, had eight champions.\n \n\n   \n  But in baseball, only about 10% of the difference between good teams and bad teams is due to the size of their payroll, said Matheson.\n \n\n   \n  “But there are so many things that you can’t control, like injuries and like, ‘Is that great player going to perform well at a key moment?’” Matheson said.\n \n\n   \n  Some other estimates, such as one from Andrew Zimbalist, economics professor emeritus at Smith College and a leading expert on the business of sports, put the impact of payroll higher, but still only about 25% of the difference between winning and losing.\n \n\n   \n  The team with the second-largest payroll in the sport, the New York Mets, were beat to the postseason by the small-market Cincinnati Reds, who were 19th on the payroll list.   \n \n\n   \n  The team with the best regular season record was not the deep-pocketed Dodgers but the Milwaukee Brewers, with a payroll of about a third of the Dodgers’ and No. 18 of the 30 MLB teams.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, the Brewers were eventually swept by the Dodgers in the playoffs. But anything can happen in baseball’s postseason format, even when one team is considered vastly superior to another.\n \n\n   \n  “Largely what happens in the postseason is a product of randomness,” said Zimbalist. “It’s a product of which team is peaking at the right moment, which team gets better breaks, better luck at the right moment.”\n \n\n   \n  A pair of stellar plays in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series by two of the Dodgers’ lower-paid players — Miguel Rojas, who hit the game-tying home run, and Andy Pages, who made an extremely difficult catch to prevent the Blue Jays from scoring the winning run — were all that stood in the way of Toronto winning a title.\n \n\n   \n    The possibility of a lost season\n \n\n   \n  Efforts to bring about a salary cap to MLB might lead to something quite serious: a lost season — or more.\n \n\n   \n  The MLBPA has made opposition to a salary cap the hill to die on and has refused to agree to any deal that includes one. And the union doesn’t appear willing to change that stance.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not going to negotiate through the media, but I will tell you this: The issues that we see in the system we know can be addressed without (a salary cap),” union executive director Tony Clark said in a press conference on October 24.\n \n\n   \n  But the talk in the sport for well over a year is that the owners are more united than in the past in wanting a salary cap and are ready to go to extremes to get one.\n \n\n   \n  The Dodgers’ win could very well increase the chance of a work stoppage that wipes out much, if not all, of the 2027 season, said Zimbalist.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, yes, (the Dodgers’ win) will raise the stakes a little bit, and make the compromise a little bit harder to achieve,” he said. “Some owners have told me they think that it’ll take a year and a half of a lockout before the players accept the salary cap.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/sport/victor-conte-death","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"08:15:00-05:00","title":"Victor Conte, Who Sold Undetectable Steroids to Elite Athletes in Baseball and Track, Has Died at 75","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Victor Conte, a former sports nutrition entrepreneur, died at 75 after leading a scheme to supply undetectable performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes like Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi, and Marion Jones through his companies BALCO and SNAC System.

\n        8:15 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Victor Conte, the architect of a scheme to provide undetectable performance-enhancing drugs to professional athletes including baseball stars Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi and Olympic track champion Marion Jones decades ago, has died. He was 75.\n \n\n   \n  Conte died Monday, SNAC System, a sports nutrition company he founded, said in a social media post. It did not disclose his cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  The federal government’s investigation into another company Conte founded, the  Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative , yielded convictions of Jones, elite sprint cyclist Tammy Thomas, and former NFL defensive lineman Dana Stubblefield along with coaches, distributors, a trainer, a chemist and a lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  Conte, who served four months in federal prison for dealing steroids, talked openly about his famous former clients. He went on television to say he had seen three-time Olympic medalist Jones inject herself with human growth hormone, but always stopped short of implicating Bonds, the San Francisco Giants slugger.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation led to the book “Game of Shadows.” A week after the book was published in 2006, baseball Commissioner Bud Selig hired former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell to investigate steroids.\n \n\n   \n    The Steroids Era\n \n\n   \n  Conte said he sold steroids known as “the cream” and “the clear” and advised on their use to dozens of elite athletes, including Giambi, a five-time major league All-Star, the Mitchell report said.\n \n\n   \n  “The illegal use of performance-enhancing substances poses a serious threat to the integrity of the game,” the Mitchell report said. “Widespread use by players of such substances unfairly disadvantages the honest athletes who refuse to use them and raises questions about the validity of baseball records.”\n \n\n   \n  Mitchell said the problems didn’t develop overnight. Mitchell said everyone involved in baseball in the prior two decades — including commissioners, club officials, the players’ association and players — shared some responsibility for what he called “the Steroids Era.”\n \n\n   \n  The federal investigation into BALCO began with a tax agent digging through the company’s trash.\n \n\n   \n  Conte wound up pleading guilty to two of the 42 charges against him in 2005 before trial. Six of the 11 convicted people were ensnared for lying to grand jurors, federal investigators or the court.\n \n\n   \n  Bonds’ personal trainer Greg Anderson, pleaded guilty to steroid distribution charges stemming from his BALCO connections. Anderson was sentenced to three months in prison and three months of home confinement.\n \n\n   \n  Bonds was charged with lying to a grand jury about receiving performance-enhancing drugs and went on trial in 2011. Prosecutors dropped the case four years later when the government decided not to appeal an overturned obstruction of justice conviction to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  A seven-time National League MVP and 14-time All-Star outfielder, Bonds ended his career after the 2007 season with 762 homers, surpassing the record of 755 that Hank Aaron set from 1954-76. Bonds denied knowingly using performance-enhancing drugs but has never been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n \n\n   \n  Bonds didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.\n \n\n   \n  Conte told The Associated Press in a 2010 interview that “yes, athletes cheat to win, but the government agents and prosecutors cheat to win, too.” He also questioned whether the results in such legal cases justified the effort.\n \n\n   \n  Conte’s attorney, Robert Holley, didn’t respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. SNAC System didn’t respond to a message sent through the company’s website.\n \n\n   \n    Defiant about his role\n \n\n   \n  After serving his sentence in a minimum security prison he described as “like a men’s retreat,” Conte got back in business in 2007 by resuscitating a nutritional supplements business he had launched two decades earlier called Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning or SNAC System. He located it in the same building that once housed BALCO in Burlingame, California.\n \n\n   \n  Conte remained defiant about his central role in doling out designer steroids to elite athletes. He maintained he simply helped “level the playing field” in a world already rife with cheaters.\n \n\n   \n  To Dr. Gary Wadler, a then-member of the World Anti-Doping Agency, Conte may as well have been pushing cocaine or heroin.\n \n\n   \n  “You are talking about totally illegal drug trafficking. You are talking about using drugs in violation of federal law,” Wadler said in 2007. “This is not philanthropy and this is not some do-gooding. This is drug dealing.”\n \n\n   \n  The hallway at SNAC System was lined with game jerseys of pro athletes, and signed photographs, including athletics stars Tim Montgomery, Kelli White and CJ Hunter, all punished for doping.\n \n\n   \n  Conte wore a Rolex and parked a Bentley and a Mercedes in front of his building. He told the AP in 2007 he wouldn’t drive over the speed limit.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m a person who doesn’t break laws anymore,” he said. “But I still do like to look fast.”\n \n\n   \n  Years later, he met with the then-chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency, Dick Pound.\n \n\n   \n  “As someone who was able to evade their system for so long, it was easy for me to point out the many loopholes that exist and recommend specific steps to improve the overall effectiveness of their program,” Conte said in a statement after the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  He said that some of the poor decisions he made in the past made him uniquely qualified to contribute to the anti-doping effort.\n \n\n   \n  SNAC System’s social media post announcing Conte’s death called him an “Anti-Doping Advocate.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/asia/northern-afghanistan-earthquake-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"07:51:00-05:00","title":"Deadly quake rocks Afghanistan leaving iconic Blue Mosque surrounded by rubble","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan near Mazar-i-Sharif on November 4, 2025, killing at least 27 people and injuring over 950, with the death toll potentially rising.

Laura Sharman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:51 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A powerful earthquake has rattled northern Afghanistan, killing at least 27 people and injuring 956 more, according to Dr. Sharafat Zaman Amar, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Health. The tremor also damaged one of the country’s most beautiful mosques.\n \n\n   \n  Families were jolted awake in the early hours of Monday when the 6.3-magnitude quake struck near Mazar-i-Sharif, one of the most populated cities in the north of the country, at a shallow depth of 28 kilometers (17.4 miles), the  United States Geological Survey  said.\n \n\n   \n  A massive search and rescue operation is underway, with a child seen pulled alive from the rubble in the north of the country in video released by the Ministry of Defense on Monday morning. The girl was taken to hospital in a critical condition, a spokesperson for the 209 Al-Fath Army Corp told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mazar-i-Sharif’s iconic Blue Mosque was damaged in the quake, footage on social media geolocated by CNN revealed, with its base littered with rubble - early evidence of the destruction captured in the shadows before dawn.\n \n\n   \n  The site is one of Afghanistan’s architectural treasures and a major point of pilgrimage, believed by some to be the resting place of Hazrat Ali, the fourth Caliph of Islam and the son-in-law of Prophet Mohammad.\n \n\n   \n  Residents in at least nine provinces, including Kabul, lost power after electricity lines from Uzbekistan – a major supplier of power to Afghanistan – were severed.\n \n\n   \n  The state-run energy company DABS also reported cut lines from Tajikistan to Kunduz province, plunging the area into total blackout. Teams are “working urgently to restore both routes,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Government officials put the death toll at 20. In an update early Tuesday, the World Health Organization said more than 860 people were injured in northern provinces of Balkh and Samangan — rising from more than 600 overnight. The Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority suggested casualties could rise further as “search and rescue operations are still ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Authority for Disaster Preparedness said the quake struck at around 1 a.m. local time, impacting parts of the north, east and west, with the epicenter located in Samangan.\n \n\n   \n  The United Nations (UN) confirmed it has teams on the ground “to assess needs and deliver urgent aid.”\n \n\n   \n  Initial assessments from a UN flyover on Monday found “fewer signs of damage than at first feared.”\n \n\n   \n  “We went over the main populated areas where the most settlements are in the earthquake affected area,” said Richard Trenchard, the UN’s acting Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “Thankfully, we saw very little widespread devastation… compared to the devastating scenes we saw in Kunar,” he said, referring the 6.0-magnitude quake that stuck eastern Afghanistan in August, killing at least 2,200 people.\n \n\n   \n  Afghanistan has endured a series of earthquake in recent years that have caused thousands of deaths and the USGS models estimate the shaking from Monday’s quake could result in hundreds of fatalities.\n \n\n   \n  The impoverished country’s ability to respond to natural disasters has been further impeded by a shortage in international aid following the Taliban’s successful takeover in the wake of the  chaotic withdrawal of US-led forces  in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Damage to properties was reported in the affected areas, the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority said, with accounts of broken windows and structural damage to homes.\n \n\n   \n  One resident of Mazar-i-Sharif told CNN that her family “woke up terrified” after the quake struck, saying that her children ran “down the stairs screaming” when it occurred.\n \n\n   \n  “I had never experienced such a strong earthquake in my life,” said Rahima, a former school teacher, 50, adding that it broke some of her windows and damaged the plaster on some of her walls.\n \n\n   \n  “I am happy that my house is made of concrete in the city,” she told CNN. “I don’t know if houses made of mud have survived this earthquake in the outskirts of the city.”\n \n\n   \n  The quake also blocked the Tashqurghan passage, a critical route from the capital of Kabul towards neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but rescue teams have since cleared the route, the Ministry of Defense said.\n \n\n   \n  In Tashqurghan district, rubble and debris can be seen strewn across roads as bodies are carried away following the quake, according to footage from state broadcaster Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA). In another clip from RTA, people can be seen carefully making their way through the debris, scanning the ground with flashlights, with wrecked vehicles nearby.\n \n\n   \n  At least three hospitals in the quake zone were overwhelmed by the sudden influx of injured people, and “urgently” need “additional medical supplies, and emergency personnel to sustain life-saving services,” according to the World Health Organization.\n \n\n   \n  The earthquake was felt in regions of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, three countries that border northern Afghanistan, USGS reported.\n \n\n   \n  The region was hit by at least five aftershocks, the strongest measuring 5.2 magnitude in the hours after the initial quake, according to USGS.\n \n\n   \n  India offered support following the earthquake, according to a post from foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on X. He wrote, “Indian relief material for the earthquake impacted communities is being handed over today. Further supplies of medicines to reach soon.”\n \n\n   \n  Save the Children, which has also deployed a team to the area, said while the scale of the destruction will take time to clarify, the impact on children’s mental health was immediate.\n \n\n   \n  “This is tragically the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit Afghanistan. As temperatures fall, thousands of children in the earthquake-devastated east of the country are facing the winter with only tents for protection from the rain and snow,” said Samira Sayed Rahman, the organization’s programme development and advocacy director for Afghanistan. “Now, families in the north are also experiencing fear and uncertainty after this latest powerful quake.\n \n\n   \n  In October 2023, another  6.3-magnitude earthquake  took place in western Afghanistan, killing more than 2,000.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/entertainment/jonathan-bailey-sexiest-man-alive-people","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:05:00+00:00","title":"Jonathan Bailey is the 'Sexiest Man Alive,' according to People magazine","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jonathan Bailey, the actor known for his roles in 'Wicked' and 'Bridgerton,' has been named People magazine's 'Sexiest Man Alive' in 2025.

Tens of thousands of callous-handed firefighters and tender veterinarians each year are snubbed in favor of bankable Hollywood stars that, coincidentally, tend to bring attention to suffering magazines. (People Inc., which is owned by Barry Diller’s IAC,  laid off  6 percent of its workforce last month.)\n \n\n   \n  This year, the actor Jonathan Bailey was named to the honorary unpaid position. The “ Wicked ” and “Bridgerton” star is likely the first publicly out gay person to receive the award, unless there’s something we don’t know about some of honorees who preceded him. “It’s the honor of a lifetime,” Bailey told Jimmy Fallon.\n \n\n   \n  The magazine did two covers, one with Bailey’s dog, Benson.\n \n\n   \n  Here are answers to some other questions.\n \n\n   \n    Do they have to eliminate the previous sexiest man each year?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not required to rid society of the outgoing sexiest man. He is simply demoted in sexiness without fanfare. This year’s winner would have “big shoes to fill,” People magazine warned, and those shoes belong to 2024’s sexy fella, John Krasinski. (He is a size 12 US,  according to  Wikifeet.) Krasinski also has the least interesting yet very successful Hollywood career imaginable, but that doesn’t mean he should be exiled or worse. He can next be seen playing glamorous Paramount intellectual property character Jack Ryan, whom he’s played in an Amazon series for four seasons, in the sixth film of the franchise.\n \n\n   \n    What are the criteria for being described as this sexy?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just appearance, the editors of People have said,  mentioning  shadily that “looks aren’t just what the candidates are judged by,” adding that they included Michael B. Jordan because of his political activism. So you can be sexy with an asterisk and feel bad forever.\n \n\n   \n    How much does the award cost and/or pay?\n \n\n   \n  Unknown, actually! Like a presidential library (approaching  a billion dollars ) or a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ($ 85,000 ), the price, if any, of being declared People’s Sexiest Man Alive may be extravagant, but we suspect the real toll is only spiritual. Andrea Lavinthal, the magazine’s Executive Director of Special Integrated Projects, recently  said loudly  that they do not pay the honoree … and that the honoree does not pay the magazine.\n \n\n   \n    Are there other sexy men alive?\n \n\n   \n  A few. The people also get to say who is sexy, and prior to the official announcement, the people’s choices  are announced . They include men as variously sexy as the “sexiest new dad in sports,” who is Christian McCaffrey. The Sexiest Cat Dad title was won by Dave Franco.\n \n\n   \n    Is the prize of being the sexiest man alive cursed?\n \n\n   \n  Yes! Just like many other titles, such as the Grammy Award for Best New Artist and  England’s “Duke of York,”  this one also comes with a dark undercurrent. For instance, all of the people named Sexiest Man Alive are marked for death at a later date. Many have lived through years of war and terrorism. Most will also suffer from divorce, failed franchises, hair loss and sudden hair regrowth. Still, it’s nice to think that having once been named as extremely, extravagantly sexy must keep them warm on the coldest of nights.\n \n\n   \n    Do you want to feel old?\n \n\n   \n  Brad Pitt was first named sexiest man alive in 1995, the same year we got the phrase, “If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/china/us-china-red-lines-xie-feng-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:21:00-05:00","title":"China warns Taiwan and human rights remain among its ‘red lines’ after Trump-Xi talks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US President Donald Trump in South Korea, China has reaffirmed four 'red lines' as critical boundaries in US-China relations: Taiwan, democracy and human rights, political path and system, and the right to development.

among its ‘red lines’ after Trump-Xi talks \n       \n  By Simone McCarthy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:21 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  China has called for the US to avoid crossing four sensitive “red lines” in order to keep the two countries’ relations on track following a  high-stakes meeting  between leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump last week.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan, democracy and human rights, political path and system, and right to development are “China’s four red lines,” China’s ambassador to the US Xie Feng said during a  virtual address  to American and Chinese businesspeople in Shanghai on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope the US side will avoid crossing them and causing trouble,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Xie made the remarks to an event hosted by the US-China Business Council, according to a readout released by the Chinese Embassy in the US, in comments that come days after Xi and Trump held their landmark meeting last week on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Those talks – the leaders’ first since Trump’s return to the White House earlier this year – have been widely seen as a significant step in de-escalating frictions between the two superpowers.\n \n\n   \n  Now, keeping those relations on track would require both sides to “respect each other’s core interests and major concerns,” said Xie, adding that the “pressing priority” was “to follow up on the consensus reached between the two presidents.”\n \n\n   \n  “It would be unacceptable to say one thing but do another, cause any new disruption, make zero-sum calculations,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  For Beijing, the four “red lines” elaborated by Xie are longstanding sensitive areas that could enflame tensions if mishandled – the most prominent of which is Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that China’s ruling Communist Party views as its own, despite never having controlled it.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has long been irked by Washington’s unofficial relationship with Taipei, and the island often features in high-level diplomatic conversations between the two sides. Trump on Sunday told  CBS’ 60 Minutes  that the subject did not arise during the meeting last week.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has in the past bristled at what it sees as US efforts to interfere in China’s domestic affairs, including American officials voicing concerns about limits to freedoms of expression within China’s tightly controlled political system and alleged human rights violations.\n \n\n   \n  While figures within the Trump administration like US Secretary of State Marco Rubio have long been vocal around such issues, they did not appear to be raised by Trump during the recent hour-and-forty-minute meeting with Xi, which focused on their bilateral economic relationship.\n \n\n   \n  Those talks ended without a formal trade deal, but saw Beijing agree to pause for a year a sweeping expansion of its export controls on rare earth minerals, while Washington would similarly defer measures that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese firms blacklisted from accessing certain sensitive US technologies.\n \n\n   \n  The two sides also extended a truce reached earlier this year that brought down their tit-for-tat tariffs from levels that would have amounted to a de facto trade embargo.\n \n\n   \n  The measures were greeted with relief by many in the global business community, which for months has been ensnared in the uncertainty of up-and-down economic frictions between the world’s two largest economies.\n \n\n   \n  Xie, Beijing’s top envoy in Washington, picked up that thread in his remarks on Monday, as he called on business leaders to “build on the positive momentum” of the summit and “remain optimistic about China’s future and committed to the Chinese market.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/sport/running-shark-attack-victim-paralympian-nyc-marathon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"Meet the shark-attack victim and Paralympian who finished the New York City marathon","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ali Truwit, a former competitive swimmer at Yale University, survived a shark attack in Turks and Caicos in May 2023, which resulted in the loss of her left foot and lower leg.

shark-attack victim and Paralympian who finished the New York City marathon \n       \n  By Don Riddell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Ali Truwit crossed the finish line at the Copenhagen Marathon in 2023, she couldn’t have imagined how hard it would be to run the 26.2-mile distance again.\n \n\n   \n  Just 10 days later, she was bitten by a shark while snorkeling in Turks and Caicos and, although she was lucky to escape with her life, her left foot and the lower part of her leg were lost in the attack.\n \n\n   \n  But at the New York City Marathon in 2025, Truwit finished another marathon, completing the most remarkable comeback from  a devastating physical and psychological trauma. \n \n\n   \n  “I’m over the moon,” she exclaimed to CNN in an interview the next day, “I’m definitely feeling the race a little bit, but still feeling on top of the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who’s ever run a marathon will tell you about the grueling nature of the challenge, but few could imagine having to remove their leg multiple times throughout the race.\n \n\n   \n  “Still feels crazy to say,” she said, explaining that the sweat was making her prosthetic limb slip on her leg.\n \n\n   \n  After one such stop, Truwit posted a video to her Instagram story of her bouncing up and down at the side of the road to put her prosthetic back on. Another challenge was her inability to feel the ground beneath her, particularly around the five bridges along the iconic route.\n \n\n   \n  “Learning how to do it without an ankle, which is typically how you adjust for the incline and decline, was totally new,” she said, noting that it was also hard not to slip on all the water and discarded cups around the hydration stations every mile. “There were a lot of nuances to navigate with a blade.”\n \n\n   \n  Since that fateful day in May 2023, Truwit’s journey has been remarkable and inspirational. A competitive swimmer at Yale University, she said that getting back into the water triggered flashbacks of the attack, but within just 16 months she’d conquered her fear to  win two silver medals at the Paralympics in Paris. \n \n\n   \n  In New York, she reclaimed more of her life, running alongside her former teammate Sophie Pilkinton and another 13 family and friends – the people who saved her life and helped her to rebuild it. Pilkinton was there from the start, helping to fight off the shark and swim back to the boat where she applied a life-saving tourniquet; now Truwit says they’re like sisters.\n \n\n   \n  “We have an incredibly special bond,” Truwit said. “To come through a shark attack like that and survive together and save each other, to be running a marathon side by side, step by step, it’s just such a testament to her support and our friendship. Truly something I’m going to cherish for the rest of my life.”\n \n\n   \n  Truwit says that each stage of her recovery has been challenging, but in different ways.\n \n\n   \n  “Swimming was hard because of the traumatic memories I had associated with the water, (but) I don’t swim with my prosthetic, whereas with running I have to use that prosthetic to help me get where I want to go,” she told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “And that’s a big challenge, you know, navigate the swelling and all of those frustrations. Running is physically harder; swimming was emotionally harder.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite her obvious triumphs, Truwit says that she’s still recovering from the attack, she’s still a work in progress.\n \n\n   \n  “Grief comes in waves,” she laments. “I grieve different things at different times. I’ve made a lot of progress on my healing journey, and I think there’s still a-ways to go.”\n \n\n   \n  Many have asked if she had the power to go back and rewrite her history, would she?\n \n\n   \n  “Not to have my life as an amputee would have been easier,” she explained. “I wish it hadn’t happened, but I’m really thankful that I now have this opportunity and platform to impact other people too.”\n \n\n   \n  Truwit and her entourage ran New York in blue T-shirts with the name of her charity, “Stronger Than You Think,” stamped in white letters on the back. By the end of the day, they’d raised $220,000. Throughout the race, she glanced at the home screen of her cell phone, a patchwork of the nine women and girls that she has helped to find their own prosthetic limbs.\n \n\n   \n  “I was really shocked at how expensive prosthetics are and how little insurance covers relative to what’s needed,” she said. “These prosthetics are our mobility, our quality of life, our ability to go back to our careers and families and passions, so I wanted to do something about it. It’s been the most healing work for me to take this bad thing and use it for good. Our recipients give me hope and inspiration and joy, and it really was a goal for me, to not just give the prosthetics, but to create community and friendship and support among us.”\n \n\n   \n  Truwit’s positive attitude is infectious, she’s able to recall the most awful moment of her life with a smile and the social media videos documenting a painful recovery depict a joyful young woman; it’s as if the experience of being so close to death has infused her with a new love of life.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been given a second chance,” she explained, “I came face to face with that almost not being my reality. You want to live life fully and beautifully and joyfully. Of course, there’s hard moments, I just kind of believe that smiling tricks my brain a little bit, even when I’m in pain or things are hard, I smile to send my body the message, I’m so grateful to be alive right now and I know what a privilege that is.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/markets/us-stock-market","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"06:30:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s undeniable stock market victory that no one saw coming","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"One year after Donald Trump's reelection, the U.S. stock market has reached record highs, with the S&P 500 gaining 19.6% due to strong corporate earnings and soaring investor confidence in artificial intelligence.

John Towfighi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:30 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One year after President Donald Trump’s reelection, the US stock market continues to notch  record highs .\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 has gained 19.6% over the past 12 months, boosted by strong corporate earnings and investors’ enthusiasm about artificial intelligence. Stocks have been remarkably adaptable, defying concerns about a resurgence in global trade tensions and bouts of intense volatility.\n \n\n   \n  To Trump, the market’s gains are a vindication of his policies. The president on October 28 touted stocks’ record highs during a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  “Their stock market today and our stock market today hit an all-time high,” Trump  said . “That means we’re doing something right.”\n \n\n   \n  But some analysts say the stock market’s gains have a more prosaic reason: Corporate earnings continue to impress Wall Street, and investors are betting big on AI.\n \n\n   \n  “What happens in Washington matters, but it’s not the only thing that matters,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist. “Despite all the shifting narratives, the key theme for this year is the dominance of tech and AI and the continued resilience of corporate America.”\n \n\n   \n    Ascent to all-time highs\n \n\n   \n  The stock market’s resilience has been surprising, said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, considering Trump’s “pretty aggressive changes and approaches” to US trade policy and the Federal Reserve, which he has pressured to lower interest rates.\n \n\n   \n  “Trump’s introduced a lot of uncertainty into markets over the last year,” Ellerbroek said. “The market hates uncertainty.”\n \n\n   \n  Investors have turned their attention to the AI trade and tried to look past concerns about tariffs, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “This AI investment cycle is humongous and unprecedented and overwhelming any and all of those things,” Ellerbroek said.\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500, which is weighted by market value, has become increasingly concentrated in big tech companies. Nvidia ( NVDA ), which just hit  $5 trillion  in market value, now accounts for 8% of the S&P 500’s market value.\n \n\n   \n  An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, which gives all the companies in the index an equal part, is up just 6% over the past 12 months, compared to the benchmark index’s 19.6% gain.\n \n\n   \n    Weathering tariff turmoil\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 fell as much as 19% in April as Trump rolled out his  plan for tariffs . But as markets tumbled, the Trump administration walked back its most severe proposals.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the S&P 500 has coasted higher. The index is up six months in a row.\n \n\n   \n  “Stocks may be higher in part because the administration’s final tariff actions were ultimately less severe than initially feared,” said Mark Malek, CIO at brokerage firm Siebert Financial. “Were it not for the tariff-driven swoon earlier this year, markets would likely be even higher today.”\n \n\n   \n  From Trump’s election through the end of October, the S&P 500’s rise was the eighth best for a president’s first year since the end of World War II, according to CFRA Research data. The S&P 500 climbed roughly 38% during the same period during President Joe Biden’s term, marking the best performance on record.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the US stock market’s gains this year pale in comparison to global markets. In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index has soared 66% across the past 12 months. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has gained 28%. Benchmark stock indexes in Poland and Greece have gained roughly 52% and 60%, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  While stocks are near record highs, the Treasury market has also advanced. Despite concerns about US deficits, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and attacks on the Fed’s independence, investors have still flocked to US government bonds.\n \n\n   \n  The 10-year US Treasury yield, which influences a host of interest rates across the economy, has declined from 4.4% in November 2024 to 4.1% this month.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, has signaled relative calm in markets for the majority of the past six months. An index tracking volatility in the bond market is hovering near its lowest level this year.\n \n\n   \n  “We want the most America-first policies that are possible, without incurring market wrath,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times in October.\n \n\n   \n  “What gets the people in trouble is they come in, they have these ideas, but they don’t respect the market,” Bessent said. “You’ve got to respect the market.”\n \n\n   \n    Taking the baton\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was reelected,  investors cheered  the potential for deregulation and tax cuts, while the Fed had recently cut interest rates, providing a boost for stocks.\n \n\n   \n  Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, said he has not been surprised by the stock market’s ascent.\n \n\n   \n  “The administration has largely delivered on a lot of those things that investors were so bullish about,” Mayfield said.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately you zoom back and you say, ‘All right, it’s an AI bull market,’” Mayfield said. “The administration took the baton from the last administration only two years into a bull market, still with a lot of leg room left and companies growing their earnings.”\n \n\n   \n  Mayfield said he expects the rally to continue, but he is also cautious about a potential pullback, given just how far things have run.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t expect a smooth ride,” he said. “I would expect a correction at some point in the next 12 months — 10% to 15% maybe.”\n \n\n   \n  A growing chorus of Wall Street CEOs concurs: David Solomon, chief executive at Goldman Sachs, said he thinks there will be a 10% to 20% drawdown in stocks sometime in the next one to two years.\n \n\n   \n  “Things run and they pull back so people can reassess,” Solomon said during a panel at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit in Hong Kong.\n \n\n   \n  While the S&P 500 continues to hit record highs, the index is being carried by big tech and AI. It leaves everyday investors and 401(k)s increasingly exposed to enormous gains, but vulnerable to a downturn.\n \n\n   \n  To Lerner at Truist, the bull market deserves the benefit of the doubt.\n \n\n   \n  “The North Star of this bull market is corporate profits,” Lerner said.\n \n\n   \n  But with stocks trading at historically expensive levels, there are risks abound.\n \n\n   \n  “When you haven’t had a pullback since April, I think you’re just more susceptible to negative surprises, whatever those may be,” Lerner said. “You might be somewhat less able to absorb them.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/04/us/sara-ellis-judge-greg-bovino","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Sara Ellis, Obama-Appointed Judge, Orders Federal Agents to Avoid Violent Encounters in Chicago Protests","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sara L.

\nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Tue November 4, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal judge in Illinois who ordered federal agents to limit aggressive tactics against protesters is known for her stern tone and an extensive career in civil and criminal litigation.\n \n\n   \n  Trump administration officials have defended themselves in court as Judge Sara L. Ellis of the Northern District of Illinois has repeatedly pressed federal officials and demanded explanations for their response to intense protests in Chicago amid “Operation Midway Blitz.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis has   raised concerns a temporary restraining order she issued last month to block agents from using certain types of force against protesters was being violated. The courtroom felt like a principal’s office as Ellis detailed examples of incidents where she felt her order wasn’t being followed.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not blind, right?” Ellis  said .\n \n\n   \n  While Ellis’ approach has been viewed by some as assertive oversight of executive powers, Ellis’ former colleagues who spoke with CNN described her as someone who dispenses evenhanded justice.\n \n\n   \n  During a hearing last week, Ellis cited videos of interactions between agents and crowds, which she said appeared to show agents firing tear gas without notice and with no apparent threat.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed,” Ellis said.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis took on civil rights lawsuits and white-collar criminal defense for nearly 20 years before former President Barack Obama appointed her to the federal bench during his second term. The Canadian-born judge had previously discussed her experience as an immigrant to the US and indirectly addressed President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in his first term.\n \n\n   \n  Since becoming a US district judge, Ellis has taken on noteworthy cases ranging from Covid-19 restrictions to immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  “Judge Ellis calls the balls and strikes fairly in every case, applying the law without letting personal views play any role,” Corey Rubenstein, a Chicago attorney who has known Ellis for 25 years, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Another former colleague, William Ziegelmueller, said Ellis’ response “shows that she views herself as part of the community, not a resident of a lofty ivory tower, and understands that her rulings directly impact the lives of everyone in her community.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Having Sara on the other side was like going to war’\n \n\n   \n  Ellis received her bachelor’s degree in 1991 from Indiana University and her Juris Doctor in 1994 from Loyola University Chicago School of Law, according to  the Federal Judicial Center .\n \n\n   \n  Before becoming a judge, Ellis  practiced  almost exclusively in federal court as a litigator for criminal and civil matters, trying  11 cases  to verdict.\n \n\n   \n  After graduating from law school, Ellis began her career as a staff attorney at the Federal Defender Program in Chicago, according to the  district court . Ronald Safer, who met her when she was in that position, said she excelled as a young lawyer.\n \n\n   \n  “She is kind and gentle. Her demeanor led some people to underestimate her,” Safer told CNN. “They did so at their peril. Sara was a fierce advocate. She was a whip-smart legal analyst … Having Sara on the other side was like going to war.”\n \n\n   \n  She worked at a white-collar criminal defense law firm for four years before serving as assistant corporation counsel for the City of Chicago Department of Law, where she handled class claims for injunctive relief and civil rights lawsuits. Working for the city was like “living in the eye of the hurricane,” but Ellis “tried to bring order to chaos,” Safer said.\n \n\n   \n  “As a defense lawyer, her compassion for her clients guided her every move,” said Rubenstein, who worked with Ellis at Stetler, Duffy and Rotert, Ltd.\n \n\n   \n  She also worked as an adjunct professor at Loyola University Chicago for several years. Before becoming a federal judge, Ellis worked at another Chicago law firm, where she handled criminal and civil cases.\n \n\n   \n  “She was admired and beloved by her colleagues and her clients,” said Safer, who worked with Ellis at Schiff Hardin LLP. One of her strong suits, he said, was she could talk to a jury as a peer.\n \n\n   \n  Her  pro bono work  included challenging solitary confinement for extended periods of time and advocating for the inclusion of female baseball players on high school baseball teams. She also volunteered to represent a Lake County, Illinois, man who Safer said had been wrongfully convicted.\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Ellis has a distinguished record of pro bono work and community service,” Sen. Dick Durbin said in a  news release .\n \n\n   \n  Rubenstein said Ellis “cares about the little guy, the downtrodden as much as any jurist I have known.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘I have been a zealous advocate for my clients’\n \n\n   \n  In 2013, Durbin recommended Ellis and Judge Andrea Wood to Obama for judgeship positions, according to the district court. Obama then nominated Ellis on  May 6, 2013 , to a seat vacated by Joan B. Gottschall.\n \n\n   \n  “Sara Ellis and Andrea Wood are both experienced attorneys in federal court practice,” said former Chief Judge James Holderman in a  statement  following the nomination. “I have no doubt that they will be outstanding district judges on our court.”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a Senate questionnaire, Ellis  said  her goal is “to adhere to the rule of law and apply the law in a fair and impartial manner.” She also said she aimed to treat “all litigants with courtesy, respect, and an even hand” and resolve legal issues “promptly, decisively, and after thorough application of the relevant legal principles to the facts at hand.”\n \n\n   \n  “I have been a zealous advocate for my clients regardless of their political beliefs, financial standing, or their role in the case as plaintiff or defendant,” Ellis wrote, adding she has represented members of law enforcement as well as criminal defendants.\n \n\n   \n  At her confirmation hearing, Ellis said she believes a judge should work “efficiently and expediently because justice delayed is justice denied.”\n \n\n   \n  The Senate confirmed Ellis by voice vote in October 2013.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I am an immigrant just like you’\n \n\n   \n  Born in Ontario, Canada, to Jamaican-born parents in 1969, Ellis became a US citizen at age 15, according to  Senate records . In 2017, Ellis  compared  her own swearing in as a new citizen to that of 117 United States citizens she swore in.\n \n\n   \n  “Thirty years ago, I took this very same oath. I am an immigrant just like you,” she said at the time. Ellis then asked a new citizen from Syria to lead the Pledge of Allegiance as the group rose and placed their hands over their hearts.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis remembered the “very hot, cramped immigration office” in Indianapolis as she stood next to her brother and sister. Giving her oath of allegiance to the US was an extremely powerful experience for her, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I was moved by those words then, and I continue to be moved by those words 30 years later,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  At the time,   Trump had issued an executive order banning travel from seven countries and all refugees from entry into the US. Although Ellis hadn’t mentioned Trump by name, her message had a clear target audience.\n \n\n   \n  “There are very negative things that have been said and negative opinions that have been voiced,” Ellis said at the ceremony. “I want you to know and believe in your heart that you are welcome here.”\n \n\n   \n    Ellis ‘dispenses justice with patience and firmness’\n \n\n   \n  As a judge, Ellis has ruled on a wide range of issues,   from public health to voter registration records.\n \n\n   \n  “What stands out about Judge Ellis as a judge is the kindness, compassion, and humanity that she routinely displays through her rulings and interactions with litigants,” Ziegelmueller said.\n \n\n   \n  Safer said Ellis “dispenses justice with patience and firmness. She decides.” He added Ellis was never on the  “Biden list, ” which refers to federal judges who have a significant number of case motions pending for long periods.\n \n\n   \n  “She controls her courtroom not by demanded obedience – although she will do so if necessary – but by commanding respect,” Safer said, adding she has an “iron will.”\n \n\n   \n  One notable case in 2020 involved a  lawsuit  by the Illinois Republican Party. Ellis denied a motion for an injunction against Gov. JB Pritzker’s executive order that placed gathering size restrictions on political parties, finding the state was not treating political parties differently from other similar groups.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, a case brought by Judicial Watch sought access to Illinois voter registration records and to remove allegedly ineligible voters. Ellis dismissed part of the case for lack of standing. The case is ongoing, with the only remaining claim alleging Illinois failed to make reasonable efforts to remove ineligible voters due to a change of residence.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2023, Ellis has served as a board member of the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education agency for US federal courts. Ellis has also been a key player in the  court’s reentry program , Safer said.\n \n\n   \n    Ellis’ ruling ‘will be measured and it will be sound’\n \n\n   \n  As Trump intensifies his immigration crackdown during his second term, Ellis’ rulings regarding the Chicago-area protests have received sharp criticism from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “DHS will continue to oppose all efforts to vilify law enforcement and prop up the cause of violent rioters,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin  told  The Associated Press after Ellis indicated in court her temporary restraining order would be expanded to require agents wear body cameras during immigration enforcement. “Were a court to enter such an order in the future, that would be an extreme act of judicial activism.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis declined to be interviewed for this story.\n \n\n   \n  The controversial immigration operation in Chicago has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since it began in September and has drawn legal challenges from plaintiffs who accuse federal agents of shooting pepper balls and tear gas at demonstrators.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis last week told Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino he must be in court daily for a week as she considers reports federal agents were not following her order to limit aggressive tactics and warn protesters and journalists before using tear gas and less-lethal munitions. Bovino had been ordered to appear in court after plaintiffs accused him of  throwing a tear gas canister  into a crowd of demonstrators without justification or warning – a characterization DHS has rebutted.   \n \n\n   \n  But the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday wiped away Ellis’ order mandating check-ins, saying she had overstepped her authority.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration argued Bovino having to appear before Ellis would be “extraordinarily disruptive” and “irreparably harming the government.”\n \n\n   \n  A hearing to determine whether Ellis should convert her temporary restraining order into a longer-lasting preliminary injunction is scheduled for Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the case will go moving forward, but Safer says Ellis’ ruling “will be measured and it will be sound.” She will take the time to gather the facts and rule based on what is right under the law without dragging the case out, Safer expects.\n \n\n   \n  “If the federal government thinks they can trifle with her and her orders, it is because they brought in people from Washington who do not know her. If the plaintiffs think she will go outside the law to protect people just because her heart goes out to them, they will be disappointed,” Safer said.\n \n\n   \n  “If Mr. Bovino thinks he is tougher than she is, he will find that he is sadly mistaken.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/china-nexperia-chip-exports","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"04:02:00-05:00","title":"China backs off chip export ban that could have shut down global auto plants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China reversed its export ban on critical automotive chips supplied by Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands, to prevent widespread shutdowns of global auto plants.

His opponents, meanwhile, have revamped their campaigns to try to cut into the front-runner’s support.\n \n\n   \n  Here are seven stories to get you up to speed on Tuesday’s election:\n \n\n   \n    First, Andrew Cuomo’s primary campaign collapsed\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo entered the mayoral race as the frontrunner despite sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied, that forced him to resign from office in 2021. But the former governor relied on name recognition and donor support instead of building out an extensive ground game, leading to his surprise loss in the June Democratic primary to Mamdani.\n \n\n   \n  “Mamdani’s historic expansion of the electorate, his tapping into the hunger for a leftward lurch and fresh voice, defied almost every poll and expert’s expectation,”  CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere reported . “But all but a few involved with the Cuomo campaign acknowledge, at least privately, how much they did wrong.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic socialists were emboldened and started talking primary challenges\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s surprise win emboldened the democratic socialists in New York City, who warned they were  considering primary challenges  against five incumbent House Democrats, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Jeffries’ team nicknamed the potential challengers “Team Gentrification.”\n \n\n   \n    Mamdani pivoted from anti-police rhetoric\n \n\n   \n  Part of Mamdani’s efforts to broaden his coalition has included  reaching out to police officers  and stepping away from his past calls to defund the police. The mayoral candidate met with off-duty police officers and held meetings on the proposals in his public safety agenda, which would overhaul the way the city approaches its most vulnerable residents.\n \n\n   \n    The Republican with many cats\n \n\n   \n  New York City hasn’t had a Republican mayor since Michael Bloomberg left office in 2013. But Republicans did not fully rally around their nominee:  Sliwa , a radio host, a founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol group, and a famous fan of fostering cats. Sliwa has campaigned by riding the subway and running on a tough-on-crime platform. He argued that his longtime ties to the city might help him reach voters who are otherwise opposed to Republican candidates. To the end, he refused to withdraw from the race despite pressure from Cuomo and others who wanted to consolidate the anti-Mamdani opposition.\n \n\n   \n  “When they come up to me, they don’t say, ‘Oh, the Republican,’” Sliwa told CNN. “They don’t see me as a politician. They see me as one of them, which is rare.”\n \n\n   \n    The diverse street at the center of the race\n \n\n   \n  Roosevelt Avenue, a diverse street in Queens that is also a hotspot for sex work,  became a focal point in the mayoral race  and debates over quality of life. Mamdani’s opponents criticized his support for decriminalizing sex work, pointing to it as evidence that he is soft on crime. Cuomo also hoped to use the issue to reach South Asian and Muslim voters. Mamdani has clarified that he doesn’t support legalizing sex work, but that he backs decriminalizing the practice between consenting adults.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not think that we should be prosecuting women who are struggling, who are currently being thrown in jail,” Mamdani said at a mayoral debate.\n \n\n   \n    Many Jewish voters felt they had bad options\n \n\n   \n  For many Jewish New Yorkers, the New York City mayoral election has become emotionally fraught.  Some voters who spoke with CNN  said they were reluctant to support Mamdani due to his pro-Palestinian activism and criticisms of Israel’s government. Mamdani sought to reach out to Jewish New Yorkers, but the most recent pre-election polls still showed Cuomo drawing around 55% of the Jewish vote.\n \n\n   \n    A different kind of potential first lady\n \n\n   \n  Rama Duwaji, Mamdani’s 28-year-old artist wife,  carved her own path  ahead of potentially becoming New York City’s next first lady. She was not a high-profile surrogate for the campaign. Instead, her influence was felt behind the scenes and on social media, where she promoted her artwork focused on Middle Eastern women and the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-cuomo-new-york-mayor","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:06:00-05:00","title":"Trump urges New Yorkers to vote for Cuomo for mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has strongly urged New Yorkers to vote for former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the upcoming New York City mayoral election, calling him 'capable' and dismissing Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani as a 'communist' and unfit.

Alejandra Jaramillo, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:06 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump urged New Yorkers in his strongest terms yet to vote for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the city’s mayoral race on the eve of the election.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job,” the president wrote on Truth Social on Monday, adding that Cuomo “is capable of it” and that Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani “is not!”\n \n\n   \n  His backing of Cuomo, whom he described as having a “Record of Success,” could hurt the former governor with Democrats as much as it helps him with Republicans in deep-blue New York City. Mamdani, who shocked Cuomo in June’s Democratic primary, has repeatedly tied the former governor to Trump and argued that he would stand up to powerful interests in both New York and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo on Monday dismissed Trump’s endorsement, insisting that the president was simply opposing Mamdani. “He’s not endorsing me. He’s opposing Mamdani,” Cuomo said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a Queens native, has long complained about Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, and falsely labeled him a communist. He again vowed to pull federal funds from the city if Mamdani wins Tuesday “other than the very minimum as required.”\n \n\n   \n  In response, Mamdani told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday night that the president is threatened by his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “Like his (campaign), we’ve diagnosed the crisis in working class New Yorkers’ lives, the cost of living. But unlike him, we’re actually going to deliver on that. And that is a contrast that he can’t bear to see,” Mamdani said on “OutFront.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani had reacted to Trump’s backing of Cuomo earlier Monday at a canvas event in his Assembly district in Queens.\n \n\n   \n  “The MAGA movement’s embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump’s understanding that this would be the best mayor for him. Not the best mayor for New York City, not the best mayor for New Yorkers, but the best mayor for Donald Trump and his administration,” Mamdani said.\n \n\n   \n  The president previously offered tepid support for Cuomo, casting the election as a choice between the better of two bad options, while discounting the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a fan of Cuomo one way or another, but if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,” Trump told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani quickly seized on Trump’s comments in that interview, posting his congratulations to Cuomo on X on Sunday and adding, “I know how hard you worked for this.”\n \n\n   \n  The Republican president discouraged voters from backing Sliwa, though he’s stopped short of explicitly demanding the Republican nominee leave the race as other Cuomo backers have.\n \n\n   \n  “A vote for Curtis Sliwa (who looks much better without the beret!) is a vote for Mamdani,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Surveys of likely voters have been  largely consistent i n showing Mamdani with a double-digit lead over Cuomo, with Sliwa in third. They differ on the precise scope of Mamdani’s advantage, although most have found him shy of clearing a majority of support in the race.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a Trump ally, also endorsed Cuomo on Monday over Mamdani and Sliwa. “Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he purchased in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo has  a long history  with Trump dating back to his time as governor prior to his 2021 resignation facing sexual harassment allegations that he’s denied. The two tussled during the Covid-19 pandemic with often-dueling press briefings. But the former New York governor has presented his dealings with Trump as a plus for New York City, arguing that Mamdani is too inexperienced to handle the president.\n \n\n   \n  “You will hear from Andrew Cuomo about his experience as if the issue is that we don’t know about it,” Mamdani retorted  during one debate . “The issue is that we have all experienced your experience.”\n \n\n   \n  The president — who’s holding telerallies for Virginia and New Jersey audiences Monday night — had his focus trained on the Empire State on social media, lashing out at Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who campaigned with Mamdani over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  He accused her of “killing the entire region with Energy Prices that are OUT OF CONTROL” and said he’d ask Transportation Secretary Dean Duffy “to take a good, long look at terminating New York City Congestion Pricing.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Gloria Pazmino, Aditi Sangal and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/snap-benefits-november-most-affected-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"10:15:00-05:00","title":"Millions of Americans Face Delays in SNAP Food Assistance Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown, millions of Americans relying on SNAP food assistance are facing significant delays in receiving their benefits, with the Trump administration agreeing to use emergency funds to provide only half of the usual monthly allotment.

At stake are tens of billions of dollars in revenue the administration has already collected and potentially trillions more – and the resolution of a power struggle that both sides have framed in existential terms.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some key points to watch as the nine justices take their seats to hear the case at 10 am ET.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do it?\n \n\n   \n  The blockbuster battle over tariffs will likely be decided based on how a majority of the court defines a single word: “regulate.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to levy the import duties. That law allows a president to “regulate … importation” during emergencies. The administration argues the word plainly includes the power to impose tariffs, since tariffs are the most common way a government regulates imports.\n \n\n   \n  But the  small- and medium-sized businesses challenging  Trump note that the law – at no point – uses the words “tariffs” or “duties.” A far more logical reading of the law, they say, is that it allows a president to impose sanctions on other countries during emergencies. After all, they point out, Trump has  other laws at his disposal  that he could use to raise tariffs to deal with trade imbalances.\n \n\n   \n  It’s just that those other laws have limits and IEEPA, for the most part, does not.\n \n\n   \n  Lower courts have consistently sided against Trump in the two cases now before the Supreme Court, though they have spelled out different rationales and implications – something the Justice Department has pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  In one case, led by V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based wine and spirits company, a divided Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that IEEPA might permit some tariffs, just not the  widespread duties Trump has carried out . In another case, led by an educational toy company called Learning Resources, a federal district court in Washington, DC, ruled that the law likely didn’t grant the president power to impose the tariffs at all.\n \n\n   \n    Enter Joe Biden\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court was clear in  case  after  case  involving President Joe Biden that an administration cannot take certain actions without explicit authorization from Congress. That is particularly true, the court has  repeatedly ruled , when policies involve “major” political or economic questions.\n \n\n   \n  Two years ago, the court’s conservative majority relied on what’s known as the “major questions doctrine” to block  Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan . A year earlier, the court stopped Biden’s vaccine and testing requirement for 84 million Americans, concluding that Congress never explicitly gave the government the power to demand those measures during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  The small businesses challenging Trump say the same logic should apply to the tariffs. The law Trump is relying on, they point out, never uses the word “tariff.”\n \n\n   \n  How the conservative justices wrestle with that argument may tell observers everything they need to know about where the court is heading in this case.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has offered the court a few arguments to bypass the doctrine that was repeatedly used against Biden. First, the administration says, those earlier cases involved agencies taking action – like the Department of Education when it came to student loan forgiveness. Second, Trump argues, the tariffs implicate foreign affairs, where a president has long been given a lot of leeway by the other branches.\n \n\n   \n  If key justices quickly distinguish the Biden-era cases on one of those grounds, that will be a good sign for the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n    Enter Richard Nixon\n \n\n   \n  Trump is relying, at least in part, on a similar effort undertaken by President Richard Nixon more than five decades ago.\n \n\n   \n  Back in 1971, Nixon imposed a 10% tariff on all imports – which the administration later justified under the Trading with the Enemy Act, a precursor to IEEPA that was enacted during World War I. Notably, that law used identical language to give the president authority to “regulate” imports. And at the time, a federal appeals court approved those tariffs with the same language.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in Congress were clearly aware of that when they enacted IEEPA with that same language. And that, the Department of Justice has argued, “strongly indicates that both Congress and the public contemporaneously understood that language to encompass tariffs.”\n \n\n   \n  The businesses challenging Trump have balked at that logic. They agree that Congress kept the “regulate” language in place for emergencies but said that, in response to Nixon, Congress also passed a law with clear instructions for when a president could unilaterally impose tariffs to address a trade imbalance.\n \n\n   \n  Trump doesn’t want to use that law, however, because it imposes limits on tariffs – capping them at 15% and permitting them for only 150 days.\n \n\n   \n  How the court’s conservatives weigh that history could influence the outcome of the case, particularly if some signal that Trump’s actions have no historic precedent.\n \n\n   \n    Tariff or a tax?\n \n\n   \n  For years,  economists have shaken their heads  as the president and other White House officials have repeatedly described tariffs as a duty paid by foreign companies. The debate over how to depict the tariffs has taken on legal significance in the case before the Supreme Court, and how the justices deal with it could provide clues about their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The  small- and medium-sized businesses challenging the tariffs  call them a tax, which they note falls squarely within the power of Congress under the Constitution to levy – not a president. Because tariffs are paid “primarily by American businesses,” and ultimately American consumers, the plaintiffs told the Supreme Court in written arguments, the president’s tariffs have “equated to the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.”\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps sensing the danger in that argument, the Department of Justice spent a significant portion of its most recent brief in late October distinguishing between tariffs and taxes. US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate attorney, blasted the plaintiffs for relying on a “repeated, false equivalence between domestic revenue-raising taxes and regulatory tariffs on foreign imports.”\n \n\n   \n  What Trump has imposed under IEEPA, Sauer said, are “regulatory tariffs” on foreign imports to “deal with foreign threats,” which he said, “crucially differ from domestic taxation.”\n \n\n   \n    Vassal States of America\n \n\n   \n  After floating the idea of attending the oral arguments in person on Wednesday, Trump said over the weekend  he would skip the session .\n \n\n   \n  Even though the president will be elsewhere, his heightened rhetoric is all over the case. The Justice Department has used unusually striking language to warn the justices about what might happen if the court ultimately rules against the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Sauer has quoted administration officials framing a loss as a “catastrophic” and “ruinous” outcome that would lead to a “dangerous diplomatic embarrassment.” Upholding the lower courts, the administration said, would “accelerate the drift toward America’s decline into a vassal state.”\n \n\n   \n  That language is clearly designed to give the justices pause about the practical implications of their decision, even though the court’s conservatives have long espoused the idea that they make decisions based on the law as they find it, not on potential consequences.\n \n\n   \n  It will be worth watching whether Sauer doubles down on that strategy as he looks up at the bench on Wednesday from the podium.\n \n\n   \n  In response, a dozen states that oppose the administration, criticized the Justice Department for its “hyperbolic rhetoric” and quoted from a  concurring opinion from three conservative justices  – Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas – when the court tossed out Biden’s vaccine requirements.\n \n\n   \n  “The question, as in other recent cases of executive overreach, is: ‘Who decides?’” the states wrote. “Congress, not the president, decides whether and how much to tax Americans who import goods from abroad.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/china/china-xi-laughing-images-apec-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"11:48:00-05:00","title":"The White House has shared images of Xi Jinping that most Chinese don’t see at home","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House released images of Xi Jinping during a bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump at the APEC summit in South Korea, showing a more relaxed and approachable side of the Chinese leader—contrasting with the serious, state-controlled image he projects domestically.

China’s most powerful Communist leader in decades has built a reputation reinforced by state media during his 12-year rule as a serious and steady hand.\n \n\n   \n  But images released by the White House show a different side of Xi – and one not apparent in images published at home.\n \n\n   \n   Xi attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) summit in South Korea, where he met US President Donald Trump for a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base in Busan.\n \n\n   \n  All eyes were on how the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies would sort out their differences on a range of topics from soybeans and fentanyl to rare earth minerals and high-end computer chips.\n \n\n   \n  But aside from the hard-hitting diplomacy, photographs released by the White House captured a rare candid moment between the two leaders.\n \n\n   \n  In a room filled with suited diplomats, Trump was seen in one image with his arm stretched across the negotiation table to show Xi a piece of paper. Whatever was written or printed on the paper remains unknown.\n \n\n   \n  In another image, the Chinese leader appears to grin with his eyes shut, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi laughing by his side. It’s unclear if the images were arranged in chronological order.\n \n\n   \n  Two days later, Xi was caught on camera cracking a joke when he exchanged gifts with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung, according to a Reuters video.\n \n\n   \n  Lee first presented Xi with a wooden board for the chess game Go. Then, the Chinese leader gave Lee and his wife two  China -made Xiaomi phones, which an official said came with displays made in South Korea, home to electronic giants Samsung and LG.\n \n\n   \n  Lee then jokingly asked: “How is the communication security?” drawing laughter from the room.\n \n\n   \n  Xi, who was also laughing at this point, replied: “You can check if there’s a backdoor.”\n \n\n   \n  A backdoor risk refers to a hidden method of accessing a user’s device without them knowing. The issue has prompted a raft of allegations between China and other countries.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing has recently expressed concerns over a US proposal to have advanced chips sold abroad fitted with tracking, a suggestion that prompted  US chipmaker Nvidia to say its chips had no “backdoors.”  Meanwhile, numerous Western countries have raised cybersecurity concerns regarding certain China-made devices.\n \n\n   \n  The two off-the-cuff moments from Xi contrast with his carefully crafted image at home, where he was recently shown  presiding over a military parade in a Mao suit , an outfit associated with Mao Zedong, Communist China’s founding father.\n \n\n   \n  Before his meeting with Trump, he chaired a party  plenum , delivering speeches in a stoic demonstration of his tight control over China’s political apparatus.\n \n\n   \n  Not all Chinese leaders projected such a tightly constructed image.\n \n\n   \n  Xi’s predecessor Jiang Zemin, who served as president between 1993 and 2003, was known for his flamboyant personality, cosmopolitan flair and willingness to show off his language skills and interact with journalists.\n \n\n   \n  However, Xi has charted a different course. Along with curbing freedom of expression in China, he has maintained strict control of his image and the flow of information. Elite politics has become so opaque under his rule that pundits look for any clue for China’s direction – from parsing Xi’s words for their real meaning to assessing the  color of his hair. \n \n\n   \n  Xi’s more relaxed international appearances in South Korea barely made it to China’s tightly controlled internet. Censors often remove any coverage of Xi that deviates from the official narrative in the country, where most Western news websites and social media platforms are banned.\n \n\n   \n  Footage and images showing Xi’s light-hearted exchanges with his US and South Korean counterparts were nowhere to be found on two of the country’s most popular social media platforms: Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, and Xiaohongshu.\n \n\n   \n  A few posts by Chinese-language news outlets based outside of China that reported Xi’s gift exchange with South Korea’s Lee were available on X-like platform Weibo.\n \n\n   \n  The posts only displayed a few users’ comments despite hundreds of messages.

 Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s  Election Day 2025 . And the results in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere Tuesday could be some of the most significant dominoes to fall in the federal government shutdown, which is set to become the longest in history on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  But the election isn’t the only X factor in the monthlong shutdown that’s evolving even as we speak.\n \n\n   \n  Let’s check in on a number of key variables and sources of potential leverage in the shutdown and how they’re playing.\n \n\n   \n    Election Day 2025\n \n\n   \n  The big ones to watch here are the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  (The New York City mayor’s race and a redistricting ballot measure in California are fascinating for other reasons, but less instructive when it comes to Republican vs. Democrat power dynamics.)\n \n\n   \n  The blue lean of these two states and the history of these races suggest Democrats should win both gubernatorial races. Generally speaking, the party that just lost the presidential race  tends to overperform . This year, that’s Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats win each race by comfortable margins — say by double digits — they’ll probably feel pretty good about how they’ve handled the shutdown. A good election night might leave them emboldened to press forward.\n \n\n   \n  That could especially be the case if Rep. Abigail Spanberger wins big in Virginia, given it’s home to so many government employees who are feeling the brunt of the shutdown. (The most recent polls suggest Spanberger leads, on average, by around 10 points.)\n \n\n   \n  But Republicans have been optimistic about making it a competitive race in New Jersey, which swung significantly in President Donald Trump’s direction in 2024. If Republican Jack Ciattarelli can keep it close with Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Democrats might start second-guessing their shutdown strategy.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans also appear to have real hope of winning the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race and especially the state’s attorney general’s race — though the latter owes mostly to the Democratic candidate’s  violent texts .\n \n\n   \n    Obamacare open enrollment\n \n\n   \n  This is the big source of potential leverage for Democrats. But it’s too early to say how it’s playing.\n \n\n   \n  Open enrollment for millions of people who get their health insurance  through the Obamacare marketplaces  began on Saturday. In other words, that’s when many people began to see their premiums would double next year.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have been demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies that would prevent those huge premium increases, in exchange for funding the government. And the optimistic case for them is that people seeing these premiums about to rise would ratchet up pressure on Republicans to give in.\n \n\n   \n  Some Republicans, including  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia and  Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio , have warned the GOP about the political cost of not extending the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  We know that  north of 70% of Americans  have said they support extending the subsidies. The question for Republicans now is whether they think they might have to extend the subsidies either during or after the shutdown. If they start getting more pressure from their constituents, that could force them to act.\n \n\n   \n    SNAP benefits\n \n\n   \n  These food stamp benefits have been in limbo since Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration signaled Monday that it would  provide partial benefits  — $4.65 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s contingency fund — after a federal judge ordered it to find a solution.\n \n\n   \n  But notably, the administration declined to attempt to provide full benefits, which would cost roughly $9 billion for the month. And it made clear that it wasn’t going to strain too hard on the subject.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have been clear that they believe these benefits being withheld provides leverage in the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson last week told CNN’s Dana Bash that passing a bill to fully fund SNAP benefits would “reduce the pressure” on Democrats to vote to reopen the government.\n \n\n   \n  So is he right?\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps these benefits not being paid in full and on time does provide leverage — in the sense that no one wants to be blamed for Americans going hungry.\n \n\n   \n  But from a partisan standpoint, polls continue to show  more Americans blame Republicans than Democrats  for the shutdown. And the Republicans’ handling of SNAP in recent days could signal to Americans that it’s they who have stood in the way of a fully funded program.\n \n\n   \n  After all, Johnson was rejecting a push from some in his own party, including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, to pass legislation.\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday called the Trump administration’s partial SNAP funding “an intentional decision not to pay full benefits.”\n \n\n   \n  Beyond that, the White House has also risked seeming tone-deaf on the financial pain of the shutdown in recent weeks. Not only has it set about demolishing the East Wing  for a ballroom  costing hundreds of millions of dollars (which Trump says is privately funded), but the president late last week proudly promoted a renovation of the  Lincoln Bedroom bathroom . And on Friday night, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort played host to  a “Great Gatsby”-themed event .\n \n\n   \n  Those are perhaps not the best optics.\n \n\n   \n    Paying the troops\n \n\n   \n  While the administration hasn’t bent over backward on SNAP benefits, it’s taken a more urgent posture toward military paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  For the second time, the administration on Friday  found funding  to make sure the military paychecks went out.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has made clear that he would like to be perceived as a political ally of the troops. He has repeatedly  attacked Democrats in speeches to the military  in recent weeks — a highly questionable breach of norms.\n \n\n   \n  “I want you to know that despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny,” Trump told members of the Navy last month.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have expressed warnings about Trump trying to wield the military for political purposes. And at some point, they might worry that enabling him to look like the savior of troops’ paychecks plays into his hands.\n \n\n   \n    Air travel\n \n\n   \n  This is perhaps the biggest X factor right now. But it’s really difficult to evaluate the politics of it.\n \n\n   \n  This weekend marked the  worst one for air traffic control staffing shortages  since the shutdown began, according to a CNN analysis. And that notably came just days after Federal Aviation Administration employees  missed their first full paycheck .\n \n\n   \n  There have now been more than 400 staffing shortages, as of Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, meanwhile,  told CNBC  on Monday that he would “shut the whole airspace down” if he felt travel was unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  The fact that we are seeing significant slowdown in air travel probably plays somewhat like the SNAP issue — generally applying pressure on lawmakers to come to a resolution but not necessarily providing one side significantly more leverage than the other.\n \n\n   \n  The Thanksgiving travel season could up that pressure, however, as travel delays become more acute.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/travel/japan-expensive-rice-kinmemai-premium-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:49:00Z","title":"From hunger to luxury: The story behind the world’s most expensive rice","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the story behind Kinmemai Premium, a rare and expensive rice variety from Toyo Rice Corporation in Japan, certified by Guinness World Records in 2016 as the world’s most expensive rice.

    9:49 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Holding an elegant black box embossed with the words “World’s Best Rice” in gold, Japanese chef Kenichi Fujimoto tilts his head and smiles — a flicker of skepticism on his face.\n \n\n   \n  “These things are often very commercial and not necessarily good,” says the Hong Kong-based chef/owner of Sushi Fujimoto, gesturing at the pot of rice simmering in his kitchen.\n \n\n   \n  With more than 20 years of experience working under Michelin-starred sushi masters, the chef has encountered countless varieties of rice. Nothing like this, though.\n \n\n   \n  Not only do the makers of Kinmemai Premium claim that it’s the world’s best rice, but in 2016 Guinness World Records certified it as the  most expensive .\n \n\n   \n  Does it live up to the claim? CNN drafted in Fujimoto to help answer that question. The grains have been rinsed and soaked before they’re placed inside a cast-iron pot of water and heated.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an important test for a Japanese chef. “Rice is Japan’s soul food,” says Fujimoto. “For sushi, rice is the most important part — 80% of good sushi comes from the rice and 20% from the fish,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  The clock is now counting down to the moment of truth.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll know in 15 minutes.”\n \n\n   \n    Only 1,000 boxes produced each year\n \n\n   \n  Rice has been a sacred staple in Japan for around 3,000 years.\n \n\n   \n  Today, there are more than 300 varieties commonly cultivated around the country, with new varieties constantly under development.\n \n\n   \n  Dishes and beverages made with Japanese rice — sushi, mochi cakes and sake — have gained international fame in recent decades. Rice exports, however, have never achieved the same levels of success.\n \n\n   \n  Enter Keiji Saika, the now 91-year-old president of Toyo Rice Corporation. In 2016, he decided to take promotion of the staple into his own hands.\n \n\n   \n  Based in Wakayama, his company sells rice milling machines as well as Kinmemai, directly translated as “Golden Sprout Rice”, a variety prized for its nutritional value and taste.\n \n\n   \n  “I felt that Japan needed to better appeal to the international community about how great Japanese rice is,” Saika tells CNN Travel in an interview at the company’s Tokyo office.\n \n\n   \n  The challenge? Boost the global profile of Japanese rice without blowing the company’s marketing budget.\n \n\n   \n  “That was when the idea of Guinness World Records came to me. We’d have to do something that’s never been done before,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Confident that he had produced the world’s most delicious rice, Saika introduced Kinmemai Premium to the market that same year, selling it for a whopping 9,496 Japanese yen for a box of 840 grams — or about $109 per kilogram in 2016.\n \n\n   \n  “At a time when typical rice cost only 300 yen to 400 yen per kilogram, I wondered if anyone would actually buy it. Surprisingly, enquiries started increasing,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  What began as a one-off has since become an annual release, thanks to unrelenting demand. This year, boxes of Kinmemai Premium hit the market for 10,800 yen, or $73.4 apiece.\n \n\n   \n  With only 1,000 produced, they sold out quickly after their August 22 launch.\n \n\n   \n    Why doesn’t it make money?\n \n\n   \n  As Toyo Rice prepares to mark the project’s 10th anniversary in 2026, Saika emphasizes that profiting from the expensive rice was never his plan.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, when you calculate the costs, we’re probably running at a loss. Even though we sell it at a high price, it’s not profitable,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, the initiative was meant to raise the profile of Japanese rice and encourage farmers to cultivate higher-quality strains. Saika calls it the “World’s Best Rice” project — one of many innovations driven by his determination to improve Japanese rice production.\n \n\n   \n  In the 1970s he developed rinse-free rice to conserve water. Two decades ago, his company created a new milling machine that removes only nine layers of bran instead of the usual 16, preserving nutrients and flavors.\n \n\n   \n  But to create Kinmemai Premium, the Guinness World Record version, the process is more complicated.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, Saika selects four to six top-class, award-winning rice varieties from a pool of about 5,000 entries. The International Contest on Rice Taste Evaluation, hosted by the Syokumi Kanteisi — The Rice Taste Appraiser Association — is the largest of its kind in Japan.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond flavor and texture, Saika tests the enzyme levels of each variety of rice.\n \n\n   \n  “That vitality, that life force, can be clearly identified through enzyme activity. Rice with strong vitality like that becomes truly exceptional,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Only the grains with the highest vitality are chosen. Then comes aging.\n \n\n   \n  “Letting the rice sit for a few months enhances the flavor even more. The taste becomes richer, and the health benefits seem to improve as well. So this rice is truly special,” Saika says.\n \n\n   \n  The painstaking process, combined with limited supply, makes Kinmemai Premium costly to produce. The rice is often given as a luxury gift, used to mark special occasions or impress corporate clients.\n \n\n   \n  Farmers chosen for the year’s  “World’s Best Rice” project are flown to Tokyo for the grand reveal.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone seems to take great pride in it,” says Saika. “This was an unexpected effect, but rice producers work hard toward that goal every year. As when they do that, it gets featured prominently in the local newspapers with a note that it’s been ‘selected as an ingredient for the World’s Best Rice.’”\n \n\n   \n  This year’s Kinmemai Premium features a blend of four rice varieties: there are two styles of Koshihikari Rice, from Gifu and Nagano prefectures, respectively, and two types of Yudai 21 Rice – also from Gifu and Nagano.\n \n\n   \n    Driven by hunger\n \n\n   \n  Saika’s devotion to rice is connected in his childhood. After World War II ended in 1945, Japan faced severe food shortages.\n \n\n   \n  The country was depending on the fall harvest to ease the crisis, but Typhoon Makurazaki hit Kagoshima, the southwestern tip of Japan, before moving north, devastating farmlands.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people died of starvation. Even judges — and those in important positions and the upper class,” Saika recalls.\n \n\n   \n  His family survived by planting whatever seeds they could find and catching eels, catfish and birds. This experience instilled in him a profound appreciation for rice and a mission to produce better grains.\n \n\n   \n  For him, Kinmemai Premium embodies that passion. But even he doesn’t have an unlimited supply.\n \n\n   \n  “(I eat it) just once a year when they ask me to taste that year’s rice. Just a little bit,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Hiroshi Matsumoto, head chef at the company’s in-house sushi restaurant, says he became an instant fan after trying the rice for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember it was so delicious that one bowl just wasn’t enough, and I found myself wanting a second one.” Still, he doesn’t serve it with sushi. “It’s best served warm, part of a set meal,” he says.\n \n\n   \n    Independent taste tests\n \n\n   \n  Back in Fujimoto’s kitchen the Kinmemai Premium — a gift from Toyo Rice — has been cooked and now sits steaming in the black, cast-iron pot.\n \n\n   \n  Usually, the chef would perform several test runs with a new rice to figure out the best soaking times, water levels and cooking temperatures. But with only 420 grams of Kinmemai Premium to play with, he’s had to improvise.\n \n\n   \n  Fujimoto rinsed the rice for a mere second and soaked it for 30 minutes — 30 minutes less than the recommended time — before adding it to the pot.\n \n\n   \n  His initial assessment? “Nice, clear color. I like it.” His wife Ai’s take? “Whoa. Shiny.”\n \n\n   \n  “Like a diamond,” adds Fujimoto. “You can see every grain standing out, which usually indicates good quality. The shape is beautiful, and the aroma is nicely balanced — not too strong.”\n \n\n   \n  Tasting it, he gives his approval.\n \n\n   \n  “The flavor is well-balanced. The texture is good. It has nice moisture. This rice will appeal to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  Is he tempted to buy the rice for his restaurant?\n \n\n   \n  “No, no, no. It’s too expensive — we’d have to triple our prices,” he laughs.\n \n\n   \n  Like Toyo’s in-house chef, he also believes the rice is better served plain, more suited to a  kaiseki  restaurant, an establishment serving traditional refined dishes. “I think this rice isn’t really suited for sushi. It might get mushy if mixed with vinegar,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  Chef Nansen Lai owns several Hong Kong restaurants including Flower Drum and Lai’s Kitchen – the latter of which specializes in clay pot rice. He also sampled the Kinmemai Premium, comparing it with his house blend — a mix of Thai fragrant rice and Koshihikari, another high-quality grain, from Japan’s Niigata prefecture.\n \n\n   \n  “It looks stickier and doesn’t have as strong a rice fragrance as Thai rice, which is a normal difference between Thai and Japanese rice,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  He takes a bite.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s delicious, with a much more complex taste and flavor than our house rice,” says Lai, before inviting his staff to try it.\n \n\n   \n  “From a restaurateur’s perspective, we can’t afford rice like this. We also need a firmer rice, like Thai rice, that can stand up to stronger sauces. But this rice is so tasty you could eat it plain.”\n \n\n   \n  Both Lai and Fujimoto agree that Toyo Rice’s project is a useful way to motivate producers.\n \n\n   \n  “Rice farmers are struggling. With costs like machines and gas prices rising, rice prices haven’t really changed much for the last 30 or 40 years. Japanese farmers didn’t enjoy the benefit of the raised retail prices. If they can’t make a living, young people will not continue the family business,” says Fujimoto.\n \n\n   \n    For a better future\n \n\n   \n  At 91, Saika remains vigorous, still going to work every day.\n \n\n   \n  “Today I’m wearing a suit, but usually I’m in work clothes, doing various tasks in the factory,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “There are quite a lot of elderly people who stay healthy. (Most) go to karaoke, play golf, or do exercises, but not many come to a company.”\n \n\n   \n  The secret to his health? Rice, of course. His passion for the staple drives him to keep working.\n \n\n   \n  “At this age, I care about the development of myself and the company, but my biggest concern is Japan’s future,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how many more years I’ll live, but during that time, I want to develop things that will be useful to society. I don’t have much time, so I’m busy every day.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-nigeria-military-action-threat","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-20:42","title":"Trump Reacts to Christian Persecution in Nigeria, Calls for U.S. Military Action","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump, after viewing a Fox News segment on Christian persecution in Nigeria, became immediately concerned and declared the country a 'Country of Particular Concern' under the International Religious Freedom Act.

Within an hour, he was laser-focused on Christians’ treatment in Nigeria \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Kevin Liptak, Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:42 PM EST, Mon November 3, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump was heading to Florida on Friday, watching Fox News, when he saw the network run a story on how Christians were being targeted by Islamic groups in Nigeria, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president was “immediately” angered by it, one of the sources said, and asked to get further read in on the issue. Shortly after Air Force One touched down in West Palm Beach, he began posting on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter,” he posted, adding that he is making Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official told CNN the president has “been tracking this issue previously and had already begun thinking about Truthing it out.”\n \n\n   \n  From there, the plight of Christians in Nigeria became a focal point of Trump’s  throughout the weekend , leading him to call directly on his secretary of defense to “prepare for possible action” and warn the US would enter Nigeria “guns-a-blazing” to protect the Christian population of Africa’s most populous country.\n \n\n   \n  One of the sources familiar with Trump’s thinking on the issue told CNN that the president’s threats toward the country are meant to “see how Nigeria responds.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s an ‘Art of the Deal’”-type strategy, the source said. And a key part of it has already been met with the intended effect: The actions by Islamist groups are gaining attention thanks to his posts, they argued.\n \n\n   \n  “At President Trump’s direction, the Department of War is planning options for possible action to stop the killing of Christians in Nigeria,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CNN. “Any announcements will come from the President directly.”\n \n\n   \n  The plight of Nigeria’s Christians has been an animating subject for American conservatives for years, with some of Trump’s top allies, including Sen. Ted Cruz, in recent months calling for US intervention after claiming Nigeria’s government wasn’t doing enough to prevent attacks on Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Nigeria has denied the accusations, and both Christians and Muslims have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists in the country.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s directive to the Pentagon to “prepare for possible action” in Nigeria — including, in his telling, potential US boots on the ground — caught many by surprise, including in the military.\n \n\n   \n  Personnel within US Africa Command were abruptly recalled to headquarters over the weekend following Trump’s post on Saturday vowing potential military action in Nigeria, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The post left many wondering what the president wanted the military to do, the sources said. A small group of personnel with AFRICOM, which is based in Germany, were quickly recalled to discuss potential courses of action.\n \n\n   \n  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday that the Pentagon was “preparing for action,” and one of the sources said there was a request from the Pentagon to build out various contingency plans.\n \n\n   \n  It remained unclear what the plans entail, though creating contingency plans for a range of scenarios to provide to the president and secretary of defense is one of the primary functions of the military.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump was elected in a landslide victory to accomplish his peace through strength agenda. The Department of War stands ready to execute the Commander in Chief’s direction,” chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The snap-to reaction on Saturday was indicative of a broader frustration with the way potential policy decisions are relayed over social media, one of the sources familiar said, with little planning done ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, declined to rule out sending American troops to Nigeria to protect Christians there.\n \n\n   \n  “Could be,” Trump said when asked about the prospect of US troops or airstrikes. “I envisage a lot of things. They’re killing a record number of Christians in Nigeria,” the president told reporters, saying other countries in Africa were doing similar.\n \n\n   \n    The reality on the ground\n \n\n   \n  While Trump claimed a “mass slaughter” of Christians was underway in Nigeria, there exists a  more nuanced reality  on the ground. Both Christians and Muslims — the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people — have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists, experts and analysts say.\n \n\n   \n  The West African nation has grappled for years with deep-rooted security problems that are driven by various factors, including religiously motivated attacks. Observers say other violent conflicts arise from communal and ethnic tensions, as well as disputes between farmers and herders over limited access to natural resources.\n \n\n   \n  Massad Boulos, Trump’s adviser on Arab and African affairs, told  Nigerian media  last month that “People of all religions and of all tribes are dying, and it is very unfortunate, and we even know that Boko Haram and ISIS are killing more Muslims than more Christians.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nigerian government rejects claims that it is not doing enough to protect Christians from violence, saying it was bewildered by Trump’s suggestion of a potential military intervention.\n \n\n   \n  “We are shocked that President Trump is mulling an invasion of our country,” Nigerian presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga told CNN after the US president instructed the Pentagon to prepare for possible military action.\n \n\n   \n  Within US conservative circles, however, the situation in Nigeria has caused growing alarm. Trump himself raised the issue during a first-term meeting with then-President  Muhammadu Buhari  at the White House in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “We are deeply concerned by religious violence in Nigeria, including the burning of churches and the killing and persecution of Christians. It’s a horrible story,” Trump said during a joint news conference afterward.\n \n\n   \n  Buhari said he had explained to Trump the security situation in Nigeria was more complicated than mere religious persecution, saying groups sometimes used religious violence as they pursued economic interests.\n \n\n   \n  Nonetheless, Trump designated Nigeria a “Country of Particular Concern” two years later, citing “severe violations of religious freedom.” The Biden administration reversed the decision.\n \n\n   \n    Renewed effort by conservatives\n \n\n   \n  With Trump’s return to office came a renewed effort by American conservatives to apply pressure on the Nigerian government to stem violence against Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who has earned overwhelming support from evangelical Christians during his campaigns for president, vowed during last year’s election to combat anti-Christian bias. And administration officials have stated previously that protecting Christians is a key tenet of Trump’s foreign policy.\n \n\n   \n  Paula White-Cain, the senior adviser to the White House faith office and Trump’s longtime spiritual adviser, has previously traveled to Nigeria to minister. She thanked Trump on social media this weekend for his “strong stand on Christian persecution in Nigeria.”\n \n\n   \n  Cruz, an evangelical Christian from Texas, is one of the GOP lawmakers who has been working to get his fellow Christians and Congress to designate Nigeria as a violator of religious freedoms.\n \n\n   \n  Cruz, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a bill in September to sanction Nigerian officials whom he accused of “ignoring and even facilitating the mass murder of Christians.” The measure would also require the State Department to redesignate Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” — something the president noted in his first post on the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the issue was amplified on “Real Time with Bill Maher” on HBO. Maher said Islamic militants in Nigeria were “attempting to wipe out the Christian population of an entire country.” HBO is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.\n \n\n   \n  None of those calls seemed to go as far as Trump did, however, in threatening US military action on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  How such an intervention is carried out remains to be seen. Last year, the US  completed a withdrawal  of some 1,000 US troops from Niger, which neighbors Nigeria, ending a longtime presence in the nation.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Nimi Princewill contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/what-to-know-elections-virginia-new-jersey-new-york","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"What to know about today’s key races, from NYC’s mayoral race to history in the making in Virginia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines several key U.S. elections occurring on Tuesday, November 4, 2025, including the New York City mayoral race, New Jersey governor’s race, Virginia governor’s race, and critical issues like redistricting and utility costs.

Andrew Cuomo, who is attempting a political comeback as an independent after losing the Democratic primary, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in the  mayoral race  — one of a handful of contests around the country Tuesday that will draw copious attention.\n \n\n   \n  “When the sun comes up, everything changes — shadows lift off the river, light reflects off of office building windows, and you start to feel the warmth of a new day. That was how it felt when we beat Andrew Cuomo,” Mamdani said Monday morning, referring to his Democratic primary win. “And it’s how we will feel again tomorrow when polls close at 9 p.m. (ET).”\n \n\n   \n  Though New York City is overwhelmingly Democratic, the outcome could offer a window into what the party’s voters want from their leaders as a slew of competitive House and Senate primaries approach, and the 2028 presidential primary starts to take shape. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Muslim immigrant and democratic socialist, has faced resistance and reticence within his own party, including from congressional leaders, over his  views about Israel . But his relentless focus on the cost of living and his viral social media videos have also shot him to stardom — making him a unique figure in a party desperate for new ways to counter President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani on Monday said Cuomo is “Trump’s puppet in this race,” after Trump on Sunday called Mamdani a communist and threatened to withhold federal dollars from the city. Trump on Monday urged New Yorkers in his strongest terms yet to  vote for Cuomo , writing on Truth Social that voters “really have no choice.”\n \n\n   \n  The race for governor across the Hudson River in New Jersey, another one in Virginia and a key redistricting vote in California will also serve to gauge how voters feel in the first year of Trump’s second presidency – and provide signals about the midterm elections just one year away.\n \n\n   \n  In Virginia, the ongoing shutdown and Trump’s efforts to remake the government have affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers who will play a central role Tuesday. In New Jersey, the  durability of Latino voters’ swing  to Trump in 2024, and the political potency of affordability concerns fueled by increasing taxes and utility costs, are at the center of a competitive contest.\n \n\n   \n  And in California, the race to redraw  congressional district boundaries  ahead of next year’s battle for majority control of the US House of Representatives faces a critical moment.\n \n\n   \n  A special election in Texas and a state Supreme Court retention vote in Pennsylvania cap an important set of odd-year elections. Here are the races and issues to watch Tuesday:\n \n\n   \n    New York City mayor\n \n\n   \n  The mayor’s race is a signal moment for a Democratic Party looking for its way out of the political wilderness. Similar dynamics — progressives against moderates and insiders against outsiders — could play out in primary elections next spring. Democrats can also draw lessons from how questions of  support for Israel  have played in the race, and from Mamdani’s approach to social media and publicity, including appearing on Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  Some national Democrats — most notably the party’s top two figures in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York — have been slow to embrace Mamdani. Jeffries  endorsed him  only in late October, and Schumer has not said who he is supporting in the mayor’s race.\n \n\n   \n  Before  heading out to rallies  in Virginia and New Jersey on Saturday, former President Barack Obama called Mamdani. He has not endorsed the nominee — aides attribute that to a policy of generally not getting involved in mayoral elections — and that did not change in the call. But according to a person familiar with the conversation, he called Mamdani’s campaign “impressive to watch,” and offered to be a “sounding board” going forward.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are largely rallying around Cuomo, identifying him as the only hope of stopping Mamdani’s election despite Sliwa’s presence in the race. Trump said on “60 Minutes” Sunday that “if it’s going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time to be honest with you.”\n \n\n   \n  Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who served a short stint in Trump’s White House,  urged New Yorkers on X  on Monday to vote for Cuomo. “Bear in mind that a vote for Curtis is really a vote for Mumdumi or whatever his name is,” Musk wrote.\n \n\n   \n    New Jersey governor\n \n\n   \n  Across the Hudson River, voters in the traditionally blue state of New Jersey will choose their replacement for term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n \n\n   \n  Amid tax hikes and soaring utility costs, affordability has taken center stage in the election. Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican who is endorsed by Trump and has praised the president’s performance in his second term, has sought to localize the race —  pitching himself  as the consummate “Jersey guy” and casting Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who moved to the state after a Navy career, as an outsider.\n \n\n   \n  Sherrill and Democrats, meanwhile, have emphasized Ciattarelli’s links to Trump — a potentially decisive factor in a state with 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. One point of emphasis: Trump’s cancellation of funding for the Gateway Tunnel, a rail project linking New Jersey and New York City.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be a continued fight against Trump’s vision in Washington as he tries to stifle opportunity for people across this country,” Sherrill told supporters at a campaign office visit Monday.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey has typically leaned blue, but Ciattarelli came close to winning in 2021, and the state shifted hard in Trump’s direction in 2024: He lost by just 6 percentage points, after a 16-point drubbing there in 2020.\n \n\n   \n  Asked Monday by CNN whether Trump is a liability in the governor’s race, Ciattarelli said, “Not one bit.”\n \n\n   \n  “The people of New Jersey know who I am. I will fiercely defend the 9 million citizens of this state every day of the week,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Virginia governor\n \n\n   \n  Four years after Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin won a major upset, tapping into parents’ anger over local school boards, his lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is seeking to replace him with a campaign centered on transgender policies, particularly in schools.\n \n\n   \n  But polls suggest her Democratic opponent, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, has a clear advantage headed into Election Day in a state that three times voted against Trump. Democrats have relentlessly tied Earle-Sears to Trump, and she has not sought to distance herself from the president.\n \n\n   \n  “What is it that we do here in Virginia?” Spanberger said at a Monday rally. “The answer is, we flip some seats. … The answer is that we stand up against the chaos and the division that we see coming out of this administration.”\n \n\n   \n  None of the states holding elections on Tuesday are typically considered swing states in presidential elections. But Republicans were able to sweep statewide races in Virginia four years ago. And with the Virginia’s proximity to Washington, it is home to hundreds of thousands of federal government workers who are affected by the Trump administration’s downsizing of the federal workforce and the government shutdown. Its gubernatorial election might be the closest to a true test of Trump’s performance this year.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have shown closer races down ballot in Virginia, where Republican John Reid and Democrat Ghazala Hashmi are facing off for lieutenant governor. In the contest for attorney general, Republicans have what could be their best chance to win Tuesday as GOP incumbent Jason Miyares faces Democrat Jay Jones, who has been  dogged by controversy  surrounding violent text messages he sent in 2022.\n \n\n   \n    Issue to watch: Utility costs\n \n\n   \n  The economy is a perennial campaign issue, with voters often expressing concerns about prices at the grocery store or at gas pumps. This year’s pocketbook metric is one less often discussed:  utility costs .\n \n\n   \n  Electricity prices across the country, which have  sharply increased  since 2020, have jumped over the last year, introducing a new financial strain for voters in places like New Jersey and Virginia. Candidates in both states have featured energy costs in their television ads and campaign speeches.\n \n\n   \n  Utility costs have become a particularly salient issue in New Jersey, where residential electricity prices have jumped nearly 21% over the past year compared with a 6% increase nationwide, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Ciattarelli has said Democrats’ push for clean energy is to blame, while Sherrill has said she will fix the issue by freezing utility rates, a proposal that has drawn skepticism from Murphy, the outgoing Democratic governor.\n \n\n   \n  Even Trump appears to be aware of the political potency of the issue. In a tele-rally for Ciattarelli last month, the president repeatedly turned to talking about energy costs — an indication the issue could be front and center in next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n    California’s redistricting battle\n \n\n   \n  California’s vote on  a measure known as Proposition 50  will set the stage for next year’s midterm battle for control of the US House of Representatives.\n \n\n   \n  Voters will decide whether to green-light the Democratic plan spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom to set aside the congressional districts drawn by the state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission in favor of a gerrymandered map aimed at improving Democrats’ chances of winning five GOP-held seats.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a response to Texas, where the legislature approved and Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law new maps intended to help Republicans win five more seats — improving the party’s odds of retaining its House majority.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom, widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender, sought an answer that would neutralize those Texas gains. But unlike in Texas, California voters have to sign off on the plan to replace the nonpartisan commission’s maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections — before switching back to new, commission-drawn maps in the next decade, after the 2030 census.\n \n\n   \n  A “yes” vote would be a big win for Democrats, who have fewer avenues to respond after Republicans also redrew Missouri’s maps to add one more seat, with Indiana set to convene a special legislative session in the coming weeks to potentially add one or two more GOP seats and North Carolina moving to add one more Republican-leaning district. It would also be a milestone for Newsom, as he and a slew of other Democratic governors seek to position themselves as Trump’s strongest opponents ahead of potential presidential runs.\n \n\n   \n    Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention\n \n\n   \n  In Pennsylvania, voters must determine whether to keep three Democratic members of the state Supreme Court — a decision with potentially  significant ramifications  in the coming months and years in the crucial presidential battleground.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have a 5-2 majority on the state’s high court. The three incumbents on Tuesday’s ballot face yes-or-no questions of whether they’ll be retained for new 10-year terms. If they aren’t, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro would appoint interim replacements until elections for new justices were held in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  A change in party control of the state Supreme Court could have far-reaching implications for the 2028 presidential race, upcoming midterms and future redistricting. Ahead of the 2020 and 2024 elections, the Democratic majority sided with Democrats on key cases related to mail-in deadlines, provisional ballots and signature matching.\n \n\n   \n    Texas House special election\n \n\n   \n  The largely Democratic, Houston-area 18th Congressional District in Texas has been without representation in Washington for most of the last 16 months.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024,  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee  died. Her daughter, Erica Lee Carter, won the special election to fill the vacancy. But that special election was held the same day as the 2024 general election, which was won by former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner — who hadn’t been on the ballot in the special election.\n \n\n   \n  Turner  died in early March . Abbott, a Republican, scheduled the special election for eight months later — a move that gave the House GOP more breathing room as it moved toward passage of Trump’s landmark tax and domestic policy bill.\n \n\n   \n  This special election, a jungle primary that will go to a runoff featuring the top two finishers unless one tops 50% of the vote on Tuesday, has drawn several high-profile candidates. Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, who has technically resigned to run for Congress but continues to serve, is among the Democrats, as are state Rep. Jolanda Jones and Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member who lost in the 2024 primary to Jackson Lee. Republican Carmen Montiel, a Venezuelan American real estate agent and former TV journalist, is the highest-profile member of her party in the race.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5598418","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Democrats Had a Big Night: 5 Takeaways from the 2025 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In the 2025 off-year elections, Democrats achieved significant victories across key state races, driven primarily by voter concern over the cost of living.

a big night. Here are 5 takeaways from the 2025 elections \n         By Domenico Montanaro \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         One thing was clear — it was a big night for Democrats. Up and down the ballot, Democrats did well. That was true whether it was the marquee governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats significantly outperformed 2024 presidential election margins, or even less-closely-watched races like the Virginia House of Delegates, the state supreme court in Pennsylvania and even Georgia Public Service Commission. And  the outcomes  very well may have consequences in the near term, for things like the federal government shutdown, in the medium term for the 2026 midterm elections and in the longer term for 2028. Here are five takeaways from the 2025 off-year elections: 1.   It's still the cost of living, stupid. The old political axiom, coined by former Bill Clinton adviser James Carville is, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Well, over the last couple of years, more specifically that should be, \"It's the cost of living, stupid.\" Whether it was Democratic President Joe Biden or now Republican President Trump, prices and affordability have proven to be voting motivators. But Trump  has largely ignored it , saying he always felt immigration was more motivating. That came back to bite his party Tuesday night. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The  exit polls  found that in all four major contests — the governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York mayor's race and the Proposition 50 battle in California — voters said the economy was the most important issue (or close to it in New Jersey), and they sided with Democrats overwhelmingly. And that's despite Republicans being seen Tuesday night as best on the issue of crime or immigration in these elections (counting Trump-endorsed Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent in New York). That's a very bad sign for Republicans and Trump, who clearly now own the economy, despite how much the president continues to try to blame his predecessor. 2. Republicans still have a Trump problem — in two different ways The president is unpopular and a drag on his party when he's not on the ballot, but also, when he's not on the ballot, the GOP can't seem to turn out conservatives. Trump's numbers with independents haven't been good since early on in his second term as president, as lots of them disapprove of the job he's doing on the economy and think he's gone too far with how he's approached a policy of mass deportations. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In these elections, according to the exit polls, as of 1 a.m. ET — independents made up a third of the electorate in Virginia, and Democrat Abigail Spanberger won those voters by 19 points in the governor's race. It was a similar story in New Jersey, where they made up 31% and went for Democrat Mikie Sherrill by 13 points. It's a real quandary for Republicans. It was true during his first term as president, too, that in these non-presidential election years, Trump brings people out to the polls in the wrong way for the GOP. If you're a Republican, that has to be figured out. But so few want to cross Trump, and show a public break with him, that that's unlikely to happen anytime soon for the party  en masse . It's something to watch heading into next year's midterms and into 2028 when Trump is constitutionally ineligible to run again. 3. The Trump slump with Latinos appears to be real Trump made significant inroads with Latinos during the 2024 presidential election. In fact, no Republican presidential candidate won a higher percentage with Latinos — ever. But there have been signs that Latinos were moving away from Trump. Poll after poll has shown that, and Tuesday night was the first time it showed up at the ballot box in a significant way. Spanberger and Sherrill, the governors-elect from Virginia and New Jersey respectively, both won Latinos by 2-to-1 margins, according to the exit polls. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Going deeper into New Jersey specifically, Trump won Passaic County in North Jersey, a county that is nearly half Latino, according to the census. He was the first Republican presidential candidate to win it since 1992. Trump won it by 3 points, but Sherrill won it by 15. There are 10 counties in New Jersey where Latinos make up at least 1-in-5 people, per the U.S. census. Sherrill not only won them all, she expanded Democratic margins and flipped three Trump had won. For a couple of decades — since Latinos have become a significant political force given their population boom in the country — they had been reliable Democratic voters. But they have increasingly become a bloc that is not necessarily loyal to either party. Get more updates in the NPR Politics newsletter . They're particularly worried — like lots of other voters — about the cost of living. And many Latino leaders, including in the Republican Party, have voiced concerns about Trump's approach to immigration — casting a far-wider net than just hardened criminals. Tuesday's result is likely going to have a lot of smart conservatives privately questioning Trump's policies and biting their nails about winning the group back for their races next year, as they try to hold onto the House. 4. The redistricting arms race is on, and Democrats got a boost Tuesday on that front Practically, maybe the most consequential election Tuesday was the Proposition 50 ballot initiative in California. A yes vote on Prop 50 would temporarily overturn the requirement that California draw its congressional districts via independent commission. That's exactly what happened — and it wasn't even close. That wasn't guaranteed at the beginning of this effort a few months ago. It was spearheaded by California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, and with the help of a lot of money and high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, they successfully made it a proxy fight with Trump. They convinced California Democrats that this was necessary to counterbalance Trump's demands on red states, like Texas, to squeeze out more Republican congressional districts to try to ensure GOP control of the House next year. Now, California is set to redraw its congressional maps, which likely will result in more Democratic seats. If that wasn't politically significant enough, there was also how Newsom positioned himself. While taking a victory lap, he tried to show he's a Democrat looking to counterbalance Trump not just with congressional districts but as a leader.   Newsom called it a \"good night\" for the Democratic Party, one on the \"ascendancy,\" and \"on its toes rather than on its heels.\" Newsom also chided Trump, calling him \"historically unpopular,\" that he \"promised to make us healthier and wealthier,\" but \"we're sicker and poorer\" and that Trump knows his unpopular position. \"Why else,\" Newsom asked, would Trump try to get more seats out of Texas except to try to \"rig\" next year's elections? Newsom boasted of his state standing \"firm in response\" to Trump. Democrats have made clear they want a fighter, someone willing to stand up to Trump in any way possible, someone with the guts to, say, bend the rules a little the way Trump might. One wonders who Newsom thinks should lead this \"ascendant\" party? 5. The Democratic Party will have to wrestle with its identity over the next year There are plenty of people in the party with different ideas on how to lead the party, push a message of affordability and stand up to Trump in the process. That brings us to Zohran Mamdani. No one has captured more attention during this election cycle than Mamdani. The 34-year-old, who is set to become the youngest New York City mayor in more than a century, and the first Muslim to serve in that office, has become a star with progressives — and a villain among conservatives. Conservatives are very good at creating Democratic bogeymen, and they will try their hardest to make Mamdani, a self-avowed Democratic socialist, the face of the party.   Mamdani has plenty of political gifts. The campaign he ran was unique in its ability to reach out to younger voters in authentic ways and on social media. And, unlike a lot of Democrats, who have a hard time squeezing their policy proposals onto a bumper sticker, he was able to communicate his message of affordability clearly. But he also did nothing to calm his critics Tuesday night. His victory speech was bold and defiant, even beginning by quoting Eugene Debs, a committed socialist who created the Socialist Party of America. The cover of the conservative New York Post Wednesday depicts Mamdani holding up a hammer and sickle, a communist symbol, with the headline: \"THE RED APPLE.\" He reached out to Jewish New Yorkers in his speech, saying he would aim to fight the \"scourge of antisemitism.\" And he also poked the White House hive. Speaking directly to Trump, he urged him to \"turn the volume up\" before lambasting him over income inequality, union rights and his view of immigrants. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       All night, Fox News opted to talk about \"Commie\" Mamdani instead of taking victory speeches from Spanberger and Sherrill. Both women cut a different political profile: both have military or law enforcement backgrounds and tried to reach out to their opponents' voters. So, a large swath of the country on the right didn't hear a Democrat wishing her opponent well, praising her military service and saying she wants to be governor for everyone in the state. Instead, they were served a heavy dose of red scare. But is Mamdani now the face, or the \"soul\" of the Democratic Party? New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who also describes herself as a Democratic socialist and was an early Mamdani backer, was asked about that on MSNBC Tuesday night. \"I don't think that our party needs to have one face,\" she said. \"Our country does not have one face. It's about all of us as a team together. And we all understand the assignment. Our assignment everywhere is to send the strongest fighters for the working class wherever possible. In some places, like Virginia, for the gubernatorial seat, that's going to look like Abigail Spanberger. In New York City, unequivocally, it's Zohran Mamdani.\" Again, it's the cost of living and affordability that's key. Can Republicans effectively make the next year a debate between capitalism and socialism — or will Democrats be able to band together and sell something on the economy that's better than what's currently in control of Washington? That's going to be a key question for the 2026 midterms, which kick off now. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/03/asia/north-korea-kim-yong-nam-death-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"20:38:00-05:00","title":"North Korea’s Longtime Ceremonial Head of State Kim Yong Nam Dies at 97","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kim Yong Nam, North Korea's long-serving ceremonial head of state and a loyal figure within the Kim dynasty, has died at the age of 97, according to state media.

That post is North Korea’s nominal head of state, though the true power was held by the Kim family that has ruled the North since its formal foundation in 1948.\n \n\n   \n  Kim Yong Nam, who was known for propaganda-filled speeches with a deep, booming voice at key state events, often appeared in state media greeting visiting foreign dignitaries on behalf of Kim Jong Un and his late father Kim Jong Il.\n \n\n   \n  In February 2018, he traveled to South Korea with Kim Jong Un’s influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, to attend the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Olympics as Pyongyang sought better ties with Seoul and Washington after years of heightened animosities on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  The trip made Kim Yong Nam the highest-level North Korean official to visit South Korea since Kim Jong Un sent a top military officer to attend the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  At the Pyeongchang opening ceremony, Kim Yong Nam and Kim Yo Jong sat within feet of then-US Vice President Mike Pence, though the two sides made no apparent contact.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s temporary diplomatic openness peaked with the summits between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019, but Kim Yong Nam did not attend them and his influence was seen as waning due to his age. In April 2019, he was replaced by Choe Ryong Hae, one of Kim Jong Un’s close confidants who had previously served as the top political officer of the North’s 1.2 million-member military.\n \n\n   \n    Survivor of purges\n \n\n   \n  Kim Yong Nam’s career epitomized that of a successful North Korean bureaucrat. He joined the ruling Workers’ Party shortly after the 1950-53 Korean War and survived major political purges through the 1970s. He was appointed to the powerful Politburo in 1978 and served 15 years as foreign minister, starting in 1983. During his tenure, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union disintegrated, leaving North Korea isolated.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea watchers also say Kim Yong Nam had an expertise in third-world diplomacy. He was a frequent participant in gatherings of nations that consider themselves independent from major power blocs, including the 2012 Non-Aligned Movement summit in Iran.\n \n\n   \n  People who met Kim Yong Nam described him as mild-mannered but staunch in his opinions.\n \n\n   \n  “I found Kim Yong Nam a puzzling figure. In greetings before business began, he was cordial and relaxed, but once at work, he relentlessly followed his script in a way that reminded of former Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko,” former Washington Post reporter Don Oberdofer wrote in his book, “The Two Koreas.”\n \n\n   \n  In a testament to his loyalty to the ruling dynasty, Kim Yong Nam read an elegy to Kim Il Sung when he died in 1994. Kim Yong Nam also undertook the job of formally nominating Kim Jong Il to be chairman of the National Defense Commission after the son observed a three-year mourning period.\n \n\n   \n  A native of Pyongyang, Kim Yong Nam studied at Kim Il Sung University and Moscow State University.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5597788","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"23:06:00-20:05","title":"Mamdani wins New York City mayoral race, in a historic victory for progressives","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani has won the New York City mayoral election, becoming the first Muslim and person of South Asian descent to hold the office and the youngest mayor in over a century.

Rachel Treisman, Brian Mann \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 2:06 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         BROOKLYN, N.Y. - Zohran Mamdani will be the next mayor of New York City, becoming the first Muslim and person of South Asian descent — as well as the youngest in over a century — to hold the position. \"The future is in our hands,\" Mamdani declared to roaring applause Tuesday night at a victory celebration in Brooklyn.  \"My friends, tonight we have toppled a political dynasty.\" The 34-year-old, Ugandan-born Democratic socialist defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an Independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in Tuesday's election, according to a race call by the Associated Press. It's a remarkable ascent for Mamdani, who was a relatively unknown state assemblymember representing a district in Queens when he entered the crowded mayoral race last year. He went on to win June's Democratic primary by 12 percentage points, quickly becoming one of the country's most  popular and polarizing  politicians along the way. Taking the stage Tuesday night, Mamdani didn't shy away from his socialist political views, opening his speech with a quote from Eugene Debs, a socialist politician who ran for president five times in the early 1900s. \"I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity,\" Mamdani said, promising to improve conditions for New York City's workers. Many of the young Mamdani supporters who gathered in Brooklyn said they had been moved by his optimism and promises that he would improve their lives.  \"I voted with my parents, it's a tradition of ours,\" said Dania Darwish, 32, who described herself as a Syrian-American Brookynite.  \"My mom was crying the entire way to the voting station,\" Darwish added.  \"It was very emotional for all of us to see a candidate on the ballot who represents us.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some of Mamdani's main campaign promises included making the city's buses fare-free, freezing stabilized rents, providing universal child care, increasing the minimum wage by 2030 and lowering the cost of living by raising taxes on big corporations and the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers. Mamdani has also said he would stand up to President Trump, who has frequently criticized — and mischaracterized — Mamdani as a communist and  repeatedly threatened  to slash New York City's federal funding if he won. In a concession speech that echoed the ominous themes of his campaign, Andrew Cuomo warned of antisemitism and lawlessness.  \"We need the police to keep society safe.  We will not make the NYPD the enemy,\" Cuomo said, while also condemning Mamdani's embrace of socialism. \"We are headed down a dangerous, dangerous road,\" Cuomo said. Critics have pointed to Mamdani's relative inexperience and the political challenges he would face in delivering on his ambitious, highly progressive agenda. And, despite his repeated disavowal of antisemitism, his vocal and long-held criticisms of Israel's government and actions in Gaza have alienated some voters in a city that's home to the  largest Jewish community  outside of Israel. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But Mamdani's vision of a more affordable city, articulated through savvy social media videos and upbeat in-person interactions, has clearly resonated with young and first-time voters (even  outside of New York ). He won endorsements from scores of  high-profile progressives , mobilized  tens of thousands  of campaign volunteers and held a  double-digit lead  in polls going into Election Day. Young voters, who were likely to have supported Mamdani, are credited with  driving record early-voter turnout .  Less than an hour after polls closed on Tuesday, it was clear his efforts had paid off. A recap of the race New York City's mayoral race unfolded in a series of dramatic twists and turns, clashes and unlikely alliances. It energized voters and, in the end, more than two million votes were cast — the first time since 1969, according to the  New York City Board of Elections . Current Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, initially ran for a second term, despite a scandal-ridden first term and all-time low  approval ratings . After the Trump administration formally  dismissed the corruption case  against him, he announced his reelection bid in June, this time as an independent. That allowed Adams to bypass the Democratic primary, in which Mamdani triumphed over Cuomo. Mamdani's win was seen as an upset to the establishment, since the 67-year-old Cuomo is the son of a three-time New York governor and held the position himself for a decade beginning in 2011. In 2021, after numerous women  accused him of sexual misconduct  and questions swirled about his administration's  management of nursing home residents  during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuomo resigned as governor to avoid a likely impeachment trial, but denied all wrongdoing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Angling for a comeback, Cuomo entered the mayoral race  in March , saying the city was \"in crisis\" and in need of \"effective leadership.\" His platform emphasized issues like public safety, affordable housing, healthcare and fighting antisemitism — with a more centrist stance compared to Mamdani. Cuomo reentered the race as an independent after his primary loss, seeking to appeal to more moderate voters. He also got Adams' endorsement after the mayor  dropped out  in late September. At that point, the race narrowed to three main contenders: Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa, a 71-year-old radio talk show host and founder of the subway patrol organization the Guardian Angels, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Sliwa, who ran against Adams in 2021, was determined to remain in this year's race despite third-place poll numbers and  mounting calls  to drop out, from his own party as well as from Cuomo. Their concern was that Sliwa would take votes away from Cuomo, propelling Mamdani to victory. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The three faced off in two  contentious debates  in October, in which Mamdani and Cuomo sparred over issues of integrity and experience while Sliwa sought to paint them as two sides of the same ideological coin. Tuesday's election marks a pivotal moment for liberal-leaning New York City and the Democratic establishment. Both have grappled with how to respond to the Trump administration, which has targeted blue cities nationwide ( including the Big Apple ) with funding cuts and National Guard troops. The high stakes and voter enthusiasm of this election were evident well before Election Day: The city Board of Elections said 735,317 voters cast ballots during early voting,  more than five times  the number of early voters in 2021. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"14:20:00-05:00","title":"A Collection of Featured Tiny Desk Concerts","category":"Special Interest / Other","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Wednesday, February 28, 2024, at 2:20 PM EST, the Home Page Tiny Desk Carousel featured a collection of live Tiny Desk Concerts, offering audiences an intimate glimpse into musical performances by various artists.

Mikie Sherrill wins N.J. governor in Tuesday's second victory for Democrats \n         By Joe Hernandez \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 9:29 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A former Navy pilot, first elected to Congress in 2018, will be New Jersey's next governor. Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill defeated former Republican Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, according to a race call by The Associated Press, capping a closely-watched gubernatorial election that some polls predicted would be a coin flip. Sherrill's victory marks the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row. Her victory is also the second major win for Democrats on Tuesday, following   Abigail Spanberger's  win for Virginia governor. The race was also one of the first statewide votes since President Trump began his second term. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli in May ahead of the Republican primary. The tight race  has surprised some  in the traditionally blue state, which has had a Democratic governor for the past eight years and a legislature controlled by Democrats for even longer. But the  possibility that the governorship could flip  to a Republican — along with the statewide contest being seen as an indicator of public opinion on Trump's second term — put the election in the national spotlight and  drew nearly $200 million  in spending. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli earlier this year, saying that after Ciattarelli got to \"know and understand MAGA\" he went \"ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!).\" Ciattarelli had previously criticized the president. Meanwhile, former President Obama endorsed Sherrill in an online video message and later joined her on the campaign trail. Sherrill, also a former federal prosecutor and attorney, entered politics less than a decade ago when she was elected to Congress in 2018. This was the third time Ciattarelli, a former CPA and small business owner, had run for governor. But even though Democrats hold an advantage over Republicans on the voter rolls, New Jersey residents have chosen governors from both parties. \"As blue as New Jersey might be in presidential races and U.S. Senate races too, the state is decidedly purple when it comes to gubernatorial elections,\" Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship at Rowan University,  told NPR  in October. Affordability has been perhaps the most prominent issue of the campaign. Both candidates have bemoaned the state's high cost of living and surging energy prices, with Ciattarelli vowing to lower New Jersey's high property taxes and Sherrill promising to freeze electricity bills. But in the final weeks of the race, both campaigns traded personal attacks. Ciattarelli repeatedly questioned Sherrill's involvement in a cheating scandal at the Naval Academy in 1994. She said she was prohibited from walking at her graduation because she failed to turn in her classmates, and blasted the Trump administration for releasing her mostly unredacted military records to an ally of Ciattarelli's campaign. For her part, Sherrill accused Ciattarelli's former publishing company of producing materials that downplayed the dangers of opioids, saying in one of the televised debates between the pair that her opponent was responsible for killing tens of thousands of people in New Jersey. Ciattarelli said Sherrill was lying and  threatened to sue  her for defamation. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5598420","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Air traffic controllers warn of 'tipping point' as U.S. government shutdown drags on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. government shutdown continues past its five-week mark, air traffic controllers across the nation face severe staffing shortages and unpaid work, leading to widespread flight delays, cancellations, and growing public anxiety.

drags on \n         By Joel Rose \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         For many travelers, the  nation's airspace  was a scary place to be on Halloween. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Federal Aviation Administration was  forced to delay flights  across the U.S. because of staffing shortages at dozens of air traffic control facilities, making for one of the most difficult days to fly since  the government shutdown  began five weeks ago. \"What you're seeing is a lot of people who are truly having to call in sick to go earn money elsewhere,\" said one air traffic controller who works at a facility in the Midwest that handles high-altitude traffic. \"I think you're also seeing people who are just calling in sick because they're fed up and they're like, 'well, I'm going to spend the holiday weekend with my kids for once.'\" The government shutdown is taking a  growing toll on air traffic controllers  who are required to work without pay. Staffing shortages led to major delays over the weekend, raising concerns about more widespread travel chaos as the shutdown continues. NPR interviewed four current air traffic controllers this week, who all asked not to use their names because they're afraid of retaliation from the FAA. They said morale was already low, even before the government shutdown, due to a longstanding staffing shortage across the system. Mandatory overtime and stagnating wages were other factors dampening morale, which has gotten even worse now that controllers are not being paid at all. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy insists the U.S. air travel system is safe, and that the FAA will need to reroute and limit the number of planes in order to keep it that way. \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe,\" Duffy said Tuesday, \"if we don't have enough controllers to effectively and safely manage our skies.\" Duffy warned that the FAA may be forced to do a lot of that next week if the shutdown isn't resolved and the controllers miss another paycheck. \"You will see mass chaos, you will see mass flight delays. You'll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it because we don't have the air traffic controllers,\" Duffy said. Some air traffic controllers say they've been able to get loans from their credit unions to cover their expenses for a few paychecks, while others have been forced to take on part-time jobs. \"I work with people that are working a second job at night and are just calling in sick in the morning when they can't go to the job that doesn't pay them because they're too tired,\" said one controller who handles approaching and departing traffic at a major U.S. airport. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The controller said they haven't taken on a second job yet, but now a colleague who is already moonlighting in private security. \"You know, I'm going to join that guy here next week if things don't pan out,\" the controller said, just so that they can pay the mortgage. The longer the shutdown goes on, the more controllers may be forced to make these difficult decisions. \"I think we're reaching a tipping point,\" said the controller who works high-altitude traffic in the Midwest. \"This is kind of about the point in the last shutdown where people just started getting fed up with it.\" It was more than a month into the last government shutdown in 2018 and 2019 when a small number of air traffic controllers in a few key facilities called in sick. That caused  major disruptions  at airports up and down the East Coast, and arguably helped bring the shutdown to an end later that day. The FAA is better at managing staffing shortages these days, several controllers said. One controller said more of their colleagues have called out sick during this shutdown than during the previous one, while the impacts on travel have been mostly isolated so far. But controllers also say the shutdown is adding more risk to the system. \"It does degrade that margin of safety if a bunch of people are sick and not at work and I'm having to do their jobs along with my own,\" said the controller who handles traffic around a major airport. Another controller who handles arriving and departing traffic at a major airport in the New York City-area says they were the only certified controller working during a recent night shift. \"It was on a bad weather day where there was a ton of confusion and coordinations necessary. Trainees who were around tried to be as helpful as they could,\" the controller said, but \"it was a terrible situation to be stuck in.\" \"It's clear that the government only pays lip service to the value of our profession,\" this controller said. \"Otherwise why would they jeopardize hundreds of thousands of people's lives every day this way?\" Legally, air traffic controllers are not allowed to strike or to coordinate their absences, as their union leaders have emphasized throughout the shutdown. But controllers also know that the Thanksgiving holiday — one of the busiest travel periods of the year — is just a few weeks away. The high-altitude controller from the Midwest put it this way: \"I think you're going to see probably the worst day of travel in the history of flight.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1097583787","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00+00:00","title":"Political Developments and Economic Reforms in the Region: A Look at Key Events of October 2023","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on recent political developments in the region, focusing on the Prime Minister's announcement of new economic reforms, the passage of a key legislative policy by the National Assembly, and the signing of an International Trade Agreement.

The thaw has arrived, at least here in Baltimore, where I am at the time of this taping. The days are getting longer, the cold is subsiding, and we are fast approaching that perfect date weather, that \"Miss Congeniality\" weather - you know, when it's not too hot, not too cold. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"MISS CONGENIALITY\") HEATHER BURNS: (As Cheryl Frasier) ...Not too hot, not too cold. All you need is a light jacket. LIMBONG: ...Which is to say, it is the perfect time to get outside and see something new. And you don't have to go far. Today's episode is all about how to pay attention to your usual surroundings with some fresh eyes. JENNY ODELL: We have a natural curiosity, and it's just, you know, unfortunate that the structures of life and, you know, many different factors kind of cover over that, and you have to find ways of rehabilitating it. LIMBONG: That's Jenny Odell, previous guest of the pod, avid birdwatcher and author of the book \"How To Do Nothing.\" In this episode of LIFE KIT, she's going to be our guide to finding some new things in old spaces. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LIMBONG: It's easy to take for granted the stuff that's around you - you know, that park down the street, that weird-looking building a few blocks from work, that bench underneath that tree where you ate a sandwich once. Really paying attention to these things is probably something you only do when a friend visits from out of town and you play tourist in your own town with them. But it's important to try and incorporate that energy into your everyday life. It is, after all, the ecosystem you inhabit. Just like those dioramas in science class, everything in an ecosystem affects everything else, including you. Here's Odell reading from her book, \"How To Do Nothing.\" ODELL: (Reading) It's a bit like falling in love, that terrifying realization that your fate is linked to someone else's, that you are no longer your own. But isn't that closer to the truth anyway? Our fates are linked to each other, to the places where we are and everyone and everything that lives in them. How much more real my responsibility feels when I think about it this way. This is more than just an abstract understanding that our survival is threatened by global warming or even a cerebral appreciation for other living beings and systems. Instead, this is an urgent personal recognition that my emotional and physical survival are bound up with these, quote, \"strangers,\" not just now, but for life. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LIMBONG: Whew. (LAUGHTER) LIMBONG: It's just hit it, like, I - you know, every - I don't know, every guy hits 30 and all of a sudden, like, gets, like, into the city-planning YouTube rabbit hole, and, like, that's been my bag. And I've sort of been thinking a lot about, like, oh, everything - all of our decisions are, you know, intricately... ODELL: Yeah. LIMBONG: ...It's like, oh, where you put a street affects all this other stuff, you know, and I was just like, oh man. So reading the book has, like, made me think a lot about that sort of stuff. I'm just curious, what do you think? What do you get out of acting like a tourist in your own town? ODELL: I've always been amazed by how much we take for granted. Even if you haven't lived somewhere that long or aren't that familiar - or don't think you're that familiar - there's so much that we write off. And that could be, you know, architectural. It could be environmental. It could be things that happen, things that people are doing. I think, you know, if you think about, like, the route that you take to commute, for example, there's so much that just kind of doesn't come to your attention because you sort of either think that you know it already or there's no reason for you to pay attention to it. And then - it's sort of funny, because then, when you go to another place as a tourist, you notice everything because you're in a sort of tourist mindset, whereas, like, people who live there have probably written off many of those things. So it's really just a perspective, I think, that is one where you pay attention to maybe different kinds of things, maybe a different kind of level of granularity. I think you're less susceptible to think of things as, like, banal or everyday if you're in a tourist mindset. And so, I think, that's - for me - that's the main thing. It's always surprising. Like, you'll always find something, you know, surprising and oftentimes delightful when you're in that mindset. LIMBONG: Yeah. Like, you take the time to read the little, like, some guy built this thing here once, like, placards - right? - like, that sort of thing? ODELL: Yeah. I mean, I think one thing that's been really amazing to me - especially during the pandemic, because, you know, I and many people I know have been walking a lot and walking in neighborhoods - is to walk around a space with someone else - like, a space that you think you're familiar with. Like, I - a friend of mine had gone for a walk in my neighborhood and then a week later was like, I really want to show you this weird thing that I found in a mural. And I've walked past this mural, like, hundreds and hundreds of times, and I never would have noticed that thing. And so, like, it just really goes to show that what you see has to do with, like, what you specifically are looking for or aren't looking for. And so I think just, like, going somewhere with someone else or, like, going on a walking tour - historical walking tour - of your own neighborhood, if you're so lucky to be able to do that - those can be really eye-opening experiences. LIMBONG: And, you know, besides having someone else accompany you around your neighborhood, what other ways do you think that, like, people can really dig into, like, their whereabouts? Like, how do they reopen their eyes, so to speak? ODELL: I think one really easy way is to think about the idea of, like, a lens. And you can take that literally or figuratively. So, literally, I tend to walk around with - I don't know, I've seen it referred to as a jeweler's loop. I don't know a lot about these lenses, but basically I have a very small magnifying glass, like, type thing, and it's, like, a 10X lens. But I've used that to look at, you know, plants really close up. And it's actually a little bit comical because, in my experience, you have to be quite close to the thing that you're looking at, and your eye also has to be pretty close to the lens. So I look like some kind of weird plant detective because I'm, like, walking up to these plants with this, like, tiny - you know, my face sort of pressed up against this thing and, like, really close to some leaves or whatnot. But I am always surprised by how things look. I mean, plants are so much hairier than you realize, and, like, insects are terrifying. But - and like, there's, like, dewdrops and all these kind of tiny details. It's, like, very magical to realize that there's this, you know, world. It's very like, \"Honey, I Shrunk The Kids,\" like, level of wonder. So I carry that around. And then I also often have binoculars on me because I'm a birder. So I have, you know, my own eyes, which see in a certain way, and then I have this lens where I can see things that are really small. And then I have this other lens where I can see things that are far away. And so, like, that's sort of a literal example of lenses. But I think you can also think about, like, conceptual lenses. Like, what are you looking for? So, you know, like, what if you walked your neighborhood and you tried to pay attention to things that are flowering? I mean, this is a good time to be doing that because it's the spring. And maybe over the course of, you know, weeks or months, you continue to pay attention to those plants, and you kind of track them through their flowering processes. Or maybe you try to pay attention to, like, what kinds of insects are attending to them. You could do a really interesting thing, just, like, only paying attention to sound or only certain types of sound. But, like, all of these kind of involve like a decision to begin with. Like, I am going to pay attention to X, and that's my lens. And I'm going to move through the space. And I think that that's - I mean, there's almost like an infinite number of things that you could choose. And so there's an infinite number of interpretations that you could have of the same space. And I think, like, that's been something that I've really relied on during the pandemic, especially, because, you know, we're all looking for novelty. And that is sort of a movement that you can make in your own head before you're even in the space that will drastically affect what you're going to notice. LIMBONG: How do you decide what to fix your lens on or which lens to choose? ODELL: Yeah. I think it sort of just depends on what you are maybe naturally curious about. So, you know, for me, I personally just am drawn to ecological processes. But there's also this layer of history that is in everything as well. So, you know, I remember at some point years ago, I was - I think I looked up - I live in an apartment building, but there's a house across the street that I looked up, and it was built in the 1920s. And I remember that just kind of set off this whole thing for me of like, oh, this, that side of the street, those were all built in the 1920s. Like, I wonder why? Like, why were they built like that? So I think there's also kind of like an architectural, historical layer that you could pay attention to, like, you know, styles of things. But just thinking about, yeah, like, why things are in the places that they are - you know, another way of putting it is, it's just like - during the pandemic I remember I would walk around and just ask myself like, what is different from yesterday? And then, like, that's kind of a funny question because you realize that, actually, everything is different from yesterday. But asking that question will maybe, like, allow you to find the things that are most obviously different from yesterday. And that could be things that people are doing in the space, you know, things that are growing or blooming, things that are being built or torn down, birds that have arrived, you know, that weren't there before, smells. I know there's someone who gives, like, smell tours in New York City - or did at some point - so really, like, anything that's in your sort of powers of observation, like using that to try to measure the difference of today from yesterday. LIMBONG: Bro, I'm not going on that smell tour. (LAUGHTER) ODELL: I mean... LIMBONG: This question might sound a little ridiculous, but how do you pay attention? ODELL: I mean, I think there are many ways to pay attention. I think, for me, one of the things that I have noticed, I think, especially in the last couple of years, about the way that I pay attention, is that it has a lot to do with time and being attentive to change. So, for example - I know; sorry. All my examples are from birding. But, like, when you start birding - right? - you get your bird guide, and you have all these different birds in it. And you could sort of treat it like Pokemon Go, right? Like, I'm looking for this bird. I saw it. I saw the bird. I'm done. Like, I keep walking, right? And then inevitably, I think, especially if you're in the same place and you're paying attention to the same birds, you start to notice things like, oh, you know, these birds do different things at different times of the year. And then you realize, oh, they do different types of things during in different times of the day. And at some point, I think, when that moves from just, like, that bird is there to, like, that a bird is observing and responding to its environment, I find that, like, if I observe that, that's the deepest form of attention that I'm aware of, is if I am attending to, you know, like, let's say this bird attending to its environment, which really just means, like, tracking something through space and time and acknowledging that it is also alive to its environment. So conversely, the best - the easiest way to not pay attention to something is to think that it's just kind of a frozen object in space, like it's not going to change. It doesn't have an orientation to time. And that's how you write things off. It's like, I've seen it. I'm done. And then you're no longer paying attention to it. And I think if you really want to pay attention to something for more than a moment, it has to come with the acknowledgement that, you know, that thing or being has a history, and it also has a future. And it's sort of existing in time with you. And it's changing. LIMBONG: Do you have any advice on how to build a community out of this sort of stuff, like, maybe from scratch and, like, start, you know, spreading the good news of looking around and noticing things? ODELL: Yeah. I mean, I think the first step would just be having to find out if someone's already done that, which, you know, if you're lucky, maybe someone already has. I don't have a lot of great examples. I mean, well, so I guess, you know, under the category of things that are already established, you know, here in the Bay Area, the Golden Gate Audubon Society organizes trips - you know, birding trips, which - and I also mentioned earlier, the Feminist Birding Club. So there are - you know, birding is the type of thing that's like - it's an established enough thing that there are often, like, groups that already exist that you could maybe look for. But I also - I'm almost more drawn to, like, smaller things where - I'm just thinking of - I have one friend in particular who's, like, my birding friend. Like, this is the friend that I will text if I see, you know, a bird for the first time with, like, many exclamation points because it's like the - one of the only people I know who will, like, understand why that's so exciting on a personal level. We walk around and look at birds. And that's - I don't know if that counts as a group. That's two people. But I do feel like you sometimes only need one other person to sort of make that agreement with, like, we are going to pay attention to X, and then you go and look for it because it's about sharing that experience. So - and then who's to say that, you know, you and your friend don't find, like, another person that you just know, sort of through friends or whatever, who also likes that thing. So maybe the three of you go, you know what I mean? That's kind of a more organic approach versus the kind of, like, organized walk - which the organized walks are really great, too, because they're - you know, they're often led by an expert. So, like, you can just ask the person, like, what is that? And they'll tell you. But I think that those are kind of two different approaches to kind of, like, finding others. LIMBONG: You mentioned taking the bus before. There's a passage in the book about public transportation and sort of, like, what it offers. And I was wondering if you could, like, tell me a little bit more about, like, what do you get out of taking the bus or the train as opposed to just, like, driving somewhere? ODELL: Yeah, it's funny you ask. I was just on the bus in - again, in San Francisco last week, and I was thinking about how much I love the bus. But I think it's that - it's one of the last places, for me, anyway, where you are thrown together with strangers. And I mean, I know this is not always the case, but there's generally, like, a sense of, like, respect and, like, mutual recognition. Like, we all just want to get to where we're going, and people sort of rearrange themselves accordingly. And I think just, especially, like, on a long bus ride, like, for me, it's just been this opportunity to consider, like, the reality of other people who I don't have some kind of - it's not, you know, friends or family or someone that I have some kind of, like, obvious relationship to. And you just kind of see people getting on and off. It's just this kind of, like, indication, I think, of, like, other lives. And I find that that - again, especially during the pandemic, I felt I really missed that. I think, like, the world kind of shrank in this way, that it made it harder to just, like, really, in a palpable way, like, sit with the fact of, like, just everyone kind of trying to make it, right? Like, everyone's just trying to get through their lives. And people have, like, hopes and desires and dreams and regrets. And every single person you see on the bus has those, you know? And, like, you know, you can get that, sort of, from walking around, if you're in a crowded area. But I don't know. To me, there's something about the bus where you're all going in the same direction, and you're all kind of invested in the bus, like, getting there. And you're just - and you're sitting together, you know, even if you're not talking. So in short, I love the bus (laughter). LIMBONG: No, buses rock. Yeah, I love - yeah, the - I never feel like more part of the city than, like, if somebody is, like, being a piece of s***, and everybody on the bus is, like, booing them, you know what I mean? ODELL: Yeah. Right, right. Like, totally. And that's what I was going to - I know there's - you know, like, there's always - you know, not always, but there's going to be, you know, oftentimes, some kind of incident on the bus. And it's like - but there are also then all the other people on the bus who are going to, like, rally around, like, trying to make sure that everything is OK. So - and I think that that's - maybe that's part of it for me, too, is like, there's some kind of illusion of individuality - like, a model of individuality, where you can sort of live your life unaffected by others and not affecting others that is perpetuated by something like driving a car on a freeway versus, like, when you're on a bus, you are confronted with this reality that you are - your life is intimately bound up with the lives of others, especially those who you do not - are not friends and family, who you don't have some sort of personal relationship to. And, like, the bus just kind of models that or just kind of reminds you of that general truth. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LIMBONG: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

Spanberger, who previously served three terms in the U.S. House, defeated her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. She'll be Virginia's first woman governor. The contest received national attention as one of the  first major tests of voter sentiment  in  response to the Trump administration's  policies. Virginia is home to around 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors. On the campaign trail, Spanberger argued that federal layoffs, cutbacks by President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tariffs and the federal shutdown were an  attack on the Virginia economy  — and pitched herself as a way for voters to push back. \"We need a governor who will recognize the hardship of this moment, advocate for Virginians, and make clear that not only are we watching people be challenged in their livelihoods and in their businesses and in communities, but Virginia's economy is under attack,\" Spanberger said at a stop on a campaign bus tour late last month. That message resonated with Haley Morgan Wright, a voter whose husband is a federal employee currently working without pay during the federal shutdown. She wants Spanberger to use her platform as governor to uplift the stories of civil servants like him. \"He cares about his country, he wants to serve his country and has opted to do it in this way,\" she said after casting a ballot in the Northern Virginia exurbs. \"He's not superfluous.\" Spanberger was backed by national Democrats National Democrats had looked to Spanberger and Virginia Democrats for a boost heading into the 2026 midterms. Former President Barack Obama had campaigned for her and the party backed her in what was one of just two governor's races this year. \"The DNC has been spending a lot of money and a lot of time in Virginia,\" said DNC Vice Chair Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta at a meeting for party volunteers in Northern Virginia. \"Because we know that what you all do and the momentum that is going to come out of your victories is going lead to us flipping the House of Representatives in 2026.\" In 2021, Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe with 50.6% of the vote to 48.7%. Virginia governors are limited to one four-year term. Spanberger, who served in the CIA before running for Congress in 2018, has cultivated a reputation as a pragmatic centrist. The theme of her run for governor was \"affordability\" — speaking to Virginians' concerns about rising costs of housing, utility bills, pharmaceutical drugs and the economic uncertainty she blamed on Trump's tariffs and federal layoffs. Earle-Sears, meanwhile, portrayed herself as an example of the American dream — a Jamaican immigrant who became a U.S. Marine and small business owner. She accused Spanberger of backing policies on transgender rights that she said are a threat to girls' safety in school bathrooms and locker rooms.  \"Love is not having my daughter having to be forced to undress in a locker room with a man. That's not love,\" Earle-Sears said at a rally in late October. \"Love is making sure that our girl children have opportunities in sports and are not forced to play against biological males.\" Earle-Sears' stance on transgender students in girls' bathrooms sounded good to Elizabeth Drake, a voter who said she works with youth at a church in Loudoun County. \"I feel like we're actually going back and setting ourselves back a lot by endangering women,\" she said. \"I'm not saying that that doesn't mean we can have alternative spaces for people, but the women's locker rooms, women's bathrooms, women's safe homes are not it.\" The race was jolted by late-breaking events Earle-Sears also attacked Spanberger for supporting Biden administration policies. She vowed to continue business-friendly polices of outgoing Gov. Youngkin. While she backed Trump's policies, Trump did not endorse her. Several developments  impacted the final weeks of the race. The federal shutdown shadowed the final month of early voting, with both campaigns blaming the other party for the stalemate.  Virginia lawmakers began considering a plan to redistrict the state's congressional districts to favor Democratic candidates in the 2026 midterm elections, as Trump pushes Republicans in other states to move to favor their candidates. That could be an issue facing the next Virginia governor. And Republicans seized on revelations of text messages by Democratic candidate for attorney general, Jay Jones, in which he described the hypothetical shooting of a Republican lawmaker. Spanberger denounced the messages though Earle-Sears faulted her for not calling on Jones to drop out of the race. Despite the scandal, Jones defeated incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, according to an Associated Press race call. His victory in the key legal post will enable the commonwealth to participate in the torrent of blue-state lawsuits against the Trump administration.

The measure, called Proposition 50, will replace lines drawn by an independent commission with a map that could net Democrats as many as five new seats in next year's U.S. House elections. The AP called the race just as polls closed in California. The result caps a strong election night for Democrats, who also pocketed notable wins in  Virginia  and  New Jersey . In an abbreviated campaign that saturated California's airwaves with ads, Gov. Gavin Newsom convinced voters that the state needed to draw new maps to counteract gerrymandering done at President Trump's behest in Republican-led states such as Texas. In  Texas ,  Missouri  and  North Carolina , the new GOP-friendly maps were enacted after approval by the state legislature. But in California, Newsom and Democratic allies needed to win approval from voters for the new political lines, because voters had given congressional line-drawing power to an independent citizens commission in 2010. The commission remains popular in California, but Newsom was able to  amplify the partisan stakes  of the campaign, arguing that California could not stand by and watch Republicans bake in a sizable advantage through redistricting ahead of midterm elections that will decide control of power in a closely divided House of Representatives. The results, said California political strategist Erica Kwiatkowski Nielsen, \"shows a huge appetite and just the willingness of Californians to stand up to Donald Trump.\" \"I think the campaign did a fantastic job of saying and acknowledging people's fears that, hey, we've been a leader in California on redistricting but this isn't politics as usual,\" Nielsen said. \"These are unprecedented times.\" Newsom's \"Yes\" side wins the money battle Newsom, who has positioned himself as a primary foil to Trump, amassed a war chest to support the measure — bringing in nearly $120 million as of Friday. Top donors included House Majority PAC, a group working to elect Democrats to the House, and George Soros' Fund for Policy Reform. The Yes campaign blanketed the state with ads featuring top Democrats, from former President Barack Obama to New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Polling in the last week of the campaign  showed more than 90% of Democrats supporting the measure and more than 90% of Republicans opposed. That didn't bode well for opponents of Proposition 50, given Democrats' strong registration advantage in the state. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The campaign against Proposition 50 was led by Charles Munger Jr., a Bay Area donor who bankrolled the original campaign to create the citizens redistricting commission in 2008. Munger contributed nearly $33 million to the No on 50 campaign — but his donations accounted for roughly three-quarters of the $44 million raised by opponents. Other Republican heavyweights stayed away from the campaign and spending against Proposition 50 dried up in the final weeks of the race, as polling showed the measure opening up a wide lead. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former California Republican governor who worked with Munger to create the citizens commission, played a restrained role in the campaign — voicing his opposition to Proposition 50 in just a handful of interviews and public appearances. The changes to the state's congressional map are sure to trigger a series of difficult decisions for Republican incumbents in the coming weeks. U.S. Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley and Doug LaMalfa will have to weigh running in districts where chances of reelection range from challenging to virtually impossible. The new lines approved under Proposition 50 will remain in place through the 2030 election, after which the citizens commission would again take over redistricting responsibilities. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1196978795","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"New Economic Policy Implementation Marks Turning Point in Political Landscape","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On April 10, 2024, President Rivera announced a new policy aimed at addressing economic inequality.

Here's how to eat it responsibly \n         By Stacey Vanek Smith, Clare Marie Schneider \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, September 10, 2024 • 1:42 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on March 7, 2024, and has been updated.  Climate change is affecting our food, and our food is affecting the climate. NPR is dedicating a week to  stories and conversations about the search for solutions . As a consumer, it can be hard to know if the fish at the supermarket or on the menu is contributing to the degradation of marine life.  Overfishing has led to the decline of entire species, like Atlantic cod,  according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . And destructive fishing practices have driven others, like the Maui dolphin, to near extinction.  That's why it's crucial to get more information about the fish you eat — especially about how it was caught and where it came from.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Your Life Kit for living more sustainably \n       Your choices matter, says  Jennifer Dianto Kemmerly , vice president of global ocean initiatives at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. When people buy sustainable fish — fish that minimize harm to our wildlife and oceans — it sends \"a very clear market signal to the industry that this is what people want: healthy, responsible [fish] that's good for people and the planet.\"  Kemmerly, who works on  Seafood Watch,  the aquarium's sustainable seafood advisory list, shares three principles to consider when eating seafood.  Ask the right questions  Let's say you're at a restaurant or the fresh fish counter at the supermarket and you want to get the salmon — but you're not sure whether it's sustainable. To find out, simply ask the server or the fishmonger, says Kemmerly. Here are two key questions:  Is this fish pole or line-caught?  If the answer is yes, that's usually a good sign, says Kemmerly. \"Even at a commercial scale, a fishing boat can see what they just reeled in and if they caught a fish that's too small or is a different species they didn't intend [to catch], they can quickly release it.\"  When trawling or large nets are used to catch fish, sometimes other species are caught by accident, says Kemmerly. This is referred to in the industry as \"bycatch.\" Fish or marine life that get caught in these nets are often considered waste and thrown overboard.  According to NOAA , \"these unintentionally caught animals often suffer injuries or die.\"  Is this fish caught in the U.S.?   If so, it's probably a sustainable choice. \"The U.S. has some of the most stringent regulations\" of fishing in the world,  Kemmerly says. For example, if fish populations are depleted, fisheries in the U.S. are required to rebuild them to sustainable levels.  Do your research If you're not able to ask these questions, you may need to get your answers elsewhere. For example, if you're buying frozen shrimp in the seafood aisle of the supermarket and have limited information about its origins.  In addition to Seafood Watch, you can find information about sustainable fish on the  NOAA's  FishWatch site or the  Environmental Defense Fund 's Seafood Selector tool. (Which resource you use is up to you and your personal values, advise experts in  an NPR story from 2017  about seafood guides — each may offer different recommendations based on varying factors.) \n       \n      Related Story:  I Want To Eat Fish Responsibly. But The Seafood Guides Are So Confusing!   \n       All you need to do is look up the fish — say, pink shrimp from the U.S. — to get its status. According to the  NOAA's website , \"U.S. wild-caught pink shrimp is a smart seafood choice because it is sustainably managed and responsibly harvested under U.S. regulations.\" So that should give you confidence that pink shrimp is a safer choice for the environment.  Compare that to Argentine red shrimp caught in Argentina. Seafood Watch has flagged it as  a fish to avoid  because of concerns about bycatch.  Kemmerly recommends reading up on your go-to fish. Having the facts handy makes it easier to decide which seafood to eat without contributing to overfishing.  Don't be swayed by seafood labels  You might see seafood labels like \"wild-caught\" and \"farm-raised\" when buying fish. Don't be swayed by either term when determining what to eat, says Kemmerly.  Just because a fish is \"farm-raised,\" or raised in a pen or tank, doesn't mean it's sustainable. The same goes for a fish that is \"wild-caught,\" or caught from its natural habitat.  Knowing how a fish was harvested can be a helpful puzzle piece in determining how sustainable it is, but on their own, these labels don't provide much information. The most important factor is its impact on the environment, Kemmerly says. \n       \n      Related Story:  Sustainable Seafood? It's A Question Of Data \n       Remember there are other fish in the sea Don't be afraid to get outside of your comfort zone and try other kinds of fish. There are some tasty options outside of salmon, tuna and shrimp — the most popular fish in the U.S. — that you may be overlooking.  Like  farmed mussels , says Kemmerly. They are high in protein and the environmental impact of farming them is minimal,  according to Seafood Watch . Or  Arctic char , a cold-water fish with a rich, flavorful taste and the same pink color as salmon.  According to Seafood Watch , \"the stock is considered healthy, and the fishery is managed well.\" You may be pleasantly surprised by what you find. Kemmerly says she discovered sablefish when she was trying to move away from eating bluefin tuna. \"It's kind of buttery. It's denser and prepares well.\"  There's another sustainable benefit to diversifying your palate, says Kemmerly: it helps avoid overtaxing one type of fish species.

Salmon are not native to Chile.] MARIELLE SEGARRA, BYLINE: You're listening to LIFE KIT... (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...From NPR. STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:   Ahoy, LIFE KITers. I'm Stacey Vanek Smith in for Marielle Segarra. CLARE MARIE SCHNEIDER, HOST:   And I'm Clare Marie Schneider, a producer for LIFE KIT. VANEK SMITH: And today, Clare and I are bringing you a very special tale about fish, namely which fish to eat, because fish are some of the only wild animals that we consume on a mass scale. And it can be very hard to know what's OK to eat and what might be really harming the ocean or what's really overfished. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So we visited a restaurant in New York that is doing fish a little differently. It's called Rosella. It's a little sushi place in the East Village. VANEK SMITH: And the night we went, it was packed. It was hopping. People were dancing to the music a little. And we were all sort of sitting around watching the chefs, like, chop up the fish. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. And they were blaring U.K. rap really loud. VANEK SMITH: It was its own scene. ANDREW SORLAESITH: I'm Andrew. I'll be helping you with food tonight. So if you have any questions... VANEK SMITH: Andrew Sorlaesith is a sushi chef at Rosella. He's been making sushi for a decade, and he was serving up some of the restaurant's signature dishes. SORLAESITH: We have a porgy from Montauk. This one is dry aged, and... SCHNEIDER: It's a little loud. It might be a little hard to hear him, but he is telling us that he is serving us porgy sashimi. VANEK SMITH: Dry aged porgy sashimi from Montauk. SORLAESITH: Porgy is like a very American fish. You find it here, like, the Northeast a lot, but most people don't use it for sushi. VANEK SMITH: But I don't think, like, the California roll needs to be shaking in its shoes right now. But in fairness, porgy sashimi was basically the reason that we were at Rosella because porgy is quite sustainable. And Rosella is one of the only sustainable sushi restaurants in New York City. It only serves fish that have been sustainably farmed or caught. SCHNEIDER: Yeah, and the results are some kind of cool twists on classics. SORLAESITH: And then this one is actually made with - it's very similar to, like, a Philly roll. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I was going to say, there's cream cheese... SCHNEIDER: Yeah, the Philadelphia roll, which is usually made with smoked salmon, cream cheese and avocado. VANEK SMITH: I love cream cheese in a sushi roll. This is how you know that the U.S. has gotten involved (laughter). In whatever sushi roll it is, we have added cheese. SCHNEIDER: But Rosella does do it a little differently. SORLAESITH: This one is served with a dill cream cheese and our housemade tamago - the Japanese rolled omelet. VANEK SMITH: A smoked trout Philadelphia roll. Actually, this - I think we both - Clare Marie, that was pretty delicious. But it kind of shows how being a sustainable sushi restaurant puts you in this kind of bind. Because, you know, a lot of the greatest sushi hits - the rolls that people come in to order - they don't really make the cut. For instance, salmon - that is definitely one of the most popular sushi fish. So this time of year, sustainable salmon, it's just really hard to come by. So right now, Rosella's salmon avocado roll is actually an Arctic char avocado roll. SCHNEIDER: And it's actually dishes like the char avocado roll that brought Sasha Litvinov (ph) to the restaurant the night we were there. VANEK SMITH: Do you know that it's a sustainable sushi restaurant? SASHA LITVINOV: Yes, very much a draw. Part of what drew me is that it's a sustainable sushi restaurant. It's, you know, a complete travesty getting - what's going on in the oceans these days, and the fact that somebody is paying attention and trying to make it - you know, do their part in this town is really exciting. So... VANEK SMITH: So Sasha has a point about what's going on in the oceans right now. In fact, the World Bank estimates that almost 90% of global fish stocks are overfished. And the effect - it's kind of mind-blowing. It's been pretty devastating. Over the past 40 years, marine species have seen their populations fall by more than a third. SCHNEIDER: And Sasha said that she appreciates that, at Rosella, she can just order anything she wants off the menu because she knows all the fish is sustainable. VANEK SMITH: Right. I mean, and I felt that, too, when we were there. You can just kind of order anything off the menu and they've done all the curating for you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANEK SMITH: But, you know, Clare Marie, let's say you don't have the money to eat at a sustainable sushi restaurant every night. Maybe you just need to figure out which fish to buy to cook up for dinner or, you know, you're at Red Lobster and you're trying to figure out what to order. Don't worry. We have got you covered. You can have your fish cake and eat it, too. SCHNEIDER: This is going to be the whole episode, isn't it? VANEK SMITH: I have so many - so many fish puns that I've been saving up for this moment, Clare Marie. It's going to be the whole episode, yes. On this episode of LIFE KIT, along with many, many fish puns, we are going to take a deep dive into fish - what to eat, what not to eat... SCHNEIDER: And what to consider when you're buying fish, too. VANEK SMITH: OK. So, Clare Marie, before we dive into which fish to eat, which fish not to eat, what's sustainable, we should probably talk about how we are defining sustainable in this episode because it can mean a lot of different things. For our purposes today, we're talking about fishing practices that don't have a really negative environmental impact. And this is everything from, like, overfishing to local ecosystems, all of it. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So you're at the grocery store, and you're looking at all the fish for sale. You're seeing tuna, shrimp, crabs, trout, whatever. But how do you know what you should buy? JENNIFER DIANTO KEMMERLY: Hello, my name is Jennifer Dianto Kemmerly. I'm the vice president of Global Ocean Conservation at Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So the Monterey Bay Aquarium has created one of the best resources for people who are trying to eat more sustainably. It's called the Seafood Watch Guide. VANEK SMITH: Yes. Seafoodwatch.org is totally free, and it's become kind of a big thing. KEMMERLY: It's actually quite unique. It wasn't planned at all. VANEK SMITH: Yes. And Jennifer says this whole thing, the whole Seafood Watch Guide started by accident back in the '90s. The aquarium put this flyer out in their cafe to just let guests know how they were sourcing the seafood that they were serving there at the cafeteria. KEMMERLY: So we created these little tent cards and lo and behold, people started taking them, which was a real surprise to us. But we're like, wow, I think we're on to something here. People are really interested in this information. VANEK SMITH: So then Seafood Watch evolved into these little wallet-sized cards and then to a website, and it is now used by millions of people all over the world. It covers every kind of fish you can think of, from northwestern brook trout to Alaskan king crabs to Caribbean lobster. It is all covered by the seafood watch's, like, traffic light system. SCHNEIDER: That's our first takeaway. Do your homework. VANEK SMITH: Use a guide and look up the seafood that you tend to like to buy or order at a restaurant. Take yourself to fish school. SCHNEIDER: There are a bunch of sites and they're all really thorough and free. So obviously, Seafood Watch, of course, but also, NOAA has a great guide and so does the Safina Center at Stony Brook University, and the Environmental Defense Fund has a seafood selector. VANEK SMITH: Yes. I mean, and truly, like, we've looked at all of these, Clare Marie. The sights are kind of overwhelming. There is just, like, so much information and it gets really, really granular. It's just - it's so hard to know. I mean, there are really great farmed fish, there are really terrible farmed fish, totally sustainable wild-caught fish, totally unsustainable wild-caught fish. And the idea of trying to look through it while you are, like, in line or while a server is staring at you, waiting for you to order something, that could be hard. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So Jennifer recommends actually just picking the fish that you tend to eat. You know, the stuff that you're buying or ordering at restaurants. And educate yourself. Stacey, what's your favorite kind of fish? VANEK SMITH: I mean, I - this is going to sound so basic, but it is the truth. My favorite fish is salmon. I love salmon. SCHNEIDER: So yeah, if you look up salmon in the Seafood Watch Guide, you'll see different kinds of salmon are totally sustainable - green light fish. And then others get a red light. So as of this taping, king salmon farmed in Alaska and New Zealand gets a green light. Also, salmon caught with gillnets or trolling lines in the Northeastern U.S. - green light. VANEK SMITH: And red light, which means, like, take a pass for now, that would be king salmon caught with gillnets in Canada, those salmon are apparently overfished. Also, coho salmon farmed in Chile. Apparently, there's been a problem with the fish getting out of the pens and harming the wild, native species there. So red light. SCHNEIDER: Yellow light, this means there are some concerns about how it's been raised, like farmed Atlantic salmon raised in Norway can be good, but they use some chemicals to get rid of sea lice on the fish, which may be a little iffy. But there are all kinds of factors Seafood Watch takes into account. VANEK SMITH: Yes. And Jennifer says for salmon, for the specific case of salmon, a lot of the farms, they just, like, really pack the fish in there. And that's a lot of what can create a red light situation. KEMMERLY: I would love the listeners to envision these big net pens off the coast floating, and in those net pens are hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, depending on how big the net pen is, of salmon. And any time you have a large number of one species in a space, disease can spread very quickly. So what we do when we're assessing farmed salmon is we're really looking at the chemical and the pesticide use. And depending on the patterns of the water temperature, how many fish are packed into a net pen, this really does impact disease outbreaks and chemical use. SCHNEIDER: But then there are issues that have nothing to do with the animal itself. Take for example the Maine lobster. VANEK SMITH: Oh no, I love Maine lobster. SCHNEIDER: I know, me too. So the real problem here isn't actually the lobster population itself, it's that the lobster pots they use end up entangling a lot of North Atlantic right whales, and they're really endangered. There are only around 300 left in the world. So it's a red light. VANEK SMITH: But there are still options if you want to eat a green light lobster. Let's say you're at a Red Lobster, Clare Marie, and Lobster Fest, I think is on right now. You can opt for the rock lobster from Florida right now or the langostino lobsters from Chile. Both of those get a green light. And when - you know, when you're at Red Lobster, one of the best things to do that everybody told us to do was just to ask questions, to ask a lot of questions, to be that annoying customer that just will not stop asking questions. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. So Jennifer said this is actually one of the most powerful things you can do. And it's our second takeaway. It's to ask questions. And if the answer is I don't know, keep asking. KEMMERLY: Just asking, is this sustainable? Or even asking, is this wild card or farm raised? It's really surprising how many retailers and restaurants can't tell you. And I think as a consumer, just making it known that that's important to you really helps programs like Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch do the work that we need to do. So help us help you. Ask questions at point of sale. Is it farmed or wild? Is it sustainable? Where is it from? And if you ever see just white fish on the menu, please ask what does that mean? Because it can be anything from, like, a farm-raised striped bass to Arctic char. VANEK SMITH: And Jennifer says those questions have a big impact. Servers and fish sellers will feel pressure to know that information, and that can actually push them to make changes. Jennifer says she has seen this happen. SCHNEIDER: Take the rockfish. It's a white California coastal fish, and it used to solidly be in the red category. VANEK SMITH: Yes. Apparently it is very tasty, and it was on a lot of fancy California menus, and the chefs did not want to take it off because people loved it. KEMMERLY: It had been red rated because it was overfished for all the reasons that we've been talking about, and we were seeing the populations dwindle. VANEK SMITH: But people started asking restaurants about it. A lot of customers started asking a lot of questions. And, Jennifer says, restaurants and fish sellers - they felt the heat. KEMMERLY: Chefs and local businesses who relied on rockfish as part of their menu staples were starting to get engaged and say, what are we doing? What are we doing here? So it was really raising the alarm. So the government, the fishing community, the conservation organizations, academia came together and started co-designing solutions. VANEK SMITH: Special protected areas were created to encourage breeding. Fishing was regulated to certain times of year. And now the rockfish is a green-light fish. So, you know, using these guides, educating yourself, asking questions - this is just a great way to make sure that you're eating fish that you feel good about eating. SCHNEIDER: Yeah. And if you don't have your phone with you, or it's dead, or you just need to make a fast call, there are some general rules you can follow. VANEK SMITH: Rule No. 1 - ask how the fish was caught. If it is pole-and-line caught, Jennifer says that is usually a very good sign. That is a green flag. Some other fishing practices, like the use of nets or trawlers - that can sometimes be a little more iffy, but pole-and-line - thumbs up all the way. SCHNEIDER: Also, if the fish is farmed or caught in the U.S., that's usually a good sign because U.S. regulations are quite strict around fishing and raising fish, so you're probably OK there. VANEK SMITH: And one thing to ignore is price, because unlike with most food, sustainable fish are not necessarily more expensive. In fact, we heard this from Rosella's head chef and owner Jeff Miller. He said this is something he discovered when he decided to open his sustainable sushi restaurant. SCHNEIDER: He knew that he was going to have to find some nontraditional sushi fish. And for about two years, he tried every single fish that met his sustainability criteria. JEFF MILLER: I kept track, and there were - we used, I used, 91 unique species of fish in here, and not all of them worked. A lot of it was just, like - anytime I would see a fish that that I hadn't worked with before, I would bring it in. SCHNEIDER: Jeff said that in a lot of the cases, the most sustainable fish were actually way cheaper than the sushi-grade fish he used to import from Japan. MILLER: If you then switch to looking at what's from Long Island, it's hard to find fish that are as expensive as the fish that you're getting from Tokyo. Porgy is an abundant fish. There's so much porgy up and down the East Coast. And it's - in general, it's like $4 a pound. VANEK SMITH: And it makes a mean sashimi. SCHNEIDER: And so did another seafood that you don't often see in sushi restaurants - mussels. MILLER: It's kind of the next level of sustainability in that they're filter feeders. They're good for the water that they grow in, and super cheap. SCHNEIDER: This brings us to our third takeaway - seek out more sustainable fish and give it a try. VANEK SMITH: Yes. In fact, those mussels that Jeff was just talking about - they are taking center stage at the Monterey Bay aquarium this month. For the 25th anniversary of the seafood watch list, the aquarium is unveiling its super-green list, aka fish that are super green, exceptionally environmentally friendly and exceptionally sustainable. SCHNEIDER: So every month they're going to name one seafood, and they're going to provide recipes and nutritional facts. And for March, the pick is mussels. VANEK SMITH: And you know, we did try some mussels. SCHNEIDER: We tried Chef Jeff's pickled mussels. And Chef Andrew served it up for us. SORLAESITH: And then the pickled mussels - the muscles are from Maine. They're pickled in Chardonnay vinegar and served with a spicy aioli. VANEK SMITH: And so, Clare Marie, as you know, I was not 100% sold on the porgy, but the pickled mussels - those were great. I could eat pickled mussels from Rosella every day. It felt like a real flex from the chef. Like, get it? Like, mussels and flexing. SCHNEIDER: OK, let's serve up our takeaways, Stacey. VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) Oh, my gosh, Clare Marie. My heart just grew three sizes. Serve it up. SCHNEIDER: Takeaway No. 1 - use an online guide. There are a bunch of great ones. They're free. And the information is amazing. And it goes super in-depth on all kinds of aspects about where your fish came from. And maybe look up some of your favorites in advance. Those guides are kind of complicated and very thorough. VANEK SMITH: Takeaway No. 2 - ask questions. Ask all the questions. Be that annoying guest, because just the act of asking questions can make a real difference, can have a real impact. SCHNEIDER: Takeaway No. 3 - look up sustainable fish and maybe try some out. You might find something that you really like. VANEK SMITH: That is so true. And you know why, Clare Marie? SCHNEIDER: Why? VANEK SMITH: There are just a lot of fish in the sea. SCHNEIDER: Like porgy. VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) Like porgy. SCHNEIDER: For more LIFE KIT, check out our other episodes.

the longest in U.S. history. See how it compares \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The ongoing government shutdown entered its 36th full day on Wednesday, which officially makes it the longest in U.S. history. It takes the title from the most recent shutdown, which stretched from December 2018 to January 2019 during the first Trump administration. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That impasse started with Democrats' refusal to fund President Trump's southern border wall. It ended — 35 days and an  estimated $3 billion  in lost GDP later — after a series of escalating disruptions, including to air travel, put pressure on Trump and Republicans in Congress to reach a compromise. This time around, the government shuttered on Oct. 1 after Congress failed to break a stalemate over funding negotiations. More than a month later, an end to the stalemate appears nowhere in sight. There have been 20 \"funding gaps\" since Congress introduced the modern budget process in 1976, according to the  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , but many of those were only a few days long. Before now, only  three funding lapses  shut down the government for more than two weeks — and they were all within the last 30 years. (There was another shutdown in 1978, but that was before funding gaps halted government operations the way they do today.) While Republicans control both chambers, they need 60 votes to pass a spending bill in the Senate. Democrats are using that as leverage to push for an extension of Affordable Care Act  subsidies that are due to expire  at the end of this year, potentially leaving millions of Americans without health insurance. Republicans have said they are open to talks on the subsidies — but only after the government reopens. In the meantime, both parties are pointing the finger  at each other  and doing little, at least publicly, to reopen the government. The Senate has now tried — and failed — 14 times to pass a  House-approved  stopgap funding bill. The House, meanwhile, has been out of session since the shutdown began. Americans are feeling  the worsening impacts  every day. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Over 1 million federal workers are working  without paychecks . Another roughly 600,000 have been furloughed, and although a 2019 law ensures they are entitled to backpay after the shutdown is over,  recent comments  by President Trump have left many worried about whether that will still happen. Air traffic control shortages have caused delays and  disruptions at airports  across the country.  National park sites  are reducing operations and  Smithsonian museums  are closed. The  IRS furloughed  nearly half its staff, creating delays in taxpayer services. Tens of thousands of children from low-income families are now at risk of losing  access to the Head Start  program. And, federal food and nutrition benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) stopped over the weekend, prompting widespread outcry and pushback from two federal judges. In response, the Trump administration says it will restart those payments — but they  will be delayed  and may  only be for half the amount  people typically get. In a  weekend interview  with  CBS News , Trump continued to place blame on Democrats, and called on Senate Republicans to  end the filibuster  to bypass Democrats altogether. Senate Republicans have rejected that plea.

It wasn't until she was in her 50s, researching her family tree, that she discovered a family secret: Corrigan found documents showing her mother, Bridget Dolan, had given birth to two boys in 1946 and 1950, in a home for unwed mothers. It was an era when the Roman Catholic Church dominated Irish life. There was no sex education. Birth control and abortion were illegal, and pregnancy outside marriage brought shame. Dolan died in 2001 without ever speaking about her sons. \"I never knew what she was going through,\" says Corrigan, 69, paging through black-and-white photos of her First Communion. \"See the grip my mother has holding me? What was going through her mind, after losing two children? [Were they] taken away, dead, adopted?\" Throughout the 20th century, the Irish government and Catholic Church ran facilities called mother and baby homes, where single women who got pregnant could go to give birth. Mothers typically stayed about a year, while breastfeeding, but were then forced out — without their babies. These were similar to Ireland's  Magdalene Laundries , Catholic-run, all-female workhouses where women who were considered disgraced often lived indefinitely, doing unpaid or underpaid labor, usually as laundresses. The last Magdalene Laundry operated in central Dublin  until 1996 ; the last mother and baby home  closed two years later . Tens of thousands of women passed through these facilities. Many of their children never came out. Only now, as the Catholic Church's  influence wanes  and Ireland grows more secular —  voting in 2015  to legalize same-sex marriage and  abortion in 2018  — and as genetic testing goes mainstream, are families investigating their links to this dark chapter of Irish history. Corrigan's search for her missing siblings has taken her to a muddy field in the western Irish town of Tuam, in County Galway, where a mother and baby home was demolished in the mid-1970s. It operated from 1925 to 1961, run by a Catholic order of nuns called the Sisters of Bon Secours. In the mid-1970s, two neighborhood boys were playing on the grounds of the Tuam home, when they fell down a hole into a disused septic tank. To their horror, they discovered the tank was lined with tiny human skeletons — and the fate of some of Ireland's missing children became known. But it would take decades for anyone to investigate how many babies were buried in Tuam, and even longer — until this past July — for anyone to unearth them. What life was like inside Ireland's mother and baby homes A stone wall still runs along what was once the perimeter of Tuam's mother and baby home. \"It was a prison. If you looked out, all you saw was a high wall all around,\" recalls P.J. Haverty, 73, who was born inside and still lives down the road. \"I feel like our brains didn't develop in there.\" Ireland was relatively poor through most of the 20th century, and conditions in the mother and baby homes were meager. Food, sanitation and medical care were often inadequate, and nuns did not prioritize better care for these marginalized children. During parts of the 1930s and 1940s, more than 40% of children in these institutions did not live past their 1st birthday, a  government report later found . Overall, about 15% of children in Ireland's mother and baby homes died, mostly of disease, malnutrition and neglect, the report says. There was no evidence of any deliberate killing. \"Measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, and some of them had boils all over the body,\" says Catherine Corless, a 71-year-old amateur historian who first uncovered death records for hundreds of infants and children who'd lived in the Tuam home. \"There were a lot of children in Ireland [who] at the time, before penicillin, were dying. But this home had a rate of four times higher than the death rate of children and infants in Ireland of those diseases.\" Haverty doesn't remember conditions inside the home. Perhaps he blocked out the trauma, he says. His earliest memories are only of that stone wall, and of being segregated from other children in his primary school classroom. The first time he received any tenderness or affection, he recalls, was just before his 7th birthday, when a woman who would become his foster mother held his hand and led him away from the home. Discrimination continued for most of his life, he says. \"Because you were born out of wedlock, you were different. One man told me I was dirt from the street, that I was a disease carrier,\" Haverty, now a grandfather, recalls. \"When I got older and started going to the pub, there were elderly people who would switch seats, so they wouldn't have to sit alongside you.\" A rare reunion between mother and son After her son was born, Haverty's birth mother was sent to live in a separate wing of the Tuam home, while the nuns oversaw his care. She was allowed to visit him several times daily, only to breastfeed. Twelve months later, she was forced to leave without him.  Decades later, Haverty found letters she'd written to the Bon Secours Sisters, begging for custody. He also found the nuns' response, refusing her request and asking for money for his care.  Most children, if they survived infancy in the Tuam home, were fostered out or adopted before their 10th birthdays. Many grew up knowing little about their origins. \"I knew I was born in Tuam, but I didn't know anything else. I didn't know [until decades later that] it was at a mother and baby home,\" says Carmel Smyth Larkin, 76, who left as a toddler and still lives near the home. \"My foster parents didn't ask, or they weren't allowed to. The church was so powerful! You didn't question.\"  After Haverty was fostered out to a family living on a farm outside town — where he says he had a happy upbringing — he had a brief encounter with a woman he would later learn was his birth mother, Eileen Haverty. It happened when he was corralling cows on a road near the farm one day. He must have been around 12, he estimates. A car pulled up alongside him, and a woman asked for directions. Young Haverty pointed her in the right direction, and the car moved slowly alongside him for a bit. \"The lady in the passenger seat … as we were walking along, the smile and the looking she was doing at me, I got scared! 'Cause I thought then, did I [mistakenly] let the cows out in front of them?\" Haverty recalls, laughing. The encounter wasn't a coincidence. Eileen Haverty had received a tip from a former neighbor about where her son's foster family lived. She'd asked the local priest to arrange a meeting, P.J. Haverty says, but the priest refused and threatened her to stay away from her son and his foster family, warning that she would \"only confuse him.\" Eileen, undeterred, drove past their house often, looking for her son, and finally saw him that day corralling the cows. Years later, former neighbors connected them, and Eileen Haverty was able to reveal to her son that she was indeed the woman in the car that day. They reunited in 1977, when P.J. Haverty was 25. In photos of the two of them, sitting together on a sofa in London, they look strikingly similar — with the same wide smile. Haverty visited Eileen several times in London, where she lived out her days and where she died in 2011. He was her only child.  Hundreds of other children, however, never came out of Tuam's mother and baby home. Discovering and reburying tiny skulls in their gardens Neighbors say there were rumors for years. A woman named Ellen, who grew up near the site of the Tuam home after its buildings had been demolished, says everyone in the neighborhood has a story of finding \"skulls and other remains\" in their gardens. She didn't want to give her last name because of the shame she says the home has brought her and her community.  Ellen says she recalls her father and another neighbor simply reburying the bones. Neighbors would pray over the mass grave annually, she says. \"We always knew! Everybody knew it was consecrated ground,\" says Ellen, 41, who still lives across the street from her childhood home. \"We were told when we went out to play, 'Do not go in the babies' graveyard. Stay out of the babies' graveyard.' And it was fine, we all knew what it was. You didn't go in, you respected it. We're Catholics. So you don't mess on consecrated ground.\" Just how many infants were buried there, though, no one in town was ever quite sure — until Corless, the amateur historian, started investigating. A former classmate always wondered what happened to those children Corless grew up in Tuam and went to primary school with children born in the mother and baby home. \"I just vaguely remember them. They sat at the back of the class. They were skinny-looking, and they did have sores sometimes on their faces and hands,\" Corless recalls. \"We were told not to go near them.\" She too had long heard rumors about a mass grave. But unlike others, she decided to chase them up. In 2010, she began asking local officials, priests and the Sisters of Bon Secours about how many children died in their care. \"I had no idea what I was delving into. I was up against great opposition. The nuns said they know absolutely nothing. The authorities wouldn't let me see any records,\" she recalls. \"But I got them eventually.\" In 2012, she convinced a clerk at Tuam's town hall to search public records for anyone who died in the mother and baby home during its years of operation, from 1925 to 1961. She was expecting one or two a year, maybe. But the clerk said there were hundreds of death certificates. \"I got a cold shiver,\" Corless recalls. The clerk printed out a list of 796 infants and children whose deaths were recorded in the facility. They range from newborns to 4-year-olds. Corless published her findings later that year in an article headlined, simply, \" The Home ,\" in a local history journal. Irish media picked it up. Two years later, the Irish government ordered the creation of a national commission to investigate all of Ireland's mother and baby homes. In 2017, the commission  announced  that preliminary excavations had found \"significant quantities\" of human remains at the Tuam site. The Irish Taoiseach, or prime minister,  called  the home a \"chamber of horrors.\" When NPR visited Corless in July at her farmhouse just outside Tuam, she unfurled that long printout of names and spread it across her kitchen table along with some of the official death certificates. She has also made a papier-mâché model of the sprawling facility where the children died. Before it became a mother and baby home, the complex was a British colonial-era poorhouse during Ireland's 19th century potato famine. Corless gestures to where the facility's septic tank was. It became defunct in 1937, and that's when she believes the nuns started filling it with dead babies. \"They had to be lowered down into the tank, one on top of the other, the babies — probably lowered down on a sheet or something,\" she says. \"They had no regard for those children, because they were 'illegitimate.'\" \"They didn't bother to bring them to the cemetery across the road,\" Corless says. \"It was a way of hiding, I suppose, all the death, all the babies that were dying . \" Corless wins renown, and the nuns apologize In 2018, in recognition of her work uncovering what happened to Tuam's children, Corless was named one of Ireland's  People of the Year . The actor Liam Neeson is currently making  a movie about her . And in 2021, the Catholic order of nuns that ran the Tuam home, the Sisters of Bon Secours,  issued an apology . The order admitted it had played a role in a \"sorrowful\" chapter of Irish history \"in which many women and children were rejected, silenced and excluded; in which they were subjected to hardship; and in which their inherent human dignity was disrespected, in life and in death.\" \"We did not live up to our Christianity,\" the nuns wrote. On a 2018 visit to Ireland, Pope Francis  denounced  how Irish children were \"robbed of their innocence and taken from their mothers\" by Catholic-run institutions. He also met with Ireland's minister for children, and said her description of what happened in Tuam \"still echoes in my ears.\" A soaring dark stone church — the Cathedral Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary — still towers over Tuam. But weekday Masses are sparsely attended. When NPR visited in July, the priest saying Mass was from India. White-haired ladies in raincoats chatted in the church doorway after the service, but no one was willing to talk to a visiting reporter asking about the excavations taking place half a mile away, nor about any collective responsibility for what happened there.  \"We don't know anything,\" they said in unison, smiling politely. But a local nun — who didn't want to give her name because she's not authorized to speak for her Catholic order, the Sisters of Mercy — says she thinks the clergy who were once in charge of the Tuam home have been treated unfairly by history. \"There's a lot of misinformation. These children [in Tuam's mother and baby home] were very well cared for, as best they could! [The nuns] didn't have the resources,\" she says. \"Today people would say children have too much.\" The children who died in Tuam had virtually nothing. Excavations began in Tuam this summer The septic tank where hundreds of them are believed to be interred has since flooded several times over the decades. So unearthing the remains, matching their bones and identifying them is an arduous, delicate — and horrifying — task. It's being led by Daniel MacSweeney, a forensics expert who previously worked for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Yemen. Workers first used ground-penetrating radar in 2014 to locate evidence of remains and later traced them to the septic tank, where they began digging in small test areas. On July 14, widescale excavations began in earnest, using bulldozers and digging machines. Baby bottles and tiny shoes have since  been found  mixed in with fragments of tiny skeletons. Excavations are expected to last at least two years, MacSweeney's office says. After that, forensics experts will begin analyzing and identifying the remains.   Meanwhile, townspeople in Tuam and farther afield are  giving DNA samples  to Irish authorities working with MacSweeney's team, to determine whether some of the babies belonged to them or their relatives. Some families have said if there's a match, they'll apply for custody of the remains and arrange private reburials. Corrigan is still searching for her missing brothers Among those who've given DNA samples is Anna Corrigan — the Dubliner who thought she was an only child and is now searching for two brothers. She has located both of her brothers' birth certificates, but only one death certificate. Her eldest brother John Dolan's birth certificate shows he weighed 9 pounds when he born in the Tuam home in 1946. A year and a half later, his death certificate lists his causes of death as measles and \"congenital idiot,\" an outdated, derogatory phrase for mental disabilities, though there was no previous mention of Corrigan's brother having any. \"What does that even mean?\" Corrigan asks. \"Born at 9 pounds, that's a very healthy baby! But then I found a report from a year later that said he was emaciated, with a voracious appetite. And then he's dead four months after that, and he's a 'congenital idiot'?\" Her other brother, William Joseph Dolan, born at the Tuam home in 1950, is listed on the home's internal ledgers as having died in February 1951. But there's no cause of death, no medical certification of death and no death certificate. His date of birth is also crossed out and changed by three years. And he's not on Corless' printout of 796 children who died in the Tuam home. \"So are they digging for him, in those excavations?\" Corrigan asks. She thinks — hopes — he may still be alive. Corrigan believes her brother may have been sent to the United States for adoption, like  thousands of Irish babies  from the same era. Adoption wasn't legal in Ireland until 1953. Before that, adoptions still happened, but they were private, informal, often arranged by nuns discreetly — and unlawfully. Money often changed hands.  That may have been why Corrigan's brother's birthdate was changed, she believes. If he is alive, she doubts his name is still William Dolan. The nuns or an adoptive family would likely have changed it. But through DNA testing, biological relatives are now indeed finding each other. And that's been the case in this NPR reporter's own extended family.  The tip of the iceberg In the course of reporting this story, I discovered that one of my own cousins — adopted nearly six decades ago by my grandmother's sister and her husband, in New Jersey — came from a mother and baby home not far from Tuam, in County Tipperary. Through DNA testing, she's found two biological sisters. That home where she was born, called Sean Ross Abbey, operated until 1970. Public records show more than 1,000 children died there. No excavations have been done yet. Tuam is the first of Ireland's mother and baby homes to be excavated for remains. On the day digging began, Corrigan stood on the edge of the mass grave, musing about her lost brothers. \"Tuam is the tip of the iceberg,\" she says, \"and a lot more's to come.\" NPR producer Fatima Al-Kassab contributed to this story. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   One of Europe's biggest mass graves is being unearthed right now. It's in Ireland, and the victims are children who died in a home for unwed mothers. NPR's Lauren Frayer begins our story in Dublin. (SOUNDBITE OF PAGES TURNING) ANNA CORRIGAN: This is me, and this is me making my Holy Communion. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Anna Corrigan pages through family photos. She grew up in a Dublin tenement. CORRIGAN: An only child. I was born on the 1 September, 1956. FRAYER: And it wasn't until Corrigan was in her 50s that she discovered a family secret... CORRIGAN: This is John's birth certificate. FRAYER: ...Two older brothers, born before her mother got married. Her mother died in 2001 without ever mentioning their existence. But when Corrigan started researching her family tree, she found documents showing her mother had spent time in one of Ireland's mother and baby homes, where single women went to give birth. CORRIGAN: To the matron, please admit Bridget Dolan, 26 years of age. FRAYER: Now, this was 1940s Ireland. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Altar boys shower rose petals, and a special place is reserved for women wearing hooded cloaks. FRAYER: There was no sex ed. Birth control and abortion were illegal, and children born outside of marriage were seen as illegitimate. Corrigan scours old photos for any hint of the secret her mother kept. CORRIGAN: And as you can see, the grip my mother has holding me. What was going through her mind after losing two children - taken away, dead, adopted? FRAYER: Corrigan's search for her missing brothers has brought her to a town called Tuam in County Galway, where a mother and baby home closed in 1961 and was demolished about a decade later. (SOUNDBITE OF METAL CLANGING) FRAYER: Beyond this metal fence, it's just scrubby, muddy ground, a flag pole, and I can see a tall stone wall behind it, which used to encircle the home. It's now covered in moss. PJ HAVERTY: It was a prison. And if you look out, all you seen was a high wall all around. You seen nothing. FRAYER: PJ Haverty was one of the babies born on the other side of that wall, and he still lives down the road. He's 73 now. HAVERTY: They didn't want any bonding between the baby and the mother. You couldn't hold the baby and rock it, talk to it. FRAYER: So did she live there? HAVERTY: She lived there for 12 months. And when the 12 months was over, then they opened the door and told her to get out. FRAYER: Decades later, PJ found letters his mother had written to nuns who ran the home, begging for custody of him. The nuns refused and demanded she make monthly payments instead for his care. HAVERTY: She used to come down every so often, and she'd give them the money. And she was hoping that she'd get to see me, but no. And then the final day she came down, then the nuns said, you don't need to come here anymore. He's gone. FRAYER: He was sent to foster care just before his seventh birthday. Thousands of other children never came out. And in 1975, local boys were playing on the grounds of the home when they fell down a hole into a disused septic tank filled with tiny skeletons, and the fate of those other children became known. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC NOISE) FRAYER: Did you grow up in this house? ELLEN: No, I grew up in that house there. FRAYER: Oh, you lived (ph) here. I meet Ellen on a rain-slicked street behind where the skeletons were found. She didn't want to give her surname because of the shame she says this has brought her and her community. ELLEN: We always knew. There was a mass there every year. Everybody knew it was consecrated ground. We were told when we went out to play, do not go in the babies' graveyard. Stay out of the babies' graveyard. And, no, it was fine. We all knew what it was... FRAYER: Yeah. ELLEN: ...And you didn't go in. You respect it. Like, we're Catholics, so you don't mess on consecrated ground. FRAYER: Everyone knew, she says. Throughout the 1980s and '90s when she was growing up, all the neighbors knew there was a mass grave of infants behind their homes. But out of respect for the Catholic Church, nobody did anything... CATHERINE CORLESS: I'll find what I did with it. (SOUNDBITE OF PAPERS SHUFFLING) CORLESS: They're usually all together - probably in here. FRAYER: ...Until Catherine Corless started nosing around. You have a whole research library here. CORLESS: I - this is only a tiny part of it. FRAYER: Corless is an amateur historian. She also heard rumors of a mass grave and decided to chase them up. In 2012, she asked a clerk at city hall for death certificates of anyone who died in the mother and baby home during its years of operation, from 1925 to 1961. She was expecting one a year, maybe. CORLESS: And she said, there are hundreds. Now, I kind of got a cold shiver. Hundreds? I said. Yes, she said. FRAYER: The clerk handed her death records for 796 children - infants through 4-year-olds. CORLESS: Measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, some of them, boils all over the body - there was a lot of children in Ireland at the time, before penicillin, they were dying with. But the home had a rate of four times higher than the death rate of children and infants in Ireland of those diseases. FRAYER: Why would the nuns not take them to a hospital? I ask. And why are there death certificates but no burial records? There's a Catholic cemetery right across the road. CORLESS: It's blatantly obvious. They had no regard for those children because they were illegitimate, and they didn't seem to matter. They didn't bother bringing them to the cemetery across the road, and they just hid them. And then when that sewage system became defunct in 1937, that's when they started putting them into that tank. And it was a way of hiding, I suppose, all the deaths - all the babies that were dying. FRAYER: After Corless published her findings in a local history journal, the Irish government ordered an investigation. The prime minister called this a chamber of horrors. And in 2021, the Catholic order of nuns that ran this facility issued an apology, saying they were part of a system that didn't live up to their Christianity. (SOUNDBITE OF CHURCH BELL TOLLING) FRAYER: At a dark stone cathedral that still towers over this town... UNIDENTIFIED PRIEST: May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins. FRAYER: ...The daily mass is sparsely attended, and nobody is willing to talk to me about any collective responsibility. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Thank you, darling. We don't know anything about it. FRAYER: A nun who didn't want to give her name because she's not authorized to speak for her order, the Sisters of Mercy, tells me she thinks the clergy have been treated unfairly. UNIDENTIFIED NUN: Because these children, there's a lot of misinformation about it. These children, they were very well cared for - as best they could. They didn't have the resources. FRAYER: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED NUN: You know, today, people would say that children have too much - and families. (SOUNDBITE OF BULLDOZER RUMBLING) FRAYER: Excavations are now underway on a mass grave of children who died here with nothing. Among those who've given DNA samples is Anna Corrigan, the Dubliner who thought she was an only child and is now searching for two brothers. She's located their birth certificates but only one death certificate. So her brother, William Dolan, born in 1950... CORRIGAN: He's not on the list of the 796. So are they digging for him in Tuam? FRAYER: In your heart of hearts, what are you hoping for? CORRIGAN: Well, I believe he was adopted Stateside. FRAYER: Do you even know if his name is still William? CORRIGAN: No, it wouldn't be William. FRAYER: She believes her brother may have survived and been sent to the United States for adoption, like thousands of Irish babies from this era. CORRIGAN: And if anybody knows anything about William Joseph Dolan, born 1950 in Galway... FRAYER: While reporting this story, I even found out one of my own cousins, adopted into my extended family in New Jersey, was born in a mother and baby home in Tipperary, Ireland, where more than a thousand babies went missing. And no excavations have been done there. CORRIGAN: (Inaudible) OK. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING) FRAYER: And so standing on the edge of this one mass grave, Corrigan tells me this is only the tip of the iceberg. Lauren Frayer, NPR News in Tuam, Ireland.

Emulating traditional representations of the goddesses, Mann and her youngest daughter, Virginia, face forward while the eldest, Jessie, turns toward the ocean. They hold hands and appear graceful and elated as they urinate. Mann calls herself a \"chicken\" for not including the image in the book. \"I'm risk-averse fundamentally. And more so now,\" she said during a recent conversation at her studio. That's because Mann, whose work is held at major art institutions around the world, is reeling after police seized four of her most celebrated — and reviled — photographs off the walls of the  Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in Texas  in January. \"Awful\" and \"shocking,\" she recalled. In one, a toddler Virginia is asleep, sprawled across a bed she wetted. A popsicle drips on son Emmett's lower body, genitals included, in another. It's a tribute to early 20th century photographer Edward Weston's \" Torso of Neil \" (1925), of his own son. Both similarly evoke a marble sculpture, in \"marmoreal\" fashion to borrow one of Mann's favorite terms — she keeps a list handy — but Weston's is cropped above the sensitive bits. The black-and-white images are part of Mann's  Immediate Family   series, which  became a flashpoint  during the 1990s culture wars. Still, not once were her prints taken off the walls of a public site, until this year's seizure. The Danbury Institute, a conservative Christian advocacy group,  accused the museum of displaying \"child pornography\"  in a December 2024 open letter. Backed by  some local elected officials , they demanded the photographs be removed. \"Children cannot consent to such photography, and displaying these images publicly only perpetuates their exploitation,\" the group said. \"Such actions degrade the values of our community, endanger the innocence of childhood and contribute to a dangerous cultural shift.\" After the prints were seized, the museum said that an \"inquiry\" had been made into the photographs, which \"have been widely published and exhibited for more than 30 years in leading cultural institutions across the country and around the world.\" Director of communications Kendal Smith Lake declined to provide any further comment to NPR. A grand jury in Texas did not bring forward charges against Mann or the museum. The prints stayed out of the rest of the show's run and were later returned to her gallery. The incident has no recent precedent in the United States, though there are parallels. Amy Werbel, a professor of art history at the Fashion Institute of Technology, said that the events surrounding the removal of Mann's photographs  echo a period between 1873 and 1915  when \"police empowered by anti-obscenity statutes\" removed artwork from galleries and public spaces. Werbel said case law that emerged from that time made it more difficult to prosecute curators. The much publicized 1990 obscenity trial around the late  Robert Mapplethorpe's explicit photographs  of sadomasochism ended with an acquittal for Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director. The prints were not censored or destroyed, though the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., dropped a planned exhibit. \"We're entering a new era of culture wars, I'm quite sure. And I think the people who are pursuing this are much more sophisticated and have many more tools at hand,\" Mann said, pointing to social media as one such tool. Mann predicts more attacks on art by, as she put it, people who don't understand the art they're vilifying but do understand it's powerful. \"Nevermind that Jesus Christ is portrayed any number of times in great paintings nude, and there are little putti [chubby winged children] peeing into fountains right and left in every Italian garden,\" she said. \"This is just stuck in their craw, this whole notion of what is completely innocent child nudity and they somehow sexualize it. … That seems to be the trigger for them, the nudity.\" For law enforcement to remove artwork from a public institution could have a \"chilling\" effect on other museums and artists, Mann said. The Trump administration has said it intends to  audit  exhibitions and holdings at eight Smithsonian Institution museums to determine whether they align with the \"President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\" In  a post on social media , Trump called out \"Museums throughout Washington\" and those \"all over the Country\" as being \"the last remaining segment of 'WOKE.'\" And a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  told NPR  that Trump \"will start with the Smithsonian and then go from there.\" Those moves followed a  March executive order  that criticized the Smithsonian, saying it had come \"under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology\" and had been promoting \"narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" Mann said that artists like her now live with the fear that their art could be seized. \"They're not just reviewing the Smithsonian,\" she said. \"They're actively rewriting history. And that's terrifying. This is Orwellian.\" Lindsey Halligan, the lawyer who has been leading the review of the Smithsonian's exhibits for the White House, rejected that characterization. Halligan told NPR that Trump's   executive order  aims to \"depoliticize our nation's museums and ensure the Smithsonian presents history with balance, integrity and openness\" and that \"history is not being erased but shared more fully, free from partisan influence.\" Citing the Fort Worth controversy, Halligan said she thinks Mann's photography should \"never be in a federally funded institution like the Smithsonian.\" (Trump has said he  plans to nominate Halligan  as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia.) The Fort Worth museum is not part of the Smithsonian. Mann has photographed the site of Emmett Till's murder, corpses and her husband's body weakened by muscular dystrophy, but she's only faced significant backlash for her unvarnished renderings of everyday family life, from insect bites to a child's bite, bloody noses, vomit and wet beds. \"I don't want to be known as the controversial photographer,\" Mann said, letting out a heavy sigh. She estimates having taken more than 4,000 shots for  Immediate Family , with only around 60 of them printed or otherwise shown. Today, Mann said, she's not sure she'd make the images public. The photographs of her children are intimate. They're shown sometimes in the nude, striking defiant, sublime poses and romping through the isolated hills and river banks of her isolated property on the outskirts of Lexington, Va., where she too grew up and that now spans nearly 800 acres. She lives here with her two rescued Belgian Malinois dogs and her husband of 55 years, Larry, once a blacksmith and a lawyer. Mann succeeds in making her images appear fleeting and entirely spontaneous despite using an antique large-format view camera. The cumbersome nature of the equipment means the scenes often had to be staged. She says she isn't looking for the perfect crispness of large format photography found in the landscapes of Ansel Adams or Wynn Bullock, or in the prints of early master photographers — \"they would not have me in their club.\" Instead, she seeks out imperfections, and sublimes them. Many of her lenses are cracked — radiating light — and a Deardorff camera she hauls all over the countryside in the back of her car was sourced from a dumpster. Mann develops her own prints. She got from a different dumpster a pricey enlarger, a projector-like darkroom tool that helps create an image on photographic paper. The resulting prints are dreamy and mysterious, evoking a time beyond time. \"That's always been a motivation for me — to try and somehow meld loss and beauty and mystery and irony and memory and nostalgia and all that is rolled together in the South,\" Mann said. \"It has to be beautiful … because if we're going to persist as a species, we need beauty.\" Down the hill from her house, Mann keeps a separate studio in a cabin for her work with wet-plate collodion. It's a process that dates back two centuries, to the beginnings of photography. A glass plate is coated with a syrupy emulsion of collodion — nitrocellulose in ether and alcohol — before being placed in the camera and exposed. When Mann first started working with the process, there were very few practitioners — whom she sought out. In recent years, it's had a rebirth of sorts and \"you can't throw a dead cat without hitting someone with a collodion camera,\" she snorted. Taking a sniff from a bottle of collodion on the table, she noted its intoxicating smell: \"It's supposed to cure pain but never cured mine.\" That incurable pain includes the death of her son, Emmett, at the age of 36 after a struggle with schizophrenia in adulthood. Her new memoir is dedicated to him, \"O lost, and by the wind grieved.\" As her children became adults, Mann turned her lens on southern landscapes, places like Civil War battlefields or swamps used by people escaping slavery during the antebellum period. \"The South just runs through all my work,\" she said. \"There's something about southern light that's irresistible, but also the complexity that underlies its history.\" Mann, who grew up in the segregated South, says that complexity includes racism and slavery. At 74, she's now focusing on the James River and Point Comfort, where the first boat carrying enslaved people docked in 1619. One of the river's tributaries runs near her home. The images have also grown more experimental in recent years. When she does dip into digital photography, Mann jerry-rigs her camera with an uncoated antique lens. While developing a print from her latest series, she accidentally solarized it — reversing its tones — when she turned on her phone in a corner of the dark room. A surreal streak of light spread across the image. She's been trying to replicate this happy accident ever since. Her memoir is ostensibly aimed at budding creatives, packed with practical advice and anecdotes, divided into topics like luck, your darlings — as in those you kill through ruthless self-editing — and rejection, like a searing one from a gallerist in 1977 that left her in tears. Or, simply, as Mann puts it in her opening line: \"This is a book about how to get s*** done.\" Mann wants young artists to know it took time — 20 years — for her to gain major recognition, financial hardship included. \"You have to be prepared to do work in obscurity. I think that's one of the most important things in this book — early success can be really, really dangerous. And I think you have to be prepared to make a lot of work over a long period of time,\" she said. \"If it's good enough work, irrespective of how many rejections you've had … it will be received. It will be seen eventually. I truly believe that you can live in upstate Wisconsin. You can live in Arkansas. You can live in Appalachia like I do. And if your work is good enough, it won't be ignored.\" Today, hardly a month goes by without a show that includes her work somewhere in the world. A major traveling survey kicks off next year, with stops in Asia and South America. And in 2027, Gagosian Gallery, whose flagship space is in New York, will host an exhibit of her  Marital Trust  series. But her photographs face an uncertain future, as Mann reconsiders plans to donate her estate to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts since it receives public money. \"The ripples of this new regime are far-reaching, even reached to little old me. I don't know what to do,\" she said. \"Even if they held them and took perfect care of them and the prints themselves weren't at any risk, the funding for the museum might be at risk.\" The broadcast version of this story was edited by  Ashley Westerman . The digital version was edited by  Obed Manuel . \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   One of America's most influential and sometimes controversial photographers has a memoir out this month. Sally Mann's new book is called \"Art Work.\" NPR's Olivia Hampton went to her studio in rural Virginia. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS TWEETING) OLIVIA HAMPTON, BYLINE: When you turn up the hill to Sally Mann's home, horses graze and gallop in lush green fields dotted with trees. She lives on this farm with her husband of 55 years and their two rescued Belgian Malinois dogs. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING AND DOGS BARKING) SALLY MANN: Hi. Come on in. HAMPTON: Nice to meet you. MANN: No, no, likewise. Likewise. HAMPTON: Mann was born in these bucolic foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. This place and the broader South have inspired her work, beating inside her, as she puts it in the book, like a second heart. MANN: The South just runs through my - all my work. There's something about Southern light that's irresistible, but also the complexity that underlies its history. HAMPTON: Racism and slavery and... MANN: All of that is the complexity of which I speak. HAMPTON: What makes Mann's images so captivating is how they convey that complexity. Their dreamy, timeless feel owes much to century-old equipment that she favors. It's cumbersome and time-consuming. To show me how it works, Mann walks down to a studio she keeps in a cabin. MANN: Guess we waited a little long to mow this lawn. We should have run a hay baler through it. HAMPTON: Here, she uses what's known as the we-plate process, which dates back to the 19th century. First, a glass plate is coated with a syrupy solution of collodion - highly flammable stuff. The chemicals would have been heated on a stove. MANN: Your chemicals have to be a certain temperature, so I'd fill it with water. It's really a bad idea to have a wood stove in a collodion studio, but so far, I haven't blown up. HAMPTON: The plate is then loaded into a dark slide holder and inserted into a large-format camera. She throws a dark cloth over her head and manually uncovers the lens to expose the plate. Mann's lenses and cameras often have flaws - at first, by necessity. MANN: I wanted to do pictures that look different from other people's pictures. And I couldn't afford the equipment for the pictures that other people were taking, so I had to make do with what I had. And what I had was often cracked lenses or cameras with bellows that had holes in them, so strange light links came in. HAMPTON: She also works with film cameras like her Deardorff, a hulking wooden box on a tripod with sides that look like an accordion. Cameras like these aren't manufactured anymore, and a used one can easily fetch $2,000. Mann sourced hers in a unique way in New York. MANN: A friend was walking down 35th Street, and they had one of those chutes that came off, like, a fourth-floor window. They were destroying an apartment, and right in front of him, a Deardorff came down the trash chute. He crawled into the dumpster and grabbed this camera for me, and that's the camera I work with. It's a great camera. It's a little skewed because it was so roughly handled. HAMPTON: It might sound scrappy, but Mann is a master at turning imperfections into art - even when the subject is tough. She photographed the site of Emmett Till's murder, corpses and the advance of muscular dystrophy on her husband's body. But it's her immediate family series of her children that sparked outrage during the 1990s culture wars. As she puts it in the book... MANN: Intent doesn't matter. Your intent can be perfectly pure, and there's no way you can, like, chase after these pictures and say, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. HAMPTON: In those pictures, the three children strike defiant or sublime poses, sometimes in the nude. Conservatives accused Mann of child abuse. Still, not once were her photographs taken off the walls of a public site - until this year. MANN: We're entering a new era of culture wars, I'm quite sure. And I think the people who are pursuing this are much more sophisticated and have many more tools at hand. HAMPTON: In January of this year, under pressure from a Christian advocacy group with backing from some local elected officials, police seized four of these prints from the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in Texas. MANN: It was awful. It was shocking. HAMPTON: The photographs are more than 30 years old. One shows Mann's daughter lying in a wet bed. In another, a popsicle drips on her son's lower body. MANN: Never mind that Jesus Christ is portrayed any number of times in great paintings nude. That seems to be the trigger for them, is the nudity. HAMPTON: A grand jury declined to bring charges, and the prints were returned to Mann's gallery after the show closed. But she worries that the seizure was just the tip of the iceberg. Mann says artists like her are reeling from the Trump administration's efforts to change the American cultural landscape and to remove from public view evidence of some of the more controversial aspects of the country's history. MANN: It's chilling. They're actively rewriting history, and that's terrifying. This is Orwellian. HAMPTON: Lindsey Halligan, the lawyer who's been leading a review of Smithsonian museums for the White House, told NPR she rejects that characterization. She says the administration is trying to, quote, \"depoliticize\" museums and show history without, quote, \"partisan influence.\" In her memoir, Mann calls controversy a double-edged sword for artists. MANN: Do we have an obligation to make our art, I don't want to say political, but sociologically investigative? HAMPTON: I think the answer for you would be yes. You have done that. MANN: Yeah, but it has to be beautiful, too. It's too important to set aside for any political or sociological statement. HAMPTON: The book is candid about her insecurities, her failures and the role sheer luck plays in her success. She wants young artists to know it took time - 20 years for her - to gain major recognition. MANN: That's one of the most important things in this book. I think early success can be really dangerous, and I think you have to be prepared to make a lot of work over a long period of time. If it's good enough work, irrespective of how many rejections you've had, it will be received. It will be seen eventually. HAMPTON: At 74, Mann is still churning out new work, training her lens on the James River. A tributary runs near her home. She casually laid out some of those prints at the table where we sat to speak. Some focus on Point Comfort, where the first boats carrying enslaved people docked in 1619. MANN: I'll make a little note as to exactly when the light hits that one sliver of river that I want illuminated, you know, and I'll go back and take it. You find what works and you repeat the picture until you get it. HAMPTON: Olivia Hampton, NPR News, Lexington, Virginia.

kills 6, hospitalizes 25 \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Tuesday, November 4, 2025 • 2:28 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A deadly listeria outbreak connected to prepared pasta meals sold at grocery chains nationwide is worsening, federal health officials say. As of late October, the outbreak has killed six people and sickened 27, all but two of whom were hospitalized,  according to last week's update  from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). One of those affected was a pregnant mother, resulting in a fetal loss. Cases have been reported in 18 states: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Since the last CDC case count update on September 25, 2025, a total of 7 new illnesses from 3 states have been reported, with 2 additional deaths reported,\" the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said . That list has grown in recent months. The outbreak started in June, when listeria concerns prompted recalls of several brands of ready-to-eat chicken  fettuccine Alfredo meals made by FreshRealm Inc. and sold under the Home Chef brand at Kroger and the Marketside brand at Walmart. In response, FreshRealm began testing some of its pasta samples — and in mid-September, they came back positive for listeria. Further genetic testing confirmed it was the same strain of listeria that was detected in FreshRealm's previously recalled chicken Alfredo meal, the FDA said at the time. That discovery prompted the recall of two more products with specific use-by dates in late September and early October: Marketside Linguine With Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce, sold at Walmart, and Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo. They shared a pasta supplier, Nate's Fine Foods. The company supplies precooked pasta and grains to the wholesale food service and restaurant industries, according to its website. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In late September, Nate's further expanded its recall to include other batches of precooked pasta \"including fettucine, linguine, and farfalle (bowtie), after a sample of linguine pasta collected and tested by FreshRealm tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes,\"  the FDA said . Early October  saw the recalls  of several more pre-made pasta salads and heat-and-eat noodle dishes sold at Trader Joe's, Albertsons, Kroger, Walmart, Giant Eagle and Sprouts locations across the country. In a late  September statement , Nate's said it was recalling the products out of an \"abundance of caution\" and apologized for any concern it had caused. \"Our top priority is ensuring the safety of the people who enjoy our products, and we will continue to take all appropriate steps until this matter is resolved,\" it said, adding that it is working closely with the CDC, FDA and state health officials to identify the source. The  FDA says  it is working with Nate's to determine if additional recalls are needed. Health officials say customers who purchased any of these meals should throw them away, and clean their refrigerators, containers and any surfaces that may have come into contact with the food. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At this point, the products that were recalled between June and October are more likely to be in customers' fridges and freezers than on store shelves. Most of them had use-by dates earlier than Oct. 10. The  recalled product  with the longest shelf life is a frozen meal, Scott & Jon's Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Bowls. Those dishes, which were distributed to wholesale distributors and operators nationwide, have best-by dates in March 2027. A spokesperson for the company told NPR that retailers have removed the product from their shelves. What to know — and do — about listeria Listeria infection, or listeriosis, is most likely to sicken pregnant people and newborns, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems. Pregnant people may only experience mild symptoms like fever, fatigue and muscle aches, but should be aware that listeria could cause miscarriages, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of their newborn. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal issues, stiff neck, confusion and loss of balance. They usually start within two weeks of eating contaminated food but could start as soon as the same day or as late as 10 weeks later, the CDC says. It can be hard to confirm the scope of an outbreak, since some people recover from the infection without medical care. For those who do require medical attention, the CDC says it usually takes three to four weeks to determine whether their illness is part of an outbreak. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The CDC says it has interviewed 13 of the people who got sick as of late September. Seven of them reported eating precooked meals before their illness started, and four specifically mentioned eating chicken fettuccine Alfredo. The CDC and FDA say consumers should contact their health care provider to report any symptoms of listeriosis and receive care. They can also report any adverse health effects  to the FDA online . The U.S. has seen a number of listeria outbreaks in the past year. A 2024 outbreak tied to deli meat left 10 people dead and dozens more hospitalized across the country. A U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in January blamed \" inadequate sanitation practices \" at a since-closed Boar's Head facility in Virginia and listed  several steps  it would take to better protect the public from listeria.

Standing in the Rose Garden last April, President Trump proclaimed what he called \"liberation day,\" a day that \"will be remembered as the day American industry was reborn.\"   Oral arguments in the case are set for 10 a.m. ET. Listen here: Carrying out his campaign pledge to impose massive tariffs on foreign imports, Trump issued an executive order that initially imposed a tariff of at least 10% on goods from most countries doing business with the United States. Goods from countries like China have been hit with much higher tariffs — up to 145%, though they have since come down. Imports from allies like Canada and Mexico have been taxed at 25%; Canada's rate was later increased to 35%. In an interview with CBS'  60 Minutes  this week, Trump credited the tariffs with the deal he just negotiated with China, boasting that without tariffs, China would not have \"come to the table.\" The case before the court But the up and down, fluctuating tariffs around the world spooked American businesses, prompting a court challenge, contending that the president had exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs. In some two dozen previous cases, the Supreme Court has been largely receptive to Trump's claims of presidential authority, but those victories came on the Supreme Court's emergency docket, allowing Trump policies to take effect on a temporary basis while the litigation played out in the lower courts. In contrast, the tariff cases are the real deal, with the court having ordered full briefing and expedited arguments in the case, and offering the justices the first real opportunity to say \"no\" to the president.   One of the lead challengers to the tariffs is Victor Owen Schwartz, a wine and spirits importer from upstate New York who has been in business for 40 years.  \"The thing is there's such a misconception out there that foreign entities are paying the tariffs,\" he says, adding: \"I can't say this enough times: Americans are paying the taxes. American business is paying the taxes and it will be passed on to consumers.\" According to Schwartz, small businesses not only have to worry about fluctuating tariff rates, but the tariffs have also plunged the value of the dollar compared to the euro. When you add up all of these costs, he says, they amount to about 35% more he has to pay for his wines. So, he charges more, eats part of the tariff, and is down to a barebones profit that in the long run, he says, is \"unsustainable.\" Or as Schwartz wryly puts it: \"Do you think I can increase the price of Sancerre by 35%?\" Trump's view  Countering that argument is Trump who sees tariffs as potentially bringing in trillions of dollars to the federal government. They've brought in $195 billion this fiscal year, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group. \"I always say 'tariffs' is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,\" Trump has said, \"because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It's going to bring our country's businesses back that left us.\" Indeed, the tariffs are so important to the president that he flirted with the idea of attending Wednesday's argument. In the end, he decided against being the first president to do that, instead sending his treasury secretary. Regardless of who is in the court chamber on Wednesday though, the justices certainly know that a ruling against Trump would be a dramatic, even embarrassing, setback for the president, and none of the six conservatives, including three Trump appointees, is likely looking for a confrontation with the nation's chief executive.    The issue the justices must resolve is whether Trump has the power to unilaterally set tariff rates under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as IEEPA. Lower courts have ruled that Trump exceeded his authority under both the statute and the Constitution. But the president argues that both allow him to impose tariffs in order to deal with persistent trade imbalances and to stem the flood of fentanyl coming into the United States. Both, he asserts, present national emergencies and pose a threat to national security.   As Solicitor General D. John Sauer put it in the administration's briefs, were the Supreme Court to invalidate the tariffs, it \"would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy.\"  And he said, that were the court to rule against the president, it would \"lead to dangerous diplomatic embarrassment.\" While the administration conceded in the lower courts that this is the first time in the 50-year history of IEEPA that any president has tried to use the statute to impose tariffs on his own, it continues to maintain that the Trump tariffs are beyond the jurisdiction of the courts altogether, and that the only check on presidentially imposed tariffs would be if Congress were to specifically reject them. Arguments against tariffs   Countering that argument at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, lawyer Neal Katyal will tell the justices that the word \"tariff\" isn't even in the IEEPA statute and that there is \"zero\" authority under the statute to justify such sweeping presidential authority when the constitution itself gives the legislature, not the president, the power to tax.   \"The idea that every president had this power all along—Presidents Reagan to Obama— and none of them knew it and all of them have been spending all this time negotiating with Congress to try and get tariff authority when they had it from the start, is just too fanciful to believe,\" Katyal asserts. He notes that Congress has created \"an extensive trade architecture\" governing everything from how a president may deal with trade deficits to national security questions. For instance, a different statute  does  allow the president to increase tariffs by 15% when there is a serious trade deficit, but only for 150 days. \"The president has said, 'I can blow past all of those things and do whatever I want,'\" says Katyal.  And that, he maintains, is contrary to the nation's history dating from its founding. \"That is why we had the Boston Tea Party. It is why our Revolutionary War was fought. The idea that you can tax Americans through the monarch's decision alone is as foreign to our Constitution and our traditions as anything I have ever seen.\" IEEPA wasn't aimed at tariffs or taxes at at all, says Katyal's co-counsel Michael McConnell, a conservative former federal judge appointed by George W. Bush, who now is director of the Stanford Constitutional Law Center. \"It's a statute about imposing various forms of sanctions, economic sanctions on countries with whom we are in conflict,\" he says, adding, \"It has nothing to do with imposing taxes on Americans for engaging in perfectly lawful trade with friendly nations.\" One of the issues raised by the challengers is that the administration's argument also fails under the so-called \"major questions doctrine,\" first enunciated by the court's conservatives in 2022. It says that for Congress to delegate a major policy decision to another branch of government, it must be explicit in its text about doing so. But at least one member of the court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has indicated that in his view at least the major questions doctrine does not apply to foreign affairs and national security. The briefs filed by interested groups in Wednesday's case are remarkably lopsided, with 38 briefs supporting the challengers, representing over a thousand organizations and individuals on the right, left, and center of the political spectrum.  Also among those supporting the challengers are a large group of national security experts from previous Republican and Democratic administrations and a similarly diverse set of 44 economists on both the left and right, including four Nobel prize winners. On the other side are six briefs, mainly representing individuals, who did not want to be interviewed for this story. That said, the case is not a slam dunk at all, says conservative scholar Jonathan Adler, of William and Mary Law School. \"In general, the court is very reluctant to second guess presidential determinations that something implicates national security or that there is an exigency,\" he says. Of course, just what are exigent circumstances is often in the eye of the beholder, and the current court often rejected the Biden administration's assertion of exigent circumstances. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1199885811","dateOfPublication":"2025-08-13","timeOfPublication":"14:00:00Z","title":"8 Essential Conversations to Have with Your Aging Parents","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article, written by Marielle Segarra and Margaret Cirino, urges families to have open and proactive conversations with aging parents about financial and medical planning.

• 2:00 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         This story was originally published on Sept. 25, 2023, and has been updated.  Cameron Huddleston was 35 when her mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  Trying to ask her mom about her financial situation and end-of-life plans while she was showing signs of memory loss was a challenge. \"When there's an emergency, it's a lot harder to have a rational conversation,\" she says. \"Your emotions are all over the place.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That's why Huddleston, a financial journalist, wants people to start talking to their parents about these topics early. Ask them about their plans for retirement, how they will pay for health care if they get sick, and what will happen to their property when they die. She  covers these subjects in her 2019 book ,  Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk: How to Have Essential Conversations with Your Parents About Their Finances .  Huddleston explains how to broach this conversation with your parents — and which documents and plans they should have in place.  1. Get a sense of your parents' end-of-life plans Your parents might be hesitant to open up about their finances with you. For a long time,  you  were the child — and  they  were your caregivers. So Huddleston recommends asking them for advice as a way into the conversation. Start with a question like: I just had my first child. Should I set up a will? Or, I just started a new job. Should I be taking advantage of a workplace retirement plan?  \"Their answers are going to give you clues about what sort of planning\" they might have done in their own lives, she says. For example, if they say yes, you should draft up a will, that's a good sign — it's likely they have that document written for themselves.  On the other hand, if they say nope, don't worry about a 401K, that's a red flag. It might make you wonder whether they've prioritized saving for retirement. So you might probe a bit deeper (and get them thinking about the topic) by saying \"maybe this is something we could look into together,\" says Huddleston.  You could also share a cautionary tale about a friend who's had to get involved with their parents' finances, says Huddleston. Maybe your friend's parent passed away without a will in place, and the family had to go to court. When you tell the story, she adds, you might say, \"I hope we can avoid that.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       2. Assess whether they're able to handle their affairs  If your parents are experiencing cognitive decline, there may be big changes in their spending habits, says Huddleston. So be on the lookout for choices that don't make sense to you — for example, lapses in bill payments or sudden, big-ticket purchases.  If that's the case, encourage your parents to get a health checkup, she adds. If a medical condition is compromising their decision-making, you'll need a power of attorney and a living will to make financial and medical decisions on their behalf – which we'll get into next. 3. Make sure they have a will to distribute their assets...  This is the most important item on the list, says Huddleston. A will is a legal document that states how a person wishes to distribute their assets after their death. Keep it somewhere safe. Then when a parent dies, you'll need to submit it to the court, along with a death certificate, in order for their assets to be distributed.   If a parent doesn't have a will, state law will determine who gets what. \"A lot of people don't realize this. They think, 'my family can just work it out,' \" she says. But having to go through the court system to handle a parent's assets is the last thing you'll want to do after a death, says Huddleston.   4. ... and a power of attorney  In the event that your parents become unable to make financial and legal decisions for themselves, they will need a power of attorney. It's a legal document that allows another individual to step in and manage that person's finances during their lifetime. That includes everything from handling their bank accounts and property to doing their taxes or even filing a lawsuit on their behalf. This form is crucial for anyone showing signs of cognitive decline, says Huddleston.  You can find free, state-specific power of attorney forms online. Notarize it and keep the form in a safe place until you need it.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       5. Outline their medical wishes in a living will  Unlike a will, which deals with a person's assets, a living will communicates a person's wishes in terms of medical treatment in the event that they're not able to make those decisions themselves.  For example, if a parent should suffer from severe and irreversible brain damage, would they want any treatments to help prolong their life? If so, for how long? Huddleston says you don't want to be in the difficult situation of having to act on a parent's behalf without knowing what they want. \"You don't want to have to be the one deciding whether to keep them on life support.\" 6. Prepare for long-term care There may come a time when your parents may not be able to perform everyday tasks like bathing, cooking, cleaning or taking their medications. So they may need extra help at home from a caretaker, they may need to go to an adult daycare or live in an assisted living facility.  But this long-term care, as these services are called, can be expensive. The AARP has a  long-term care cost calculator  that you can use to find the costs of a caretaker, adult daycare, nursing home and other types of care in your area. Ten hours of assistance from a home health aide in Lakewood, Calif., for example, costs about $2,666. And assisted living costs about $5,250 a month.  A long-term care insurance policy can help soften that blow, says Huddleston. It works much like home or auto insurance. You pay premiums and make claims if you ever need covered services – like adult daycare or a room in a nursing home.  She recommends that people start investing in them when they're in their 50s or early 60s, as the premiums grow as you get older. \"These are not cheap, but they're a heck of a lot cheaper than the monthly cost of assisted living or bringing [a caretaker] into the home,\" she adds.  If you're unsure what kind of long-term care your parents can afford, consult a financial planner. You might think that financial planners are only for the wealthy, \"but that's not true,\" says Huddleston. \"Your parents can just meet a few times to have someone look over their financial situation, give them a few suggestions and create a plan for them.\"  7. Get access to their passwords  If there's an emergency and you need to log into a parent's bank account or contact their doctors through their medical portal, you don't want to waste time hunting down their usernames and passwords, says Huddleston. So ask your parents to make a list of relevant passwords, store it somewhere safe — like a password manager — and tell you how to access it.  8. Reassure them If you're struggling to get your parents to talk to you about their finances and their plans as they age, reassure them that you're looking out for their best interests. By setting up these documents and coming up with a long-term care plan, \"you can help them in the way that they want to be helped,\" says Huddleston.  Remind them: \"I respect your independence and I want to help you remain independent for as long as possible. But to do that, we need to have some plans.\" This episode of Life Kit was produced by Margaret Cirino and edited by Sylvie Douglis. The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

an enduring debate over healthcare sparked a now record-long shutdown \n         By Sam Gringlas \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The government shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history. The ongoing 36-day closure has sparked disputes over a range of topics — from the separation of powers and the federal workforce, to food assistance and air traffic control. But at the heart of the impasse is a debate about health care, specifically expiring subsidies for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Democrats have gone all-in on their fight to preserve the subsidies, withholding votes 14 times for a Republican-backed short-term spending measure even  as shutdown pain ratchets up  with flight cancellations, delayed SNAP benefits and missed paychecks for federal workers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Though Republicans have insisted they will not negotiate on the subsidies until the government reopens, some members are calling for them to be preserved. The stalemate has underscored the Affordable Care Act debate's lasting imprint on Washington, more than 15 years after it was signed into law. Clashes over health care have continued to animate pivotal moments in American politics, from consequential elections to paper-thin votes in Congress and even a past government shutdown in 2013. Now the debate has stoked a record-long shutdown, just ahead of midterm elections in 2026, when health care could once again shape the results. Why some Obamacare critics want to extend its subsidies For more than a month, Democrats have refused to back a government funding measure without an agreement to extend subsidies for ACA marketplace plans, which expire at the end of the year. That has left Republicans in a tricky position. While the party broadly dislikes the law, some in Congress have begun to acknowledge they may be stuck with it. \"This is a big deal in my district,\" said Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Colo. \"I've heard from a number of people who are facing dramatic increases.\" Hurd says without the subsidies, constituents in his heavily rural district could lose health coverage. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Like most in his party, Hurd says reopening the government has to come first. He is also one of more than a dozen House Republicans who signed onto a letter calling for them to be preserved. And along with a pair of Democrats, Hurd and Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., outlined a bipartisan framework this week to temporarily extend the subsidies. Even the conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has called for keeping them, despite her sharp criticism of Obamacare, saying the cost of health care is a top issue in her deep red district. \"The toothpaste is out of the tube,\" Greene  wrote  on X this month. When the Affordable Care Act passed with zero Republican votes, this kind of acceptance would have been hard to imagine. Fights over the ACA helped fuel a 2013 shutdown. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) held the Senate floor for  more than 21 hours , railing against Obamacare and memorably reading from Dr. Seuss'  Green Eggs and Ham . Former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says backlash against the law helped give birth to the Tea Party and later the Make America Great Again movement. \"There was a lot of trepidation as to what Obamacare was going to mean,\" Cantor said in an interview with NPR. \"Whether you were going to be able to keep your doctor, whether there were going to be 'death panels,' and honestly a concern about the unknown.\" Over the years, Republicans repeatedly tried to repeal and replace Obamacare. \"We still faced opposition from within our own ranks,\" said former Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who chaired a key committee that tried to work on a substitute. \"Here we are today, and there's still no alternative. It's been 15 years. It's not gonna go away.\" Today, Upton says letting the subsidies expire could be disastrous for many Michiganders. Even House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has acknowledged that Obamacare is unlikely to be repealed. Johnson and other Republicans, including President Trump, who talked about \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA during a presidential debate last fall, have struggled to articulate concrete reforms. \"These ideas have been on paper for a long time,\" Johnson said recently. \"There's volumes of this stuff. We've been working on it since day one of this Congress.\" Polls show a majority of Republicans still oppose Obamacare, but the law's popularity has grown, says Ashley Kirzinger, director of survey methodology at the health policy organization KFF.  More than half  of marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts. \"They're more likely to live in rural areas, to own a small business or be farmers,\" she said. An  October survey  of competitive congressional districts by Republican pollster John McLaughlin, who has worked with Trump during each of his campaigns, also found overwhelming support for extending the subsidies. He says the results have been put in front of top advisers at the White House. \"Voters are definitely more likely to vote for somebody who's gonna support a healthcare tax credit that they can use versus those who might oppose it,\" McLaughlin said in an interview. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some Democrats hoped Trump would get involved and cut a deal on subsidies to end the shutdown. But Trump has continued to bash Obamacare and has yet to embrace an extension of the subsidies. And many rank-and-file Republicans remain skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a gastroenterologist. \"Obamacare has become the 'Unaffordable Care Act,\" Cassidy said. \"And the reforms that were supposed to lower costs are now being papered over with more and more subsidies.\" Hurd, the Colorado congressman, agrees the subsidies only address a symptom of the ballooning cost of health care. Still, he says extending them is an imperative for him and many colleagues — and hopes this can also be an opportunity for a bipartisan conversation about health care. \"Whether it's something they're public about or not, if you're genuinely serious about serving your constituents, this ought to be something on your radar screen,\" Hurd said. Why Democrats are all-in on their healthcare push Meanwhile, Democrats are betting enormous political capital as they hold out for a subsidies deal, emboldened by what happened in 2018, when candidates running on health care swept the party back into the House majority. That year, Andy Kim ran for a Republican-held congressional district in New Jersey. The incumbent, Rep. Tom MacArthur, was a key player in efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, authoring an amendment that would have allowed states to waive the ACA ban on denying coverage over pre-existing conditions. \"Everyone was furious,\" Kim recalled. \"He really touched a third rail.\" That year in Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin also challenged a Republican incumbent on health care. \"I think it was the dominant issue,\" Slotkin said. \"My experience with my mom not having insurance when she was diagnosed with Stage 4 ovarian cancer just meant that a lot of people wanted to talk about it and I had a lot to say.\" Kim and Slotkin won their races — part of a blue wave that gave Democrats control of the House. Eight years later, they are in the Senate, where Democrats have refused to back a stopgap spending bill without a deal to extend expiring ACA subsidies. Open enrollment began Nov. 1, when many Americans discovered that their premiums without the subsidies next year will skyrocket. \"That's 500,000 people in my state alone,\" Slotkin said. \"You're talking about people who are going to be doubling their costs and then therefore deciding not to keep health care coverage.\" \"I think what's really telling is that we see not just majorities, but large majorities, of Republicans, independents and Democrats saying that they want Congress to extend the enhanced premium tax credits,\" KFF's Kirzinger said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       KFF has been polling on the ACA for years. The 2010 law is  more popular than ever , a sea change from 15 years ago, when Americans were more evenly divided on the law. \"The best thing that happened to the Affordable Care Act politically was when Republicans started trying to take it away,\" said Meredith Kelly, a top Democratic congressional committee staffer during the 2018 midterms. Leading up to that cycle, Kelly worried that Obamacare was a political liability for Democratic candidates. But then, with Trump in office, Republicans moved to destroy it. \"I think that the 2018 cycle was a massive turning point for the popularity of the ACA,\" Kelly said. \"And I think that's in great part because Democrats worked really hard that cycle to help Americans understand what Republicans were ripping away.\" Democrats think health care will resonate again in the 2026 midterms, despite the onslaught of news that has characterized Trump's second term. Riding the Senate subway, Kim says 2018 was chaotic, too, and still the health care message cut through. \"I think sometimes we don't remember how turbulent and crazy the first term was as well,\" Kim said. Hustling to another vote on the Republican funding bill, Slotkin said she does not know whether health care will play the same driving role it did in 2018. But she says there is reason to believe it will. \"Among all of the major ways people are paying more and the cost of living is going up, I can't think of something that is more personal than health care,\" she said. Will the shutdown reshape the health care debate? Throughout the shutdown, Republicans have slammed the high cost of the subsidies, calling them a relic of the pandemic-era and no longer needed. They also have accused Democrats of holding the government hostage to extract policy concessions, putting federal workers and others in the crosshairs. \"I'm still at a loss as to what exactly they're trying to get out of this,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday. \"While they may believe politically that it's in their best interests, it's certainly not in the best interests of the American people ... Nobody wins. Shutdowns are stupid.\" Kelly, the Democratic strategist, thinks Democrats will win that argument in the long run. \"What I do hope the American people understand before next November is that Democrats are on the side of lowering their costs and protecting their health care, and Republicans are not,\" she said. \"That will be the lasting impact of this shutdown.\" Not all Democrats agree that the shutdown consequences will be worth it. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., has been one of three in her caucus voting with Republicans to reopen the government. \"I don't think we should swap the pain of some Americans for others,\" she told reporters. \"I think we can keep the government open and address the looming crisis of the health care cliff that we are seeing.\" Republicans hoped more Democrats would see it that way as the shutdown dragged on. This week, some have signaled they may now accept just the promise of a vote on the subsidies. For now, the shutdown may soon stretch into a sixth week, with the subsidies still set to expire. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5596488","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Yes, Trump's tariffs are raising billions -- but at a steep economic cost","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Trump's tariffs, implemented in early 2025, are generating significant revenue for the federal government but are causing economic disruption.

dollars for the federal government.  They're also costing consumers, frustrating businesses and hurting the manufacturers they're supposed to help.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The average tax on U.S. imports today is nearly 18%, according to  economists at the Budget Lab at Yale   — up from 2.4% before Trump returned to the White House. The Treasury Department is collecting almost four times as much tariff revenue now as it was a year ago.  The average tariff rate would be closer to 9% were it nor for the \"emergency tariffs\" the Supreme Court is reviewing. Despite the administration's repeated claims that foreign suppliers are paying the tariffs, most of the bill is being paid by U.S. importers.  And ultimately, at least some of the tab will be passed along to American consumers in the form of higher prices.  \"It's a tax,\" says Patrick Allen, a wine importer based in Columbus, Ohio. \"And it get built into the price everybody is paying for goods.\" Inflation is rising  Tariffs have already contributed to higher prices for apparel, furniture and other goods where the U.S. is heavily reliant on imports.  Inflation has been inching up in recent months, although it's still nowhere near the 9% level it reached three years ago, in the wake of the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Annual inflation in September was 3%, compared to 2.3% in April when Trump first announced his worldwide tariffs.  Inflation watchdogs at the Federal Reserve are betting that Trump's tariffs will raise prices once, as they work their way through the supply chain, but will not continue to cause upward price pressure month after month.   'Havoc' for importers Wild swings in tariff rates — from 30% to over 100% — have also created challenges for importers who typically order products months ahead of time. \"The unpredictability of the tariff situation continues to cause havoc and uncertainty,\" said an anonymous computer manufacturer, quoted in a report this week from the  Institute for Supply Management .   But even then, the manufacturer noted it wasn't spurring more domestic production. \"Even with the tariffs, the cost to import in many cases is still more attractive than sourcing within the U.S,\" said the manufacturer. While the tariffs are designed to encourage domestic manufacturing by making imports more expensive, factory employment has dropped by more than 40,000 jobs since April, while the ISM index of manufacturing activity fell in October for the eighth month in a row. \"The products we import are not readily manufactured in the U.S., so attempts to reshore have been unsuccessful,\" said the manager of a machinery factory. \"Overall, prices on all products have gone up, some significantly. We are trying to keep up with the wild fluctuations and pass along what costs we can to our customers.\" Supreme Court challenge  Trump's emergency tariffs have been  challenged by a number of businesses and states  as exceeding the president's authority.  The White House has relied for many of the tariffs on a 1970s statute designed to address economic emergencies.

And the jump in tariff revenue that month was more than offset by a decline in corporate tax payments.   The president's Plan B Even if the Supreme Court does find the president's emergency tariffs are illegal, Trump has other options to impose import taxes, using powers that were explicitly granted by Congress.   \"I think in the end, he could piece together something very close to — if not identical to — what he's done so far,\" says law professor Kathleen Claussen, a tariff expert at Georgetown University.  \"That's not to say we might not have legal challenges in the courts again. But certainly, on the surface, I think the president could move to replicate what he's already done using these other statutes. \" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5596414","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-05:00","title":"FEMA Promised Funds to Tsunami-Proof an Oregon Hospital.

That money is MIA \n         By Katia Riddle \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 6:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Eight years ago, Erik Thorsen — CEO of Columbia Memorial Hospital in Astoria, Ore. — received a warning that no hospital administrator wants to hear: A big earthquake could cause his hospital's building to collapse. His staff and his patients could die in a matter of moments.  \"They basically said, 'None of you are prepared for a major natural disaster from the Cascadia subduction zone,'\" recalls Thorsen.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The  Cascadia subduction zone  is an earthquake-prone region that stretches about 700 miles from California to British Columbia. Thorsen's hospital sits right along it — which is why a team of experts and engineers from the state had come to talk to him and other leaders from coastal hospitals about earthquake risk. Alarmed, Thorsen — who grew up in this area, left for college, and then returned to raise his family here — got to work fundraising and planning in order to fortify his hospital to withstand an earthquake and provide shelter during a tsunami. A critical part of the project's $300 million budget was to come from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Their $14 million grant would help to build a tsunami evacuation zone in the hospital. But in April, the Trump administration canceled the grant program that awarded the funding, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. A  report  from the Urban Institute estimates this  cancellation  jeopardizes over $3 billion nationally in hazard mitigation funds to protect communities from threats like floods, wildfires, tornadoes and hurricanes. When the news reached Astoria, construction plans were already well under way. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"We did go back to the design team and say, 'What would it take to actually take these elements out?'\" says Mark Kujala, a Clatsop County commissioner who worked on fundraising for the project. \"And because it's so integrated into the project, that just wasn't feasible.\" The hospital broke ground in September. The current plan for filling the $14 million hole left by FEMA: There is no plan. \"Unfortunately, FEMA — even prior to the shutdown, had kind of gone silent on us,\" says Thorsen. \"And now with the shutdown … very silent on us.\" No worse place to locate a hospital Columbia Memorial Hospital was constructed in its current location in 1977, when earthquake risk was not as well understood. In addition to being constructed in a zone vulnerable to a major earthquake, the hospital sits in a low-lying plain just blocks from the waterfront, on unstable ground. \"The theory is if the earthquake happened, that ground underneath us would liquefy and the building would potentially collapse,\" says Thorsen. \"If we happen to remain upright and a tsunami comes our way, maybe we get 20 to 30 minutes of notice to evacuate people up the hill.\" That would mean moving vulnerable patients — in some cases, critically ill patients — out of their environment and into another, in the middle of a disaster zone, in a matter of minutes. Other earthquake-prone places like Japan have already built such structures to avoid this scenario by moving to higher ground within their buildings. But Oregon is late to the game, some experts say. \" We're sitting here on — you know the overused phrase — [a] ticking time bomb,\" says Chris Goldfinger, who studies paleoseismology at Oregon State University. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A magnitude 9 earthquake, says Goldfinger, is a realistic possibility in the Cascadia subduction zone. \"Those happen on average just under [once every] 500 years,\" says Goldfinger. \"We're 325 years since the last one.\" At least 25,000 people could die in this scenario, according to  some estimates . There are only three hospitals in Oregon in this region. \"Honestly, with this project, we could be the only hospital that could survive and serve the residents — for about 60,000 people,\" says Thorsen. \"It's a big responsibility.\" Currently the hospital is a sprawling, one-story building, and modeling has predicted that several feet of water could flood the hospital's ground floor during a tsunami. When it is complete, the new hospital will be dramatically taller, growing from one story to four (plus a fifth level for a helipad). The idea behind the vertical evacuation zone is that once the earthquake has stopped and the new building is still standing, people can congregate in the top several floors, built especially to be able to withstand a tsunami. In order to help mitigate that potential disaster, engineers designed a plan to anchor the hospital to bedrock 65 feet deep. \"The building is 97 feet and the helipad sits on the roof,\" says Thorsen, gesturing to the hospital and describing its new design. A 100-foot drill — basically an enormous version of the kind of drill bit one might find in a household toolbox — is already making deep holes to secure the piles. Although the Pacific Northwest is beginning to build these kinds of structures, Goldfinger says, they're hard to finance without federal support. \"The federal government is really the only entity that's large enough to deal with this as a national-level problem,\" he says. \"It's just well beyond anything that the states could do alone.\" \"It is just incredibly frustrating\" Though Thorsen and his staff say they were given some indication that existing BRIC grants would still be distributed, they've yet to see any money. The  BRIC program  was established under the first Trump administration in order to fortify communities against natural disasters. After it was  canceled , a lawsuit challenged the program's termination and a federal judge  issued an injunction . \"It is just incredibly frustrating,\" says Democratic Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, who represents the area. Bonamici says she and her staff have been pleading with anyone who will listen to help access the money. \" I lost count of how many calls I have made, trying to get somebody from FEMA on the phone,\" says Bonamici. FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Plans for a new hospital, says Bonamici, provided her peace of mind about a potential catastrophe in her district. Some predictions forecast a magnitude 9 earthquake here could be the  worst natural disaster  the U.S. has ever seen. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It is going to be a safe place not just for patients or employees in the hospital, but for the community, \" says Bonamici. \"They can't outrun a tsunami. \" In addition to saving lives, she says, the project will save property and money. \"It is really critical that — now that they're underway with construction — this funding comes through.\" Waste, fraud, and abuse hits different at a local level When Trump officials started talking about cutting \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" Willis Van Dusen was enthusiastic. A registered Republican, Van Dusen was mayor of Astoria for more than two decades. Eliminating waste, he says, is what he and fellow Republicans wanted. \"This is what Trump ran on,\" he says. But when Trump's \"waste, fraud and abuse\" campaign came to his town, Van Dusen says he felt differently. \"What is more important than a hospital in a rural community like Astoria?\" he asks. Astoria has a history as a fishing and logging town, but more recently it's given way to big-city retirees and craft breweries. It's a rare, politically moderate area — a place, says Van Dusen, where neighborhoods are socioeconomically mixed and people are typically more concerned with questions of practical issues like trash collection than identity politics. Few issues are more practical than having a trusted hospital nearby, says Van Dusen. When he had a heart attack some years ago, it was doctors at Columbia Memorial who brought him back. \"I had actually died,\" he says, pointing to a framed EKG reading he keeps in his office. Making sure that this hospital can keep providing care during an earthquake and tsunami, he says, is the opposite of waste, fraud and abuse. \"Just to jerk that money away from us,\" he says, \"it makes me livid.\" Van Dusen says he's not the only one in this town who's mad, regardless of political party. \"Every single Republican that I have talked to is livid over what's happening,\" he adds. Hospital CEO Erik Thorsen says they are not giving up — even without the federal money. Construction continues. They've been thinking through other ways to finance it. Thorsen feels a responsibility for protecting this community where he has spent most of his life. \"We have this obligation to make sure that our patients and our residents and citizens are safe,\" he says. Without the federal government, though, the path ahead is unclear. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5558169","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Iowa Doesn't Have Enough OB-GYNs.

Is the state's abortion ban part of the problem? \n         By Natalie Krebs \n        \n           Wednesday, November 5, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Jonna Quinn was initially thrilled when she got her first job after residency, working as an OB-GYN in Mason City, Iowa. It was just an hour down the road from her hometown of West Bend, where she grew up on a farm. But the hospital started restricting certain birth control options and fertility treatments based on  its affiliation  with the Catholic church, she said. At the same time, her unit was becoming  increasingly short-staffed  as other obstetricians left and retired. At one point, Quinn said she was seeing up to 50 patients a day. \"That is twice what a normal OB-GYN will see in a day,\" she said. \"I knew I was going to miss something, because there's no way somebody can function at that level.\" Last spring, Quinn decided to leave -- not just Mason City, but Iowa entirely. At the time, the state supreme court  was on the verge of approving a  law  banning abortion as early as six weeks of pregnancy, with very few exceptions. It was the last straw for Quinn, who  got a job  in Minnesota and moved her family there. Minnesota has  constitutional protections  for abortion. \"I could either stay and ruin myself and my career and my mental health and my relationship with my children, or I could go and continue to practice OB, which had always been my dream,\" she said. A few months after Quinn moved away, Iowa's abortion ban went into effect on July 29, 2024. Iowa's severe shortage of obstetricians After the Supreme Court overturned  Roe v. Wade  in 2022, multiple states, including Iowa,  enacted abortion bans  — despite already facing shortages of OB-GYNs. The laws have put doctors under increasing strain and surveillance,  complicating  the standard medical treatments for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, premature membrane rupture, and other pregnancy problems. Some physicians fear these laws could drive these much-needed doctors from certain states and dissuade other OB-GYNs from moving in and establishing a practice. Iowa has the  lowest number  of OB-GYNs per capita in the country , according to a KFF analysis of 2021-2022  federal data  from the  Health Resources and Services Administration . Studies show that insufficient maternity care is linked to  low birthweight  and increased infant and  maternal mortality . As doctors leave, more stress on those who remain Rural hospitals in Iowa have been struggling to find more OB-GYNs. The  Grinnell Regional Medical Center , a 49-bed hospital in a rural college town, has been trying to recruit an OB-GYN, and a family practice doctor with obstetrical training, for more than a year. The hospital has seen a dramatic jump in deliveries after a neighboring hospital  shuttered  its labor and delivery unit last year. The additional number of deliveries has been stressful for its two existing obstetrical-unit doctors, according to  David-Paul Cavazos , an executive with the center. Back when patient volume was lower, it was easier for doctors to be on call over the weekend, he explained. \"You just kind of had to hang out at home, be by the phone,\" he said. But recently the on-call doctors have been delivering \"five babies on Saturday, six babies on Sunday,\" Cavazos said. \"It becomes more stressful.\" The Iowa legislature  passed a bill  last session that increased Medicaid reimbursement rates for maternity care, so OB-GYNs could be paid more for caring for pregnant patients. The new law also directs federal funding towards a project to set up additional medical residency slots, including OB-GYN residency slots, in Iowa. Medical residents tend to stay and  set up practices  in states where they complete their residency. These things could help, said  Karla Solheim , chair of the Iowa section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But the state's abortion restrictions are still a red flag for some OB/GYNs when deciding whether to practice in Iowa, she said. \"They understandably do not want to put their licenses and their livelihood at risk when it comes to taking care of patients,\" said Solheim. At her previous job in Quad Cities, Solheim performed an abortion on a patient who had life-threatening complications, she said. It spurred many phone calls from hospital administrators They peppered her with questions about her decision, Solheim recalled: \"Did I have enough evidence? Was her blood count low enough that her life was in danger? Should we have waited until her blood pressure got lower?\" Solheim recently stopped delivering babies to focus on gynecology and outpatient care, saying she had become exhausted working in Iowa hospital units that didn't have enough obstetricians. Recent data on residency applications show that state abortion bans may be influencing the next generation of doctors. Fewer medical students  are applying  to OB-GYN residency programs in states that restrict or ban abortion, according to  a data analysis  from the Association of American Medical Colleges. For E., a fourth-year medical student in Iowa, the law is weighing heavily on her decision of where to apply for OB-GYN residency, and ultimately practice. She worries about how Iowa's law will affect her ability to practice evidence-based care. E. is her middle initial – she asked to be identified that way because she's concerned her comments could negatively affect her future career options. \" I'm seriously questioning whether Iowa is a state that I want to practice in, in the long term, and it breaks my heart because I know that there is such a need,\" she said. Research presents a mixed picture   It's still unclear whether abortion bans   are driving doctors out-of-state. One  recent study  in Idaho found that two years after the state enacted its highly-restrictive abortion law, 35 percent of the state's 268 OB-GYNs had stopped practicing obstetrics. But  another study , analyzing federal data two years after the 2022  Dobbs  decision, failed to find significant departures of OB-GYNs from states with abortion bans. \"We were surprised, and we cut the data in every possible way that we could,\" said  Becky Staiger , an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Public Health, and the study's lead author. While numbers don't show a systemic exit, it's possible some of these OB-GYNs could be adapting how they practice so they can stay with their patients, she said. \"We've heard anecdotally, and through qualitative research, that they're really highly committed to those patients,\" Staiger said. She said  the analysis also doesn't capture  how OB-GYNs feel about  working in states with abortion restrictions . \"What we can't observe is anything about the quality of care that the providers are able to provide, about provider satisfaction with job, about provider safety,\" Staiger said. This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership with  Iowa Public Radio   and   KFF Health News . \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Iowa needs more OB-GYNs. Lawmakers are trying to attract more, but critics blame a state abortion ban for the country's lowest OB-GYN rate per capita. Natalie Krebs of Iowa Public Radio has this report. NATALIE KREBS, BYLINE: Dr. Karla Solheim leads the Iowa chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She says practicing got harder after Iowa's abortion ban started in 2024. KARLA SOLHEIM: It just feels like our job is impossible. KREBS: Solheim says a recent pregnant patient developed life-threatening complications, so Solheim ended the pregnancy. She says afterwards she was grilled by hospital administrators to make sure the abortion qualified for an exception under the law. SOLHEIM: Did I have enough evidence? Was her blood count low enough that her life was in danger? Should we have waited until her blood pressure got lower to proceed with terminating the pregnancy? KREBS: Another OB-GYN, Jonna Quinn, ended up leaving Iowa. Quinn grew up here and really wanted to stay, but the problems and stresses kept building at her job. For one thing, she worked at a Catholic hospital that did not allow her to offer all the birth control options or fertility treatments, and the staffing shortages kept getting worse. Quinn says at one point, she was seeing up to 50 patients a day. JONNA QUINN: That is twice what a normal OB-GYN will see in a day. I knew I was going to miss something because there's no way somebody can function at that level. KREBS: But the final straw came when Iowa lawmakers banned most abortions after six weeks. Quinn says she felt like she was working under too many restrictions to provide the best medical care. QUINN: I could either stay and ruin myself and my career and my mental health and my relationship with my children, or I could go and continue to practice OB, which had always been my dream. KREBS: Last year, Quinn took a job in Minnesota, where the state Constitution protects abortion. In Iowa, lawmakers are trying to keep OBs and attract even more. They raised the amount that Medicaid pays doctors for maternity care. They also used $150 million to create more residency training slots across Iowa. Solheim says these things help, but the state's abortion law is an issue for OB-GYNs. SOLHEIM: They understandably do not want to put their licenses and their livelihood at risk when it comes to taking care of patients. KREBS: It's still unclear how state abortion bans affect OBs. A national study of federal data didn't find OB-GYNs are leaving abortion-banned states in significant numbers. Some researchers say the laws are so new, it's too soon to see an effect. But when it comes to medical students - the future doctors - these laws do seem to be having an impact. Applications for medical residencies have dropped in states with abortion bans. That's especially true for OB-GYN residencies. That's according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. E is in her final year of medical school in Iowa, and she wants to be an OB-GYN. E: I really worry about effect that abortion bans will have on my future patients and on my ability to provide evidence-based care for my patients. KREBS: E asked to be identified by her middle initial because she's concerned her comments could negatively affect her future career. E: The idea of leaving Iowa possibly forever breaks my heart, but it is something I'm seriously considering at this point. KREBS: For NPR News, I'm Natalie Krebs in Des Moines.

    Why you should avoid lotions and creams that contain 'fragrance' \n         By Marielle Segarra, Clare Marie Schneider, Malaka Gharib \n        \n           Tuesday, April 8, 2025 • 4:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Do you know what's in the lotions, creams and gels you use on your hair and skin every day? Research  has shown that some of the ingredients found in personal care products may be harmful to your health. Phthalates  and  parabens , which can be found in everything from makeup to shampoo, are known hormone disruptors that have been linked to poor reproductive health. Chemical hair straightening and smoothing treatments often contain  formaldehyde , a known  carcinogen , and can cause lung and eye irritation. And 1,4 dioxane, a contaminant that can  show up in trace amounts  in some cosmetics, has been identified as a potential carcinogen by the Department of Health and Human Services. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's tricky to connect the dots between exposure and outcome with these chemicals ,  says  Emily Barrett , an epidemiologist at the Rutgers School of Public Health. They may not cause \"an obvious outcome you can detect right away, like a rash,\" she says. \"Instead, it might mean 20 years from now, you're at a greater risk of breast cancer or fertility problems.\" Still, over time, these exposures can add up, says Barrett and other scientists who study these chemicals. So consider limiting your use of potentially unsafe personal care products — and swapping them out for healthier alternatives. Researchers and experts share safety tips to make your skin care and beauty regimen leaner and cleaner. 📋 Audit your medicine cabinet, shower shelf and makeup bag.  You may be wondering: if these cosmetic ingredients are so concerning, why hasn't the Food and Drug Administration banned them? The agency can ban or restrict chemicals in cosmetics, but the  banned/restricted list  is a short one, with only 11 ingredients, including chloroform and mercury compounds. But the process of adding chemicals is long and bureaucratic, says Linda Katz, the former director of the office of cosmetics and colors at the FDA who retired from that role in January. The agency's position is that there isn't enough scientific evidence to show these ingredients, as used in cosmetics, are harmful. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That means we as individuals have to look closely at the ingredient list on each of our personal care products and make those decisions for ourselves, Barrett says. Read the ingredients list on your go-to items and look for any chemicals of concern. This will be easier for some chemicals than others. For instance, parabens will generally be listed in the ingredients and contain the word \"paraben.\" Phthalates will likely not be listed — we'll talk more about how to avoid them below. Some chemicals may be present under a different name. The FDA says 1,4 dioxane, for example, may be present in ingredients that contain the prefix, word or syllables \"PEG,\" \"Polyethylene,\" \"Polyethylene glycol,\" \"Polyoxyethylene,\" \"-eth-,\" or \"-oxynol-.\" 💐 Watch out for products with \"fragrance\" in the ingredient list. \"Fragrance\" can include hundreds of different chemicals, and it's hard to say whether those ingredients are safe, says  Melanie Benesh , an attorney and vice president for government affairs at the research and advocacy nonprofit, Environmental Working Group. That's because fragrance is considered a  trade secret  under federal law, which means product manufacturers aren't legally required to disclose what's in it. Phthalates are often used in fragrances, says Barrett, who studies environmental chemicals and their impact on pregnancy and child development. \"They're very good at carrying scent and color in products.\" But they have been linked to  preterm birth in pregnant women  with high levels of the chemical in their bodies. So one way to cut down on your phthalate exposure is to steer clear of products with fragrance, unless they say \"phthalate-free\" on the label, Barrett says. But keep in mind even fragrance-free products can contain phthalates for other reasons, so in general, it's a good idea to look for products labeled \"phthalate-free,\" she says. ✂️ Cut back on how many products you use on a daily basis. You may be using more products in your everyday life than you realize.  A study  published in 2023 found that women use an average of 19 products daily and men use an average of seven. When Barrett, one of the study's authors, counted the number of products she used, it was above average. That made her want to cut back, she says. She started by asking herself, \"Are all these things I need to make me feel my best? What's essential? What are the extras I could scale back? Why am I putting so many products on my body every day?\" Take stock of your beauty, skin care and hygiene regimen. Instead of using a hair gel and mousse, can you use one? Is there a step you can skip in your makeup or skin care routine? Barrett decided to eliminate perfume to minimize her exposure to \"fragrance.\" \"I didn't feel like it was essential to my life. So I cut it out. That was a very easy fix,\" she says. 🔀 Look for alternatives to products you can't live without.  You've done an audit of your personal care products and identified your essentials. But now you have a conundrum. That wonderful leave-in conditioner that you've been using to de-frizz your curls contains chemicals you want to avoid. What do you do? Research similar products  that don't include any ingredients of concern, says Benesh of EWG.   Look for labels that say \"phthalate-free\" and \"paraben-free.\" You may find a safer conditioner or hair oil that works just as well. Be wary of marketing.  Just because a label says \"green\" or \"all natural\" doesn't mean it's safe, Barrett says. If you're not sure, look up the ingredients.  Keep in mind that not all synthetic chemicals are bad,  Barrett says. Some of them work well and aren't known to cause health problems. The Environmental Protection Agency  maintains a list  of chemicals deemed \"verified to be of low concern,\" including  cetyl acetate , used in lip balms and exfoliants, and  polyglycerin-3 , found in lipstick and facial moisturizer. Consider products made with ingredients you can eat,  says  Adana Llanos , an epidemiologist at Columbia University who researches what contributes to and causes cancer. That includes avocado, coconut oil, olive oil, papaya and shea butter.  🐢 Slowly phase in cleaner products.  You don't need to throw out every potentially harmful product you own right away, say our experts. Instead, Barrett recommends making swaps when you run out of a product. \"It's hard for people to give up all the products they love cold turkey,\" Llanos says. \"It's much more sustainable to do it slowly.\" This episode was produced by Clare Marie Schneider.

(AP) — A UPS cargo plane crashed and exploded in a massive fireball Tuesday while taking off from the company’s global aviation hub in Louisville, Kentucky, killing at least seven people and injuring 11, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said the plane crashed about 5:15 p.m. as it was departing for Honolulu from Louisville’s Muhammad Ali International Airport. The plane crashed about 5:15 p.m. as it was departing for Honolulu from UPS Worldport at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. Video showed flames on the plane’s left wing and a trail of smoke. The plane then lifted slightly off the ground before crashing and exploding in a huge fireball. Video also revealed portions of a building’s shredded roof next to the end of the runway. The death toll had risen to at least seven Tuesday night, and four of those killed were not on the plane, officials said. Among the 11 who were hurt, some had “very significant” injuries, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said. “Anybody who has seen the images, the video, knows how violent this crash is,” he said. Beshear said he didn’t know the status of the three crew members aboard the plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 made in 1991. AP AUDIO: At least 3 dead, 11 injured in UPS plane crash in Kentucky and governor says numbers likely to grow At a news conference, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear says several businesses were struck when a UPS cargo plane crashed and exploded Tuesday. UPS’s largest package handling facility is in Louisville and the company announced Tuesday night that it had halted package sorting at the center and didn’t say when it would resume. The hub employs thousands of workers, has 300 daily flights and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.

Eric Richardson stood outside a police training academy where people gathered looking for information about missing loved ones Tuesday night, hoping to find out what had happened to his girlfriend. She had been at a metal recycling business near the explosion and wasn’t answering her phone, he told the AP. Her phone’s live location said she was still there. Bobby Whelan, Richardson’s friend had been in front of her in line, but had left minutes before the explosion. He said he was about a quarter mile down the road when he heard what sounded like a bomb exploding. “We don’t even want to think about anything but the best,” Whelan said. “All our friends were there.” A UPS plane crashed on takeoff from the airport in Louisville, Kentucky, igniting a huge fire on ground, officials said Tuesday. A video taken by Leirim Rodríguez shows several massive balls of flames exploding into the sky in a row, followed by large billowing clouds of black smoke. Tom Brooks Jr., who runs a metal recycling business down the street, said the unbelievable magnitude of the crash “just rocked the whole place.” “This was massive. I mean, it literally looked like a war zone,” he said. Destyn Mitchell said she was working as a host at an Outback restaurant, about a 15-minute drive from the crash, when she heard a loud boom. About 20 people were in the restaurant. “The mood in the restaurant was very shaken up,” Mitchell said. “Everyone is really concerned. People who just sat down to eat got up and left in under 30 minutes and packed up their food because they wanted to hurry up and get home.” Pablo Rojas, an aviation attorney, said that based on the videos it looked like the aircraft was struggling to gain altitude as a fire blazed on its left side around one of its engines. Given the large amount of fuel it was carrying, once the fire started in that area, it would’ve been only a matter of time before there was an explosion or the fire grew rapidly. “Really the plane itself is almost acting like a bomb because of the amount of fuel,” he said. The Louisville airport is only a 10-minute drive from the city’s downtown, which sits on the Ohio River bordering the Indiana state line. There are residential areas, a water park and museums in the area. ___ Golden reported from Seattle.

didn’t depend on donations from wealthy nations and large philanthropies but instead included a major fund that paid countries to keep forests standing. “I don’t want to say the word donation any longer,” Lula told reporters ahead of the United Nations’ climate summit , known as COP30, which begins this week in Belem , a Brazilian city in the edge of the Amazon. “Someone gives us $50 million. It is nice, but that’s nothing,” he said. “We need billions to deal with our problems, problems of people who are (living) there.” In Belem, Lula is expected to launch an initiative named Tropical Forests Forever Fund, aiming to support more than 70 developing countries that commit to preservation.

The exploratory drilling block lies 175 kilometers (108 miles) offshore the northern Brazilian state of Amapa, which borders Suriname. The biodiverse area is home to little-studied mangroves and a coral reef. Activists and experts have said the project risks leaks that could be carried widely by tides and imperil the sensitive environment. Petrobras has long argued it has never caused spills in its drillings. “If I was a fake and lying leader, I would wait for COP to be finished (to give approval),” Lula said. “But if I did that I would be a small man before the importance of this.” A boat moves through Guajara Bay and historic city of Belem, Para state, Brazil, Friday, Oct. 31, 2025.

Zamacona said there were 150 people in a holding cell. Desperate to lie down to sleep, he said he once took the spot of another man who got up to use the toilet. And the water? Zamacona said he tried to drink from a sink but it “tasted like sewer.” Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Judge calls conditions ‘cruel’ A lawsuit filed last week accuses the government of denying proper access to food, water and medical care, and coercing people to sign documents they don’t understand. Without that knowledge, and without private communication with lawyers, they have unknowingly relinquished their rights and faced deportation , the lawsuit alleges. “This is not an issue of not getting a toilet or a Fiji water bottle,” attorney Alexa Van Brunt of the MacArthur Justice Center told the judge. “These are a set of dire conditions that when taken together paint a harrowing picture.” The judge began the hearing by saying the allegations in the lawsuit by MacArthur Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois were “disgusting.” Gettleman’s opinion got sharper as the day went on, saying conditions were “unnecessarily cruel.” “The evidence has been pretty strong that this facility is no longer just a temporary holding facility. It has really become a prison,” the judge said. But people held there, Gettleman noted, “are not convicted felons. These are civil detainees.” Feds say improvements were made Attorney Jana Brady of the Justice Department acknowledged there are no beds at the Broadview building, just outside Chicago, because it was not intended to be a long-term detention site. Authorities have “improved the operations” over the past few months, she said, adding there has been a “learning curve.” “The conditions are not sufficiently serious,” Brady told the judge. The building has been managed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for decades. But amid the Chicago-area crackdown, it has been used to process people for detention or deportation. Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who has led the Chicago immigration operation, said criticism was unfounded. “I think they’re doing a great job out there,” he told The Associated Press during an interview this week. Water bottles as pillows Testifying with the help of a translator, Pablo Moreno Gonzalez, 56, said he was arrested last week while waiting to start work. Like Zamacona, he said he was placed in a cell with 150 other people, with no beds, blankets, toothbrush or toothpaste. “It was just really bad. ... It was just too much,” Moreno Gonzalez, crying, told the judge. Claudia Carolina Pereira Guevara testified from Honduras, separated from two children who remain in the U.S. She said she was held at Broadview for five days in October and recalled using a garbage bag to clear a clogged toilet. “They gave us nothing that had to do with cleaning. Absolutely nothing,” Guevara said. Another witness, Ruben Torres Maldonado , said he slept on the concrete floor and would fill water bottles to use as pillows. The judge said he could make a decision Wednesday on the request for a restraining order. For months advocates have raised concerns about conditions at Broadview, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel. The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, leading to the arrests of numerous protesters. The demonstrations are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using tear gas and other weapons on them. _____ AP reporters Sophia Tareen in Chicago and Ed White in Detroit contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/redistricting-kansas-midterms-trump-7847d53b34245aead8cac5bf8cd6e12f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"00:38:20+00:00","title":"Kansas Republicans End Push to Redraw Congressional Districts Ahead of 2026 Elections","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Kansas, Republican lawmakers attempted to bypass Governor Laura Kelly and convene a special session to redraw congressional districts in an effort to weaken Democrat Sharice Davids' seat ahead of the 2026 midterms.

2025-11-05T00:38:20+00:00\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — The Kansas House’s top Republican on Tuesday dropped efforts to force a redraw of U.S. House districts that would have thrust the state into a widening national battle for partisan advantage in the 2026 elections. The announcement by House Speaker Dan Hawkins ended a weekslong push by GOP lawmakers to circumvent Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and call themselves into a special session on redistricting, which would have convened Friday. A session would have targeted four-term U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, the only Democrat in the state’s four-person House delegation. Republicans still could draw a map designed to oust her after the GOP-supermajority Legislature convenes its next regular annual session in January. Indeed, state Senate President Ty Masterson promised immediately after Hawkins’ announcement that redistricting would be “a top priority” early next year. Kansas Republicans were trying to answer President Donald Trump’s call for states to redraw their maps to give the GOP more winnable seats ahead of the 2026 midterms so the party stands a better chance of keeping its slim House majority.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Some GOP critics opposed a mid-decade redistricting, while others feared that changes could make the three other Republican-held districts more competitive for Democrats. “Planning a Special Session is always going to be an uphill battle with multiple agendas, scheduling conflicts and many unseen factors at play,” Hawkins said in a statement. Davids conceded that the fight over a new Kansas map isn’t over. “We’ve won the first round in this fight against gerrymandering,” she said in a statement. Kansas lawmakers haven’t done a mid-decade congressional redistricting since 1965, following federal court rulings requiring congressional and legislative districts to be as nearly equal in population as possible as a matter of fairness to all voters. Most of Davids’ district is in the Kansas City area, dominated by Johnson County, the state’s most populous county. It is highly likely that Republicans would have to split Johnson County between at least two districts to hurt Davids enough for her to lose in 2026 — and that could alienate voters there. Laurel Burchfield, advocacy director for the Mainstream Coalition, which opposes a mid-decade redistricting, said Kansas residents want GOP lawmakers to focus on economic issues and lowering costs for families. “Changing the maps mid-decade to rig the system in their favor is wrong,” Burchfield said in a statement texted to The Associated Press. GOP lawmakers in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina have heeded the president’s call for new maps, creating seven additional Republican seats among them. California countered with an initiative on Tuesday’s ballot to pick up five Democratic seats there. In Maryland, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore announced Tuesday that he has formed a commission to consider mid-cycle redistricting despite the state Senate president saying last week that his chamber would not move forward with redistricting. Democrats hold seven of eight House seats there. In Kansas, it would have been only the second time in the state’s 164-year history that lawmakers bypassed the governor for a special session. The only previous time was in 2021, when Republicans sought to challenge federal COVID-19 vaccine mandates. GOP leaders circulated this year’s petition for weeks. Hawkins’ statement was titled, “Countdown to January 12th,” the date lawmakers open their next annual session. Hawkins said in his statement that most Republicans “wish to have a conversation about redistricting.” GOP lawmakers would still have time to get a new map into law. The state’s candidate filing deadline isn’t until June 1, and the primary election is Aug. 4. Davids has said she expects to challenge a new congressional map in court. She also is considering a run for the U.S. Senate next year against incumbent Republican Roger Marshall if her district is redrawn. “Every option is on the table, including a statewide race,” Davids said during a recent Zoom news conference. ___ Associated Press journalist Brian Witte contributed reporting from Annapolis, Maryland."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/california-redistricting-prop-50-gavin-newsom-839193bfc2a817086acca7365315f26f","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"05:22:05+00:00","title":"California Voters Approve Redistricting Measure in Response to Republican Gerrymandering","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California voters approved Proposition 50 on November 4, 2025, approving new congressional district boundaries drawn by the Democratic-controlled legislature.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — California voters approved new congressional district boundaries Tuesday, delivering a victory for Democrats in the state-by-state redistricting battle that will help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026 and, with it, the power to thwart or advance President Donald Trump’s agenda. The approval of Proposition 50 gives Democrats a shot at winning as many as five additional seats, just enough to blunt Texas Republicans’ move to redraw their own maps to pick up five GOP seats at Trump’s urging. Texas’ move and California’s response have kicked off a flurry of redistricting efforts around the country, with Republican states appearing to have an edge. Deeply blue California is Democrats’ best opportunity to make up seats. Midterm elections typically punish the party in the White House, and Trump is fighting to maintain his party’s slim House majority. Republicans hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 213. Tuesday’s results mark a political victory for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cast the measure as an essential tool to fight back against Trump and protect American democracy. Speaking to reporters in Sacramento, Newsom cast the California vote as part of a broader national rejection of Trump’s policies that saw Democratic governors elevated in New Jersey and Virginia . But he warned the more consequential battle would come next year. If Democrats win the House majority, they can “end Donald Trump’s presidency as we know it,” Newsom said. “It is all on the line, a bright line, in 2026.” Measure supported by Newsom and Obama California’s Proposition 50 asked voters to suspend House maps drawn by an independent commission and replace them with rejiggered districts adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Those new districts would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. The recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters’ power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. The measure was spearheaded by Newsom, who threw the weight of his political operation behind it in a major test of his mettle ahead of a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Former President Barack Obama urged voters to pass it as well. Gov. Gavin Newsom arrives at a campaign event on Proposition 50 in San Francisco, Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Gov.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,” Obama said in one ad. “You can stop Republicans in their tracks.” Critics said two wrongs don’t make a right. They urged Californians to reject the measure, even if they have misgivings about Trump’s moves elsewhere. Among the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the movie star and former Republican governor who pushed for the creation of the independent commission, which voters approved in 2008 and 2010. It makes no sense to fight Trump by becoming him, Schwarzenegger said in September , arguing that the proposal would “take the power away from the people.” “I don’t want Newsom to have control,” said Rebecca Fleshman, a 63-year-old retired medical assistant from Southern California, who voted against the measure. “I don’t want the state to be blue. I want it to be red.” A lopsided campaign foreshadowed the vote After an early burst of TV advertising, opponents of the plan struggled to raise cash in a state with some of the nation’s most expensive media markets. The campaign followed an unusual trajectory. A handful of Republican congressmen who will see their districts dramatically reshaped – and their jobs endangered — mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. With opponents short on cash, Newsom and his supporters dominated TV screens in the critical closing weeks.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Total spending on broadcast and cable ads topped $100 million, with more than two-thirds of it coming from supporters. Newsom told people to stop donating in the race’s final weeks. The GOP congressmen — Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa — will see right-leaning voters reduced and left-leaning voters boosted in their respective districts in a shift that would make it likely a Democratic candidate would prevail in each race. Issa issued a defiant statement, saying: “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll continue to represent the people of California regardless of their party or where they live.” Calvert said Newsom engineered a “power grab” while housing costs, gas prices and taxes continue to strain family budgets. “I am determined to keep fighting for the families I represent,” he said in an email. AP poll finds voters motivated by political reasons Proposition 50 won a swift and decisive victory, as the AP declared a winner when polls closed statewide. Early returns were strongly in favor of the measure, as were preliminary results from the AP Voter Poll, an expansive survey of more than 4,000 voters in California. Roughly 7 in 10 California voters said party control of Congress was “very important” to them, and those voters overwhelmingly supported the measure, according to the AP Voter Poll. About 8 in 10 California voters who supported the ballot measure said it was necessary to counter the changes made by Republicans in other states, while only about 2 in 10 said they supported it because it was the best way to draw maps, AP Voter Poll found. Trump, who overwhelmingly lost California in his three presidential campaigns, largely stayed out of the fray. A week before the election, he urged voters in a social media post not to vote early or by mail — messaging that conflicted with that of top Republicans in the state who urged people to get their ballots in as soon as possible. In a post Tuesday on his social media platform, the president called the state’s voting process “RIGGED” and warned that it was “under very serious legal and criminal review. STAY TUNED!” Secretary of State Shirley Weber called that “another baseless claim.” The national House map is in flux Congressional district boundaries are typically redrawn every 10 years to reflect population shifts documented in the census. Mid-decade redistricting is unusual, absent a court order finding fault with the maps in place. Beyond Texas, Republicans expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio. Five other GOP-led states are also considering new maps: Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska. On the Democratic side, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Virginia have proposals to redraw maps, but major hurdles remain. A court has ordered new boundaries be drawn in Utah, where all four House districts are represented by Republicans, but it remains to be seen if the state will approve a map that makes any of them winnable for Democrats. Here’s what to know about Election Night 2025: Down the ballot in some states, voters approved Democrat ballot measures, except in deep-red Texas : In Maine, voters rejected changes to voting that would have shortened the early voting period and required photo ID —something Trump called for in a social media post Tuesday night. Voters in the state also approved a red flag law gun control measure . In Colorado, voters opted to raise taxes on higher-earning households to pay for public school student meals . While Maine remains competitive for Republicans, Colorado has shifted left. In Texas, meanwhile, votes approved amendments to the state constitution that require U.S. citizenship to vote there and to affirm that parents are the primary decision-makers for their children. Impact on national politics next year and beyond: The one contest on Tuesday that may do the most to shape national politics going forward is a measure on the ballot in California , where voters will decide whether to approve a new congressional map that could flip as many as five Republican-held U.S. House seats to Democratic control in the 2026 midterm elections. California’s Proposition 50 is a response to Trump’s gerrymandering push to keep the U.S. House under Republican control in the 2026 midterms. How the AP calls races: The AP takes a careful and thorough analysis of the latest available vote tallies and a variety of other election data , with the goal of answering this question: Is there any circumstance in which the trailing candidate can catch up? If the answer is no, then the leading candidate has won. Read more here about how it is done . Siddhartha Deb, 52, has lived in the U.S. since he was 7 years old but he just became a citizen Tuesday. Immediately afterward he registered to vote at San Francisco City Hall and cast his ballot in favor of Newsom’s measure. “I don’t like the way the Republican Party is basically trying to rig elections by gerrymandering,” Deb said. “And this is the only way, to fight fire with fire.” ___ Cooper reported from Phoenix and Nguyen from Sacramento, California.

George W. Bush’s vice president died Monday from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said Tuesday in a statement. In Cheney’s hands, the vice presidency became a nexus of influence and manipulation — no longer the timid office whose occupants had tended their boss’s ambitions, gone to endless banquets and often waited in the wings for their own shot at the prize.

He was the small man operating big levers as if from Oz. Machiavelli with a sardonic grin. “The Darth Vader of the administration,” as Bush described the public’s view. AP AUDIO: Dick Cheney, one of the most powerful and polarizing vice presidents in US history, dies at 84 One of the most powerful and polarizing vice presidents in American history has died.

No one seemed more amused at that perception than Cheney himself. “Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole?” he asked. “It’s a nice way to operate, actually.” The force was with him.

Bush before returning to public life under his son. Cheney was, in effect, the chief operating officer of the younger Bush’s presidency. He had a hand, often a commanding one, in implementing decisions most important to the president and some of surpassing interest to himself — all while living with decades of heart disease and, post-administration, a heart transplant. Cheney consistently defended the extraordinary tools of surveillance, detention and inquisition employed in response to the Sept. 11 attacks. “History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation — a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position he held,” Bush said Tuesday.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Cheney assailed Trump Years after leaving office, Cheney became a target of President Donald Trump, especially after his daughter Liz Cheney became the leading Republican critic and examiner of Trump’s desperate attempts to stay in power after his 2020 election defeat and his actions in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Cheney said in a television ad for his daughter . “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He is a coward.” In a twist the Democrats of his era could never have imagined, Cheney said last year he was voting for their candidate , Kamala Harris, for president against Trump. Trump said nothing about Cheney publicly in the hours after his death was disclosed. The White House lowered flags to half-staff in remembrance of him but without the usual announcement or proclamation praising the deceased. For all his conservatism, Cheney was supportive of his daughter Mary Cheney after she came out as gay, years before gay marriage was broadly supported, then legalized. “Freedom means freedom for everyone,” he said. A survivor of five heart attacks, Cheney long thought he was living on borrowed time and declared in 2013 that he awoke each morning “with a smile on my face, thankful for the gift of another day,” an odd image for a figure who always seemed to be manning the ramparts. Cheney made his vice presidency a network of back channels from which to influence policy on Iraq , terrorism, presidential powers, energy and other conservative cornerstones. Fixed with a seemingly permanent half-smile -- detractors called it a smirk -- Cheney joked about his outsize reputation as a stealthy manipulator. Among those who worked with him and sometimes crossed him, Bush White House adviser Dan Bartlett told a Miller Center oral history series that you always knew where you stood with Cheney. “In Washington and politics you get a lot of people who will stab you in the back,” he said. “Dick Cheney was perfectly comfortable with stabbing you in the chest.” He liked that about him.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More The Iraq War A hard-liner on Iraq who was increasingly isolated as other hawks left government, Cheney was proved wrong on point after point in the Iraq War, without losing the conviction he was essentially right. He alleged links between the 9/11 attacks and prewar Iraq that didn’t exist. He said U.S. troops would be welcomed as liberators; they weren’t. He declared the Iraqi insurgency in its last throes in May 2005, back when 1,661 U.S. service members had been killed, not even half the toll by war’s end. The U.S. intervention unseated the longtime autocratic leader, Saddam Hussein, but opened up a security vacuum that led to years of brutal civil war, the rise of extremist groups including the Islamic State and the expansion of Iranian influence. On a busy street in Baghdad, Ahmad Jabar called former Cheney a “bloodthirsty person.” “They destroyed us,” he said of the Bush administration, “and Dick Cheney specifically destroyed us. How are we supposed to remember him?” For admirers, Cheney kept the faith in a shaky time, resolute even as the nation turned against the war and the leaders waging it. But well into Bush’s second term, Cheney’s clout waned, checked by courts or shifting political realities. Courts ruled against efforts he championed to broaden presidential authority and accord special harsh treatment to terrorism suspects.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Cheney’s relationship with Bush From the beginning, Cheney and Bush struck an odd bargain, unspoken but well understood. Shelving any ambitions he might have had to succeed Bush, Cheney was accorded power comparable in some ways to the presidency itself. That bargain largely held up. As Cheney put it: “I made the decision when I signed on with the president that the only agenda I would have would be his agenda, that I was not going to be like most vice presidents — and that was angling, trying to figure out how I was going to be elected president when his term was over with.” His penchant for secrecy and backstage maneuvering had a price. He came to be seen as a thin-skinned figure orchestrating a bungled response to criticism of the Iraq War. And when he shot a hunting companion in the torso, neck and face with an errant shotgun blast in 2006, he and his coterie were slow to disclose that episode. It was “one of the worst days of my life,” Cheney said. The victim, his friend Harry Whittington , recovered and quickly forgave him. Comedians were relentless about it for months. When Bush began his presidential quest, he sought help from Cheney, a Washington insider who had retreated to the oil business. Cheney led the team to find a vice presidential candidate. Bush decided the best choice was the man picked to help with the choosing. Together, the pair faced a protracted 2000 postelection battle before they could claim victory. Recounts and court challenges left the nation in limbo for weeks. Cheney took charge of the presidential transition before victory was clear and helped give the Republican administration a smooth launch despite the lost time. In office, disputes among departments vying for a bigger piece of Bush’s constrained budget came to his desk and often were settled there. On Capitol Hill, Cheney lobbied for the president’s programs in halls he had walked as a deeply conservative member of Congress and the No. 2 Republican House leader. Jokes abounded about how Cheney was the real No. 1 in town; Bush didn’t seem to mind and cracked a few himself. But such comments became less apt later in Bush’s presidency as he clearly came into his own. On Sept. 11, 2001, with Bush out of town, the president gave Cheney approval to authorize the military to shoot down any hijacked planes still in the sky. By then, two airliners had hit the World Trade Center and a third was bearing down on the capital from nearby Dulles airport in Virginia. A Secret Service agent burst into the West Wing room, grabbed Cheney by the belt and shoulder and led him to a bunker underneath the White House. “He didn’t say, ‘Shall we go?’” Cheney told NBC News years later. “He wasn’t polite about it.” Cheney talked to Bush again from the bunker and told him, “Washington was under attack, as well as New York.” After Bush’s return to the White House that night, Cheney was taken to a secret location to keep the president and vice president separated and try to ensure that at least one of them would survive any further attack. Cheney said his first reaction to hearing of the crash of the fourth hijacked plane, in Pennsylvania, was that the U.S. might have shot it down per his order. It came down after passengers fought the hijackers. The American flag is seen at half-staff, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, at the White House in Washington.

He became a protégé of Rep. Donald Rumsfeld, R-Ill., serving under him in two agencies and in Gerald Ford’s White House before he was elevated to chief of staff, the youngest ever, at age 34. Cheney held the post for 14 months, then returned to Casper, Wyoming, where he had been raised, and ran for the state’s lone congressional seat. In that first race for the House, Cheney suffered a mild heart attack, prompting him to crack he was forming a group called “Cardiacs for Cheney.” He still managed a decisive victory and went on to win five more terms. In 1989, Cheney became defense secretary under the first President Bush and led the Pentagon during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, which drove Iraq’s troops from Kuwait. Between the two Bush administrations, Cheney led Dallas-based Halliburton Corp., a large engineering and construction company for the oil industry. Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, son of a longtime Agriculture Department worker. Senior class president and football co-captain in Casper, he went to Yale on a full scholarship for a year but failed out. He moved back to Wyoming, eventually enrolled at the University of Wyoming and renewed a relationship with high school sweetheart Lynne Anne Vincent, marrying her in 1964. He is survived by his wife and daughters. ___ Associated Press writers Mead Gruver in Cheyenne, Wyoming; Ali Abdul-Hassan in Baghdad, and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"5112-11-20","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early November 2025, political developments across the United States—including Democratic victories in New Jersey and Virginia governorships and a close call in California’s Proposition 50—have raised the possibility of a shift in the congressional balance of power.

lawmaker, who promised to transform city government to restore power to the working class and fight back against a hostile Trump administration. In a victory for the Democratic party’s progressive wing , Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa . Mamdani must now navigate the unending demands of America’s biggest city and deliver on ambitious — skeptics say unrealistic — campaign promises. With his commanding win, the democratic socialist will etch his place in history as the city’s first Muslim mayor , the first of South Asian heritage and the first born in Africa. He will also become New York’s youngest mayor in more than a century when he takes office on Jan. 1. Zohran Mamdani votes on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in New York.

I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this,” Mamdani declared to a roaring crowd at his victory party. He cast his win as a boon for blue-collar workers struggling to get by. “New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change,” he said, vowing to ”wake up each morning with a singular purpose: To make this city better for you than it was the day before.” More than 2 million New Yorkers cast ballots in the contest, the largest turnout in a mayoral race in more than 50 years, according to the city’s Board of Elections. With roughly 90% of the votes counted, Mamdani held an approximately 9 percentage point lead over Cuomo. Mamdani’s unlikely rise gives credence to Democrats who have urged the party to embrace more progressive candidates instead of rallying behind centrists in hopes of winning back swing voters who have abandoned the party. He has already faced scrutiny from national Republicans, including President Donald Trump , who have eagerly cast him as a threat and the face of a more radical Democratic Party that is out of step with mainstream America. Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut federal funding to the city — and even take it over — if Mamdani won. A commanding win At his victory party in Brooklyn, Mamdani supporters cheered and embraced, some tearfully, after The Associated Press called the race. Campaign posters flew through the air, as one person hoisted the official flag of New York City and Bad Bunny played from the speakers. The mood was far more muted at Cuomo’s party at a midtown Manhattan theater. In his concession speech, a defiant Cuomo called his campaign “a caution flag that we are headed down a dangerous, dangerous road” and noted that “almost half of New Yorkers did not vote to support a government agenda that makes promises that we know cannot be met.” Still, he corrected his supporters when they began to boo at the mention of Mamdani’s name. “No, that is not right,” he said, offering to help the incoming mayor in any way. “Tonight was their night.” Mamdani’s grassroots campaign centered on affordability, and his charisma spoiled Cuomo’s attempted political comeback. The former governor, who resigned four years ago following allegations of sexual harassment that he continues to deny, was dogged by his past throughout the race and was criticized for running a negative campaign. Mamdani will also have to deal with Trump, who not only threatened retribution against the city but also suggested he might try to arrest and deport Mamdani if he won. Mamdani was born in Uganda , where he spent his early childhood, but was raised in New York City and became a U.S. citizen in 2018. In his speech, Mamdani addressed Trump head on. “New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” he said, adding that, “If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.” Trump appeared to acknowledge Mamdani’s challenges, posting ”…AND SO IT BEGINS!” on his Truth Social site.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Mamdani, who was criticized throughout the campaign for his thin resume, will now have to begin staffing his incoming administration and planning how to accomplish the ambitious but polarizing agenda that drove him to victory. Among the campaign’s promises are free child care, free city bus service, city-run grocery stores and a new Department of Community Safety that would send mental health care workers to handle certain emergency calls rather than police officers. It is unclear how Mamdani will pay for such initiatives, given Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s steadfast opposition to his calls to raise taxes on wealthy people. His decisions around the leadership of the New York Police Department will also be closely watched. Mamdani was a fierce critic of the department in 2020, calling for “this rogue agency” to be defunded and slamming it as “racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.” He has since apologized for those comments and has said he will ask the current NYPD commissioner to stay on the job. Mamdani’s campaign was driven by his optimistic view of the city and his promises to improve the quality of life for its middle and lower classes. Cuomo, Sliwa and other critics assailed him over his vehement criticism of Israel ’s military actions in Gaza. Mamdani, a longtime advocate of Palestinian rights, has accused Israel of committing genocide and said he would honor an arrest warrant the International Criminal Court issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More Mamdani began his campaign as a relatively obscure state lawmaker, little known even within New York City. Going into the Democratic primary, Cuomo was the presumed favorite, with near-universal name recognition and deep political connections. Cuomo’s chances were buoyed further when incumbent Mayor Eric Adams bowed out of the primary while dealing with the fallout of his now-dismissed federal corruption case . But as the race progressed, Mamdani’s natural charm, catchy social media videos and populist economic platform energized voters in the notoriously expensive city. He also began drawing outside attention as his name recognition grew. Mamdani trounced Cuomo in the primary by about 13 points. The former governor relaunched his campaign as an independent candidate for the general election, vowing to hit the streets with a more energetic approach. However, much of his campaign continued to focus on attacking opponents. In the race’s final stretch, he claimed Mamdani’s election would make Jews feel unsafe. Meanwhile, supporters packed Mamdani’s rallies , and he held whimsical events, including a scavenger hunt and a community soccer tournament. Cuomo also juxtaposed his deep experience in government with Mamdani’s less than five years in the state Legislature. But the former governor also faced his own political baggage, as his opponents dredged up the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation, as well as his decisions during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sliwa, the creator of the Guardian Angels crime patrol group, also had his moments — mostly in the form of funny quips on the debate stage — but had difficulty gaining traction as a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. He conceded the race about a half hour after the polls closed, wishing Mamdani “good luck because if he does well, we do well.” But he also issued a warning: “If you try to implement socialism, if you try to render our police weak and impotent, if you forsake the people’s public safety, we will become the mayor-elect and his supporters’ worst enemies.” ___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Philip Marcelo and Jake Offenhartz contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a major milestone in its space program.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials.

I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reveals that mRNA vaccines used for COVID-19 may significantly improve survival in cancer patients by activating the immune system to recognize and attack tumors.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/death-toll-from-hurricane-melissa-climbs-to-49-with-many-still-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-31","timeOfPublication":"06:15:49+00:00","title":"Death toll from Hurricane Melissa climbs to 49, with many still missing","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, made landfall in Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane, causing widespread destruction, with 49 confirmed deaths and hundreds of thousands without power.

It warned them to avoid downed power lines “at all costs”.\n\nTo the island’s west, parishes, including St James and St Elizabeth, were rocked by torrential floodwaters, powerful winds and landslides.\n\nIn the historic port town of Black River, the hurricane levelled homes, destroyed historic buildings and flooded medical care facilities, destroying the “entire infrastructure”, Holness said in a video update from the town.\n\nTo the north, heavy construction equipment crawled through the mud-soaked streets of St James Parish to clear blockages and push aside felled trees. Video footage showed dazed residents wandering around outside to assess the damage.\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have pledged support."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/jamaica-declares-disaster-after-monstrous-melissa-ravages-island","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"07:27:00Z","title":"Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after killing dozens in Haiti, Jamaica","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hurricane Melissa, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, devastated the Caribbean in October 2025, killing at least 32 people across Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic.

in Haiti and Jamaica, leading to the deaths of at least 32 people.\n\nTwenty of the reported deaths on Wednesday came after a river burst its banks in the southern coastal Haitian town of Petit-Goave, flooding and collapsing dozens of homes.\n\nThe mayor of the town, Jean Bertrand Subreme, said that people were still trapped under the rubble of their homes.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the situation,” Subreme said, as he pleaded for help from the government.\n\nThree other deaths were reported from Melissa in Haiti. Eight people were killed in Jamaica, including a baby killed after a tree fell in the western side of the island, according to State Minister Abka Fitz-Henley. One person was also reported to have been killed in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe storm was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record when it hit Jamaica on Tuesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.\n\nAs it crossed Cuba on Wednesday, it weakened to a Category 2 storm from its previous Category 5 classification. It is projected to move into the Bahamas later on Wednesday, where dozens of people have been evacuated from the south east of the archipelago.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness had declared Jamaica a “disaster area” after Hurricane Melissa barrelled across the island.\n\nThe hurricane ripped off the roofs of homes, inundated Jamaica’s “bread basket”, and felled power lines and trees, leaving most of its 2.8 million people without electricity.\n\n“It’s not going to be an easy road, Jamaica,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. “I know persons … are wondering what their futures are going to be like.”\n\nMelissa took hours to cross over Jamaica, a passage over land that diminished its winds, before it ramped back up as it  continued  towards Cuba.\n\nThe governor of Cuba’s Granma, Yanetsy Terry Gutierrez, said that parts of the province, including in the provincial capital Jiguani, were “under water”.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have also reported collapsed houses, blocked mountain roads, and roofs blown off.\n\nThe Jamaican government had lifted the tropical storm warning by Wednesday, but officials are struggling to assess the damage.\n\n“There’s a total communications blockout on that side,” said Richard Thompson, the acting director general of Jamaica’s Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, referring to the south and southwest of the island.\n\nMcKenzie said that four hospitals had been damaged and one was left without power, forcing the evacuation of 75 patients.\n\nHeavy damage was also reported in Clarendon, in Jamaica’s south, and Saint Elizabeth, in the southwest, where a landslide blocked main roads in the town of Santa Cruz, and winds ripped off part of the roof of a school used as a shelter.\n\n“I never saw anything like this before in all my years living here,” said one resident of the town, Jennifer Small.\n\n“The entire hillside came down last night,” said another, Robert James.\n\nPrime Minister Holness said on Tuesday that his government was mobilising quickly to start relief and recovery efforts by Wednesday morning.\n\nEven before Melissa slammed into Jamaica, seven deaths – three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic – were caused by the hurricane.\n\nA roof was completely torn off a building at a section of the Savanna La Mar Public General Hospital due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa.

So many homes, so many people have been displaced,” she said.\n\n“We did prepare, but there wasn’t much that we could have done.”\n\nTrout Hall Rd,  Clarendon #TrackingMelissa   #HurricaneMelissa   #Jamaica   @CVMTV   pic.twitter.com/bTop93pOvp\n\n— Giovanni R.

It is a daily reality for small island developing states like Jamaica,” he said.\n\nJamaica is responsible for just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming, according to data from the World Resources Institute.\n\nBut like other tropical islands, it is expected to continue to bear the brunt of worsening climate effects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Virginia on October 20, 2025, caused widespread disruptions across global digital services due to a DNS failure triggered by an error in a technical update to DynamoDB’s API.

outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/thousands-evacuated-as-typhoon-kalmaegi-approaches-the-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"14:20:14+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuated as Typhoon Kalmaegi approaches the Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi is approaching the eastern Philippines, prompting the evacuation of over 70,000 people in coastal areas such as Guiuan, Salcedo, and Mercedes.

Category 5 storm, and residents were assessing their losses and the long road to recovery on Friday.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Jamaica remains without power, and nearly half of its water systems are offline.\n\nIn the historic seaside town of Black River, in southwest Jamaica, up to 90 percent of all structures were left without roofs, while the storm also snapped power lines and toppled concrete structures.\n\n“People are hungry,” said Monique Powell as she stood watch over a stash of groceries and household items for herself and a group of residents from Greenfield, one of many hurricane-torn communities on the outskirts of Black River.\n\n“Everything is gone,” said Michelle Barnes as she and her 13-year-old daughter secured their portion of handouts from local food establishments that were giving away their goods, many of which had become water-soaked and damaged.\n\nThe storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded, was made four times more likely because of human-caused climate change, according to a study by Imperial College London.\n\nJamaica’s Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told a briefing that authorities had “quite credible” reports of a potential five additional deaths, but had not yet been able to confirm.\n\n“We’re still at 19 confirmed, but we do expect that will change today,” she said.\n\nIn nearby Haiti, authorities reported at least 31 people killed and 21 others missing, mostly in the country’s southern region. More than 15,800 people also remained in shelters.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Friday, where the civil defence evacuated more than 735,000 people across the eastern part of the island and where dangerous flooding continued in some areas on Friday.\n\nAlthough the full cost of Jamaica’s recovery is not yet known, the Caribbean country has allocated money for disaster response, including through a unique catastrophe bond arrangement with the World Bank.\n\nDixon said the bond, issued in 2024, provides Jamaica with $150m in financial protection for four hurricane seasons.\n\n“This bond, which provides payouts in the event of natural disasters until 2027, has been triggered by Hurricane Melissa,” she said on Friday.\n\nJamaica is  among many countries calling on wealthy nations to  increase climate financing  to help cover  the costs of climate-induced disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaica’s Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Andrew Wheatley said that the country “deeply appreciates the global outpouring of support” in the wake of Melissa, but urged potential donors to be wary of scams and use the official government portal for donations.\n\nCuba was working on Friday to rescue residents still stranded by unprecedented floodwaters in the wake of Melissa.\n\nThe Cauto River overflowed its banks shortly after the Hurricane slammed into Cuba as a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, bringing upwards of 380mm (15 inches) of rain to some areas of the eastern end of the island.\n\nEmergency workers on Friday waded waist-deep in wetsuits and used boats and military vehicles to rescue residents from the still-rising waters of the country’s longest river.\n\nRio Cauto resident Eduardo Verdecia, 83, said he and his family had expected the river to subside, but continuing rains, plus run-off from nearby mountains and a fast-rising reservoir, had surprised them.\n\n“When night fell, we thought it would go down. But look at it now – and it’s still raining,” Verdecia said, indicating brown water that had inundated his house to near roof level."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have observed the most energetic flare ever recorded from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump announced the restart of US nuclear weapons testing in response to China’s growing arsenal, sparking controversy.

nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/avalanche-hits-nepals-mount-yalung-ri-killing-seven-climbers","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"02:55:07+00:00","title":"Avalanche hits Nepal’s Mount Yalung Ri, killing seven climbers","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An avalanche on Mount Yalung Ri in Nepal’s Rolwaling Valley killed seven climbers, including five foreigners: three French, one Canadian, one Italian, and two Nepalis.

hits Nepal’s Mount Yalung Ri, killing seven climbers\n\nAt least seven people, including five foreigners, have been killed in eastern Nepal after an avalanche swept through a camp on Mount Yalung Ri, according to media reports.\n\nThe Kathmandu Post, citing local officials, reported on Tuesday that the avalanche hit the team of 15 people as they were ascending the 5,630-metre (18,471-foot) mountain of Yalung Ri, and that four members of the expedition remain remaining.\n\n“The avalanche buried everyone on the slope,” Deputy Superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato told the Kathmandu Post. “We got the information late, and the difficult weather delayed immediate response.”\n\nMahato said that three French climbers, one Canadian, one Italian and two Nepalis were killed in the incident.\n\nFour Nepali climbers who were injured have been evacuated, while four others, also from Nepal, remain missing, the Kathmandu Post reported.\n\nOne of the injured climbers told the newspaper that the climbers had called for help but got no response for hours.\n\n“We shouted and cried for help, but no one could reach us,” the unnamed climber said. “We were told that a helicopter would come after four hours, but by then, several of our friends were gone.”\n\nYalung Ri is located in the Rolwaling Valley of northeastern Nepal, and climbers there encounter a mix of rock, ice and snow.\n\nBefore Monday’s tragedy, the valley had experienced continuous snow and poor weather conditions for several days, according to the Kathmandu Post.\n\nMahato, the police officer, said helicopters could not be flown in the area due to heavy snowfall and clouds but an aircraft finally reached the area on Monday evening.\n\nHe added that rescue teams on foot have also been dispatched to the area, and that the search operation would resume on Tuesday morning.\n\nNepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest peaks, including  Mount Everest , and welcomes hundreds of climbers and trekkers every year.\n\nAutumn expeditions on the Himalayan mountains in October and November are less popular because of the shorter, colder days, snowy terrain and a narrow summit window compared with the busy spring season, which runs from April to May.\n\nLast week,  Cyclone Montha  triggered heavy rain and snowfall across Nepal, leaving trekkers and tourists stranded on popular Himalayan trekking routes.\n\nSeparately, two Italian climbers have also gone missing while scaling a remote peak in western Nepal, tourism officials said on Monday."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/attack-on-key-city-in-sudans-kordofan-region-kills-40-un","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"10:38:08+00:00","title":"Attack

Israel’s more than  two-year genocidal war  has left deep wounds, both physical and psychological, ones that will remain long after it comes to an end.\n\nTens of thousands have lost parents and siblings while many others have suffered life-changing injuries. Some are also experiencing trauma from witnessing the deaths of other children. They have been displaced numerous times, lost their homes and had their educations stamped out.\n\nWith few resources available to help them process their pain, young people are finding creative outlets for their grief.\n\nYara Youssef Abu Kweik, aged 16, is pouring her emotions into her art.\n\n“I used to draw ordinary, spontaneous, colourful things,” Youssef Abu Kweik told Al Jazeera.\n\n“As the war came on, I started to feel that I needed to show the world how we [Palestinians in Gaza] are living.”\n\nYoussef Abu Kweik told Al Jazeera that she uses her drawings and paintings to show what she has been witnessing and experiencing in her daily life over the past two years.\n\n“I drew a picture of children struggling to grab handfuls of water. The famine we have endured for years, life in tents, all these sufferings have had a toll on my soul.”\n\nWhile drawing allows Youssef Abu Kweik an outlet to “vent” her feelings, the scenes she draws also cause her to “get flashbacks”.\n\nPsychologists warned that more than 80 percent of Gaza’s children now display symptoms of severe trauma, including headaches, stomachaches, bone pain, hair loss, vitiligo and weakened immunity.\n\n“The second time I was displaced, I started painting the things that have changed all of us. As it was the second time I was forced out of my home, I started to put it into drawing. The pain and suffering, especially the people who have no shelter to go to, not even tents. I drew a picture of children alongside their parents sleeping on the road, exposed to fire, shells and, above all, to the elements,” she said.\n\nEven before Israel’s war on Gaza began, children in Gaza suffered from significant mental health issues.\n\nAccording to a 2022  report  by Save the Children, four out of five children in Gaza were living with depression, grief and fear while  more than half  struggled with suicidal thoughts.\n\nUNICEF estimated that more than 64,000 children have been killed or injured in Gaza since Israel’s war began after the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel.  Israel’s war on Gaza  has killed at least 68,858 people and wounded 170,664.\n\nA United States-brokered ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas that  came into effect on October 10  has provided little respite to children and adults alike in Gaza due to repeated Israeli strikes and severe restrictions on the flow of food, medical supplies and other aid.\n\nAccording to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, more than 200 people have been killed and more than 500 injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire took effect.\n\nDespite her suffering and that of those around her, Youssef Abu Kweik is determined to improve her painting skills and “send my message out to the world”.\n\nThat message is clear and succinct: “I represent all the Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip, and on their behalf, I say: Enough is enough.

California’s Proposition 50 on redistricting to pass in blow to Trump\n\nCalifornia has passed a ballot measure that will redraw the boundaries of electoral districts to favour the Democrats in next year’s critical midterm elections in a counterattack against United States President  Donald Trump ’s gerrymandering in Republican states.\n\nEarly results from Tuesday’s vote showed voters approved  Proposition 50  by a margin of two-to-one in what was seen as a big victory for Democratic Governor  Gavin Newsom , boosting his party’s chances of winning control of the US Congress in next year’s poll and hence thwarting Trump’s agenda.\n\nThe approval of the measure means Democrats might win as many as five additional seats in the House, offsetting the five that Texas Republicans are looking to pick up after Trump urged them to redraw their own maps. Republicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio.\n\nTrump responded to Newsom’s fightback with fury. “The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,” he wrote on his social media site Truth Social on Tuesday.\n\nNewsom, who is staking his claim to leadership of the Democratic Party ahead of the 2028 presidential election on his willingness to stand up to Trump, hit back, describing the Republican’s response as the “ramblings of an old man that knows he’s about to LOSE”. Taking to X after the victory, he said voters had sent a “powerful message” to Trump.\n\nTonight, California sent a powerful message to Donald Trump. We will fight for our democracy.

Normally, they are drawn by an independent commission following the national census taken every 10 years, so the electoral map reflects the people who live there. In reality, most boundaries are rejigged by the parties in power.\n\nThe recast districts aim to dilute Republican voters’ power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nNewsom had sought to nationalise the campaign, depicting the proposal as a means of countering Trump’s efforts to erode democracy. A televised campaign had imagined an irate Trump watching the results on a TV as he threw French fries at the television.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama threw his weight behind the move. “Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,” he said in one advertisement. “You can stop Republicans in their tracks.”\n\nCritics said two wrongs do not make a right. They urged Californians to reject what they call a Democratic power grab, even if they have misgivings about Trump’s moves in Republican-led states.\n\nAmong the most prominent critics was Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor who had overseen the creation of the independent commission, approved in 2008 and 2010.\n\nSchwarzenegger had argued that the proposal would “take the power away from the people”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia is implementing a social media ban for children under 16, expanding the list of restricted platforms to include Reddit and Kick alongside Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/eu-waters-down-climate-target-in-last-ditch-deal-ahead-of-cop30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:23:03+00:00","title":"EU waters down climate target in last-ditch deal before COP30 in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The European Union has compromised on its climate target, agreeing to allow up to 10% of its 90% emissions reduction goal by 2040 to be offset through foreign carbon credits, while delaying the launch of its carbon market to 2028 and committing to biannual reassessments of its 2040 target.

They also agreed to weaken other politically sensitive climate policies, delaying the launch of an upcoming EU carbon market from 2027 to 2028.\n\nA handful of countries including Poland, Slovakia and Hungary opposed the 2040 climate target on the grounds it would hit industrial competitiveness, but they could not block the deal, which needed backing from only 15 of the EU’s 27 member states.\n\nThe UN had asked all governments worldwide to submit 2035 climate plans before the COP30 climate summit opens on Monday in Brazil.

No ID is required. Other mayoral candidates appear twice. (Andrew) Cuomo’s name is last in bottom right,” wrote Musk, who supported  Cuomo  over Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. Other X users made similar points in other posts.\n\nNew York does not require voters to present IDs at their polling place on election day, beyond first-time voters who were unable to present their IDs at the time they registered. For all other voters, poll workers confirm identity by matching their signature to official records. People are required to present ID when they register to vote.\n\nAs for Cuomo’s ballot placement, the former New York governor lost the Democratic primary and created his own independent party to allow him to run in the general election. According to election rules, that meant the placement for Cuomo and his new party was further down the ballot than longer-established parties.\n\nWhat about candidates appearing twice? There is nothing fishy about that: It is part of New York’s long tradition of fusion voting, in which multiple parties can nominate the same candidate.\n\nHaving a candidate appear on the ballot twice is “not a scam at all”, said Jerry H Goldfeder, senior counsel at the law firm Cozen O’Connor. “New York has had fusion voting for many, many years.”\n\nIf a candidate receives more than one party nomination, voters must choose not only the candidate they prefer but also the party they want those votes to count for.\n\nIn the 2025 mayoral election, Mamdani and one of his opponents, Sliwa, secured nominations from two parties, so they are listed twice on the ballot.\n\nMamdani won nominations from the Democratic Party and the left-wing Working Families Party. On election day, Mamdani said he voted for himself on the Working Families Party line.\n\nSliwa won the nomination of the Republican Party and a party he created, called the Protect Animals Party. Sliwa has attracted notice for having 16 cats in his 320-square-foot studio apartment, and he has made animal welfare a key campaign issue.\n\nAny votes for a candidate, regardless of the party line the vote is cast under, count towards that candidate’s total. “Although candidates may appear on more than one party’s line, voters can only vote for them once,” said Julia Sass Rubin, a Rutgers University public policy professor.\n\nSo why would voters support a prominent candidate on a minor-party line?\n\nThey might want to send a message about the importance of that party’s positions. They also might want to ensure that the smaller party continues to win enough votes to secure a ballot spot in future elections.\n\nBy allowing cross-party alliances, a fusion system allows smaller parties to be more than just a “wasted vote” or a self-defeating “spoiler”, said Dan Cantor, who cofounded the Working Families Party and now heads the Center for Ballot Freedom, which supports fusion voting.\n\n“It allows voters the ability to vote their values and send a message to the candidate that he or she should be attentive to the minor party’s concerns,” Cantor said.\n\nFusion voting dates to the 19th century, but only New York and Connecticut allow the practice today.\n\nHistorically, cross-nominations were used to elevate issues, including the abolition of slavery and enhanced political representation into the mainstream, wrote three legal experts for the American Bar Association in 2024.\n\nIn the close 1960 presidential election, New York’s 45 electoral votes were crucial. While Richard Nixon received more Republican votes than John F Kennedy received Democratic votes, “Kennedy’s 6 percent support on the Liberal Party line delivered him the state and the White House,” the authors wrote. Franklin D Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan also won New York by fusing with minor parties.\n\nTabatha Abu El-Haj, one of the authors of the American Bar Association paper, said there is an irony in Musk’s criticism. “Back when Elon Musk threw out the notion of forming a third-party, many commentators noted the only way that party could actually influence the direction of the Republican Party would be if it operated as a fusion party.”\n\nMusk wrote, “The New York City ballot form is a scam” because “mayoral candidates appear twice”.\n\nMamdani and Sliwa are on the mayoral ballot twice because two separate parties made them their nominees. This is how fusion voting works, and how it has operated in New York since the 19th century.\n\nWe rate the statement  False .\n\nJill Terreri Ramos contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched a national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025 to immunize 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, using a single-dose Chinese vaccine called Cecolin.

2025-10-23T08:09:33+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/5/live-israeli-air-attacks-shelling-demolition-campaign-hit-southern-gaza?update=4086535","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:30:01+00:00","title":"Israeli air attacks, shelling and demolition campaign hit southern Gaza","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a ceasefire agreement, Israel continues its military campaign in southern Gaza, including air attacks, artillery shelling, and demolition.

Qatar  – United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that any stabilisation force in Gaza must have “full international legitimacy” to support Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera Arabic on Tuesday at the Second World Summit for Social Development, Guterres said the truce achieved in the besieged and bombarded coastal enclave after “horrific suffering and famine” remained delicate and needs international guarantees.\n\n“It is important the force that is created have full international legitimacy to deal with the parties and the population of Gaza.”\n\nThe proposed international force for Gaza was part of United States President Donald Trump’s  20-point Gaza peace plan .\n\nBut which nations comprise that force remains contentious. Israel, with US backing, has already said it will not accept Turkiye, a key Gaza ceasefire mediator, having any role on the ground. Turkiye, which has repeatedly condemned Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza, held a top-level meeting this week  demanding Israel stop violating the truce  and allow crucial humanitarian aid to enter the embattled Palestinian enclave.\n\nDespite criticism, Guterres said a mandate from the UN Security Council (UNSC) remains “the source of legitimacy” for any stabilisation force, warning that without it, the risk of renewed conflict remains high.\n\nThe UN chief also praised the US for bringing Israel to accept the current ceasefire.\n\n“The government of Israel had other intentions … which were to conduct the war up to the end, but the Americans, at a certain moment, understood that enough was enough,” he noted.\n\nNevertheless, he warned that the ceasefire remained delicate.\n\n“It was essential to stop the war and release hostages … but this is all very fragile,” he said.\n\nAccording to Gaza officials, Israel has violated the deal upwards of 80 times, killing hundreds of Palestinians in the last four weeks.\n\nMoreover, Guterres warned that aid entering the Gaza Strip remains far below what is needed.\n\n“Humanitarian aid has improved … but we are far from what is necessary to eliminate famine quickly, and to create the conditions for the people in Gaza to have the very, very minimum that is necessary for dignity in life,” he warned.\n\nOn the brutal civil war in Sudan, Guterres described the situation as “absolutely intolerable” in the wake of the fall of  el-Fasher city  to the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\n“We are seeing that after el-Fasher being taken by the RSF, all kinds of horrible violations of the most basic rights – sexual violence, people being killed, being denied humanitarian aid,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nEl-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, was taken by the RSF on October 26, following the withdrawal of the Sudanese army. The two sides have been  battling for control of Sudan  since April 2023 in what the UN has called the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.\n\nGuterres said while the UN was working with other organisations, including the African Union, to bring the warring sides to the dialogue table,  it “will be extremely difficult to obtain” following what happened in el-Fasher.\n\nHe said the Sudanese army and the RSF must face “enormous pressure” from the international community, while stressing that foreign actors must also stop fuelling the conflict.\n\n“Many weapons are coming from the outside. And it is absolutely essential also that all these forms of foreign intervention in Sudan end, because this needs to be solved by the Sudanese,” he said.\n\nGuterres also told Al Jazeera that the council no longer “corresponds” to today’s world.\n\n“It corresponds to the world of 1945 with some small adjustments,” the UN chief said.\n\n“Europe has three members as permanent members … Africa has no members. Latin America has no members. Asia has one member. It’s clear it no longer corresponds to the world of today.”\n\nHe called for reforms to make the UNSC more representative and effective, including two permanent African seats and limits on the use of vetoes in cases of mass atrocities.\n\nThe US has vetoed a litany of resolutions condemning Israeli actions in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and beyond, giving its ally unconditional diplomatic cover.\n\n“There were two interesting proposals from France and the UK limiting the exercise of the right of veto in situations of extreme violation of all rights … and this I think would be a very interesting reform to consider,” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/5/live-israeli-air-attacks-shelling-demolition-campaign-hit-southern-gaza","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:30:01+00:00","title":"Israeli air attacks, shelling and demolition campaign hit southern Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Despite a ceasefire agreement, Israel is continuing military attacks—including air raids, artillery shelling, and demolition campaigns—in southern Gaza, while simultaneously restricting the entry of critical humanitarian aid.

2,350 times in West Bank last month: Report\n\nIsraeli forces and settlers have carried out 2,350 attacks across the occupied West Bank last month in an “ongoing cycle of terror”, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission (CRRC).\n\nCRRC head Mu’ayyad Sha’ban said on Wednesday that Israeli forces carried out 1,584 attacks – including direct physical attacks, the demolition of homes and the uprooting of olive trees – with most of the violence focused on the governorates of Ramallah (542), Nablus (412) and Hebron (401).\n\nThe research, compiled in a CRRC monthly report titled Occupation Violations and Colonial Expansion Measures, also noted 766 attacks by settlers. The commission said they are expanding settlements, which are illegal under international law, as part of what it called an “organised strategy that aims to displace the land’s indigenous people and enforce a fully racist colonial regime”.\n\nThe report said settler attacks reached a new peak with most targeting the Ramallah governorate (195), Nablus (179) and Hebron (126). Olive pickers received the brunt of attacks, according to the report, which said they were the victims of “state terror” that had been “orchestrated in the dark backrooms of the occupation government”.\n\nIt described instances of Israeli “vandalism and theft” carried out in cahoots with Israeli soldiers that have seen the “uprooting, destruction and poisoning” of 1,200 olive trees in Hebron, Ramallah, Tubas, Qalqilya, Nablus and Bethlehem. During the violence, settlers have tried to establish seven new outposts on Palestinian land since October in the governorates of Hebron and Nablus.\n\nFor decades, the Israeli military has uprooted olive trees, an  important Palestinian cultural symbol , across the West Bank as part of efforts by successive Israeli governments to seize Palestinian land and forcibly displace residents.\n\nThe spike in Israeli violence comes amid expectations that Israel’s Higher Planning Council (HPC), part of the Israeli army’s Civil Administration overseeing the occupied West Bank, will meet to discuss the construction of 1,985 new settlement units in the West Bank on Wednesday.\n\nThe left-wing Israeli movement Peace Now said 1,288 of the units would be rolled out in two isolated settlements in the northern West Bank, namely Avnei Hefetz and Einav Plan.\n\nIt said the HPC had been holding weekly meetings since November last year to advance housing projects in the settlements, thus normalising and accelerating construction on land taken from Palestinians.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, the HPC has pushed forward a record 28,195 housing units, Peace Now said.\n\nIn August, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich drew international condemnation after saying plans to build thousands of homes as part of the proposed E1 settlement scheme in the West Bank “buries the idea of a Palestinian state”.\n\nThe E1 project, shelved for years amid opposition from the United States and European allies, would connect occupied East Jerusalem with the existing illegal Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim.\n\nThe Israeli far right’s push to annex the West Bank would essentially end the possibility of implementing a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict as outlined in numerous United Nations resolutions.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump’s administration has been adamant that it won’t allow Israel to annex the occupied territory.  US Vice President JD Vance,  while visiting Israel recently , said Trump would oppose Israeli annexation of the West Bank and it would not happen. Vance said as he left Israel, “If it was a political stunt, it is a very stupid one, and I personally take some insult to it.”\n\nBut the US has done nothing to rein in Israel’s assaults and crackdowns on Palestinians in the West Bank as it trumpets its Gaza ceasefire efforts."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/nothing-revolutionary-about-russias-nuclear-powered-missile-experts","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:35:12+00:00","title":"'Nothing revolutionary' about Russia’s nuclear-powered missile: Experts","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines Russia’s claims about the Burevestnik, a nuclear-powered cruise missile named after a seabird, asserting it can reach any point on Earth and evade missile defenses.

scared of Moscow’s new, nuclear-powered cruise missile because it can reach anywhere on Earth, bypassing the most sophisticated air and missile defence systems, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has claimed.\n\n“They’re afraid of what we’ll show to them next,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the RIA Novosti news agency on Sunday.\n\nDays earlier, she said Moscow was “forced” to develop and test the cruise missile, which is named the Burevestnik, meaning storm petrel – a type of seabird, in response to NATO’s hostility towards Russia.\n\n“The development can be characterised as forced and takes place to maintain strategic balance,” she was quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as saying.  Russia  “has to respond to NATO’s increasingly destabilising actions in the field of missile defence”.\n\nWith much pomp, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday handed state awards to Burevestnik’s developers.\n\nAlso awarded were the designers of Poseidon, an underwater nuclear-powered torpedo which Putin has also claimed has been successfully tested.\n\nRussia says Poseidon can carry nuclear weapons that cause radioactive tsunamis, wiping out huge coastal areas. The “super torpedo” can move at the speed of 200km/h (120mph) and zigzag its way to avoid interception, it says.\n\n“In terms of flight range, the Burevestnik … has surpassed all known missile systems in the world,” Putin said in his speech at the Kremlin. “Same as any other nuclear power, Russia is developing its nuclear potential, its strategic potential … What we are talking about now is the work announced a long time ago.”\n\nBut military and nuclear experts are sceptical about the efficiency and lethality of the new weapons.\n\nIt is not unusual for Russia to flaunt its arsenal as its onslaught in Ukraine continues. Analysts say rather than scaring its critics, Moscow’s announcements are merely a scare tactic to dissuade Western powers from supporting Kyiv.\n\n“There’s nothing revolutionary about,” the Burevestnik, said Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project at the the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research.\n\n“It can fly long and far, and there’s some novelty about it, but there’s nothing to back [Putin’s claim] that it can absolutely change everything,” Podvig told Al Jazeera. “One can’t say that it is invincible and can triumph over everything.”\n\nThe Burevestnik’s test is part of Moscow’s media stratagem of intimidating the West when the real situation on the  front lines in Ukraine  is desperate, according to a former Russian diplomat.\n\nThe missile is “not a technical breakthrough but a product of propaganda and desperation”, Boris Bondarev, who quit his Russian Foreign Ministry job to protest against the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, wrote in an opinion piece published by the Moscow Times.\n\n“It symbolises not strength but weakness – the Kremlin’s lack of any tools of political influence other than threats.”\n\nThe problem is that officials have so far unveiled very little about the Burevestnik, which NATO has dubbed the SSC-X-9 Skyfall – a missile that has a nuclear reactor allegedly capable of keeping it in the air indefinitely.\n\nOn October 26, when fatigues-clad Putin announced Burevestnik’s successful test, he was accompanied by his top general Valery Gerasimov.\n\n“This is a unique item; no one else in the world has it,” said Putin, in televised remarks.\n\nGerasimov said the Burevestnik had flown 14,000km (8,700 miles) in 15 hours during a recent test. It can manoeuvre and loiter midair, and unleash its nuclear load with “guaranteed precision” and at “any distance”.\n\n“There’s a lot of work ahead” before the missile is mass-produced, Putin concluded, adding the test’s “key objectives have been achieved”.\n\nA Ukrainian military expert ridiculed the Kremlin’s claims.\n\n“Much of the news report is fake, the (Burevestnik) missile is subsonic, it can be detected and destroyed by missile defence systems,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces who specialised in air and missile defence, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAs for the Poseidon nuclear drone, it is too destructive – and can be used only as a second-strike, retaliatory weapon after the start of a nuclear war, experts warned. As with the Burevestnik, the lack of detailed information about Poseidon casts doubt upon the Kremlin’s claims.\n\nThe announcements followed Washington’s  scrapping  of United States President Donald Trump’s summit with Putin in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nTrump has called the Burevestnik’s test “inappropriate” and ordered the Pentagon to  resume  the testing of nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\nBut ahead of next year’s midterm elections, he may seek to show how he forced the Kremlin to stop hostilities in Ukraine.\n\n“Trump will have to play with pressure on Russia,” Romanenko said. “Hopefully, the circumstances will force Trump to act.”\n\nWhat Putin has not mentioned is that only two of the Burevestnik’s dozen tests, starting in 2019, have been successful.\n\nIts 2019 launch near the White Sea in northwestern Russia killed at least five nuclear experts after a radioactive explosion, Western experts said at the time. Russia’s state nuclear agency acknowledged the deaths, but officials and media reports do not provide video footage, detailed photos or other specifics of the Burevestnik and its testing route – making Putin’s latest claims hard to corroborate or disprove.\n\nWestern experts were able to identify the Burevestnik’s probable deployment site in September. Known as Vologda-20 or Chebsara, it is believed to be 475km (295 miles) north of Moscow and has nine launch pads under construction, the Reuters news agency reported last year.\n\nThe missile’s capabilities have divided military analysts.\n\n“In operation, the Burevestnik would carry a nuclear warhead (or warheads), circle the globe at low altitude, avoid missile defences, and dodge terrain; and drop the warhead(s) at a difficult-to-predict location (or locations),” the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a US nonprofit security group said in a 2019 report after the missile’s first somewhat successful test.\n\nA year later, the US Air Force’s National Air and Space Intelligence Center said, if brought into service, Burevestnik would give Moscow a “unique weapon with intercontinental-range capability”.\n\nOthers doubt the missile’s functionality.\n\n“Burevestnik is a mystification for the whole seven-and-a-half years since it was first announced,” Pavel Luzin, a visiting scholar at Tufts University in Massachusetts, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s impossible to create a reactor that is compact and powerful enough to ensure a cruise missile’s movement,” Luzin said. “This is a basic physics textbook.”\n\nMoscow claims that Burevestnik utilises nuclear propulsion instead of turbojet or turbofan engines used in cruise or ballistic missiles.\n\nBut Luzin said the smallest nuclear reactors used to power satellites weighed 1 metric tonne, supplying several kilowatts of energy – roughly equal to what a regular household consumes – while emitting some 150kw of thermal energy.\n\nThe experimental nuclear reactors developed in the 1950s and the 60s for aircraft weighed many tonnes and were the size of a railway carriage, he said.\n\nAn average engine for a cruise missile weighs up to 80kg, generates 4kw for onboard electric and electronic devices, and about 1 megawatt of energy for propelling the missile, he said.\n\nOther analysts think that Burevestnik’s nuclear engine can function, but do not consider the weapon groundbreaking."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/5/live-israeli-air-attacks-shelling-demolition-campaign-hit-southern-gaza?update=4086567","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:30:01+00:00","title":"Israeli air attacks, shelling and demolition campaign hit southern Gaza","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In southern Gaza, Israel continues its air attacks, shelling, and demolition campaigns, directly contradicting the terms of a ceasefire agreement.

France had denounced their detention as “unjustified and unfounded”, while their families say the trip had been purely touristic in nature.\n\nBoth teachers, although Paris is retired, were among a number of Europeans caught up in what activists and some Western governments, including France, describe as a deliberate strategy of “hostage-taking” by Iran to extract concessions from the West.\n\nIranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said they had been granted “conditional release” on bail by the judge in charge of the case and “will be placed under surveillance until the next stage of the judicial proceedings”.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told France 2 TV they were in “good health” at the French ambassador’s residence but declined to give details on when they would be allowed to leave Iran.\n\nTheir Paris-based legal team told the AFP news agency in a statement that the release had “ended their arbitrary detention which lasted 1,277 days”.\n\nThe release comes at a time of acute sensitivity in dealings between Tehran and the West in the wake of the  US-Israel 12-day war  in June against Iran and the reimposition of  United Nations sanctions  in the standoff over the Iranian nuclear programme, which the country insists is purely for civilian purposes.\n\nSome Iranians are concerned that Israel will use the sanctions, which are already causing further economic duress in the country, as an excuse to attack again, as it used the  resolution issued by the global nuclear watchdog  in June as a pretext for a war that was cheered by Israeli officials and the public alike.\n\nThe French pair’s sentences on charges of spying for France and Israel, issued last month after a closed-door trial, amounted to 17 years in prison for Paris and 20 years for Kohler.\n\nConcern grew over their health after they were moved from Evin following an  Israeli attack on the prison  during the June war.\n\nKohler was shown in October 2022 on Iranian television in what activists described as  a “forced confession” , a practice relatively common for detainees in Iran, which rights groups say is equivalent to torture.\n\nHer parents, Pascal and Mireille, told AFP in a statement that they felt “immense relief” that the pair were now in a “little corner of France”, even if “all we know for now is that they are out of prison”.\n\nFrance had filed a case with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over their detention, saying they were held under a policy that “targets French nationals travelling in or visiting Iran”.\n\nBut in September, the ICJ suddenly dropped the case at France’s request, prompting speculation that closed-door talks were under way between the two countries for their release.\n\nIran has said the duo could be freed as part of a swap deal with France, which would also see the release of Iranian Mahdieh Esfandiari.\n\nEsfandiari was arrested in France in February on charges of promoting “terrorism” on social media, according to French authorities.\n\nScheduled to go on trial in Paris from January 13, she was released on bail last month in a move welcomed by Tehran.\n\nBarrot declined to comment when asked by France 2 if there had been a deal with Tehran.\n\nAmong the Europeans still jailed by Iran is Swedish-Iranian academic Ahmadreza Djalali, who was sentenced to death in 2017 on espionage charges his family vehemently rejects."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/us-election-results-2025-key-takeaways-from-historic-night-across-the-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"12:22:49+00:00","title":"US election results 2025: Key takeaways from historic night across the US","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a historic off-year election in 2025, Democrats won key races across the U.S., including Zohran Mamdani becoming New York’s first Muslim and first person of South Asian descent to serve as mayor, while public disapproval of President Donald Trump reached 55–69% in several states.

York mayoral election  to become the city’s first Muslim mayor, polls projected late on Tuesday after voting closed in the closely watched election.\n\nBy the time 91 percent of votes had been counted late on Tuesday night, Mamdani, who stood as the candidate for the Democratic Party, had won more than one million votes in the mayoral race, compared with about 850,000 votes for Andrew Cuomo, standing as an independent.\n\nDemocrats also won gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia on the same day, and Californians voted to allow the state’s Democratic lawmakers to redraw the congressional map.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the local United States elections:\n\nThe votes took place in states considered strongholds for Democrats, who indeed have won the elections.\n\nVoting in different US states marked the first round of elections since President Donald Trump’s second term began in January this year.\n\nOff-year elections, which take place during years when there is no presidential election, are usually viewed as an early litmus test of popular opinion on how an administration is performing and which parties voters are aligning themselves with.\n\nAccording to NBC’s exit poll on Tuesday, 55 percent of voters in New Jersey, 56 percent of voters in Virginia, 69 percent of voters in New York City, and 63 percent of voters in California said they disapproved of Trump.\n\nOff-year elections can also serve as an early indicator of how midterm elections – due next year – might go. Historically, support has started to turn away from the party in the White House by the time of the midterms.\n\nTrump appeared cautious ahead of the elections. He was most vocal about the mayoral race in New York, where polls forecast that Mamdani would win comfortably.\n\nBefore voting began, Trump threw his support behind former Democratic governor of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, calling Mamdani a “communist” and even  threatening to cut federal funding  to the city if Mamdani won.\n\nThat did not stop New Yorkers from voting for Mamdani, however. On Tuesday night, when 91 percent of votes had been counted, his tally of 1,036,051 votes was already the highest any New York mayoral candidate has won since 1965, when Republican John Lindsay secured 1,149,106 votes, according to the city’s records.\n\nTrump endorsed but did not name the Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, who was a candidate in the gubernatorial race in Virginia. On October 20, he told reporters on Air Force One: “I think the Republican candidate is very good and I think she should win because the Democrat candidate’s a disaster.”\n\nLate on Tuesday, he appeared to reject any notion that voters might be turning against his administration, posting on his Truth Social platform: “‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters.”\n\nHere is a closer breakdown of what the results look like for each race.\n\nWith 91 percent of the votes counted, Mamdani was well on the way to winning with 1,036,051 votes, about 50.4 percent. Cuomo had 41.6 percent, and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa was trailing far behind with just 7.1 percent of the vote share.\n\nDemocrat Mikie Sherrill was ahead with 1,792,760 votes, or 56.2 percent of the vote share, by the time 95 percent of the ballots had been counted. Republican Jack Ciattarelli had received 43.2 percent of the vote. Sherrill would take over from outgoing Democratic Governor Phil Murphy.\n\nDemocrat Abigail Spanberger had won 1,961,990 votes, or 57.5 percent of the vote share, by the time 97 percent of the votes had been counted. Republican Earle-Sears had received 42.3 percent of the vote.\n\nVirginia also elected Democrat Ghazala Hashmi as lieutenant governor and Democrat Jay Jones as attorney general.\n\nWhile some of the winning Democrats, including Mamdani, represented the party’s more progressive wing, Virginia’s race was won by Spanberger, a moderate.\n\nOther votes included mayoral races in Cincinnati, Atlanta, Detroit and Pittsburgh, as well as for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\nIn Cincinnati and Atlanta, Democratic incumbents Aftab Pureval and Andre Dickens won their races. In Detroit, Democrat Mary Sheffield won, becoming the first woman to lead the city. Democrat Corey O’Connor won the race for Pittsburgh mayor.\n\nPennsylvania voters also voted to retain liberal Supreme Court Justices David Wecht, Christine Donohue and Kevin Dougherty.\n\nMamdani’s win marks several firsts for New York.\n\nAged just 34, he is the first Muslim, the first person of South Asian descent, and the first born in Africa to become mayor of the city.\n\nHis win was met with fanfare. “Tonight, against all odds, we have grasped it. The future is in our hands,” he told a crowd of supporters.\n\n“My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty. New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change, a mandate for a new kind of politics, a mandate for a city we can afford,” he declared.\n\nMamdani pledged to deliver on his campaign promises, which include introducing rent freezes, free buses and universal childcare, and to serve all of the many diverse communities which make up the city. “I speak of Yemeni bodega owners and Mexican abuelas, Senegalese taxi drivers and Uzbek nurses. Trinidadian line cooks and Ethiopian aunties … to every New Yorker in Kensington and Midwood and Hunts Point,” he said.\n\nMamdani contested the mayoral election on  promises  of a free bus programme, universal childcare and the freezing of rent increases on rent-stabilised apartments, to be funded by higher income tax for millionaires and a hike in the corporate tax rate.\n\nSherrill ran her campaign on the promise of lower electricity costs. New Jersey’s electricity rates increased by 22 percent this year, the second-highest increase among all states after Maine. Sherrill has promised to freeze electricity rates and make it easier to add new power generators to the power grid.\n\nSpanberger’s campaign focused on the cost of living in Virginia. She promised to lower the cost of housing, energy and healthcare, alongside improving public schools in the state.\n\nCalifornians voted on an amendment  which will allow the Democratic-controlled state legislature, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, to implement new congressional district maps starting with the 2026 elections.\n\nA majority of 63.8 percent of voters had voted in favour of the amendment by the time 71 percent of the votes had been counted.\n\nWhile California has been a reliably “blue” state, some districts in its rural northeast have often flipped red. With the redistricting plan set out in Proposition 50, five of these districts could now turn back to blue in the upcoming House elections.\n\nThe proposition was, in part, a response to Texas’s mid-cycle redistricting, which benefits Republicans and could allow them to gain five House seats in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nIn June, Trump had floated this idea with Texas Republicans, prompting Governor Greg Abbott to call a special session to redraw the congressional district maps in Texas. In August, the redistricting was enacted in the state.\n\nAfter the vote, Newsom told reporters: “We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump’s recklessness, and tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared with an unprecedented turnout in a special election with an extraordinary result.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"5112-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A global landscape of technological and societal developments is unfolding in 2025: Australia introduces restrictions on social media for minors to protect youth; a breakthrough in mRNA-based cancer vaccines offers hope for off-the-shelf treatments; the UK may become a leading AI hub amid US investment; China bans Nexperia's automotive components, disrupting supply chains; rising temperatures are causing Iceland to lose its status as mosquito-free; Pakistan implements a successful HPV vaccine program to prevent cervical cancer; a major AWS outage highlights the fragility of digital infrastructure; and AI-related concerns over misinformation persist.

Democratic Party?\n\nNew York, United States –  A bellwether or an anomaly?\n\nThat is the question that has surrounded Zohran Mamdani, whose campaign  crescendoed  on Tuesday with a thumping victory over former governor of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, in the mayoral election.\n\nMamdani promised a new vision: a reorientation of the Democratic Party towards working-class Americans, while not sacrificing viewpoints formerly rejected by the mainstream.\n\nCuomo called it a “civil war”, pitting “moderates” like himself and upstart progressives like Mamdani.\n\nThe themes were omnipresent on election day. To Michael Blackman, a 68-year-old voter in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, going against the “establishment” was a top issue in the election.\n\n“Even if he cannot fulfil all the promises that he made, at least [Mamdani] has ideals,” Blackman told Al Jazeera.\n\nCuomo, to him, represents the “same old, same old” status quo that has long dominated liberal politics, a fact underscored by the wealthy donors he  shares  with President Donald Trump and his last-minute endorsement.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Justice Democrats, an organisation that has supported progressive candidates across the country, said, “Zohran’s victory should put every single entrenched, corporate Democrat on notice – if you’re not serving the interests of everyday people, your time in office is limited.”\n\nThe Mamdani campaign and his top allies have also not shied away from framing his victory as a shot across the bow they hope will resonate far beyond the city’s five boroughs.\n\n“It’s that important to send this message, not just to New York City, not just to New York state,” state Senator Michael Gianaris said, standing beside Mamdani on the  eve of the election , “not just to the United States, not just to the president of the United States … but to the whole world”.\n\n“That when the people stick together, they can do anything,” he said.\n\nWhat lessons will be taken from Mamdani’s campaign remain to be seen.\n\nNationally, some top Democrats have been reticent to embrace the 34-year-old, fearing his views, including his affiliation with the political organisation Democratic Socialists of America and his staunch support for Palestinian rights, could alienate their voters in the midterm elections in 2026.\n\nAt the top of that list has been US Senator Chuck Schumer, who has remained neutral in the race.\n\nBut Trip Yang, a Democratic strategist, said regardless of endorsements, Democrats will be closely watching the race for trail markings of a path forward after the party’s rout in the presidential and legislative elections last year.\n\nYang disagreed with the characterisation of a “civil war” between old guard Democrats and upstarts like Mamdani. That would require Cuomo to raise an army of Democratic endorsers, which has not emerged.\n\nInstead, he said Mamdani’s victory shows the direction the party is heading – whether its leaders like it or not; a transformation where labels are less important and a diversity of views is more accepted.\n\n“It doesn’t really matter if you run as a Democratic Socialist, as a moderate, [or] as [a] conservative. The reality is that voters care if you are a disciplined candidate who can speak to their most pressing issue,” Yang said.\n\n“In New York City, it’s affordability … But it’s about finding that one issue and relentlessly focusing on messaging on it in a positive way,” he added.\n\nHe said Mamdani’s model of being a constant presence in communities across the city, and his willingness to engage with hostile media, should also be replicated by Democrats.\n\n“A lot of Democrats just go to safe political spaces,” he said.\n\nFor Daniel Wortel-London, a visiting professor of history at Bard College in Brooklyn, Mamdani’s success underscored that “affordability is the defining issue of our time”.\n\nDemocrats have historically found success when they focus on “bread-and-butter issues like affordability and economic security”, he said.\n\nBut that does not need to come at the expense of a commitment to other progressive ideals.\n\n“Mamdani has figured out how to combine those priorities with the moral urgency of social justice that animates many progressives,” Wortel-London said.\n\n“If Democrats want to bridge their internal divisions and rebuild a broad coalition, they’ll need to take a page from Mamdani’s playbook,” he said.\n\nFor many, those ideals have been exemplified in Mamdani’s support for Palestinian rights and his condemnation of the genocide in Gaza.\n\nThat has been the subject of a wave of attacks from Cuomo, who has called Mamdani anti-Semitic and a “terrorist sympathiser”.\n\nWhile Mamdani has clarified some of his positions, for example, backing away from using the term “globalise the intifada”, he has remained resolute in his support for Palestine and his criticism of Israel.\n\n“I appreciate the fact that he has principles that are guiding him,” Mamdani supporter Shabnam Salehezadehi told Al Jazeera on the night before the election.\n\nMamdani’s success aligns with a  surge  in support for Palestinians among Democrats, driven largely by the war in Gaza, even as many top members of the party continue to support the supply of military assistance to Israel.\n\n“Mamdani sees the humanity in Palestinians; he sees the genocide for what it is,” Salehezadehi said.\n\nTo be sure, the success of Mamdani’s campaign is only the beginning.\n\nHe faces a mountain of hurdles in  enacting his agenda  when he takes office in January, particularly if he seeks to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy New Yorkers to pay for some of his top pledges, including universal childcare.\n\n“That said,” explained historian Wortel-London, “history shows it’s not impossible to win those fights. Even Mayor Bloomberg, a Republican, managed to secure tax increases when he demonstrated effective, disciplined leadership.”\n\n“If Mamdani can do the same, he may surprise people with how much he can accomplish.”\n\nFor 34-year-old Samad Ahmed, a cybersecurity consultant, Mamdani’s candidacy has been transformative, inspiring him to vote in a local election for the first time.\n\nBut he knows public opinion can be fickle. Failure to deliver could cause blowback for the brand of politics Mamdani has championed.\n\n“Personally, I’ve never felt like there was a right candidate to vote for, someone that represents me as a New Yorker,” Ahmed told Al Jazeera from Jackson Heights, Queens.\n\n“But it’s up to him to prove us right,” he said.\n\n“Otherwise, he’ll be out the door very soon. That’s how New Yorkers are. That’s how Americans are.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Andy Hirschfeld."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/why-is-pakistan-making-india-a-key-figure-in-its-dispute-with-the-taliban","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"10:55:15+00:00","title":"Why is Pakistan making India a key figure in its dispute with the Taliban?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has accused India of influencing the Afghan Taliban, claiming it is using Kabul to launch a low-intensity war against Pakistan.

from Pakistan and Afghanistan hit a wall in talks to extend their fragile ceasefire after deadly border clashes, Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif blamed a third country that wasn’t even present during the dialogue: India.\n\nIn a television interview, Asif claimed that India had “penetrated” the Afghan Taliban leadership. That, he insisted, was the reason for the  escalation in tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nHe complimented the Taliban leadership at the talks in Istanbul. “But the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi,” Asif charged. “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.”\n\nThe defence minister presented no evidence to back his claim that India was propping up the Taliban to challenge Pakistan. But his comments represent a growing attempt by Pakistan to portray its tensions with Afghanistan as the outcome of a growing friendship between the Taliban and India.\n\nAs Pakistani and Afghan troops were clashing along the border earlier in the month, Asif said the Taliban was “sitting in India’s lap”. Islamabad has accused the Taliban of allowing anti-Pakistan armed groups like the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil and has claimed – again without public evidence – that India is behind the TTP.\n\nThe Taliban leadership has rejected the accusation that India has had any role in the crisis between Pakistan and Afghanistan and has denied any responsibility in the TTP’s repeated attacks on Pakistani soil.\n\nStill, analysts said, the decision by Pakistani leaders like Asif to invoke India as an alleged shadowy villain pulling the strings of the Taliban underscores the deep unease in Islamabad over ties between New Delhi and Kabul. For Pakistan, wedged between Afghanistan to the west and India to the east, New Delhi’s expanding footprint in Kabul is a source of deep suspicion.\n\nAs Pakistani and Afghan negotiators prepare to meet in Istanbul on Thursday for the next round of talks that Qatar and Turkiye are mediating, India is increasingly the elephant in the room, analysts said.\n\nWhen a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck northern Afghanistan on Monday, one of the first countries to offer aid was India.\n\nIndian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar phoned his Taliban counterpart, Amir Khan Muttaqi, and New Delhi shipped 15 tonnes of food to quake-hit Balkh and Samangan provinces. Medical supplies, he said, would follow soon.\n\nJaishankar’s outreach came just a few days after Muttaqi completed a  six-day visit to India , the first by an Afghan Taliban leader to New Delhi since the group seized power for a second time in Kabul in August 2021.\n\nThe visit also underscored a wider re-engagement between India and the Taliban in recent years, capped by New Delhi’s decision last month to  reopen its embassy  in Kabul.\n\nThe regional landscape is very different from four years ago when the Afghan Taliban returned to power. At that time, India had paused most of its diplomatic operations in Afghanistan while Pakistan’s influence in Kabul was widely seen as having increased.\n\nFor years, Pakistan had been the Taliban’s primary patron. India, for its part, long regarded the Taliban as a Pakistani proxy. It accused the group and its allies of repeatedly targeting Indian diplomatic posts in Kabul, Jalalabad, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif from 2001 to 2021 when the Taliban was out of power and was fighting US forces and the Afghan governments that Western troops supported.\n\nIslamabad’s longstanding doctrine of “strategic depth” is rooted in the military’s desire to wield leverage in Afghanistan and blunt India’s influence in South Asia.\n\nSince 2021, however, the Taliban have pursued a more conciliatory posture towards New Delhi.\n\nC Raja Mohan, a former member of India’s National Security Advisory Board, recently wrote in his  column for Foreign Policy magazine  that India’s re-engagement with Kabul since 2021 has been “cautious, pragmatic and deliberately quiet”.\n\nThis shift, however, has unnerved Islamabad, especially as Pakistan now faces security threats on both its borders.\n\nThe Pahalgam attack in April, which killed at least 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir and for which India blamed Pakistan-based groups, became a flashpoint.\n\nIndia’s retaliation two weeks later escalated tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals and resulted in a four-day conflict in May.\n\nFive days after a ceasefire, Jaishankar called Muttaqi to express his appreciation for Afghanistan’s condemnation of the Pahalgam attack and to reiterate support for Afghan development.\n\n“Underlined our traditional friendship with the Afghan people and continuing support for their development needs. Discussed ways and means of taking cooperation forward,” the Indian external affairs minister  wrote on his X account.\n\nAfter clashing with India in  May , Pakistan also engaged in a weeklong fight with Afghanistan that took place while Muttaqi was visiting India.\n\nThe fighting eventually ended through a ceasefire, which was mediated by Qatar and Turkiye over  two rounds of talks  in Doha and Istanbul. But the peace remains tenuous at best.\n\nYet some analysts argued Pakistan’s concerns reflect longstanding strategic anxieties rather than recent developments with Afghanistan.\n\nAmina Khan of the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad said Pakistan had expected the Taliban not to create “space or vacuum” for India, an expectation that has not been met.\n\nKhan noted that the recent visit by Muttaqi to India resulted in strong statements that were issued not only by the Afghan government but also Indian officials, which led to an increase in Pakistani apprehensions.\n\nRandhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, in news briefings last month said that while India was closely monitoring the Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions, it was Pakistan’s “old practice” to blame its neighbours for its internal failures.\n\n“Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,” Jaiswal said on  October 16.\n\nKhan, though, said that ultimately, Pakistan needs to view its relationship with Afghanistan independent of ties with other nations.\n\n“Pakistan has a bilateral relationship with Afghanistan, and that should be viewed in complete isolation,” she told Al Jazeera. “Similarly, despite the tensions and clashes, India-Pakistan ties should also be viewed independently without including the Afghan factor.”\n\nPakistan has long accused India of supporting unrest in its southwestern province of Balochistan, where separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army and Baloch Liberation Front  have fought for secession.\n\nIslamabad pointed to the arrest of former Indian navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav in  March 2016  in Balochistan as proof of India’s meddling. New Delhi denied the allegations and called them baseless.\n\nBut the Pakistani government has also linked a recent rise in violence across Pakistan – especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, both of which share the country’s 2,600km-long (1,615-mile-long) border with Afghanistan – to armed groups operating from Afghan territory.\n\nIslamabad, in particular, accused the Taliban of providing safe havens on Afghan soil to the TTP, which is often called the Pakistan Taliban and has claimed a series of deadly attacks on Pakistani soil in recent years. The TTP, which emerged in 2007, is distinct from the Afghan Taliban but shares ideological affinities.\n\nThis year, however, Pakistan’s official messaging has increasingly framed both Baloch separatists and the TTP as Indian-sponsored proxies, a rhetorical move intended to tie disparate threats to a single external adversary, analysts said.\n\nFormer Pakistani diplomat Asif Durrani told Al Jazeera that leaders of Baloch groups had “proudly acknowledged” Indian assistance and alleged New Delhi supported the TTP through intermediaries from 2001 to 2021. Pakistan has not offered any public proof to back its claims of Indian support for the TTP.\n\nNow with ties with the Afghan Taliban improving, Durrani said India would “be able to manoeuvre in Afghanistan”.\n\n“I don’t think they are necessarily dictating terms to [the] Afghan Taliban, but it is likely a case of quid pro quo where Indians will give aid to them in lieu of [the] Taliban looking the other way.”\n\nIbraheem Bahiss, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, said Pakistan’s military establishment tends to view Afghanistan primarily through an Indian lens.\n\n“The Pakistani security establishment does not see Afghanistan itself as an existential threat. But it is certainly compounded by the idea of a much larger and potent threat that is posed by India. And in that context, Afghanistan does become a much bigger concern for policymakers in Islamabad,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nBahiss added, however, that it was hard for Pakistan to back its assertion that India was behind such diverse groups as the TTP and Baloch separatists.\n\n“TTP share ideological, social and linguistic connections to the Afghan Taliban, but the Baloch groups are on the completely opposite end of the spectrum with their secular outlook,” he said.\n\n“When you claim that India and the Taliban, two entities with a bitter history, are coming together to support two entirely disparate groups, that is not a very believable, cohesive narrative.”\n\nYet Islamabad treats the two relationships – with Kabul and with New Delhi – as mutually reinforcing threats.\n\nKhan warned that recent statements by Kabul and New Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting “terrorism” suggested an emerging, if tacit, convergence of interests, which she described as a “marriage of convenience”.\n\nWhile Pakistan’s eastern border with India has been quiet since the May ceasefire, relations have been tense.\n\nBoth sides have traded claims of battlefield success, including conflicting assertions about aircraft losses, and ramped up their rhetoric.\n\nIndian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh warned in October that any aggression in the Sir Creek area would be met with a “resounding response that will change both history and geography”.\n\nThe Sir Creek region is an almost 100km-long (62-mile-long) tidal estuary between Indian Gujarat’s Rann of Kutch and Pakistan that has long been disputed between the two neighbours.\n\nOn October 27, Singh told soldiers India must remain ready for a “warlike” situation, citing lessons from the May conflict.\n\nPakistan’s army chief, General Asim Munir, issued a counterwarning at a passing-out parade at Pakistan’s premier military academy on October 18.\n\n“The onus of ensuing escalations, one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond, will squarely lie with India,” he said. “Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators.”\n\nBoth countries have deployed forces in the Arabian Sea and are conducting major exercises.\n\nSeema Ilahi Baloch, a former Pakistani ambassador who has participated in informal talks with Afghanistan, said the timing of India’s re-engagement with Kabul adds to Pakistan’s unease.\n\n“The war of words between Pakistan and India will become stronger in the coming days, and any future clash cannot be ruled out,” she told Al Jazeera."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce86gneqvz1o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:02:56.003+00:00","title":"What we know about the deadly UPS cargo plane crash in Louisville, Kentucky","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 5, 2025, a UPS MD-11F cargo plane, operating as Flight 2976, crashed during takeoff at Louisville International Airport, skidding off the runway and striking two nearby businesses—Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and Grade A Auto Parts—before bursting into flames.

The airport is located in Kentucky's biggest city and several neighbourhoods and business districts surround it.\n\nAll operations at the airport have been halted.\n\nOfficials have confirmed seven deaths so far but have warned that number is expected to rise.\n\nIt is unclear whether that death toll includes the three crew members who were onboard the plane and are feared dead.\n\nEleven other people are have been injured and are being treated in hospital - but local officials say that figure is also likely to rise.\n\nThe head of the local fire service said he was not aware of anyone being trapped in nearby buildings but said searches were still ongoing.\n\nTwo workers at the auto business that was struck were still unaccounted for as of Tuesday evening, and it is not known how many customers were on the premises when the crash happened.\n\nA preliminary investigation is under way but officials have said it is too early to say what caused the crash.\n\nAfter an initial take off, it climbed to 175 ft before its altitude suddenly crashed.\n\nIt's unclear what caused the crash, but video shows a portion of its wing on fire.\n\nOfficials did note, though, that the massive blaze was due to the amount of fuel onboard the aircraft, which was beginning a journey of around 4,300 miles (6,920km) to Hawaii.\n\nThe aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel when it crashed.\n\nIt has not been confirmed what cargo was on board, though officials have said the plane was not carrying anything that would create a heightened risk of contamination.\n\nLouisville Fire Department chief Brian O'Neal said the amount of fuel spilled at the crash site made it a \"very dangerous situation\".\n\nAn order warning people to shelter in place was reduced from a five-mile radius from the airport to a one-mile radius as crews worked to contain the blaze on Tuesday night.\n\nThe model of aircraft involved was a MD-11F large triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, mosquitoes were first detected in Iceland, marking a significant ecological shift.

in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205z4963vyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:34:57.370+00:00","title":"Several critically hurt on Ile d'Oléron in France after driver rams into 10 people","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 35-year-old man on Ile d'Oléron, off the west coast of France, deliberately rammed into pedestrians and cyclists, injuring four people including a young girl, before abandoning his vehicle and attempting to set it on fire.

least 66 killed as Typhoon Kalmaegi batters the Philippines\n\nThe death toll from Typhoon Kalmaegi in the Philippines has climbed to 66, including six people on a military helicopter that crashed during the powerful storm, which unleashed heavy rains and floods across the central region of the country.\n\nFloodwaters described as “unprecedented” trapped many people on the roofs of their homes and submerged cars on Tuesday, with entire towns inundated on the island of Cebu.\n\nCebu accounted for 49 of the deaths, the civil defence agency’s deputy administrator, Rafaelito Alejandro, said in an interview with local radio outlet DZMM on Wednesday, as he confirmed the overall death toll of 66.\n\n“It was the major cities that got hit [with floods], highly urbanised areas,” Alejandro said, adding that 26 people are still missing.\n\n“All the floods have subsided. Our challenge now is the clearing of this debris that is blocking our roads,” he said.\n\nIn the 24 hours before Typhoon Kalmaegi, locally named Tino,  made landfall  shortly before midnight on Monday, the area around the provincial capital, Cebu City, was deluged with 183mm (7 inches) of rainfall, well in excess of its 131mm monthly average (5.2 inches), state weather specialist Charmagne Varilla told the AFP news agency.\n\nIn Agusan del Sur, on the island of Mindanao, a Huey helicopter went down while conducting a humanitarian disaster response mission, the military said. Six bodies of the crew were recovered, and an investigation is under way, the military said.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, provincial Governor Pamela Baricuatro called the situation in Cebu “unprecedented”.\n\n“We were expecting the winds to be the dangerous part, but … the water is what’s truly putting our people at risk,” Baricuatro said on Facebook. “The floodwaters are just devastating.”\n\nAlthough the typhoon gradually lost strength on Tuesday, it continued to lash the country with winds of 120km/h (74.5mph) and gusts of 165km/h (102.5mph) as it swept across the Visayas islands, headed for northern Palawan and towards the South China Sea.\n\nTens of thousands of residents were evacuated across the Visayas region, including parts of southern Luzon and northern Mindanao, authorities said. The typhoon was expected to leave the Philippines late on Wednesday or early Thursday.\n\n“Due to interaction with the terrain, Tino may slightly weaken while crossing Visayas. However, it is expected to remain at typhoon intensity throughout its passage over the country,” the Philippine weather agency PAGASA said in a morning bulletin.\n\nThe Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, routinely striking disaster-prone areas where millions of people live in poverty.\n\nThe Philippines was hit by two major storms in September, including  Super Typhoon Ragasa , which killed at least three people and forced thousands to evacuate from villages and schools in the north of the country.\n\nKalmaegi is forecast to make landfall on Thursday night in Vietnam’s central region, which has already suffered heavy floods that killed at least 40 people and left six others missing over the past week."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp2vj92e9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"00:18:15.451+00:00","title":"AI 'godmother' Fei-Fei Li says she is 'proud to be different'","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Professor Fei-Fei Li, known as the 'godmother of AI' and one of only seven pioneers honored with the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, emphasizes the importance of gender inclusivity in AI and takes pride in being recognized as a woman in a historically male-dominated field.

seven pioneers of artificial Intelligence being presented with a top engineering prize by the King today makes her \"proud to be different\".\n\nThe King will present the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Prof Li and six others during a ceremony at St James's Palace.\n\nThose honoured alongside her are Prof Yoshua Bengio, Dr Bill Dally, Dr Geoffrey Hinton, Prof John Hopfield, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang and Meta's Chief AI Scientist Dr Yann LeCun.\n\nThey are being recognised for their contributions to the development of modern machine learning, a field that underpins the rapid advancement of AI.\n\nDr Hinton, Prof Bengio and Yann LeCun, currently Chief AI Scientist at Meta have widely been recognised as the \"Godfathers of AI\" since they were jointly awarded the 2018 Turing Award.\n\nThere is however only one so-called \"godmother\" of AI and Prof Li told the BBC she has grown to accept the moniker.\n\n\"I would not call myself godmother of anything,\" she said.\n\nShe said a few years ago when people started calling her that, she had to \"pause and recognise if I rejected this, it would miss an opportunity for women scientists and technologists to be recognised this way\".\n\n\"Because men are pretty easily called godfathers or founding fathers.\"\n\n\"For all the young women I work with and the generations of girls to come, I'm okay now accepting this title,\" she added.\n\nBorn in China, Prof Li emigrated to the US as a teenager and went on to excel in computer science. She is co-director for Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute and co-founder and CEO of World Labs.\n\nIt is her work on ImageNet a project which enabled major advances in computer vision for which she is recognised.\n\nShe and her students created large-scale image recognition datasets upon which a lot of artificial intelligence technology is now built. It paved the way for computer vision – working out how computers could 'see'.\n\nShe says the importance of that data set \"open the floodgate of data-driven AI\".\n\nShe thinks the next AI milestone will come when it is able to interact with the world around it.\n\nThis ability was is \"innately important and native to animals and humans\", and if this could be unlocked in AI, it could \"superpower\" humans in many ways, \"including creativity, robotic learning, design and architecture\".\n\nThis will be the first time all seven laureates have come together in person.\n\nThe three \"godfathers\" have publicly stated opposing views on how dangerous AI could be.\n\nDr Hinton has  repeatedly expressed  serious concerns about the potential for AI to pose an \"extinction-level threat\".  But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta has written that  apocalyptic warnings are overblown .\n\nProf Li says she takes a more \"pragmatic approach\" and says the disagreement amongst scientists is \"healthy\".\n\n\"We're used to even disagreement, and I think that's healthy. A topic as profound and impactful as AI requires a lot of healthy debate and public discourse.\n\n\"I think in the case of AI, both extreme rhetorics concern me…I have always advocated for a much more science based, pragmatic method in communicating and educating the public.\n\n\"So, yes, I would like to see our communication of AI to be much more moderated and grounded in facts and science instead of the extreme rhetorics\".\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth prize is awarded annually to engineers responsible for groundbreaking innovations which globally benefit humanity. Previous recipients include Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.\n\nLord Vallance, chair of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, said the winners \"represent the very best of engineering,\" adding that their work \"demonstrates how engineering can both sustain our planet and transform the way we live and learn.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Philippa Wain\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

UN\n\nGlobal climate commitments are on track to limit  global warming  by as much as 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) this century, far below what is needed to tackle the climate crisis despite a raft of pledges, the United Nations has warned.\n\nIn its annual Emissions Gap Report on Tuesday, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said the world would exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) mark – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – “very likely” within the next decade.\n\nIf countries do as they have promised in their climate action plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5C (4.1 to 4.5F) by 2100, the report said. However, with the policies currently in place, Earth is expected to be 2.8C (5F) hotter in that time span.\n\n“Nations have had three attempts to deliver promises made under the Paris Agreement, and each time they have landed off target,” said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen.\n\n“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop.”\n\nThe findings come just days before world leaders are set to converge for a UN climate conference in Brazil,  COP30 , where the global failure so far to tackle the crisis will loom large.\n\nGlobal emissions grew 2.3 percent in 2024 compared to the previous year, an increase driven by India followed by China, Russia and Indonesia, Tuesday’s report found.\n\nBut wealthy and powerful Group of 20 (G20) economies accounted for three-quarters of global emissions, and of the six largest polluters, the European Union was the only one to cut greenhouse gases last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States under President Donald Trump has moved away from its climate commitments, and  the country’s planned withdrawal  from the Paris Agreement will be official early next year.\n\nThe Trump administration’s policies, which range from rolling back  environmental regulations  to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, UNEP said in its report.\n\nThe UN agency also said the rest of the world must cut an additional two billion tonnes a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing US carbon pollution.\n\nScientists are in broad agreement that warming above 1.5C (2.7F) relative to pre-industrial times risks  catastrophic consequences , and every effort must be made to stick as close as possible to that safer threshold.\n\nAt 1.4C (2.5F) above pre-industrial times, the Earth is already too warm for most tropical coral reefs to survive, while ice sheets and the Amazon rainforest could suffer severe and lasting changes below 2C (3.6F), with consequences for the entire planet.\n\n“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world,” said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate UN scientific panel that calculates climate impacts.\n\n“It is particularly important for those  vulnerable communities  and ecosystems that are already being impacted,” she told The Associated Press news agency.\n\n“It matters in  heatwaves .

budget plans billions in new spending in response to US tariff shocks \n\nCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has put forward his first federal budget, which lays out an ambitious plan to transform Canada's economy and deal with the challenge of US tariffs.\n\nBilled an \"investment budget\" by the government, the fiscal plan increases Canada's deficit to C$78bn ($55.3bn; £42.47bn), the second largest in history.\n\nThe spending is   offset by plans to attract C$1tn of investment into Canada over the next five years, with the federal government arguing more restrained spending would eliminate \"vital social programmes\" and funding for Canada's future.\n\nThe budget does outline cuts, however, including slashing the size of the federal workforce by some 10% in the coming years.\n\nThe budget was presented by Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, in the House of Commons late on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn his budget speech, Champagne warned that Canada is facing \"a time of profound change\" and that \"bold and swift action is needed\" to ensure the country prospers.\n\nPeppered throughout the budget are references to uncertainty and the need for protectionist measures as a result of US tariffs on Canada. President Donald Trump has placed a broad 35% levy on Canadian goods not covered by an existing free trade agreement, and has tariffed specific sectors like steel, aluminium and automobiles.\n\nThese levies, enacted earlier this year, have already led to Canadian job losses in those sectors, and business leaders have warned of a chill on investment in Canada due to trade uncertainty.\n\nTo counter this, the budget proposes spending of C$280bn over the next five years \"to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience\".\n\nThese include updating ports and other trade infrastructure with the goal of doubling Canadian exports to non-US markets over the next decade, as well as direct financing to support firms impacted by tariffs.\n\nThe fiscal update also outlines a plan to boost Canada's competitiveness, with the goal of making Canada a more attractive place to do business than the US.\n\nRebekah Young, the head of inclusion and resilience economics at Scotiabank, said the budget lays out a plan to reduce timelines and smooth regulatory hurdles with the hopes that it will boost private investment in Canada over the years.\n\nBut she cautioned that parts of the budget might be a hard sell for Canadians struggling immediately with the cost of living.\n\n\"They're going to open this budget and not see any new (supports),\" she said.\n\nAnd while the budget delivers on its promise of generational spending, Ms Young said it remains to be seen if it will be as \"transformational\" as Carney hopes.\n\n\"We want to unlock a trillion dollars based on this investment here. A lot has to happen to get to that trillion,\" she said.\n\nOn defence, the budget pledges nearly C$82bn over five years—the largest funding in decades—putting Canada in line with its Nato commitment to spend 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on its military by this year.\n\nThe Carney government is also betting big on AI, proposing nearly C$1bn to boost integration and use of the rapidly growing technology, including in government operations.\n\nCarney warned Canadians ahead of the budget of \"sacrifices\". Among them is a reduction of the size of the federal government that would result in 40,000 job losses by 2029. International aid is also slated to be cut to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nImmigration targets have been lowered slightly over the next three years to \"stabilise\" new admissions to the country, including a significant cut to student visas.\n\nThe budget will need to be passed by Canada's parliament before it's implemented. Carney's Liberal government is just shy of a majority, meaning it will need the support of other parties to enact its fiscal plan.\n\nFailure to pass the budget could risk a federal election.\n\nOne Conservative MP, Chris d'Entremont, said in a statement released by the Liberals on Tuesday night that he had resigned from the Conservative caucus and will be crossing the floor to Carney’s party.\n\nIn the statement, the MP said that the  budget “hits the priorities I have heard most in my riding“.\n\n​​This narrows Carney's razor-thin minority at a critical time.\n\nMeanwhile, Conservative opposition MPs have criticised the budget for increasing Canada's deficit while doing little to address affordability for Canadians.\n\nYves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of the separatist Bloc Québécois party, said his caucus does not see how they could support the budget.\n\nMembers of the left-leaning New Democratic Party said they will take the time to study it, but have criticised planned public sector cuts.\n\nWith the projected larger deficit, Carney's fiscal plan maintains that Canada's still has the lowest deficit-to-GDP ratio in the G7, behind only Japan."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9dyyydjr0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:00:36.382+00:00","title":"At least seven people killed after UPS cargo plane crashes in Kentucky","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS cargo plane, an MD-11F aircraft, crashed during takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Tuesday evening, resulting in at least seven fatalities and 11 injuries.

York City mayor\n\nIt's official: the biggest city in the US has its first Muslim and first South Asian mayor.\n\nSince democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani first entered New York City's mayoral race, the 34-year-old state assemblyman from Queens has had a meteoric rise from near-total obscurity into the national spotlight.\n\nHis bold, left-wing platform has energised progressives, shaken up his Democratic Party, and drawn harsh criticism from President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\n\"Today we have spoken in a clear voice: hope is alive,\" Mamdani told supporters after triumphing in the contest.\n\nUnlike his more established opponents, Mamdani's new perspective, youth and new left-wing platform excited and ultimately won over voters eager for a fresher politician.\n\n\"Let City Hall, with our compassion, our conviction and our clarity, be the light that our city and our nation so desperately need,\" Mamdani said on the week he was elected.\n\nBorn in Uganda, Mamdani moved to New York with his family aged seven. He attended the Bronx High School of Science and later earned a degree in Africana Studies from Bowdoin College, where he co-founded the campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine.\n\nThe millennial progressive has leaned into his roots in a diverse city. He has also made his Muslim faith a visible part of his campaign. He visited mosques regularly and released a campaign video in Urdu about the city's cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"We know that to stand in public as a Muslim is also to sacrifice the safety that we can sometimes find in the shadows,\" he said at a rally.\n\nMamdani and his wife, 27-year-old Brooklyn-based Syrian artist Rama Duwaji, met on the dating app Hinge.\n\nHis mother, Mira Nair, is a celebrated film director and his father Professor Mahmood Mamdani, teaches at Columbia. Both parents are alumni of Harvard University.\n\nBefore entering politics, he worked as a housing counsellor, helping low-income homeowners in Queens fight eviction.\n\nLike his opponents, Mamdani's mayoral campaign focused heavily on making the city safer and more affordable.\n\nBut he pushed more radical ways to accomplish those goals - some of which will be uncharted territory for New York City.\n\nPart of what made Mamdani so successful during his campaign was that younger voters perceived him to be authentic on social media, says Jane Hall, communications professor at American University.\n\n\"You don't have to be young to be able to do it, but I think you have to be seen as being authentic and speaking to what people care about in a way that is hip and makes people want to be on the bandwagon,\" Prof Hall said.\n\nMamdani's critics have argued that he does not have enough experience to lead the largest US city effectively.\n\nTrump has tried to paint him as radical, repeatedly calling him a communist, though Mamdani has frequently rejected that label. The president also has threatened to withhold federal funds from a Mamdani administration.\n\nAfter declaring victory in the mayoral race, Mamdani addressed the president directly: \"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up. To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.\"\n\nTrump promptly posted on social media: \"…AND SO IT BEGINS!\"\n\nAndres Bernal, former policy adviser to New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, says Democrats can learn from Mamdani's ability to connect with people.\n\n\"Today's Republicans shape public discourse and they try to shape political consciousness in this country,\" Bernal argued. \"While Democrats kind of just assume that people have fixed beliefs and they look at polls and say, okay, how do we match what we say to what we think people believe?\"\n\nThe high cost of housing is one of residents' most common gripes about living in the city that never sleeps.\n\nAverage rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan in November 2025 is $4,778 (£3,666), a nearly 20% increase from three years prior, according to apartment listings site RentHop. And in Brooklyn, average rent for a 1-bedroom is $3,625, about a 5% increase, according to RentHop.\n\nOne of the most talked-about points in Mamdani's housing plan is freezing rent for four years on the city's one million rent-stabilised apartments.\n\n\"This is a city where one in four of its people are living in poverty, a city where 500,000 kids go to sleep hungry every night,\" Mamdani told the BBC over the summer. \"And ultimately, it's a city that is in danger of losing that which makes it so special.\"\n\nBut researchers at Maverick Real Estate Partners argue that the four-year rent freeze would be \"catastrophic\" for many building owners, permanently reducing their net operating income.\n\nMamdani ran on a campaign of making the most expensive US city affordable for its residents beyond simply housing.\n\nOne of his more novel ideas is creating a network of  city-owned grocery stores  across New York's five boroughs, expanding on the six city-owned stores. Shopping in such shops would be cheaper for customers.\n\nBut critics have argued that Mamdani's proposal ignores complex logistical realities of the food supply chain.\n\nHe also wants to make  public buses free  - the current fare for most riders is $2.90 - and he plans to make them faster. While Mamdani has estimated that his plan would cost the city $630m a year, the chair of the MTA told the Gothamist website that it would be closer to $1bn.\n\nAlso on Mamdani's agenda is lowering the  cost of childcare , citing the experiences of friends who have told him they are leaving the city due to the high costs.\n\nTo help pay for his plans, Mamdani wants to raise the  corporate tax rate  to 11.5%, matching the top end of New Jersey's range. The corporate tax rate in New York City currently goes up to 7.25%.\n\nHe also wants to add a flat 2% tax for New Yorkers who make more than $1m a year. The campaign said these hikes would raise $9bn, but how they would be raised remains a question. Kathy Hochul, the governor of wider New York state, has also said she won't support the new mayor's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy.\n\nMamdani wants to raise the city's  minimum wage  - currently $16.50 per hour - up to $30 per hour by 2030.\n\nBut critics have argued that it would put many lower-skilled workers out of work and force them out of the city.\n\nQuality of life is another major concern for New Yorkers: only 34% of them ranked the city's as excellent or good in 2025, down from 51% in 2017, according to a survey from the Citizens Budget Commission.\n\nA flagship element of Mamdani's platform is creating a department of community safety, which would expand city mental health services, including building a system for mental health workers to respond to related 911 calls, instead of police.\n\nMamdani's Republican opponent Curtis Sliwa criticised the plan, saying it's unrealistic and unsafe for social workers to respond to potentially violent situations.\n\nMamdani's strong support of Palestinians and staunch criticism of Israel goes further than most of the Democratic establishment.\n\nAs an assemblyman, he introduced a bill to end the tax-exempt status of New York charities with ties to Israeli settlements that violate international human rights law.\n\nHe has said he believes Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, is an apartheid state, and that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be arrested. Israel vehemently rejects accusations of genocide and apartheid.\n\nMamdani has been pressed numerous times by press in interviews to state whether he supports Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. In a response, he said: \"I'm not comfortable supporting any state that has a hierarchy of citizenship on the basis of religion or anything else, I think that in the way that we have in this country, equality should be enshrined in every country in the world.\" Israel says all religions have equal rights under the law.\n\nMamdani has also said that there is no room for antisemitism in New York City, adding that if he were elected, he would increase funding to combat hate crimes.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nada Tawfik and Rachel Hagan"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8zzv1ypkpo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"04:47:15.162+00:00","title":"Six takeaways from Canada's federal budget","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled his first federal budget, signaling a major shift from former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s policies.

budget\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has introduced his first federal budget - a blueprint for how he plans to deliver on his promise to make Canada's economy the strongest in the G7.\n\nThe ambitious plan, seen as a key test of the new leader and former central banker, is as much a political document as a spending blueprint.\n\nIt warns that Canada is in an era of \"significant change\" not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall, which is underscored by its rapidly shifting relationship with the US, once the country's closest ally.\n\n\"There's some headwinds on the horizon,\" Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday. \"That's why we need a strong response.\"\n\nHere are six takeaways from the spending plan.\n\nThe budget includes billions of dollars in spending that could balloon Canada's deficit to C$78.3bn (£42.6bn) - the second biggest on record.\n\nCarney and Finance Minister Champagne have defended the massive spending plan,  which will total C$280bn, as an investment to help boost Canada's global competitiveness and argued that a strategic injection of funds will attract C$1tn in investment back to Canada in the next five years.\n\nIt will fund a broad range of areas:  highways, ports, electrical grids, digital corridors, defence, housing, and initiatives promised to boost Canada's productivity.\n\nBut Carney has also warned Canadians of necessary \"sacrifices\" in his plan to transform the economy, with the budget projecting C$60bn in total spending cuts in the next five years.\n\nThey come in part from a reduction of 40,000 jobs in the public sector by the end of 2029 - about 10% of the workforce to be trimmed through attrition, job cuts and the widespread adoption of AI.\n\nFederal ministries could see up to 15% cuts in the coming years, expected to account for more than C$44bn in savings, according to the budget.\n\nFor the first time in Canada, the fiscal plan drew distinctions between government spending by operational spending - day-to-day government spending - and capital investment, defined as funding that should help grow the economy.\n\nDue to its proximity and close cultural ties, the US has long been Canada's largest trading partner, with about 70% of trade moving south.\n\nIn the wake of Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty that came with them, Canada is looking to Europe and Asia, with the aim of doubling non-US exports over the next decade.\n\nCarney's budget proposes millions in backing for businesses working to develop new export markets, and includes help with legal expenses and market research.\n\nThere is also a nod to growing cultural ties with Europe, like exploring Canada's participation in the Eurovision song contest.\n\nWith some firms hoping to save on trade costs by moving facilities south to the US, Carney is also proposing  a raft of initiatives to make Canada more attractive. That includes a suite of measures that would lower Canada's marginal effective tax rate to 13.2% from 15.6%.\n\n\"This is a great message for investors,\" said Champagne, noting the rate will be lower than that in the US.\n\nAnd with many US universities facing uncertain funding under the Trump administration, the spending plan includes C$1.3bn to attract international researchers to Canadian universities, and money to support their research.\n\nLike other resource economies, Canada has grappled with balancing its need to increase production of commodities like oil and gas while maintaining its climate commitments. Oil-rich provinces like Alberta have lobbied the federal government to remove some enviromental initiatives, arguing they hurt development in the region.\n\nCarney's fiscal plan proposes making Canada a \"clean energy superpower\" by supporting the development of low-emission energy projects like nuclear reactors and low-carbon liquified natural gas.\n\nAt the same time, the government is pushing for the development of carbon capture and storage technologies, as well as enhanced methane regulations.\n\nIt is also affirming its commitment to the industrial carbon tax, calling it a policy \"that delivers more emissions reductions than any other\".\n\nTo encourage investment, the Carney government says it will work with provinces on what that carbon pricing would look like long-term to provide more stability to companies.\n\nThese initiatives would replace an oil and gas emissions cap introduced by Carney's predecessor, former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nAll of this is billed under a Climate Competitiveness Strategy that the Carney government says is \"a central pillar of the plan for Canada to become the strongest economy in the G7\".\n\nCarney has pledged Canada will significantly boost defence spending to hit a Nato target of 2% of GDP this year and 5% by 2035, as the country grapples with an aggressive Russia and more powerful China, as well as threats to Arctic security.\n\nThe budget outlines C$81.8bn in defence spending over the next five years, the largest amount in decades for a country that has long lagged in military funding and struggled with procurement.\n\nSpending includes pay increases for the armed forces, funding for digital infrastructure, and plans to develop Canadian supply chains.\n\nThere is also C$182.6m over three years for the defence ministry to establish capability for space launches.\n\nAnother focus is the Arctic. The Carney government says it is eyeing the development of all-weather, dual-use infrastructure projects in Canada's north that can be used for both economic and security reasons, devoting  C$1bn over four years to the endeavour.\n\nCarney's first act as prime minister was getting rid of one of his predecessor's signature climate policies, the consumer carbon tax, which had become politically unpopular.\n\nHe has continued to break from Trudeau, who was in power for nearly a decade, pushing back the electric-vehicle sales mandate and cancelling a proposed increase on Canada's capital gains tax.\n\nThe budget shows another major break, on immigration.\n\nTrudeau drastically increased the number of immigrants allowed into Canada, before announcing a sharp cut last year when concerns arose over the growing numbers of people and possible stress on housing and social services.\n\nCarney's budget significantly cuts targets for new temporary residents from 673,650 to 385,000 next year, and 370,000 in 2027 and 2028. There is also a one-time measure to speed the transition of up to 33,000 work permit holders to permanent residents.\n\nOther Trudeau-era policies now scrapped include the \"2 Billion Trees\" programme announced in 2019, which saw only around 160 million trees planted by late 2024, and the end of the 2022 luxury tax on vehicles and aircraft priced at more than C$100,000 and boats above C$250,000.\n\nThe latter \"was costing more to administer\" than it collected in tax revenue, Champagne said.\n\nThe Trump administration's trade war is hitting a broad range of Canadian businesses, as it imposes a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian goods not covered by a free trade agreement, along with sector-specific levies on steel, aluminium, lumber and automobiles.\n\nThe Carney government wants to spend C$5bn over the next five years to help these sectors, including C$1bn to fund a transition for the steel industry towards new lines of business.\n\nIt is also launching a loan facility, valued at C$10bn, intended to support \"otherwise successful Canadian businesses\" as they weather tariff-related storms. The first loan recipient is Algoma Steel Inc, an Ontario-based producer that has faced layoffs since the US tariffs were imposed.\n\nA proposed Buy Canadian Policy will also prioritise procuring Canadian goods and suppliers for government-funded projects.\n\nPart of Canada's response to the tariffs will be funded by revenue it has raised from its own countermeasures to US levies. As of October 2025, Canada has made $6.5bn in gross revenues from those measures, according to the budget."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmx4yjkzj4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:54:50.100+00:00","title":"Typhoon Kalmaegi: At least 85 killed in the Philippines as storm wreaks havoc","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi, locally named Tino, caused at least 85 deaths and displaced over 400,000 people in the Philippines, primarily in Cebu where over 49 fatalities occurred due to drowning from severe flooding.

the Philippines as storm wreaks havoc\n\nAt least 85   people have been killed while hundreds of thousands fled their homes as one of strongest typhoons this year ripped through the central Philippines, authorities say.\n\nTyphoon Kalmaegi has flooded entire towns on the most populated central island of Cebu, where at least 49 of the fatalities were located. There are 75 others missing and 17 injured, officials said on Wednesday.\n\nVideos show people sheltering on rooftops, while cars and shipping containers have been swept through the streets.\n\nThe official death toll, which is likely to rise, includes   six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island, south of Cebu, after it was   deployed to assist in relief efforts.\n\nThe aircraft went down on Tuesday near Agusan del Sur and was one of four sent to help.\n\n\"Communication with the helicopter was lost, which immediately prompted the launch of a search and rescue operation,\" the Philippine Air Force said. Later, a spokeswoman said six bodies had been recovered, believed to be of the pilot and crew.\n\nThe typhoon, locally named Tino, has weakened since making landfall early on Tuesday, but has continued to bring winds of more than 80mph (130km/h).\n\nIt is forecast to move across the Visayas islands region and out over the South China Sea by Wednesday.\n\nBut residents across Cebu province are still reeling from the deadly floods. More than 400,000 people have been displaced by the disaster, according to a report on Wednesday by the national disaster agency.\n\nJel-an Moira Servas, a business owner who lives in Mandaue city, told the BBC that she found herself waist-deep in water within minutes when her house became flooded. She quickly evacuated with her family, bringing only light items like food and electronics.\n\n\"Right now, the rain has completely stopped and the sun is out, but our houses are still filled with mud, and everything inside is in shambles,\" she said. \"We don't even know where to start cleaning. I can't even look at it without crying.\"\n\nRafaelito Alejandro, the deputy administrator at the Office of Civil Defence told local radio station DZMM that the current challenge for rescuers was clearing \"debris and cars on the road\".\n\nCarlos Jose Lañas, a volunteer rescuer, told the BBC that despite preparing for the worst case, they were caught off-guard by the extent of the flooding.\n\n\"This is the worst flood I've ever experienced,\" the 19-year-old said. \"Almost all the rivers here in Cebu overflowed. Even emergency responders did not expect this kind of scenario.\"\n\n\"The rescue operation was too overwhelming for the emergency responders around Cebu, because there were a lot of people asking for help.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post, Cebu governor Pamela Baricuatro described the disaster as \"unprecedented\".\n\n\"We were expecting the winds to be the dangerous part, but... the water is what's truly putting our people at risk,\" she said. \"The floodwaters are just devastating.\"\n\nBaricuatro declared a state of calamity in Cebu on Tuesday evening to facilitate disaster relief efforts.\n\nMost of the deaths were due to drowning, reports said. The storm has been sending torrents of muddy water down hillsides and into towns and cities.\n\nDamage to residential areas on Cebu was extensive, with many small buildings swept away and a thick carpet of mud left by the retreating floodwaters. Rescue teams took to boats to free people who were trapped inside their houses.\n\nDon del Rosario, 28, was among those in Cebu City who sought refuge on an upper floor as the storm raged.\n\n\"I've been here for 28 years, and this is by far the worst we've experienced,\" he told the AFP news agency.\n\nThe Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year.\n\nThe latest comes barely a month after back-to-back typhoons killed over a dozen people and wrought damage to infrastructure and crops.\n\nSuper Typhoon Ragasa, known locally as Nando, struck in late September, followed swiftly by Typhoon Bualoi, known locally as Opong.\n\nIn the months before, an extraordinarily wet monsoon season caused widespread flooding,  sparking anger and protests  over unfinished and sub-standard flood control systems that have been blamed on corruption.\n\nOn 30 September,  dozens were killed and injured  after a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines, with Cebu bearing the brunt of the damage.\n\nTyphoon Kalmaegi is forecast to move on to Vietnam, which is already seeing record-breaking rainfall.\n\nWith additional reporting by Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj41l1qpv7ko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"11:30:52.969+00:00","title":"Democrat Spanberger wins race for Virginia governor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democrat Abigail Spanberger has won the Virginia governor's race, becoming the first woman to hold the office, defeating Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears.

2025-11-05T09:15:41.693+00:00\n\nTitle: In Mamdani's New York win, India's Nehru finds an echo\n\n\"A moment comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new,\" Zohran Mamdani told a jubilant crowd in New York on Wednesday - quoting India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru's midnight speech of 1947, when the country  awoke to freedom.\n\n\"When an age ends and the soul of a nation finds utterance. Tonight we step out from the old to the new,\" Mamdani continued.\n\nAs Mamdani wrapped up his victory speech, the title track from the 2004 Bollywood hit Dhoom rang out across the hall - followed by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys' Empire State of Mind, now pulsing with new meaning as New York's first Indian-origin mayor made history.\n\nMonths earlier, Mamdani had turned  Bollywood into campaign language , a nod to his  South Asian roots - his mother is filmmaker Mira Nair, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, a Ugandan-born scholar of Indian descent. On Instagram, he's recorded several messages in Hindi, often relying on playful imagery and dialogues from popular Bollywood films.\n\nInvoking India's first prime minister on Wednesday was a final flourish.\n\nSeventy-seven years ago, Nehru, in a sweltering Constituent Assembly hall in Delhi, had prefaced the lines borrowed by Mamdani with one of the most stirring openings in history: \"Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially.\"\n\n\"At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.\"\n\nIt was just before midnight on 15 August 1947, and India was about to become independent after nearly two centuries of British rule. The words carried both elation and gravity - a promise of responsibility and of a nation finding its voice.\n\nMany believe Mamdani's nod to  Nehru's speech  held out the promise that something new, untested, and potentially transformative had begun in New York.\n\nDecades earlier, in another moment of awakening, Nehru had been evoking something far larger - a nation's rebirth.\n\nFreedom, Nehru continued, as not an end but a beginning - \"not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving\". The service of India, he insisted, meant serving \"the millions who suffer\" and ending \"poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity\".\n\nHe pledged that India's work would not be over \"so long as there are tears and suffering\", and urged unity over \"petty and destructive criticism\" to build \"the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell.\"\n\nThe roughly 1,600-word speech by India's first prime minister has gone down as one of the most famous speeches in history.\n\nThe New York Times said Nehru had \"electrified his countrymen with a speech of soaring eloquence\". Historian Ramachandra Guha called it a speech \"rich in emotion and rhetoric\". Srinath Raghavan, a historian, told an interviewer that the \"speech still resonates in India because it genuinely captured the moment in the way great speeches can\".\n\nThere were three main speakers that night: Chaudhry Khaliquz-zaman spoke for India's Muslims, Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a philosopher, for his eloquence and vision, and Nehru - the star of the evening.\n\nThe set-up of Nehru's speech was electric. Time magazine reported that Indian leaders had gathered in the Constituent Assembly Hall an hour before midnight. The chamber was \"ablaze with the colours of India's new tricolour flag - orange, white and green\". Nehru made what the magazine called an \"inspired speech\".\n\nWhat followed was pure theatre of history.\n\n\"And as the twelfth chime of midnight died out, a conch shell, traditional herald of the dawn, sounded raucously through the chamber. Members of the Constituent Assembly rose. Together they pledged themselves at this solemn moment . . . to the service of India and her people.\"\n\nOutside, Indians were rejoicing. In his book India After Gandhi, Guha quotes an American journalist reporting: \"Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs were happily celebrating together... It was Times Square on New Year's Eve. More than anyone else, the crowd wanted Nehru.\"\n\nBut beneath the euphoria, chaos and violence were already stirring. Across the subcontinent, religious riots broke out. Two days later, the borders were drawn - triggering one of history's largest and bloodiest migrations, as up to 15 million people moved and about a million died.\n\nAmid the upheaval, Nehru's words stood out - a reminder of India's unfulfilled promise, and of a leader whose command of language many believe matched the enormity of the moment.\n\nBy then, Nehru had gained a reputation as a formidable orator, delivering extempore speeches that ranged effortlessly across politics, science, art, and ethics. As Australian diplomat Walter Crocker observed, the breadth and spontaneity of his addresses were \"without parallel\".\n\nAs he concluded his most famous speech in August 1947, Nehru said: \"We have hard work ahead. There is no resting for any one of us till we redeem our pledge in full, till we make all the people of India what destiny intended them to be.\"\n\nSeven decades later, in New York, Mamdani has his own, rather different work cut out for him."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7emznr0nro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"12:26:17.946+00:00","title":"Migrant who returned to UK after removal sent back to France","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A migrant from Iran, who had been removed to France under the UK-France 'one-in, one-out' agreement, attempted to return to the UK by small boat and was detained and sent back.

shutdown has entered its 36th day, making it the longest period of time the American government has been closed.\n\nThe shutdown, which began 1 October, was prompted by the inability of Congress to agree to a new funding deal. It has left government workers without paycheque and millions of Americans without essential services.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have remained gridlocked for weeks without any signs of a compromise - though some glimmers of hope are beginning to show.\n\nMajority Leader John Thune, the Senate's top Republican, said his \"gut\" told him that a possible breakthrough might be on the horizon.\n\n\"I just think, based on, sort of, my gut of how these things operate, I think we're getting close to an off-ramp here,\" Thune said.\n\nThe previous government shutdown record happened during Donald Trump's first term as president and lasted 35 days before it ended in 2019.\n\nIn the weeks since this shutdown started, the impacts on everyday Americans has worsened.\n\nThousands of federal workers have already missed paycheques, and there are growing fears of increased impacts to air travel across the US as air traffic controllers and airport staff work without pay.\n\nOn Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox News that some areas of US airspace might have to be closed if the government shutdown continues. About 13,000 air traffic controllers, who are government employees, have been working without pay due to the shutdown.\n\n\"If you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos,\" Duffy said. \"You will see mass flight delays. You'll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"\n\nThe impacts have also been felt by low-income Americans who rely on government services.\n\nOne in eight people in the US are dependent on food assistance from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) but only a portion of that assistance is being paid out this month due to lapsed funding.\n\nThe Trump administration had - at first - said no Snap funds would be dispersed in November but a US court ordered that contingency funds be used to give people some assistance.\n\nSince that Monday ruling, Trump has indicated he may not listen to the judges.\n\n\"[Snap benefits] will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. The White House, though, has insisted the administration would follow the court's order.\n\nMembers of the Republian-controlled US Senate have repeatedly voted on the same short-term funding bill to reopen the government with no luck.\n\nThey tried again on Tuesday for the 14th time to no avail. The vote was 54-44, with no new Democrats crossing the aisle to approve it.\n\nThe proposal passed the House of Representatives in September.\n\nDemocrats have so far refused to support the short-term measure on government funding unless Republicans agreed to extend healthcare subsidies for low-income Americans. Republicans have resisted, accusing Democrats of holding the government hostage over unrelated policy priorities.\n\nIf there is a compromise reached, both chambers will have to pass the new legislation, because the initial House-passed bill only keeps the government funded and running until 21 November - a date that is quickly approaching and no longer makes sense, Thune said.\n\n\"If we don't start seeing some progress or some evidence of that by at least the middle of this week, it's hard to see how we would finish anything by the end of the week,\" Thune told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. \"And I think that would be the objective here, is to try and get something that we could send back to the House that would open up the government.\"\n\nIn recent days, there have been indications that some moderate Democrats and Republicans are eager to negotiate and find a deal ahead of Thanksgiving on 27 November."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4jyk9jyv3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"01:13:26.967+00:00","title":"Trump tariffs head to Supreme Court in case eagerly awaited around the world","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments over the legality of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which opponents argue violates the constitutional principle that only Congress can establish taxes.

to Supreme Court in case eagerly awaited around the world\n\nWhat may be the biggest battle yet in Donald Trump's trade war is about to begin.\n\nThe US Supreme Court is due to hear arguments over the legality of the Trump administration's tariffs, as a number of small businesses and a group of states contend most of them are illegal and should be struck down.\n\nIf the court agrees with them, Trump's trade strategy would be upended, including the sweeping global tariffs he first announced in April. The government would also likely have to refund some of the billions of dollars it has collected through the tariffs, which are taxes on imports.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's hearing, the justices will pore over the arguments and discuss the merits of the case, which could take months. Eventually they will hold a vote.\n\nTrump has described the fight in epic terms, warning a loss would tie his hands in trade negotiations and imperil national security.\n\nOn Sunday, the president said he will not attend the hearing in person as he did not want to cause a distraction.\n\n\"I wanted to go so badly... I just don't want to do anything to deflect the importance of that decision,\" he said. \"It's not about me, it's about our country.\"\n\nTrump previously said that if he does not win the case the US will be \"weakened\" and in a \"financial mess\" for many years to come.\n\nThe stakes feel just as high for many businesses in the US and abroad, which have been paying the price while getting whipped about by fast-changing policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs will cost Learning Resources, a US seller of toys made mostly overseas and one of the businesses suing the government, $14m (£10.66m) this year. That is seven times what it spent on tariffs in 2024, according to its CEO Rick Woldenberg.\n\n\"They've thrown our business into unbelievable disruption,\" he said, noting the company has had to shift the manufacturing of hundreds of items since January.\n\nFew businesses, though, are banking on a win at the court.\n\n\"We are hopeful that this is going to be ruled illegal but we're all also trying to prepare that it's setting in,\" said Bill Harris, co-founder of Georgia-based Cooperative Coffees.\n\nHis co-op, which imports coffee from more than a dozen countries, has already paid roughly $1.3m in tariffs since April.\n\nIn deciding this case, the Supreme Court will have to take on a broader question: How far does presidential power go?\n\nLegal analysts say it is hard to predict the justices' answer, but a ruling siding with Trump will give him and future White House occupants greater reach.\n\nSpecifically, the case concerns tariffs that the Trump administration imposed using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the White House has embraced for its speed and flexibility.   By declaring an emergency under the law, Trump can issue immediate orders and bypass longer, established processes.\n\nTrump first invoked the law in February to tax goods from China, Mexico and Canada, saying drug trafficking from those countries constituted an emergency.\n\nHe deployed it again in April, ordering levies ranging from 10% to 50% on goods from   almost every country in the world. This time, he said the US trade deficit - where the US imports more than it exports - posed an \"extraordinary and unusual threat\".\n\nThose tariffs took hold in fits and starts this summer while the US pushed countries to strike \"deals\".\n\nOpponents say the law authorises the president to regulate trade but never mentions the word \"tariffs\", and they contend that only Congress can establish taxes under the US Constitution.\n\nThey have also challenged whether the issues cited by the White House, especially the trade deficit, represent emergencies.\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties have asserted the Constitution gives them responsibility for creating tariffs, duties and taxes, as well.\n\nMore than 200 Democrats in both chambers and one Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski, filed a brief to the Supreme Court, where they also argued the emergency law did not grant the president power to use tariffs as a tool for gaining leverage in trade talks.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Senate made a symbolic and bipartisan move to pass three resolutions rejecting Trump's tariffs, including one to end the national emergency he declared. They are not expected to be approved in the House.\n\nStill, business groups said they hoped the rebuke would send a message to the justices.\n\nThree lower courts have ruled against the administration. After the Supreme Court hears arguments on Wednesday it will have until June to issue its decision, although most expect a ruling to come by January.\n\nWhatever it decides has implications for an estimated $90bn worth of import taxes already paid - roughly half the tariff revenue the US collected this year through September, according to Wells Fargo analysts.\n\nTrump officials have warned that sum could swell to $1tn if the court takes until June.\n\nIf the government is forced to issue refunds, Cooperative Coffees will \"absolutely\" try to recoup its money, said Mr Harris, but that would not make up for all the disruption.\n\nHis business has had to take out an extra line of credit, raise prices and find ways to survive with lower profits.\n\n\"This is an energy drain like I've never seen,\" said Mr Harris, who is also chief financial officer of Cafe Campesino, one of the 23 roasteries that own Cooperative Coffees. \"It dominates all the conversations and it just kind of sucks the life out of you.\"\n\nThe White House says that if it loses, it will impose levies via other means, such as a law allowing the president to put tariffs of up to 15% in place for 150 days.\n\nEven then, businesses would have some relief, since those other means require steps like issuing formal notices, which take time and deliberation, said trade lawyer Ted Murphy of Sidley Austin.\n\n\"This is not just about the money,\" he said. \"The president has announced tariffs on Sunday that go into effect on Wednesday, without advance notice, without any real process.\"\n\n\"I think that's the bigger thing for this case for businesses - whether or not that is going to be in our future,\" he added.\n\nThere is no clear sign of how the court will rule.\n\nIn recent years it has struck down major policies, such as Biden-era student loan forgiveness, as White House overreach.\n\nBut the nine justices, six of whom were appointed by Republicans, including three by Trump,   have shown deference to this president in other recent disputes and historically have given leeway to the White House on questions of national security.\n\n\"I really do think arguments are available for the Supreme Court to go in all different directions,\" said Greta Peisch, partner at Wiley and former trade lawyer in the Biden administration.\n\nAdam White, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he expected the court to strike down the tariffs, but avoid questions like what constitutes a national emergency.\n\nThe case has already complicated the White House's trade deals, such as one struck in July with the European Union.\n\nThe European Parliament is currently considering ratifying the agreement, which sets US tariffs on European goods at 15% in exchange for promises including  allowing in more US agricultural products.\n\n\"They're not going to act on this until they see the outcome of the Supreme Court decision,\" said John Clarke, former director for international trade at the European Commission.\n\nIn Switzerland, which recently downgraded its outlook for economic growth citing America’s 39% tariff on its goods, chocolatier Daniel Bloch said he'd welcome a ruling against the Trump administration.\n\nHis business Chocolats Camille Bloch is absorbing about a third of the cost of new tariffs on kosher chocolate that his firm has exported to the US for decades, aiming to blunt price increases and maintain sales. That decision has wiped out profits for the unit and is not sustainable, he said.\n\nHe hopes Trump will reconsider his tariffs altogether, because \"that would be easiest\".\n\n\"If the court were to make the tariffs go away of course we would see that as a positive sign,\" he said. \"But we don't trust that that will bring the solution.\"\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

newly elected mayor of New York City, is notable in many ways. He will become the city's youngest mayor since 1892, its first Muslim mayor and its first mayor born in Africa.\n\nThe 34-year-old entered the race last year with next to no name recognition, little money and no institutional party support.\n\nThat alone makes his victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa remarkable.\n\nBut more than that, he represents the kind of politician that many in the Democratic Party's left have been seeking for years.\n\nHe is young and charismatic, with his generation's natural comfort with social media.\n\nHis ethnicity reflects the diversity of the party's base. He hasn't shied away from a political fight and has proudly espoused left-wing causes - such as free childcare, expanded public transportation and government intervention in free market systems.\n\nMamdani has also shown a laser-like ability to focus on the kind of core economic issues that have been a priority for working-class voters who have drifted from the Democratic Party recently, but he hasn't disavowed the left's cultural principles.\n\nBut critics have warned that such a candidate is unelectable in broad swathes of America - and Republicans have gleefully held the self-avowed democratic socialist up as the far-left face of the Democratic Party. Still, on Tuesday night in New York City, he was a winner.\n\nBy running against and defeating Cuomo, a former New York governor who is himself the son of a governor, he has vanquished the entrenched Democratic establishment viewed by many on the left as woefully out of touch with their party and their nation.\n\nBecause of this, Mamdani's campaign for mayor has generated voluminous media attention, perhaps more than a municipal election, even one for America's largest city, deserves.\n\nIt also means that, as mayor, his successes - and failures - will be closely scrutinised.\n\nTwelve years ago, Democrat Bill de Blasio won his race for mayor on a platform of addressing New York City's economic and social inequalities. Like Mamdani, Americans on the left had high hopes that his administration would provide a national example of effective liberal governance.\n\nDe Blasio, however, departed office eight years later widely unpopular and with a mixed record of achievements as he struggled with the limits of his mayoral power to implement new policies.\n\nMamdani will have to grapple with those same limits - and those same expectations.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat, has already said she opposed raising the kind of taxes necessary to fund Mamdani's ambitious agenda.\n\nAnd even with sufficient funding, Mamdani would not be able to implement programmes unilaterally.\n\nHe campaigned as a sharp critic of the corporate and business elite that call New York City their home, and have made Manhattan the financial capital of the world. To effectively govern, he will probably have to make some form of peace with those interests, however - a process he has already begun in recent weeks.\n\nHe has also condemned Israel's conduct during the Gaza war and pledged to arrest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal if he sets foot in New York City, a promise that could be tested at some point during his term.\n\nAll those are problems for a later date, however. For now, Mamdani will need to set about the task of defining himself on the public stage - before his opponents do.\n\nWhile his campaign has generated national attention, he is still a blank slate for much of America.\n\nA recent CBS poll indicated that 46% of the American public were following the New York mayoral election \"not closely at all\". That provides both an opportunity and a challenge for Mamdani and the American left.\n\nConservatives from US President Donald Trump down will be trying to paint the newly elected mayor as a socialist menace, whose policies and priorities will bring ruin to America's largest city and present a danger if embraced by the nation as a whole.\n\nThey will amplify every stumble and highlight every negative economic indicator or crime statistic.\n\nTrump, who has a personal connection to New York, is sure to welcome a political tussle with Mamdani and he has a wealth of ways to complicate life for the new mayor.\n\nMamdani will also be pressed to win over Democratic leaders, like New York senator and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who never backed his campaign.\n\nThe opportunity for Mamdani, however, is that he is not burdened by his past, which his political opponents unsuccessfully tried to wield against him during the campaign.\n\nWhen he is inaugurated in January, he will have the chance to build his political reputation from scratch. And if Trump does feud with him, he will only give Mamdani a larger platform on which to work.\n\nHis political talent and abilities have taken him this far, which is no small feat. But that is nothing compared to the tests that await him in the years ahead.\n\nNew Yorkers like to think their city is the centre of the universe, but its mayoral race was not the only electoral contest taking place on Tuesday. In fact, in all likelihood it wasn't even Tuesday's best indication of the current electoral mood.\n\nBoth New Jersey and Virginia - states Democrat Kamala Harris narrowly carried against Trump in last year's presidential contest - held elections for governor. And in both cases, the Democrats won by more comfortable margins.\n\nOf the two, the New Jersey contest was closer. Yet the results suggest the inroads Trump made in the state last year among working class and minority voters did not hold up without the president's name on the ballot.\n\nUnlike Mamdani, Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger ran establishment-backed centrist campaigns with more modest policy prescriptions. All three, however, focused on affordability and cost-of-living issues. Exit polls showed the economy, once again, was the topic voters cared about most.\n\nWith Democrats on the left and centre winning on Tuesday, it may prove difficult for those looking to glean some insight on the kind of policies and candidates Democrats should advance to ensure future electoral success.\n\nLast week, however, Mamdani insisted there was plenty of room in the party for all kinds of viewpoints.\n\n\"I think this has to be a party that actually allows Americans to see themselves in it and not just be a mirror image of just a few people who are engaged in politics,\" he said.\n\n\"To me, what binds all of us together is who we are fighting to serve, and that is working people.\"\n\nThat view will be put to test next year, as Democrats across the nation head to the polls to select their candidates for the congressional midterm elections. Tensions are sure to mount and traditional fault lines could re-emerge.\n\nFor one night, however, the Democrats are one big, happy party."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp4dey32vo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"00:30:30.245+00:00","title":"Dr Xand: Five easy food swaps to improve your gut health","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr Xand offers a simple, cost-effective approach to improving gut health by recommending five easy food swaps focused on consuming fibre-rich whole foods like fruits and vegetables, instead of relying on expensive and unproven probiotic supplements such as drinks, shots, or powders.

the longest on record, and it is not clear when the budget stand-off between Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress will end.\n\nIt means that many - but not all - US government services are   temporarily suspended, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay.\n\nAlthough budget confrontations are common in US politics, this one is especially tense because President Donald Trump began drastically reducing the size of the national government as soon as he returned to office in January, and has threatened to use the current impasse to make further cuts.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats could not agree to pass a bill funding government services past 1 October, when the previous federal budget expired.\n\nIn the US system, Congress must approve a spending plan to send to the president to be signed into law.\n\nRepublicans currently control both chambers of Congress. But in the Senate - or upper chamber - they are short of the 60 votes needed to pass the spending bill, which gives opposition Democrats some negotiating power.\n\nDemocrats want the bill to include an extension of expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans and a reversal of Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people.\n\nDemocrats also oppose spending cuts to government health agencies.\n\nA stopgap bill designed to avoid the shutdown was passed in the House, or lower chamber, but did not clear the Senate.\n\nAnd so on 1 October, the US government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years.\n\nOn 5 November the stoppage entered its 36th day, eclipsing the 35-day shutdown which happened during Trump's first presidential term in 2018/2019.\n\nEnding the shutdown requires the two parties in the Senate to find a compromise that Trump will sign. Several votes aimed at reopening the government have failed.\n\nRepublicans say they want to negotiate the health insurance subsidies separately, and only pass what they call a \"clean resolution\".  The Trump administration has been unwilling to offer substantive concessions and believes the Democrats will bear the brunt of the public's blame.\n\nOn the other side, Democrats believe their efforts to secure cheaper healthcare are popular with voters. There is also pressure on congressional leaders to hold firm from the party's left wing, which believes they folded too quickly during the budget dispute in March 2025.\n\nHowever, analysts say there is some evidence that a number of moderate Democrats and Republicans are keen to reach a deal before Thanksgiving on 27 November.\n\nNot all aspects of government   stop during a shutdown. Services   deemed essential continue as normal, but most staff are not paid until the government reopens.\n\nBorder protection and law enforcement staff, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and in-hospital medical care workers are expected to operate as usual.\n\nHowever  many flights have been cancelled or delayed  because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are also expected to work without pay.\n\nThousands of government employees deemed non-essential have been furloughed - temporarily put on unpaid leave.\n\nUS troops were on track to miss their paycheck in mid-October until the Trump administration  identified funds to pay them . However, House Speaker Mike Johnson warned this was a \"temporary fix\" and future payments may not be made.\n\nMoney for Snap (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), commonly known as \"food stamps\", has also run out. The 41 million people enrolled in the programme were warned in late October that they would lose their food assistance.\n\nOn 3 November, the Trump administration said it would  partially fund the programme for the month using emergency funds , setting up another potential showdown before 1 December.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare cheques are still being distributed, although benefit verification and card issuance work may be interrupted.\n\nServices like federally funded pre-schools and institutions like the Smithsonian museums have been reduced or closed.\n\nSome major national parks and monuments across the country have closed, including Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay Area and the interior of the Washington Monument.\n\nDuring the previous shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019, parks were kept open with no staff, which led to vandalism and looting at a number of historical sites.\n\nMail is still being delivered and post offices are open because the US Postal Service does not depend on Congress for funding.\n\nMost American schools are state-funded, but the federal government is responsible for billions of dollars in grants and student loans, which could effectively come to a halt.\n\nHowever, because the grants are typically awarded during the summer, schools are expected to be largely unaffected during this shutdown, according to the education secretary.\n\nMembers of Congress are still being paid, a convention that has been criticised by some politicians.\n\nIn the past, lengthy government shutdowns were seen as politically dangerous to lawmakers and the current occupant of the White House, as they disrupted voters' everyday lives.\n\nHowever this time, the White House appears more than happy to shutter large parts of the US government for an extended period. Trump has threatened to break with the past practice of returning government operations to normal, bringing spending back to previous levels, and paying workers retroactively for the shutdown.\n\nSince January, his administration has already slashed government spending and sacked many federal workers, testing the boundaries of presidential power. Now he is seeking to permanently fire \"non-essential\" workers during the shutdown.\n\n\"We'll be laying off a lot of people,\"  Trump said on 30 September , the day before the shutdown began.\n\nThe administration has also warned that furloughed \"non-essential\" workers  may not receive their unpaid salary after the shutdown finishes .\n\nOn 7 October, Trump told reporters that back pay \"depends on who we're talking about\" and that some workers \"don't deserve to be taken care of\".\n\nMany lawmakers insist this is wrong, including the top Democrat in the US House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, who said: \"The law is clear - every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay, period.\"\n\nEarlier in October,  the administration's attempt to to lay off about 4,000 workers  was  temporarily blocked by a federal judge , but the White House is appealing against the ruling.\n\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically limited and temporary - similar to the disruption caused by a hurricane or major storm.\n\nBut it still causes problems. Approvals for loans and permits are delayed, as are reviews of potential stock listings.\n\nBy one estimate, $800m (£614m) in new federal contracts are not being awarded each day. Unlike government employees, contractors do not receive back pay once the shutdown ends, and many of the companies are small businesses without other big clients.\n\nOverall, analysts estimate this shutdown will knock roughly 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off economic growth for each week that it continues - about $15bn a week.\n\nBut those losses threaten to become more substantial - and harder to make up - the longer the shutdown lasts.  Analysts are worried the shutdown could hurt shopping and spending during the key holiday months of November and December.\n\nThere are also new possible economic factors in this shutdown, as Trump moves to fire workers or deny them backpay and cancels federally funded projects - all of which could extend or deepen any hit to the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspension of key releases of economic data, like the monthly jobs report, has added to uncertainty. Without basic information about how the country is faring, policymakers could be at risk of committing grave errors.\n\nShutdowns over budgets are a unique aspect of US politics.\n\nThey have become quite common over the past 50 years - with three taking place during Trump's first presidential term.\n\nThe last shutdown, which began in late December 2018, was brought about by disagreements over funding a wall on the Mexico border.\n\nIt finally ended in part because large numbers of air traffic controllers, who had been working for a month without pay, began calling in sick, as has started to happen during the current shutdown.\n\nAt the time, flight disruption quickly spread, and the shutdown came to an end shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  estimated that the 2018-2019 shutdown reduced economic output  by about $11bn, including $3bn that it never regained.\n\nBut shutdowns pre-date Trump.\n\nThe Republican Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his presidency in the 1980s - though all were relatively brief.\n\nFormer Democrat President Bill Clinton had a 21-day shutdown in 1995, while his fellow Democrat Barack Obama had a 16-day shutdown in 2013.\n\nDo you have questions about the US government shutdown?

Newsom, who has been viewed as a moderate liberal figure with a controversial past, repositioned himself by opposing Trump and embracing a confrontational tone, which earned him broad approval among progressive Democrats.

Gavin Newsom of California gave them one.\n\nCalifornia voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly supported Proposition 50, Mr. Newsom’s measure to create more Democratic congressional seats, countering a similar redistricting effort pushed by Mr. Trump in other states to protect Republican control of the House next year.\n\nThe result has sharply lifted Mr. Newsom’s political profile at a moment when he is considering running for president. And it has provided what many Democrats praised as a road map on how to fight for a party that remains adrift one year after Mr. Trump captured the White House.\n\n“It shows that he can get stuff done,” said the chairwoman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Christale Spain, who hosted Mr. Newsom on a swing through her state in July. She added, “Democrats want somebody to fight back. He’s pushing back and fighting back. That is what is helping him break through.”\n\nThe election has now freed Mr. Newsom, whose term as governor ends in January 2027, to turn his attention to elevating his presence on the national stage, presenting himself as a leader who scored a high-profile electoral win for Democrats at a bleak moment for the party.\n\nHe is planning to travel the country campaigning on behalf of Democratic congressional candidates. He has a forthcoming memoir to promote. And aides said he is likely to soon pivot to the issue of climate change and cast himself as a climate champion, drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe California results capped an evening of coast-to-coast victories by Democrats, including contests for mayor of New York, governor of Virginia and governor of New Jersey.\n\nThe outcome in California was never preordained. Mr. Newsom took a political risk: He was essentially asking voters to overturn, albeit temporarily, a measure they had passed 15 years ago requiring a nonpartisan commission to draw congressional district lines. He faced opposition from governmental reform groups and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor who had championed that initiative that created the commission. By the end, the opposition had walked off the field and Mr. Newsom’s win was so decisive that the race was called as soon as polls closed.\n\nMr. Newsom was in the carriage house of the governor’s mansion at that moment, watching returns with about two dozen friends and aides. A big cheer erupted as soon as CNN called the race in his favor, one of his aides said, and then Mr. Newsom headed for the California Democratic Party headquarters, where he addressed news cameras with a somber tone that lacked the typical election night celebrations.\n\nStanding between an American flag and a California flag, Mr. Newsom cast the result as a repudiation of Mr. Trump and a victory for Democrats in California and across the nation.\n\n“What a night for the Democratic Party — a party that is in its ascendancy, a party that’s on its toes, no longer on its heels,” the governor said.\n\nThe result marks a decided turn in Mr. Newsom’s fortunes. Just 18 months ago, he seemed in danger of being overshadowed by another California Democrat and sometimes-rival, Kamala Harris, the former vice president who had become the Democratic candidate for president after Joseph R. Biden Jr. dropped out of the race.\n\nHe was being disparaged by many leaders on the left for using his podcast to embrace and interview conservative supporters of Mr. Trump, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. He struck an initially conciliatory stance toward Mr. Trump, again roiling many in his party, going to the airport in Los Angeles to warmly greet the president on the tarmac when he flew there earlier this year to inspect the damage after devastating wildfires.\n\nBut Mr. Newsom began to methodically reposition himself this summer, after Mr. Trump took control of California’s National Guard and sent troops into Los Angeles. He began using social media to mimic and mock the president, in the process drawing approval from the left. His championing of Proposition 50 was the highest-profile evidence of his shift.\n\n“Six months ago, the strategy was to engage with MAGA leaders like Steve Bannon,” said Eric Jaye, a Democratic consultant in San Francisco who was an adviser to Mr. Newsom when he was mayor of San Francisco. “With the Proposition 50 victory, Newsom has made himself Donald Trump’s chief, and most successful, antagonist, and that is exactly what Democratic primary voters are looking for nationally.”\n\nThe road ahead is far from easy if he seeks the presidency.\n\nEven his allies say he carries significant political baggage. He’s a product of arguably the most liberal state in the country and a promoter of policies that are seen as out-of-touch with many voters. He has a personal style that at least some of his critics argue is slick and off-putting. And the backlash he generated following one incident during the pandemic has never fully subsided. Mr. Newsom attended a birthday dinner for a lobbyist-friend at The French Laundry, one of the most expensive restaurants in the world, and was photographed not wearing a mask, at a moment when he was telling Californians not to gather with their families for Thanksgiving.\n\nThis is a difficult time for California — struggling with the aftermath of the fires, a housing crisis and what many Republicans denounce as out of control spending — all of which Mr. Newsom’s opponents would seek to have him own in any presidential campaign.\n\nAnd even though voters approved Mr. Newsom’s redistricting measure, it could prove for naught if Republicans manage to hold on to the House, dimming the relevance of the victory on Tuesday.\n\n“While it’s a very important win for him politically, this is just the first step,” said Brian Brokaw, a Democratic strategist who advises Mr. Newsom. “Doing what he can to make sure that Democrats win those seats and take back the majority in the midterms will be just as important. Without that, Proposition 50 will have been just a blip along the way.”\n\nAnd Republicans have already made clear that no matter Mr. Newsom’s victory with Proposition 50, they would try to diminish his standing in California and nationally, and seek to derail his attempt to stake out a spot on the presidential stage.\n\n“Gavin Newsom wants to be president, but before chasing his next job, he’s got 12 months left to try and clean up the mess he made in California,” said Steve Hilton, a Republican and former Fox News host who’s running for governor. “Instead of running the state he’s been trying to rig our elections.”\n\nStill, it’s hard to recall a time when Mr. Newsom appeared in such a commanding political position. He raised $114 million for the redistricting campaign, including $38 million from supporters responding to text and email appeals, assembling the kind of small donor list that could prove critical in a presidential race. Much of that money came from outside California.\n\nThe result came not only at a pivotal time for Mr. Newsom but for his party, which believes it has a chance to win back Congress from Republicans. The new lines are expected to help Democrats win as many as five House seats now held by Republicans in California.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mr. Newsom spoke solemnly about a nation struggling through perilous times, in a speech that suggested the themes he will no doubt strike again in the coming months.\n\n“I hope it’s dawning on people, the sobriety of this moment — what’s at stake,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lqr30l246o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"04:22:02.632+00:00","title":"California redistricting: Prop 50 passes to give Democrats advantage","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California voters have passed Prop 50, a measure to redraw congressional district boundaries in favor of Democrats, in a response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas, North Carolina, Missouri, and Ohio.

2025-11-05T04:22:02.632+00:00\n\nTitle: California redistricting: Prop 50 passes to give Democrats advantage\n\nVoters in California have approved a measure to redraw political lines to favour Democrats - launching a counterattack against similar efforts by conservative-led states in a nationwide battle for control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nCBS projects that the redistricting measure, called Prop 50, passed.\n\nIt is aimed at reconfiguring the state's voting districts to give Democrats better chances at taking five House seats from Republicans during next year's midterm elections.\n\nWhether the measure will tip the balance of power in Washington remains unclear as more Republican-led states are also redrawing their voting lines under pressure from President Donald Trump.\n\nCurrently, Republicans hold a small, five-seat majority in the 435-member House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nIf Democrats win a majority in the chamber in the 2026 election, they will be able to stunt Trump's legislative agenda for at least the next two years and also lead congressional oversight of his administration - action that could range from investigations, complete with subpoenas, to impeachment.\n\nA look nationally shows the effort in Democrat-heavy California won't be enough on its own to cancel out gains by Republicans who have also redone voting maps. Four Republican-led states have already redrawn their lines so far this year, giving the party a likely advantage in nine new voting districts.\n\nStill, experts told the BBC that those changes to districts might not be enough for Republicans keep control of the House next November.\n\nThey are called midterm elections, where voters cast ballots for congressional candidates as well as state ones, because they take place in the middle of a president's four-year term. Historically, a president often loses power of at least one chamber in Congress in the midterms.\n\nThe Brookings Institution has found that the party of the president lost House seats in 20 of the last 22 midterm elections - going back to 1938.\n\n\"There are a lot of unknowns still and a lot can happen before the midterms politically, but looking at it historically - this is an uphill battle for Republicans,\" said Galen Sheely, research director for the State Voting Laws Roundup project, a collaboration between the Brennan Center for Justice and the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nRedistricting typically is done once every 10 years, to reflect population changes recorded by the US Census.\n\nRedrawing voting lines in the middle of the decade to try to engineer election gains is \"a new strategy that is pushing boundaries that haven't been pushed before\", Dr Sheely added.\n\nThe tit-for-tat redistricting battle started with Trump pressuring conservative-led states to redraw their congressional districts to help Republicans retain control of the House. Now, more than a dozen US states are openly mulling plans to redraw voting lines - known as political gerrymandering.\n\n\"Regardless of whether it's Democrats or Republicans, this is just not good for our republic in the long term,\" said Erik Nisbet, a professor at Northwestern University. \"The question now is where does this stop? It's political sabotage to our democracy.\"\n\nFrom his viewpoint, the battle runs the risk of both eroding trust in the government, with people seeing their votes and representation in Washington diminished, along with erasing battleground districts where members of both parties have equal shots at winning the seat.\n\nRepresentatives from those districts often are crucial to negotiating deals and finding middle ground - things that have become harder in Congress amid a bitter political divide, he said.\n\n\"It's hard to not mention the ongoing government shutdown in this,\" he added. \"This will worsen polarisation and gridlock in Congress. And the ripple effect of that will mean emboldening this president and future presidents to act unilaterally without Congress.\"\n\nTrump, who began his redistricting push with Texas, has argued that he and Republicans are entitled to more congressional seats due to him winning those states in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nTexas responded to Trump's call by redoing its maps to give Republicans an advantage in five new seats. And in turn, California Democrats introduced Prop, short for \"Proposition\", 50.\n\nCalifornia's governor, Democrat Gavin Newsom, a Trump foe with reported presidential ambitions, championed Prop 50. He is now pushing Democrats to follow his lead and fight fire with fire - something he argues the party hasn't been willing to do in the past.\n\n\"These folks don't play by the rules,\" he has said of Republicans. \"If they can't win playing the game with the existing set of rules, they'll change the rules. That's what Donald Trump has done.\"\n\nHigh-profile Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Rep Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Kamala Harris helped fundraise and generate support for the measure across the country.\n\nCampaigns in support of the measure and against it received $200m total, but Democrats far outraised Republicans, with Newsom telling donors last week that they could stop sending in money.\n\nIf other states do not join in, though, the proposition and its momentum may not lead to a significant change in the House.\n\nWhile it could help score five seats for Democrats, more and more Republican-led states are also changing their maps.\n\nNorth Carolina, Missouri and Ohio have all passed new maps that give Republicans a new edge. Utah has also passed a new map, which would give Democrats an advantage in one district, but it is under legal review.\n\nEach state decides its voting districts differently and many Republican-led states have had an easier time changing their maps, due to their state laws, election deadlines, current districts or political leadership.\n\nTexas, for instance, created its new districts through the state legislature.\n\nCalifornia, though, needed voter support to change its political maps.\n\nUnder a state law intended to halt political gerrymandering, an independent commission usually sets California's voting districts once a decade. To deviate from that, the state had to call a special election, where Prop 50 was the only thing on the ballot, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $200m. The new Prop 50 maps will only be in use until 2030 when the commission will again redraw the districts.\n\nAs leaders in both liberal and conservative-leaning states look into redistricting, another factor is looming on the horizon, threatening to make an impact on the 2026 midterms: The  Supreme Court is currently reviewing a case  that - depending on the ruling - could drastically reshape how districts are drawn."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8vpe8g3l3o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"21:56:47.856+00:00","title":"What Trump took from Dick Cheney's political playbook","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article draws a direct political parallel between Dick Cheney, the former U.S. vice president who expanded executive powers after 9/11, and Donald Trump, who is currently employing similar tools of executive authority—such as military strikes, surveillance, and detention of non-citizens—to advance his agenda.

More than two decades later, Donald Trump is wielding the political levers Cheney constructed as a potent tool to advance his national priorities - even as the two men had nasty personal clashes over the direction of the Republican Party.\n\nCheney's experience in US government stretched back to Richard Nixon's White House, and he honed his theories of presidential powers over decades of experience in the corridors of power in Congress and during multiple Republican administrations.\n\nAs vice-president during the George W Bush administration, he used the Al-Qaeda attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon – the most consequential moment of American national unity and clarity of purpose since the Japanese Pearl Harbor attack of World War Two – to restructure the foundations of executive authority.\n\n\"Cheney freed Bush to fight the 'war on terror' as he saw fit, driven by a shared belief that the government had to shake off old habits of self-restraint,\" former Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman writes in Angler, his 2008 book on Cheney's time as vice-president.\n\nNow Donald Trump, who has inherited those expanded presidential powers, is using them to pursue his own political agenda. It's an agenda that has shocked portions of the American public the way Cheney's once did, but one that has, at times, run counter to the policies and priorities Cheney once endorsed.\n\nAnd while Trump cites \"national emergencies\" to justify his actions, there is nothing near the national unity or sense of crisis that gripped America in the wake of 9/11.\n\nDespite spending decades concentrating power in the White House, in the later years of his life Cheney warned of the danger Trump posed to the nation, particularly after Trump's attempts to challenge his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. In 2024, Cheney said he supported Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n\"There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" he said. \"As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.\"\n\nTrump, for his part, called Cheney \"the king of endless, nonsensical wars, wasting lives and trillions of dollars\".\n\nThe parallels between Cheney and Trump and their expansive deployment of presidential authority, however, stretch across the breath of the American political landscape - in the use of American military power overseas, the ability to detain and transport non-citizens, and in the development and expanded use of US surveillance power, including focusing on perceived domestic threats.\n\n\"The powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned,\" Stephen Miller, a long-time Trump adviser who is now deputy chief of staff, said during a television interview in 2017. It's a line that could have been spoken by Cheney when he was at the pinnacle of American politics.\n\nWhile Trump has renounced Cheney's interventionist foreign policy and the Iraq War he oversaw, he – like Cheney – has demonstrated a willingness to use American military power abroad in ways that often flout attempts at oversight.\n\nHe launched  bombing strikes on Iran in June , which he justified with warnings of a growing nuclear threat from a regional adversary, echoing the very reasoning Cheney used at the start of the 2003 Iraq war.\n\nIn recent months, Trump's administration has designated narcotics traffickers as \"enemy combatants\" and is  undertaking an ongoing campaign  of destroying suspected drug-running boats in international waters. The deadly military attacks are necessary, they say, to protect American national security.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post report, Trump's justice department has informed Congress that the White House does not need congressional approval to continue these strikes, despite requirements governing the use of force set out in the 1974 War Powers Resolution.\n\nCritics had accused Cheney's Bush administration of stretching the boundaries of the 2001 Authorisation of Military Force in the \"War on Terror\" to permit US military operations against suspected terrorists across the world. Now Trump is using similar means – drones and missiles – without even that slim cover of congressional approval.\n\nAnother key facet of Cheney's foreign policy was a reliance on \"extraordinary renditions\" of suspected terrorists captured abroad or on US soil in order to avoid US domestic courts from having jurisdiction over individual cases.\n\nThe Bush administration constructed a massive facility at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba in order to indefinitely hold those individuals and struck deals with foreign governments to operate \"black sites\" where interrogations could be conducted without judges weighing in on the legality of the activities.\n\nDuring his second term in office, Trump has taken similar steps to avoid judicial review of his efforts to detain and deport undocumented migrants on US soil. He has expanded the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay to house deportees and struck deals with foreign governments to receive deported individuals.\n\nWhile some US courts have issued injunctions to stop the removals, they have had limited ability to review the merits of such actions.\n\n\"The constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal,\" Trump's lawyers argued in one case before the US Supreme Court.\n\nTrump has also threatened to use domestic surveillance and investigatory capabilities of the US Department of Justice that Cheney enhanced and expanded more than 20 years ago to combat what he has called \"the enemy within\".\n\nWhile the Bush administration used these powers to infiltrate Muslim communities suspected of harbouring extremist views, Trump has called for a national crackdown on the loosely organised left-wing Antifa movement, which he says has resorted to violence in its demonstrations against the president's right-wing policies.\n\nThe government's surveillance powers have also been focused on foreign nationals with legal authorisation to enter the US – revoking residency permits and work visas for those the administration has deemed to hold anti-American or antisemitic views.\n\nWithin hours after Cheney's death on Tuesday, flags at the White House were lowered to half staff - a display of national mourning mandated by federal law. The move, however, obscures the dramatic rift that had formed between the conservative old guard of Cheney's era and the new Republican Party that Trump has fashioned in his image.\n\nWhile tributes to the late vice-president have rolled in at a steady pace, Trump has been notably silent.\n\nThe current president hasn't hesitated to criticise Cheney and his interventionist foreign policy views in the past, however. And he frequently clashed with Cheney's daughter, Liz, who became a vocal critic of Trump and in 2021 served as vice-chair of the congressional panel investigating his conduct during the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.\n\nTrump and Cheney stood at loggerheads in the more than a decade since the latter left public office for the final time. Those clashes, however, were about policies and personality. On the power of the presidency – the scope of executive authority and the necessity for the White House to act forcefully when required – they were singing from the same hymnal.\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

But a financial crime investigator told the BBC he believes it goes much wider.\n\nThe Home Office said it will investigate the BBC's findings.\n\nReacting to our investigation, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, said: \"Illegal working and linked organised criminality creates an incentive for people to come here illegally. We will not stand for it.\"\n\nFor the first time, we can reveal the inner workings of a criminal system that lets asylum seekers work in plain sight on UK High Streets, in mini-marts that mainly profit from illegal cigarettes and vapes.\n\nOne man told us weekly takings from illicit tobacco at his shop could be \"sometimes, up to £3,000\".\n\nThe men who facilitate it all - so-called \"ghost directors\" - each have dozens of businesses listed on Companies House but in many cases are not involved in running them.\n\n\"The shop doesn't belong to me, it's just under my name,\" one of them told our undercover reporters.\n\nMany of the businesses are dissolved after about a year, and then re-opened with small changes to official paperwork.\n\nThese businesses have \"all the red flags\" associated with organised criminality, a financial crime investigator told the BBC.\n\nDuring our investigation we found:\n\nThe two Kurdish journalists involved in our investigation know that tensions over immigration are high. They worry that such coverage of illegal activities within the Kurdish community could inflame hostilities.\n\nOne of them is a former asylum seeker himself, and says \"I wanted to play a role in uncovering these illegal activities [...] to say loudly that they don't represent us.\"\n\nOver four months, we monitored a Kurdish Facebook group where businesses across the UK were listed for sale.\n\nNew adverts popped up every week.\n\nThe reporters got in touch with three people who listed mini-marts for sale in Crewe, Hull and Liverpool. They said they were interested in running a mini-mart and trading illegal cigarettes.\n\nIn Cheshire, the man running a Crewe mini-mart called Top Store said he would sell his shop to one reporter for £18,000 cash.\n\nThe shopkeeper, who went by the name Surchi, assured our journalist that \"you don't need anything\" to own and run a mini-mart as an asylum seeker.\n\nSurchi told us he was himself a Kurdish asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK in 2022, but whose claim had been refused.\n\nWhen the BBC later confronted him, he told us he had paperwork proving his right to work. We asked if he could show us these documents, but he hasn't provided them.\n\nAsylum seekers generally do not have the right to work in the UK while their claim is being processed. Permission to work is only granted in limited circumstances and is subject to strict conditions.\n\nIf asylum seekers are granted permission to work, they can only apply for eligible jobs on the Immigration Salary List.\n\nThese do not include being a shop manager or shop assistant.\n\nLike our undercover reporters, Surchi told us he was from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, an area that straddles the borders of Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The region is often referred to as Kurdistan, but it is not an independent country.\n\nTo avoid scrutiny by the authorities, Surchi said he paid someone called \"Hadi\" about £250 a month to be named on official papers.\n\n\"That's his job and he probably has 40 to 50 shops under his name. There's no problem, he doesn't mind what you sell,\" he explained.\n\nThis arrangement let Surchi go under the radar of immigration enforcement and sell whatever he liked. He said he had never paid any council tax and that our undercover reporter would not need to officially register the company.\n\nImmigration enforcement officers had only come by once in the past five years, when he was out, Surchi said during his sales patter. They never returned, he said.\n\nTrading Standards had raided the shop once, Surchi said, and he had been given a £200 fine for selling illegal cigarettes and vapes.\n\nShop owners in the UK caught selling these items can be fined up to £10,000, but the profits that can be made from such products far outweigh the penalties.\n\nDuring a tour of the premises, Surchi took us outside to a so-called \"stash car\" where he said he hid the bulk of his stock until 17:00 each night, when Trading Standards officers finished for the day.\n\nHe also told our reporter that \"you could make a hiding spot\" for the stock in the shop's basement - where he also showed how he tampered with the electricity meter to avoid paying utility bills.\n\nSurchi sold vapes to a group of teenagers while we were at the shop. \"I have customers that are 12 years old, I don't have any problem with them,\" he said.\n\nCustomers paid via a card machine into a bank account, he explained. Both of these belonged to his cousin, he said, who owned a mini-mart 15 miles away in Stoke.\n\nOn Facebook, we discovered Kurdish builders willing to help us conceal illegal vapes and cigarettes.\n\nOne of our reporters posted that he had bought a mini-mart in Manchester and was looking for \"a specialist to build a space to hide cigarettes in the shop\".\n\nSix builders got in touch. One sent us a video of what looked like a vending machine for illegal cigarettes hidden in a loft, which, at the press of a button, pinged packets down a chute to a concealed vent below.\n\nIt was \"fine craftsmanship\" and cost £6,000, the builder said, claiming it was guaranteed to fool Trading Standards' sniffer dogs.\n\nAs we delved deeper into who officially owned these mini-marts, a network of ghost directors began to emerge.\n\nOne name that kept coming up was Hadi Ahmad Ali - the Birmingham man to whom Surchi told us he was paying his monthly fee. We found Mr Ahmad Ali listed on Companies House as being from Iraq, in his 40s and a director of more than 50 other businesses - mini-marts, barbers and car washes.\n\nOne of our reporters phoned him pretending to be an asylum seeker looking to buy the Crewe business to sell illegal cigarettes. Mr Ahmad Ali said the shop didn't belong to him but the lease was under his name. He confirmed he could keep it in his name for our undercover reporter, for a fee of between £250 and £300 a month.\n\nHe also said he could try to provide a bank card for the shop.\n\n\"I will give you a 50% guarantee that I can get you a bank card. I have another six to seven shops under my name in Hull and other places.\"\n\nMr Ahmad Ali is still listed as an active director on several businesses on Companies House. We later learned that in October 2024 he had been disqualified from being a company officer for five years.\n\nThe ban followed illegal cigarette sales at a shop in his name in Chorley, Lancashire - including to a 16-year-old.\n\nSeparately, he pleaded guilty to his involvement in the sale of illegal cigarettes in Lincolnshire and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months.\n\nWhen later confronted by the BBC, Mr Ahmad Ali told us these mini-marts were nothing to do with him, and he had contacted Companies House to get his name removed from the businesses.\n\nA spokesperson for Companies House said it \"now has greater powers to share information and support law enforcement investigations\".\n\n\"Where criminality is suspected, information and intelligence are shared with relevant partners.\"\n\nOur research linked Mr Ahmad Ali to another man, Ismael Ahmedi Farzanda, who we found was a ghost director and responsible for 25 mini-marts.\n\nMr Farzanda's name came up because Companies House filings showed he had taken over as company director from Mr Ahmad Ali at seven mini-mart businesses. The pair also shared a co-directorship on one shop in Blackpool.\n\nOne of our reporters managed to call Mr Farzanda, using the same cover story as he had told Mr Ahmad Ali.\n\n\"I just put the shops under my name for people,\" said Mr Farzanda who, like Mr Ahmad Ali, was based in the West Midlands. He told us an \"accountant\" would take care of the paperwork, bank accounts and payments to him, and that he would have no problem with us selling illegal cigarettes.\n\nThe only request he had was that if the undercover reporter was ever caught by the police, he should let him know immediately.\n\n\"If you know you're caught, tell us so that for the interviews we can change the name and not get in trouble,\" he told our reporter.\n\nMr Farzanda was fined £4,500 in August after one shop, registered in his name in Haslingden, Lancashire, was caught selling illegal vapes to a 14-year-old, according to local media reports.\n\nSeventeen shops registered under the names of Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda have been raided since 2021 with illegal tobacco and vapes seized, Trading Standards sources confirmed.\n\nDespite being registered on official documents as being from Iran, Mr Farzanda told our undercover reporter he was actually from the Sharazoor district in neighbouring Iraq.\n\nBoth our undercover reporters say they are aware of Kurdish people who have arrived in the UK on small boats and pretended to be Iranian, believing their asylum claims would have a better chance of success.\n\nWhen later presented with our evidence, Mr Farzanda denied all the allegations put to him by the BBC.\n\nWhen we looked into the official records attached to all the companies listed for Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda, a suspicious pattern emerged.\n\nWe found companies would be set up for a year, dissolved, and then set up again - each time with a slightly different spelling of the businesses' names. The men's names and birthdays would also be changed slightly.\n\n\"Why are they doing that? It's most likely to evade tax and to dodge scrutiny by authorities,\" said financial crime investigator Graham Barrow, when we showed him our data.\n\nWe have also confirmed details of two further ghost directors - with 40 companies listed between them.\n\nThis UK-wide network of more than 100 company directorships in the names of just four individuals has \"all the red flags that I would associate with organised criminal networks\", said Mr Barrow.\n\nThe network of businesses identified by the BBC could stretch even wider across the country, said Mr Barrow: \"I certainly think it's hundreds. It could easily be bigger than that,\" he said.\n\nWe visited more than a dozen mini-marts linked to this network of ghost directors.\n\nEverywhere we went, it was the same story - the shops were on rundown High Streets in some of the UK's most deprived areas, such as Blackpool, Bradford, Huddersfield and Hull.\n\nAll but one of the shops sold counterfeit or smuggled cigarettes for about £4 per pack, instead of the average UK price of £16 for a pack of 20.\n\nAs well as Surchi's story in Crewe, our investigation revealed details of other Kurdish asylum seekers being employed illegally.\n\nA mini-mart worker in a Blackpool shop linked to one of the ghost directors told us he had left an asylum-seeker hotel in Liverpool to work 14-hour days at the shop. \"In return I get £60 to £65 [per day],\" he told us. \"For three months, I worked for £50 [per day].\"\n\nHe was interviewed by the Home Office four months ago, he said, but hasn't heard anything since. The shop had been raided by Trading Standards three times, he told us - but he described that as \"nothing\".\n\n\"Just give them any name and they will walk away,\" he explained, saying that whenever he was asked who he was, he would give the name of a famous Kurdish singer, Aziz Waisi.\n\nHe did say he was worried by immigration enforcement, however. \"They [Trading Standards] take the cigarettes and leave, but immigration makes you do fingerprints.\"\n\nWe also found another Kurdish shopworker in a Salford shop registered under Ismaeel Farzanda's name, who said he was in limbo. \"I've been here for six months and I still haven't claimed asylum,\" he said.\n\nThe 42-year-old said he had first come to the UK as a teenager, before returning to Kurdistan.\n\nHe said he returned to the UK this year and \"they found my previous fingerprint records but nothing came of it\". He said he was staying with friends.\n\n\"Honestly, we're all struggling here and don't know what to do.\"\n\nThe government says it has increased raids by 51% and this year raised the fines for businesses to £60,000 per person found working illegally.\n\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood added that the government has \"seized millions of pounds worth of unlicensed goods, banned dodgy directors and removed more than 35,000 people with no right to be in the UK.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Phill Edwards and Kirstie Brewer"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/podcasts/the-headlines/mamdani-democrats-mayor-nyc.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:00:15-05:00","title":"Mamdani’s Historic Win, and Democrats’ Big Night Nationwide","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers multiple significant events across the United States and globally: a historic Democratic victory in New York City mayoral elections, a prolonged government shutdown under Trump-related threats, a deadly UPS cargo plane crash in Louisville, a legal scandal in Israel involving allegations of abuse, and a Native community’s urgent efforts to preserve history in Alaska due to severe weather.

lady New York City has ever had - thrust into the spotlight as her husband Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral race on Tuesday night.\n\nAnd in his victory speech, the mayor-elect had a special shoutout for his wife standing beside him.\n\n\"And to my incredible wife, Rama, hayati,\" he said, using the Arabic word for \"my life\". \"There is no one I would rather have by my side in this moment, and in every moment.\"\n\nDuwaji is a New York-based artist with Syrian roots whose work often explores Middle Eastern themes. Her work has appeared on BBC News, and in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Vice and London's Tate Modern museum.\n\n\"Rama isn't just my wife; she's an incredible artist who deserves to be known on her own terms,\" Mamdani wrote in a post on 12 May, announcing they had been married three months earlier.\n\n\"Omg she's real,\" Duwaji joked in a comment on that post.\n\nThe couple met on dating app Hinge, \"so there is still hope in those dating apps,\" Mamdani said in an interview with The Bulwark.\n\nUntil recently she was rarely seen during her husband's  election campaign, leading opponents to claim that the 33-year-old state assemblyman was \"hiding\" his wife.\n\nHer absence was notable, given that US candidates often put their spouses on full display to show off their commitment to family values.\n\nMamdani addressed the criticism over his wife's absence in his May post, which included a series of photos showing their marriage at the New York City Clerk's office.\n\n\"If you take a look at Twitter today, or any day for that matter, you know how vicious politics can be,\"  he wrote .\n\n\"I usually brush it off, whether it's death threats or calls for me to be deported. But it's different when it's about those you love.... You can critique my views, but not my family.\"\n\nDuwaji opted to stay out of the spotlight - even as her husband's profile ballooned - but is said to have been a driving force behind the scenes, according to CNN.\n\nShe was among those who finalised Mamdani's brand identity, including the bold iconography and font used on his yellow, orange and blue campaign materials, it said.\n\nDespite largely steering clear of the cameras, several of Duwaji's friends have gushed about her in interviews amid speculation about her role in a Mamdani administration.\n\n\"She's our modern day Princess Diana,\" one friend, Hasnain Bhatti, declared to the New York Times last month.\n\nOthers described Duwaji as being excited but overwhelmed by the growing attention, the NY post reported.\n\nDuwaji graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University before earning a master's degree in illustration from the School of Visual Arts in New York City.\n\n\"Using drawn portraiture and movement, Rama examines the nuances of sisterhood and communal experiences,\" Ms Duwaji's professional website reads.\n\nMuch of her work is in black and white, and depicts scenes from the Arab world. Ms Duwaji herself was born in Texas and is ethnically Syrian, a campaign spokesman told the New York Times.\n\nIn 2022, her works appeared in the BBC World Service documentary  \"Who killed my grandfather\"  that investigated the assassination of a Yemeni politician in 1974.\n\nSome of her works listed on Instagram criticise \"American imperialism,\" what she called Israeli war crimes and denounce the \"ethnic cleansing\" of Palestinians, mirroring some of her husband's policy positions. Israel emphatically denies accusations of genocide in Gaza.\n\nHer works also show support for  Mahmoud Khalil , a Columbia University graduate that the Trump administration is seeking to deport over claims that his work advocating for Palestinians amounts to \"antisemitism\" towards Jews.\n\nThe Brooklyn-based artist spent most of the coronavirus pandemic in Dubai, where her family lives, she said in an April interview with website  YUNG .\n\nIn that interview, she was asked about recent events in the Middle East, the return to the White House of Donald Trump and sharp uptick in immigration raids.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, things are dark right now in NYC,\" she said. \"I worry for my friends and family, and things feel completely out of my hands.\"\n\n\"With so many people being pushed out and silenced by fear, all I can do is use my voice to speak out about what's happening in the US and Palestine and Syria as much as I can,\" she added.\n\nShe was also asked about the responsibly that artists have to speak out about global issues.\n\n\"An artist's duty as far as I'm concerned is to reflect the times,\" she said, quoting musician Nina Simone.\n\n\"I believe everyone has a responsibility to speak out against injustice, and art has such an ability to spread it,\" she continued.\n\n\"I don't think everybody has to make political work, but art is inherently political in how it's made, funded, and shared. Even creating art as a refuge from the horrors we see is political to me. It's a reaction to the world around us.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/democratic-party-mamdani.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"01:16:27-05:00","title":"The Democrats Just Took a Big Step Toward Getting Their Groove Back","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After a demoralizing loss in the 2024 election, the Democratic Party has demonstrated a resurgence in the 2025 elections, winning key offices including governors in Virginia and New Jersey, the mayor of New York City, and a major California ballot initiative that could yield five House seats.

Democrats showed that their demoralized party — which spent the past year mired in self-recriminations and soul-searching — could still accomplish the most important goal in politics.\n\nThey can win. And win big.\n\nThe decisive victories for governor in Virginia and New Jersey and mayor of New York City and a major ballot initiative in California — which is likely to yield as many as five House seats for Democrats next year — demonstrated crucial signs of life for a party that was soundly defeated in all seven presidential battleground states, lost control of the Senate and failed to win the House just a year ago.\n\nThe results showed a level of determination and energy among Democratic voters that was missing in that 2024 election. This time, their candidates were stronger, their campaigns focused intensely on affordability and an intense desire to deal a blow to President Trump. If the huge No Kings protests last month were the shot, Tuesday’s election was the chaser, with Democrats showing once more that they could turn out to deliver a powerful vote when Mr. Trump is in the White House.\n\nYet for all the invigoration that success brings, the Democratic Party still hasn’t coalesced around a coherent political identity or a clear electoral playbook that can win in swing states and safe states alike. The results on Tuesday suggest that an intraparty battle may be looming for the Democrats as they get ready for difficult House and Senate midterm elections in 2026 and a wide-open presidential primary contest in 2027 and 2028.\n\nAre they more competitive as a centrist party in the mold of Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, the moderate new governors-elect of New Jersey and Virginia, both of whom focused their campaigns on attacking Mr. Trump rather than offering bold new ideas? Or is the party better positioned to make gains with a populist vision like that of Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who won New York’s mayoral election with a sweeping critique of the excesses of capitalism and the promise of defeating the old guard of Democratic politics?\n\nProminent Democratic leaders want to have it both ways, saying on Tuesday that it’s time for a new era of “big tent” politics within the party, accommodating both Mr. Mamdani’s fellow progressives and center-left establishment Democrats. These leaders think the key for Democrats — and a lesson from Tuesday’s results — is combining winning issues like the high cost of living with a be-everywhere, be-authentic style of campaigning and communicating, while focusing less on policies and litmus tests that divide the party.\n\n“What works in Manhattan will not work in Virginia, and what works in Virginia won’t work in Michigan — and that’s all right,” said Senator Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from the swing state of Michigan, which Mr. Trump won in 2024. “Winning in different places around the country with very different voters and experiences should be celebrated, not attacked.”\n\nPete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020 and the transportation secretary under President Biden, said that Tuesday’s wins — in disparate parts of the country with diverse electorates — demonstrated that the party “can only succeed if it’s a big coalition.”\n\n“What this is showing is that we can have candidates who have different prescriptions and different styles,” Mr. Buttigieg said. “To me, kind of by definition, if they’re all succeeding, the big lesson isn’t about going one way or the other in a national fight. The big lesson is to focus on the things that matter most to voters.”\n\nBut even in victory, the Democrats remain a party teeming with tensions over age, ideology, tactics and tone, and they are still rebuilding their damaged brand. Democrats already appear headed into fierce ideological clashes in Maine, Michigan and Texas, where primary fights between more progressive candidates and establishment Democrats are underway.\n\n“There will now be a battle within the Democratic Party between the people who will point to Spanberger and Sherrill as models for the kinds of campaigns we need to run, and Mamdani as a model for a different kind of politics,” said Howard Wolfson, a former deputy mayor of New York City and a Democratic strategist. “What it all comes down to is the Democrats need to figure out who they want their standard bearers to be in 2026 and 2028.”\n\nAt times, the bickering in Democratic backrooms, strategy sessions and text chains over Mr. Mamdani alone has exploded into the public domain.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont progressive, heralded him as “the future of the Democratic Party.” When asked if he agreed, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader and a New York Democrat, quickly rejected the idea, after endorsing Mr. Mamdani only just before early voting had begun. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader and another New Yorker, declined to endorse Mr. Mamdani.\n\nThere are also signs that those in a frustrated liberal wing may channel some of their frustration about the Trump administration against their own leaders in the 2026 midterms, as Republicans did during the 2010 midterms when an insurgent Tea Party movement created contentious party primaries across the country.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul of New York felt that anger from the stage at a recent rally for Mr. Mamdani, as progressive voters drowned out her remarks with chants of “Tax the rich!” Mr. Mamdani ended the shouts by appearing on the stage besides Ms. Hochul, who had endorsed his campaign, and clasping her hand high.\n\nBut he has not publicly pledged to support Ms. Hochul in her re-election bid next year.\n\n“It’s an incoherent squabble that will not become orderly until we have a nomination fight,” said Matt Bennett, the founder of Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank based in Washington, referring to the 2028 presidential race. “When you are out of power, parties are all over the place.”\n\nWhether the party becomes entangled in such fractious debates, or unites in an ongoing single-mindedness to repudiate Mr. Trump and Republicans, remains to be seen. What is clear is that the 2026 midterms will play out amid a wave of redistricting efforts across the country that are likely to give Republicans an advantage in an already contested House map. And to win back control of the Senate, Democrats must confront a landscape largely fought in states that Mr. Trump carried by at least 10 percentage points in 2024.\n\nStill, even with an uncertain future, the Democrats got a much-needed psychological boost on Tuesday night. In New Jersey, Ms. Sherrill blew past the three-point margin that Gov. Phil Murphy notched in 2021 against Jack Ciattarelli, the same Republican opponent she faced. Democratic turnout was more than 20 percent higher than in that race.\n\nIn Virginia, the Democratic wave was so strong that it even boosted Jay Jones, the party’s nominee for attorney general, to victory, overcoming the damage from a series of violent text messages Jones sent in 2022.\n\nAnd in New York City, Mr. Mamdani captured large swaths of the city and was poised to win more than 50 percent of the vote — a significant level of support in a multicandidate race with the highest voter turnout in more than half a century.\n\nDemocrats benefited in part from Mr. Trump’s demands of fealty from Republican candidates in states where a majority of voters disapprove of how he’s handling his job as president. Ms. Sherrill, who spent much of her campaign labeling her opponent the “Trump of Trenton,” seemed mystified by his continued allegiance to the president.\n\n“It’s pretty shocking that the Republican Party is so coalesced behind Trump that even a candidate here in New Jersey is completely going against the interests of New Jersey in defense of the president,” Ms. Sherrill said in an interview late last week.\n\nBut some Democratic strategists say such a Trump-focused strategy has limitations, given that many independents and swing voters, and even some Democrats, have dim views of their party.\n\n“There’s mounting evidence that voters want to fire Donald Trump and the people loyal to him, but we still have more to do convince people to hire us,” said Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist with experience in Virginia. “Voters right now feel like their government is betraying them and it’s costing them. We have to be not just the response to that but the antidote.”\n\nFor years, Democrats have prevailed in elections when Mr. Trump is not on the ballot because their coalition has become more reliable as voters in nonpresidential races. Winning in swing states and presidential years will require rebuilding their identity in ways that connect with the concerns of broader swaths of voters.\n\nThe three major Democratic candidates on Tuesday all offered the kind of laser-sharp focus on affordability that many Democrats believe will form the start of a road map back to power.\n\nMr. Mamdani organized his campaign and message around lowering the costs of rent, child care, groceries and bus fare for New Yorkers and particularly the city’s working class. Ms. Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on her first day in office to freeze electricity prices. And Ms. Spanberger made economic issues a centerpiece of her candidacy, vowing to tackle the high costs of health care, housing and energy in a state hit particularly hard by the federal government shutdown.\n\nMr. Mamdani, Ms. Sherrill and Ms. Spanberger also benefited from showing independent streaks and a willingness to break with party leaders, which strategists said had helped them build winning coalitions despite their party’s record-low approval ratings.\n\nWhether Democratic leaders are willing to make space for a wide range of ideologies within the party — not to mention debate and dissent — is an open question that the 2026 midterms will shed light on.\n\nStanding amid cheering supporters at Mr. Mamdani’s victory party, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive leader from New York, implied that Democratic officials might have little choice.\n\n“We have a future to fight for, and we’re either going to do that together or you’re going to be left behind,” she said in an interview on MSNBC. “It’s not about progressive. It’s not moderate, it’s not liberal. This is about do you understand the assignment of fighting fascism right now? And the assignment is you come together across difference no matter what.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/mamdani-muslim.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:01:53-05:00","title":"Would New York City Elect a Muslim Mayor?

An Emphatic Yes.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-05T05:01:53-05:00\n\nIt was one of the first unconventional things Zohran Mamdani did campaigning for mayor of New York: jumping inside the halal carts.\n\nStanding in his suit by the grills, as vendors chopped chicken and fried falafel, he interviewed them about the problem of “halal-flation,” as he called it — why plates of rice and meat now cost $10 instead of $8 — and asked how he could help.\n\nAt first, many Muslims wondered, “Would New York City elect a Muslim mayor?” said Mohamed Attia, the managing director of the Street Vendor Project who helped connect the candidate with the carts. But, Mr. Attia added, the vendors were inspired, and praise of Mr. Mamdani spread to their customers and to the mosques.\n\nOn Tuesday, the city for the first time answered the question with a resounding yes.\n\nWith his election, Mr. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democrat, has defied anti-Muslim backlash to his candidacy and shattered a barrier that seemed insurmountable since the Sept. 11 terror attacks transformed what it meant to be Muslim in the city. While there are four Muslims in Congress and a few Muslim mayors of smaller Americans cities, Mr. Mamdani, as mayor of America’s financial center, will become the country’s highest-level Muslim executive.\n\nHe won while fully embracing his Muslim faith on the campaign trail, even as divisions over antisemitism, Islamophobia and the war in Gaza dominated the election, including within New York’s large Muslim and Jewish communities.\n\nQuestions about Mr. Mamdani’s religious beliefs, perhaps conflated with his political intentions, were frequently raised by his critics throughout the campaign. In a TV interview last month, Mr. Mamdani, a critic of Israel, wouldn’t give a direct answer when asked whether Hamas should lay down arms and step aside in Gaza, which spurred vitriolic attacks and suggestions that he was a terrorist sympathizer.\n\nIn another interview, in June, he declined to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which is considered a rallying cry for liberation among Palestinians. Many Jews, however, consider it a call to violence. He later said he would no longer use the phrase and would discourage others from using it.\n\nDespite the backlash, Keith Ellison, a Democrat who is the attorney general of Minnesota, said Mr. Mamdani’s election showed “dramatic improvement” from his own election in 2006, when he became the first Muslim to be elected to Congress.\n\n“It speaks well to our country,” Mr. Ellison said, “because at a moment when arguably the president won election by appealing to people’s desire to exclude, Americans are trying still to include.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday night, voters in Virginia elected Ghazala Hashmi, a Democrat, as lieutenant governor, making her the first Muslim woman to win statewide office there.\n\nDemocrats have for years struggled to organize religious voters, but in just a few months Mr. Mamdani activated a new base of Muslim voters and attracted a progressive cross-identity coalition that supported his goals, like making New York affordable and opposing Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, often on moral grounds. Now, the most prominent face of progressive religion in the Democratic Party is not a liberal Christian but a Muslim who practices his faith while also creating space for interfaith and secular morality.\n\nMany of Mr. Mamdani’s political views are not necessarily tied to his religion. But he has also unabashedly centered his faith, reaching out to the nearly one million Muslims in New York who, as he put it, had for too long been taught to live “in the shadows.”\n\nAs of June, about a third of New York’s Muslims were registered to vote, but only about one in 10 voted in the last mayoral election, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Muslims make up about 1 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nMuslims in America historically have affiliated more with the Democratic Party. But in the past couple years Muslims have emerged as a more fluid group. Notably, in Michigan last year, Arab-American voters helped deliver the state for President Trump, some directly citing frustration with the Biden administration’s support for Israel. Mr. Mamdani’s rise has shown how Muslim voters are demanding more engagement and recognition of their voice.\n\nMr. Mamdani visited more than 50 mosques during the campaign, regularly going to different ones on Fridays for jummah prayers. He campaigned while fasting for Ramadan and had a Muslim wedding ceremony, known as a nikkah, in Dubai, where his wife’s family lives. When he visited the family of a police officer who was killed in a Midtown Manhattan shooting in July, they told him that he and the slain officer had crossed paths at Eid prayers.\n\n“There is a constant effort to try and draw a small barrier around who can be American,” said Abdul El-Sayed, a Democrat and former public health director running for Senate in Michigan. “That is what makes this moment so special.”\n\nLike Mr. Mamdani, Mr. El-Sayed has also drawn on the values of his Muslim faith as he seeks the responsibility of public office. “There’s a beautiful tradition in our faith that if you were to eat a full meal, and your neighbor could smell your meal and didn’t have, then you would be committing a sin,” he said.\n\n“For all of us, ask yourself: What is wrong with sharing your food? What is wrong with sharing your resources?” he added.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s religious values, and the policies that flow from them, also stand in contrast to the conservative brand of Christianity that has been elevated within the Republican Party.\n\n“We are in a moment of the pluralists versus the anti-pluralists,” said Zeenat Rahman, executive director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago. Anti-pluralists currently have a lot of state support, but most Americans function as pluralists in their day-to-day lives, she said.\n\n“The fact that he could win in this climate says something to me about how Americans are craving leadership that reflects pluralism, not just tolerance but a real belief that our diversity strengthens our democracy,” she said.\n\nMr. Mamdani “has been allowed to be seen in the complexity of who he is,” Ms. Rahman said, defined not simply by his faith but by his policies and leadership. “To me that is the progress in the story,” she added.\n\nAfter Sept. 11, when Mr. Mamdani was about 13, his father, a political scientist at Columbia, wrote a book called “Good Muslim, Bad Muslim,” dispelling the stereotypical binary of Muslim political identities.\n\nHe dedicated the book to “Zohran and his mates” in Uganda, Cape Town, New York and New Delhi, in hopes that “together, they will no doubt remake the world they inherit from us.”\n\nEven as Mr. Mamdani broke barriers for Muslims, his campaign particularly roiled Jews across the country. New York’s mayoral race came to symbolize the broader debates over antisemitism and anti-Zionism that have intensified since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel.\n\nMuslims watched his campaign with pride but also with fear, as his opponents were accused of inciting hatred against Muslims. Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, falsely accused Mr. Mamdani of supporting “global jihad,” and Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, participated in an exchange suggesting that Mr. Mamdani would celebrate another Sept. 11-like terrorist attack.\n\nMr. Mamdani responded with an emotional speech about his experiences of bigotry and Islamophobia. It was another way he elevated the daily experiences of Muslims in the city.\n\nWhen Little Flower Cafe, a halal eatery in Queens, opened in 2022, the owner, Ali Zaman, said Mr. Mamdani started popping by regularly to order his favorite drink: a pink chai made with green tea mixed with baking soda, as well as cardamom, rose water and milk.\n\nInitially, Mr. Zaman, 29, was hesitant about Mr. Mamdani, wondering if he was like other politicians who he felt sold out over time. But during Ramadan last year, months before announcing his candidacy, Mr. Mamdani reached out to host an iftar dinner at Mr. Zaman’s father’s restaurant, Sami’s Kabab House.\n\nThey prayed across traditions — “I was raised Sunni, he was raised Shia” — and Mr. Mamdani said he wanted to mourn together what he called the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, Mr. Zaman recalled.\n\n“That was the night I was like, Oh, I have no doubt about what kind of person he is,” Mr. Zaman said. “He was like a really cool Muslim brother. He was a brown brother.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-tariffs.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:03:37-05:00","title":"Trump’s Sweeping Tariffs Face High-Stakes Supreme Court Test","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court is set to hear a high-stakes case challenging President Donald Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (1977) to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from over 100 countries, including China, Canada, and Mexico.

Without the emergency power, he said in a social media post, the country “is virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us.”\n\nThe tariffs were challenged in court by a dozen states, in addition to small businesses, including a wine importer and an educational toy manufacturer. Hundreds of small businesses have separately joined court filings that call Mr. Trump’s actions unlawful, saying the tariffs have forced them to raise prices and scale back staffing.\n\nUntil now, the court’s conservative majority has been largely receptive to Mr. Trump’s claims of presidential authority, but it has ruled largely on emergency orders that have been technically temporary. The tariffs case, which is considered a legal tossup by experts, is the first time in Mr. Trump’s second term that the justices will address the underlying legal merits of a major administration priority in a more lasting way.\n\nThe key question for the justices on Wednesday is whether the president exceeded his authority when he used the 1977 emergency statute. Past presidents have relied on the law to impose sanctions or embargoes on other countries, but Mr. Trump is the first to use it to impose tariffs.\n\nAlmost immediately after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump announced tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China, Canada and Mexico, saying the levies were a punishment for failing to stop the flow of fentanyl. In April, he expanded the tariffs to imports on goods from more than 100 trading partners, saying they were needed to address trade deficits with the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the law, the president has the authority to take certain steps in response to a national emergency to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property, which the administration argues allows Mr. Trump to levy tariffs.\n\nThe challengers counter that the word “regulate” does not encompass the power to impose tariffs. The statute itself does not include the words “tariffs,” “taxes” or “duties.”\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the power to tax. The challengers say that when lawmakers have intended to delegate tariff authority to the president, they have done so in plain language — and with limits — as they did in several other statutes.\n\nIf the justices were to rule against Mr. Trump, the administration says it would be forced to unwind trade deals with other countries. The government might also have to pay billions in refunds to importers.\n\nD. John Sauer, the solicitor general, has told the court that rolling back the tariffs could lead to economic ruin akin to the Great Depression, an interruption of trade negotiations and diplomatic embarrassment.\n\nBut even with a loss, the president would have other options. He could rely on different statutes to impose duties, but on a more limited basis and with less flexibility. The administration has proposed or issued tariffs that cover more than a third of U.S. imports under a nonemergency provision related to national security, known as Section 232.\n\nIn a sign of how pivotal the case is to the administration’s agenda, Mr. Trump had talked publicly about attending Wednesday’s argument before reversing course on Sunday, saying he would stay away to avoid becoming a distraction. Instead, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Monday that he planned to go to court and “sit hopefully in the front row and listen, have a ringside seat.”\n\n“I am there to emphasize that this is an economic emergency,” he said. “National security is economic security. Economic security is national security. As the Treasury secretary of the United States, I’m in charge of maintaining both.”\n\nThe case reached the Supreme Court after three lower courts concluded the tariffs were unlawful.\n\nIn August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7 to 4 that the emergency statute did not authorize the sweeping tariffs while declining to decide whether the statute might allow Mr. Trump to impose more limited duties.\n\n“Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly,” the majority said.\n\nIn dissent, Judge Richard G. Taranto, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, said that the statute should be read to give presidents more flexibility to respond to emergencies and that it represented “an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign affairs realm.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/politics/trump-administration-pain-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"00:03:46-05:00","title":"Shutdown Becomes Longest in History, as Trump Officials Threaten Pain Could Worsen","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government shutdown has extended beyond 35 days, breaking the record for the longest in American history, as President Donald Trump refuses to negotiate with Democrats.

Longest in History, as Trump Officials Threaten Pain Could Worsen\n\nPublished: 2025-11-05T00:03:46-05:00\n\nEven as the government shutdown stretched into Wednesday and surpassed the record for the longest in American history, President Trump showed no interest in negotiating with Democrats.\n\nInstead, as the two sides entered their 36th day at an impasse, the administration signaled it planned to ramp up the pain.\n\nThe president threatened on social media on Tuesday to deny food subsidy payments for 42 million Americans until the end of the government shutdown, in apparent defiance of a court order. (The White House press secretary later said the administration would comply with the court.)\n\nMr. Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, warned he might have to close parts of the national airspace next week because of the potential “mass chaos” with air traffic controller shortages.\n\nAnd the White House again left open the possibility it might not follow its legal obligation to restore back pay to furloughed workers who have missed paychecks during the shutdown.\n\nTaken together, the administration’s message was simple: Either Democrats back down from their demand to extend expiring health care subsidies, or the fallout of the shutdown will get worse.\n\nOn Wednesday after midnight, this year’s fiscal impasse pushed past 35 full days, breaking the ignominious record for the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which was previously set by the 34-day shutdown of Mr. Trump’s first term.\n\nUnlike that standoff, the president has not involved himself in negotiations to end the current dilemma. Instead, the White House is betting that Democrats’ key constituencies will turn on them the longer they continue to refuse to support the G.O.P. plan for a short-term spending extension at current funding levels.\n\nThe administration has pointed to the calls by some union leaders for Congress to reopen the government under the Republican plan and then negotiate over health care costs.\n\n“The Democrats obstructionism will break the record for the longest government shutdown in American history tonight,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said at a news conference. “The Democrats are intentionally hurting American families, workers and businesses with this shutdown.”\n\nWhen asked what Mr. Trump was doing to end the government shutdown, Ms. Leavitt said he was “pushing Republicans to keep voting” on a funding bill. Mr. Trump has invited all Republican senators for a discussion at the White House Wednesday.\n\nIt remains to be seen which party Americans will hold ultimately accountable for the paralysis in Washington. But recent public surveys show a larger share currently put the responsibility on Republicans.\n\n“I really try to avoid making this an issue out of what the polls say, or who’s winning or losing, because nobody wins,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the top Republican in the Senate, told reporters. “Shutdowns are stupid. I’ve been here long enough to have been through a few of them. Nobody wins.”\n\nDemocrats say the president’s refusal to engage in discussions means Mr. Trump is responsible for the impact on Americans.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, said Tuesday that some informal talks were underway and that Democrats were “exploring all the options.”\n\nBut he said Mr. Trump has not involved himself.\n\n“The fault of this shutdown falls on his shoulders,” Mr. Schumer said. “He’s refused to discuss anything with us.”\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top Democrat in the House, said Democrats would not back down until they secured a deal to improve health care benefits.\n\n“Donald Trump is unlawfully withholding billions of dollars in SNAP benefits from 42 million Americans and 16 million children,” said Mr. Jeffries, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “There’s nothing to be optimistic about relative to the cruelty and the pain that Donald Trump and Republicans continue to inflict on the American people.”\n\nHe suggested Democrats could gain more political momentum for their position with wins in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey Tuesday night.\n\n“It’s over for these people,” he said of Republicans before polls closed, “and we’re going to see it today, and we’re going to see it during the midterm elections.”\n\nFor weeks the Trump administration has played a game of winners and losers with the shutdown, aiming to mitigate the harm to the military and law enforcement, while ramping up the pressure on Democratic constituencies. Mr. Trump has used the fiscal impasse to halt funding to Democratic jurisdictions, and tried to lay off thousands of federal workers.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the pain would intensify.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, the president said that food stamp benefits under SNAP “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!”\n\nHours after that ultimatum, Ms. Leavitt appeared to walk back the president’s comments. She told reporters at a news briefing that the administration was “fully complying” with the court and would provide partial food stamp payments in November.\n\nThe White House declined to elaborate on Mr. Trump’s plans. The Agriculture Department which administers the program, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Duffy, the transportation secretary, warned of “mass chaos” in the skies.\n\n“You will see mass chaos, you will see mass flight delays, you will see mass cancellations,” he said during a news conference, accusing Democrats of perpetuating what he called a “senseless shutdown.”\n\n“And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it because we don’t have the air traffic controllers,” he said.\n\nThe most recent notifications from agencies to federal workers about the shutdown omitted any language that furloughed employees would receive back pay, which is guaranteed under a law that Mr. Trump signed in 2019.\n\nMs. Leavitt would not commit to the administration complying with the law, saying Tuesday that the matter was the subject of negotiations.\n\n“This is something we are very much open to discussing with Democrats as part of the discussions about the continuing resolution to keep the government open,” she said.\n\nMr. Trump has previously threatened to withhold back pay for some federal workers, adding that “some people that really don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way.”\n\nTony Romm, Karoun Demirjian, Erica L.

At issue is whether Mr. Trump properly used an emergency powers law to hit nearly all trading partners with tariffs.\n\nA loss at the court would be a severe setback for Mr. Trump, who has used the emergency powers law to punish countries globally with double-digit tariffs in an effort to convince them to sign trade deals and move factories back to the United States. Yet the president has plenty of other ways to tax imports.\n\nMultiple trade authorities exist that would allow the president to impose tariffs that are not subject to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, the law at issue in the Supreme Court case.\n\nTrade lawyers and government officials say the administration could look to other legal provisions to cobble together a system of tariffs that could be less flexible but just as consequential as the emergency powers levies.\n\nSome of those provisions are in use today, while others are more obscure. Together, they could be employed to impose tariffs on foreign countries or products, or even the entire globe. They could also be used to reinforce the trade deals that Mr. Trump has negotiated globally, which are based on tariffs issued under the IEEPA authority.\n\nRyan Majerus, a White House adviser and Commerce Department official in the Biden administration, said that the Trump administration had used IEEPA very flexibly to adjust tariffs, and that the court decision could curtail that ability.\n\nBut the administration could use Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act to put in place a 15 percent global tariff for 150 days, he suggested. That law says a president can impose tariffs to deal with “large and serious” balance-of-payments deficits — an issue related to trade deficits, which some of the president’s IEEPA tariffs purport to address.\n\nIn the meantime, the administration could start multiple trade investigations under a legal provision known as Section 301, said Mr. Majerus, now a partner at King & Spalding, a Washington law firm. Section 301 allows the president to issue broad tariffs in response to unfair trading practices, after first conducting an investigation.\n\nThe Trump administration used that authority in its first term to wage a trade war against China, and last month it initiated a new investigation related to China’s compliance with Mr. Trump’s first-term trade deal. Section 301 tariffs have been “battle-tested in the courts” and could be used to impose tariffs on other countries that were part of trade deals the Trump administration negotiated earlier this year, Mr. Majerus added.\n\n“I think they’ll find a way to keep tariffs in place, even if it requires more process,” he said.\n\nAnother alternative is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose tariffs on national security grounds. Those levies typically require investigations that can take several months to carry out, a period that would prevent the president from arbitrarily raising and lowering tariffs, as he has done with IEEPA.\n\nBut any resulting system of tariffs could be sweeping and more resilient to court challenges, given the court’s past deference to the president’s use of national security-related tariffs. Mr. Trump has already relied on the Section 232 authority to issue or propose tariffs on more than a third of U.S. imports, including cars, medical devices, lumber and metals, according to calculations by the Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington think tank.\n\nSection 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, another long-unused statute, allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 50 percent on countries that have taken discriminatory trade measures against the United States.\n\nOne legal channel has been notably absent from the list of alternatives that trade lawyers and officials typically mention: the more traditional route of conducting trade policy through Congress. Levying tariffs and taxes is officially the domain of Congress, and previous administrations mostly adjusted tariff policy by negotiating comprehensive trade deals that they then took to Congress for approval.\n\nThe Trump administration has bypassed Congress entirely by using executive authorities to issue tariffs and seal trade pacts. The issue has rankled Democrats and some Republicans, though few in Mr. Trump’s own party have been willing to clash with him in public.\n\nBut some hope that the Supreme Court case will shine a spotlight on the lack of action from Congress. Aaron Lehman, a fifth-generation farmer who grows corn, soybeans, oats and hay in central Iowa and serves as the president of the Iowa Farmers’ Union, said he was hopeful that the Supreme Court case could highlight the need for Congress to be an independent check on the president.\n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday featuring small businesses and farmers, Mr. Lehman said he was concerned about the president finding other ways to impose his tariffs. But he added that he believed the Supreme Court decision would highlight the need for Congress and elected leaders to reassert their authority, “so that we can return to a more pragmatic trade approach.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/nyregion/how-zohran-mamdani-won-nyc-mayor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"22:06:52-05:00","title":"How Zohran Mamdani Beat Back New York’s Elite and Was Elected Mayor","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist and first Muslim and South Asian mayor of New York City, has emerged as a historic figure in American politics after defeating the establishment in a stunning primary victory.

After winning the primary, he faced intense backlash from powerful figures including Andrew Cuomo, Bill Ackman, and Bill Bloomberg, who criticized him for his views on policing and Israel. A mass shooting at a building housing William Rudin’s office, which killed a Muslim officer, became a pivotal moment, allowing Mamdani to pivot toward a message of unity. Through strategic outreach to business leaders, including Larry Fink and Hamilton James, and a diplomatic apology to Governor Kathy Hochul, he built a coalition that included major Democrats and civic leaders.

There were the usual congratulations, certainly, but also signs of something more worrying.\n\nA young democratic socialist, Mr. Mamdani had just toppled former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, upending New York’s power structure in an upset so stunning and so swift that even he had not fully seen it coming.\n\nNow, titans of the city establishment were clogging up the phones of the candidate and his small team, looking for belated introductions. Most did not sound happy.\n\n“It’s a great day in New York,” Morris Katz, Mr. Mamdani’s 26-year-old political adviser, told the real estate magnate William C. Rudin in one of the conversations.\n\nThe businessman paused. That’s certainly not how I see it, he replied.\n\nMany past primary winners had instantly been anointed as mayor-elect in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. But it took just hours to become clear that the power brokers and civic gatekeepers accustomed to running New York saw Mr. Mamdani’s ascent as something closer to hostile takeover — one that many would do anything to block.\n\nA top aide for Mr. Cuomo was already phoning unions and Democratic officials urging them to withhold support. Old real estate friends soon began pitching President Trump on a possible White House intervention.\n\nAnd Bill Ackman, the billionaire financier, fired off a warning on X, saying “hundreds of millions of dollars” would be available to clobber the young interloper in November and “save our City.”\n\nMr. Mamdani’s political rise may be remembered for what came first: the buoyant, flamboyant, rule-breaking primary run that united a new coalition of Brooklyn gentrifiers and Queens cabbies around the city’s growing affordability crisis and the birth of a megawatt talent.\n\nBut his election on Tuesday as the 111th mayor of New York owes as much to the equally improbable backroom campaign that followed. In Midtown C-suites and intimate phone calls, a left-wing populist who had built his brand on taxing the rich wooed, charmed and delicately disarmed some of the most powerful people in America.\n\nThe arc of his success is nothing short of staggering. At the start of the year, Mr. Mamdani was polling at 1 percent, tied, as he likes to say, with the candidate known as “someone else.” Few New Yorkers recognized his name, and his own political team put the odds of winning as low as 3 percent.\n\nNow, at age 34, he will be New York City’s youngest leader in more than a century, amid a pile of historic firsts: the first Muslim mayor, the first South Asian and arguably the most influential democratic socialist in the country.\n\nThis account of how he did it draws from interviews with Mr. Mamdani’s top advisers and allies, as well as his critics and rivals. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to share previously unreported exchanges.\n\nThe final chapter was a high-wire act that at times appeared at risk of collapsing, as internal forces clashed over how much ground to give around the war in Gaza and policing, and Mr. Cuomo deftly sought to undermine him.\n\nBehind the scenes, it featured a key apology to Gov. Kathy Hochul at a Midtown hotel; renewed contact with Mr. Rudin, after a horrific shooting touched the core of his business; a courtship of Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor, that bought Mr. Mamdani time, if not an alliance; and more than a bit of luck.\n\nThe meetings with establishment leaders turned out to be crucial. “I don’t think anything he said was nearly as important as the fact that he knew they were important enough to spend time on,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, the head of a leading business group.\n\nDeep misgivings still remain among the city’s elite that could affect his tenure. But, Ms. Wylde added, “It quieted the hysteria — just enough.”\n\nAs Mr. Mamdani began sketching out a potential campaign a year earlier over cups of chai at a Yemeni cafe in Astoria, his challenge was far more basic: getting noticed at all.\n\nA backbench assemblyman who had immigrated to New York City at age 7, he had almost no citywide profile. Even fellow socialists thought his views on policing and Israel would put a hard ceiling on his support. And the field running against the scandal-plagued mayor, Eric Adams, was growing by the day.\n\nMr. Mamdani later told an ally that he had confided in his fiancée, Rama Duwaji, that he didn’t really think he could win. The goal was to build a template for the kind of muscular leftist campaign that might one day crack the Democratic establishment’s hold.\n\nHow that long-shot candidacy caught fire has been amply dissected by political observers here and in Washington. Mr. Mamdani foregrounded the city’s affordability crisis when rivals focused elsewhere, lapped them with viral social media videos and benefited from Democrats’ hunger for generational change.\n\nBut as seen by Mr. Mamdani and his cadre of advisers, not one of whom had ever run a citywide campaign, none of it was going to work if they waited for traditional gatekeepers in media, civic institutions and elected office.\n\nForget the New York conjured by political strategists, one future adviser, Zara Rahim, advised him over coffee last summer. Make a campaign about the actual New York City.\n\nJonathan Rosen, a Democrat who helped mastermind Bill de Blasio’s 2013 mayoral victory and was advising a rival campaign, compared the strategy to those deployed by two other New Yorkers, Mr. Trump and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who “went direct, ignored all the institutions and referees and built a relationship with New Yorkers.”\n\n“Mediums matter,” he said, “and who understands them first matters.”\n\nThe campaign decided to forgo selling branded swag, a revenue stream for many candidates, and adopted what it called “the Mets bobblehead strategy of merch.” It produced special items in limited quantities — a blue beanie, paper fans, bandannas — that could only be earned, incentivizing supporters to give not money but time.\n\nIt hosted a series of events — a citywide scavenger hunt, a soccer tournament at Coney Island — that opponents laughed off as gimmicks but attracted thousands of supporters. Many later became part of an unmatched army of volunteers.\n\n“My experience of politics in the last nine years has been a lot of people being mean to each other on Twitter,” said Katie Riley, who oversaw campaign operations. “We wanted people to get out in the world together in real spaces.”\n\nThe contrast to Mr. Cuomo could not have been more jarring. The scion of a political dynasty, he had been run out of the governor’s office in a sexual harassment scandal. But when he entered the race in March, he acted as if he were still in charge.\n\nHe rarely appeared in public, threatened unions and fellow Democrats into creating an air of inevitability around him and relied on $25 million in big-money donations to a super PAC supporting him.\n\nBy the time Mr. Mamdani and aides gathered at a Holiday Inn on June 24, primary night, they thought their approach was working. But they were so certain they would not win outright that first night that they had not prepared a victory speech.\n\nYet not long after 10 p.m., Mr. Mamdani found himself letting congratulatory calls go through to voice mail, as he and a shocked clutch of aides raced to write one.\n\nSpeaking later on a rooftop near the hotel, he declared victory over the “billionaires and their big spending” and “elected officials who care more about self-enrichment than the public trust.” He proudly disclosed he had already spoken to Mr. Cuomo “about the need to bring this city together.”\n\nThe sentiment, it turns out, would last about eight hours.\n\nPatrick Gaspard, who began advising Mr. Mamdani late in the primary, had spent a lifetime accumulating contacts as a top Democratic organizer. The morning after the primary, so many of them were trying to reach him that he set his phone to do not disturb.\n\nMany messages sounded outright panicked, including from prominent Black New Yorkers who knew little about the candidate. Why do you trust him? He seems shady. He is misleading our children, Mr. Gaspard recalled the messages saying.\n\nInside the campaign, Mr. Mamdani and his advisers were exhausted. They had planned to plot their next steps while on retreat for a week. They had mere hours to face a new reality.\n\nLook, everything is about to change, Ms. Rahim and Mr. Katz told Mr. Mamdani as they idled in a car outside 30 Rockefeller Plaza after a post-primary television appearance.\n\nHe would need to quadruple his staff, delicately reassign longtime aides to less high-profile roles and begin more seriously planning for the possibility that he could be mayor, they said. If he needed any reminder, a police detail now accompanied his every movement.\n\n“The exhausted disbelief was palpable,” Mr. Gaspard said. “You could tell they were having a tough time absorbing they were going to have to do it all over again.”\n\nSome post-primary consolidation came quickly, especially as labor unions and local party leaders embraced his candidacy. But others, including some of the nation’s top Democrats, held back, worried that associating with Mr. Mamdani’s far-left views could tank the party’s chances in next year’s midterms.\n\nMr. Adams, who sat out the primary, looked to be regaining strength with support from the city’s rattled business class. And though Mr. Cuomo had initially signaled a willingness to bow out, he threw himself back into the race as an independent with a newfound furor after taking a brief retreat in the Hamptons.\n\n“I was not aggressive enough,” he told supporters. “I promise you, I will not make that mistake again.”\n\nMr. Mamdani also took a post-primary break, traveling to Uganda in late July for a long-planned marriage celebration at a lavish family compound. The campaign was jittery, hiring an outside lawyer as a precaution in case immigration agents hassled him when he returned. Mr. Mamdani went through the airport in a mask and a hat to avoid a public spectacle.\n\nBut when a crisis did arrive, it was not the one they expected. Seven thousand miles away, back in New York, a gunman walked into a Midtown office tower and carried out a deadly mass shooting, including killing an off-duty police officer. The attacker had targeted a building that happened to house the offices of Mr. Rudin, the real estate executive, and killed one of his employees.\n\nAides woke Mr. Mamdani in the night to put out a statement, and he rushed to get on the first flight back to New York City. But by the time he landed two days later, Mr. Cuomo was on television screens across the city all but blaming his opponent, who once called for defunding the police, for the massacre.\n\nIt was a disaster. And the unfavorable optics might have changed the course of the whole campaign, but for one twist of fate: The officer killed turned out to be Bangladeshi and, like Mr. Mamdani, a Muslim. The family invited the candidate to join them at home, and he arrived directly from Kennedy Airport.\n\nAfterward, he called a news conference that would be his longest since Primary Day. He chastised Mr. Cuomo for politicizing the moment but also used the platform to stress that his views on policing had evolved from the days when he called the institution “racist” and called for funding cuts.\n\nFor the first time in weeks, aides breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n“To me, it was the first moment I felt like he was the mayor of New York,” Mr. Katz said.\n\nMr. Mamdani knew he still had a problem.\n\nNo mayor has led New York without at least some tacit support from the business elite since the fiscal crisis of 1970s. Running aggressively against them had worked in the primary, but as summer slid toward fall, his advisers worried that leaders of the group could push both Mr. Adams and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, out of the race.\n\nA one-on-one matchup with Mr. Cuomo in a more conservative general electorate could be disastrous.\n\nSo Mr. Mamdani got busy. He asked Ms. Wylde, the head of the Partnership for New York City, for a list of every major business leader he should call and began reaching out one by one, including to Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, and Hamilton E. James, the former head of Blackstone.\n\nThe only child of two prominent cultural figures, Mr. Mamdani was at ease with rich and powerful people. He explained why his core positions would not change, but he also solicited advice and signaled more flexibility that his reputation suggested.\n\nHis goal was to expand free child care and buses, Mr. Mamdani said in some groups, but he was open to scrapping a proposed tax hike if he could find another funding stream.\n\nAt a packed meeting with the Association for a Better New York, a civic-minded group of business leaders, in a Midtown office suite in early August, he began by offering condolences to Mr. Rudin, whose father co-founded the organization, over the recent shooting. (The men had also spoken by phone in the days after it happened.) Then, he surprised attendees by proposing a regulatory change developers had longed for to speed up construction.\n\nSome who were expecting a strident ideologue came away impressed. For others, his willingness to engage was at least a welcome contrast to Mr. de Blasio, a progressive who had made a point of conspicuously thumbing his nose at Manhattan elite, and to Mr. Cuomo’s bruising style.\n\n“He asked more questions and listened more intently to me and others in the room than I’ve ever seen any politician — surely in this city — do,” said Mr. Rosen.\n\nMr. Mamdani also took on a new tone with fellow Democrats.\n\nWhen Chi Ossé, a progressive City Council member he was close to, began talking in October about potentially running in the primary next year against Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the moderate House Democratic leader, Mr. Mamdani and his team tried to shut it down.\n\nMr. Mamdani himself had been a thorn in side of Ms. Hochul for years, once saying her actions were why “people don’t trust politicians.” But he knew she had the trust of business leaders and would hold the keys to moving his ambitious plans through Albany.\n\nWhen the pair sat down in late June after the city’s Pride parade, he apologized for his earlier criticism of her and asked to work together, particularly around a shared interest in child care.\n\nMs. Hochul was pleasantly surprised. She initially told Mr. Mamdani that she would consider endorsing him, but she wanted him to agree to keep Jessica Tisch, a well-respected technocrat appointed by Mr. Adams, as police commissioner. Mr. Mamdani initially balked, explaining he had never even met her.\n\nThe question cut to the heart of one of the campaign’s leading conflicts: How far could Mr. Mamdani go courting the powerful without compromising his beliefs or, crucially, alienating his progressive base?\n\nMr. Katz described the general election campaign as a “story of a constant friction between trying to unite a party and not lose a populist edge.”\n\nWhile he saw a political advantage in locking in Ms. Tisch quickly, Elle Bisgaard-Church, Mr. Mamdani’s longtime chief of staff, wanted to take a slower approach. The appointment would be one of the most significant he would make, and Mr. Mamdani needed to know he would have a partner to implement a series of progressive reforms he had pitched for the Police Department.\n\nUltimately, both Ms. Hochul and Mr. Mamdani came around. The governor endorsed him in September after he agreed to involve her when he selected a commissioner. Weeks later, after private conversations with Ms. Tisch, Mr. Mamdani said publicly he intended to keep her.\n\nA similar argument played out around how forcefully Mr. Mamdani should distance himself from “globalize the intifada,” a phrase that many Jewish New Yorkers heard as a call to violence.\n\nMr. Mamdani, a pro-Palestinian activist, told business leaders in July that he would “discourage” the use of the phrase, but the decision not to condemn it outright eventually helped fan a full-fledged backlash from prominent Jewish institutions, which aided Mr. Cuomo.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s harsh criticism of Israel played a role in another, less successful courtship of Mr. Bloomberg.\n\nThe candidate knew the former mayor had the unique stature and fortune to influence the general election. Mr. Mamdani needed to sideline him.\n\nThe campaign struggled to get a meeting, but when the two finally met at Bloomberg’s Midtown headquarters this fall, they spent a convivial hour debating management styles and looking at old photos of Mr. Bloomberg’s time in City Hall. Mr. Bloomberg had privately told associates over the summer he was done with Mr. Cuomo after spending more than $8 million to back him in the primary. Mr. Mamdani left the meeting thinking he had done enough to keep it that way.\n\nHe was wrong. Angry over Mr. Mamdani’s comments on Israel and worried about his inexperience, Mr. Bloomberg ultimately sent $5 million to two super PACs attacking Mr. Mamdani and re-upped his endorsement of Mr. Cuomo — but did so only six days before Election Day.\n\nBy then it was too late.\n\nMr. Mamdani had fortified his unlikely coalition for the general election, its strength on display a week before Election Day, when he nearly filled Forest Hills Stadium in Queens.\n\nOnstage were Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, giants of the left, but also, awkward as it seemed to all involved, Ms. Hochul and the top legislative leaders in Albany. They were all uniting around the Democratic nominee.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/nyregion/nyc-mayor-election-mamdani-takeaways.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:01:38-05:00","title":"7 Takeaways From a Stunning New York City Mayoral Election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker and the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, won a historic mayoral election in New York City on November 5, 2025, defeating former Governor Andrew M.

Then and now, Mr. Mamdani handily dispatched former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the scion of a New York dynasty, and the big-money super PACs backing him.\n\nTuesday’s results underscored how thoroughly Mr. Mamdani has built his own new coalition of support, uniting younger voters with working-class immigrant enclaves in Queens. But he also made gains in working-class Black and Latino communities compared with the primary.\n\nHere are seven takeaways from election night:\n\nIn an era of low turnout nationwide, participation in Tuesday’s mayoral election in New York City was nothing short of electric, approaching numbers not seen in half a century.\n\nMore than two million New Yorkers cast their ballots. That figure was almost double the 1,100,000 people who voted for mayor four years ago. In some areas of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan, participation approached presidential election levels.\n\nMr. Mamdani drove the surge. He was the first candidate since John V. Lindsay in 1969 to win over one million votes in a mayoral election in the five boroughs. (Overall turnout that year, 2,458,203 people, still slightly topped Tuesday’s total, though.)\n\nFor decades, Democrats in New York City have prevailed with a fairly static coalition: white liberals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, Black and Latino voters, ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities and a smattering of other immigrants.\n\nEarly results suggest that Mr. Mamdani reworked the contours of that coalition, stitching together new alliances that could shift the city’s political outlook for years to come.\n\nHe ran up 40- and 50-point margins in Brooklyn’s affluent Brownstone belt, swept northern Manhattan and secured slightly more narrow margins in historically Black and Latino areas of Brooklyn and the Bronx.\n\nMr. Cuomo pulled away in Orthodox Jewish precincts, where he approached 80 percent of the vote, and clearly won large numbers of more liberal Jewish voters in Manhattan and Riverdale in the Bronx that typically back the Democratic nominee.\n\nBut Mr. Mamdani, who will be the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, more than made up for those losses with two groups most Democrats have overlooked: the young residents of gentrifying neighborhoods like Bushwick and Williamsburg, and the taxi drivers, bodega owners and other working-class South Asian immigrants in Queens and the Bronx.\n\nAs he saw his chances fading, Mr. Cuomo, a lifelong Democrat, launched a furious and at times ugly campaign to pull away supporters from Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee.\n\nHe blanketed Fox News and conservative talk radio, at one point laughing along with a shock jock who said Mr. Mamdani would cheer for a Sept. 11-style terrorist attack. He flipped key Republican endorsers. And on the eve of the election, Mr. Cuomo even won an endorsement from President Trump.\n\nMr. Cuomo’s message to voters on the right was blunt: “He cannot win. You vote for Curtis, save yourself the time, and vote for Mamdani.”\n\nThe effort appears to have been remarkably successful. Mr. Cuomo won Republican sections of Staten Island and Southern Brooklyn handily. Mr. Sliwa was on track to win just 7 percent Tuesday night.\n\nIt was not enough for Mr. Cuomo to make up the difference.\n\nBillionaires like Bill Ackman and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pumped millions of dollars into super PACs supporting Mr. Cuomo with the hopes of defeating Mr. Mamdani.\n\nIn advertisements and on social media, they focused on the fact that Mr. Mamdani is an avowed democratic socialist; parsed his positions on the war in Gaza; and highlighted his relative inexperience.\n\nAt the end of the race, the political ads dipped into what Mr. Mamdani called “naked bigotry” and Islamophobia. An advertisement from one super PAC, For Our City, placed a picture of a smiling Mr. Mamdani in front of the collapsing World Trade Center.\n\nSuper PACs supporting Mr. Cuomo have raised more than $40 million while those supporting Mr. Mamdani have raised about $10 million. According to Campaign Finance Board records, Fix the City spent more than $29 million to boost the campaign of Mr. Cuomo and to attack his two opponents in the election.\n\nIt was not decisive.\n\nMr. Mamdani successfully framed the attacks as an example of how the very wealthy, whom he has proposed taxing to fund some of his campaign platform, were obstacles to New Yorkers seeking a better quality of life.\n\nDuring the primary, Mr. Mamdani struggled to win some working-class Black and Latino areas. He overcame those challenges in a major way on Tuesday night.\n\nWith almost 90 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Mamdani was winning the Bronx by 11 points, a striking turnaround from the primary when he lost the county to Mr. Cuomo by 18 points.\n\nIn working-class neighborhoods like Kingsbridge in the Bronx, Mr. Cuomo beat Mr. Mamdani by almost two points in the primary. On Tuesday night, Mr. Mamdani was winning the neighborhood by 14 points.\n\nIn Brownsville, Brooklyn, one of the most economically deprived neighborhoods in the city, Mr. Mamdani was winning by 18 points. Mr. Cuomo had won the neighborhood by 40 points in the primary.\n\nBut things changed after the primary. Mr. Mamdani said doors to places in some of those neighborhoods that he lost began to open to him. As the Democratic nominee for mayor, community groups wanted to meet with him, and he suddenly found himself invited into pulpits to speak almost every Sunday.\n\nThe campaign also made a point of emphasizing how Mr. Mamdani’s focus on affordability would help a family of four in Brownsville as much as it would a young person who had recently moved to the city.\n\n“It is really without a question an electoral victory that belongs to working-class and middle-class people who are dissatisfied with a political system that tells people who are struggling to just wait or endure,” said Ana María Archila, a co-director of the New York Working Families Party.\n\nThere was a time, not that long ago, when Mr. Cuomo, 67, was not only the most powerful Democrat in New York, but widely considered a viable candidate for the White House.\n\nThat seemed like another lifetime on Tuesday night, as he faced his second stinging defeat in just five months. The results suggested he held onto support among some Black and many Jewish Democrats. But after running a scorched-earth campaign against Mr. Mamdani, the lifelong Democrat performed far better in many Republican precincts than solidly Democratic ones.\n\nMr. Cuomo may yet run for another office, but after decades of him and his father, Mario M. Cuomo, many voters said they were done.\n\n“We need someone who’s trying to turn a new leaf for New York City,” said Alexis Pierson, 35, an interior designer from Brooklyn.\n\n“Cuomo?” she added. “Been there, done that.”\n\nIt was an election, in many ways, about New York City’s spiraling living costs, the haves and have-nots. Evidently, the haves could not agree about whom to vote for.\n\nMr. Cuomo, a Sutton Place resident who earned nearly $5 million last year, clearly appealed to his neighbors a few blocks away on the Upper East Side, long the bastion of New York’s superrich. He won every block touching Central Park on the East Side between 59th and 102nd Streets, and many more nearby.\n\nThe former governor won chunks of the more liberal but still affluent Upper West Side, too, and most of TriBeCa, where the average home price is more than $3 million.\n\nMr. Mamdani, the son of a renowned filmmaker and a Columbia professor, was the choice of Brooklyn’s most exclusive neighborhoods. His margins of victory were staggering in areas like Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Park Slope and Fort Greene — where wealthy professionals and people in creative fields have congregated in recent decades.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/plane-crash-louisville-kentucky-ups.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"20:09:11-05:00","title":"What We Know About the UPS Plane Crash in Louisville","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS cargo plane, operating as Flight 2976 on an MD-11, crashed shortly after takeoff from Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky on Tuesday, November 2, 2025.

2025-11-05T05:03:24-05:00\n\nThe partisan standoff that has shut down the government became personal for Cyndie Story in late October, when she logged in to her health insurance portal to find that her premium was about to nearly double.\n\n“I just can’t swing $2,200 a month,” Ms. Story, a 60-year-old self-employed school nutrition consultant in Zebulon, Ga., said of her expected rate starting in January.\n\nMs. Story is just the kind of person Democrats say they are fighting for as they refuse to fund the government until Republicans agree to negotiate an extension of federal health care tax credits that are on track to expire at the end of the year, sending premiums soaring.\n\nBut with the shutdown entering its sixth week, she has grown alarmed by its impacts and eager for it to end. To Ms. Story, a Democrat whose small business helps feed hungry children whose families could be affected by a lapse in federal nutrition benefits, the impasse feels like “being asked to choose which arm to cut off.”\n\n“To choose between feeding hungry families and my health care,” Ms. Story said on Monday, “I’m going to feed the family.”\n\nAs the shutdown stretched into Wednesday and became the longest in history, the partisan divisions in Washington appeared as deep as ever.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said that it would be a “betrayal” for Democrats to back down now. “It would be a sellout of a working class that is struggling to survive in very difficult economic times,” he wrote in an essay for The Guardian last weekend.\n\nRecent polling suggests that Republicans are bearing the brunt of the blame for the shutdown.\n\nAmong registered voters, 46 percent blamed Republicans while 37 percent blamed Democrats, according to a Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll. Those figures were mirrored in another poll conducted by Newsweek and NBC News, which found that 52 percent of voters say Republicans and the president are more responsible for the impasse, compared with 42 percent who blame Democrats.\n\nBut in some pockets of the country, as Americans experience the effects of the closure firsthand, the calls for an end to the dysfunction and a swift reopening of the government defy party lines.\n\nIn conversations with voters in Georgia in recent days, many said that while they shared Democrats’ sense of urgency about addressing rising health care costs, they had grown impatient for the shutdown to end.\n\nIn Paulding County, frustration with both parties was easy to find. Jon Smalling, 40, a Democrat who voted in local elections this week, said: “You’ve got to blame everybody.”\n\n“I think both sides have got to give a little,” he said.\n\nMr. Smalling said he sympathized with Democrats’ focus on health care costs and was bracing for his health insurance costs to rise next year. Still, he said, “it’s gone on long enough.”\n\n“At some point,” he added, “both parties need to sit down and figure a way out.”\n\nHis congresswoman, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, has been among the very few members of Congress denouncing both sides in the stalemate. Ms. Greene, a right-wing Republican, has criticized Democrats for shutting down the government, but also rebuked her party for failing to negotiate a solution that would insulate Americans against the looming premium hikes or to offer a plan to make health care more affordable.\n\n“People are beyond outraged, and they’re terrified,” she said Tuesday on the ABC program “The View.”\n\nThe growing impatience for an end to the shutdown may be driving events in Washington, where Republicans and Democrats have both expressed optimism in recent days that a breakthrough after weeks of gridlock could be close at hand.\n\n“Finances are becoming dire for the more than 750,000 government workers who have been going without pay now for a full month,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said on the Senate floor on Tuesday.\n\n“The list of people begging Democrats to pass a clean government extension is long and it’s growing longer,” Mr. Thune said, citing calls from a growing list of labor unions and business groups. “All of these organizations are begging Democrats to take yes for an answer.”\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, was not budging.\n\n“We’re not asking for anything radical,” he said. “Lowering people’s health care costs is the definition of common sense and what Americans want all across the spectrum.”\n\nMs. Story said she agreed, and even left her congressman, Representative Brian Jack, a Republican and former Trump White House aide, a voice mail message pleading for a better solution.\n\nBut she still wants to see Democrats relent and reopen the government.\n\n“If it was up to me personally, I’d bite the bullet,” she said, quickly adding that she still wanted Congress to address health care costs.\n\nChad Hahn, a Paulding County resident who declined to share his party affiliation, voiced similar frustration.\n\n“Both sides need to figure out a solution,” he said.\n\nIn Athens, Erin Barger, the chief executive of the Food Bank of Northeast Georgia, said that even before the shutdown began, residents across the 15 counties her organization serves were experiencing “unprecedented levels of nutritional need.”\n\nShe said her team was working quickly to confront an emergency as many families they serve have already missed scheduled Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments after the Trump administration said it would cover only a portion of them.\n\n“We still know that neighbors will not have SNAP benefits on time, no matter what happens now, which we consider an emergency,” she said. “We firmly believe that food insecurity and hunger are not just bipartisan — they’re nonpartisan issues.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/us/louisville-ups-plane-crash.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"01:00:28-05:00","title":"UPS Cargo Plane Crashes in Louisville, Killing at Least 7","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS cargo plane, Flight 2976, crashed at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Tuesday, killing at least seven people and injuring 11.

Andy Beshear of Kentucky said that the plane, which was carrying three crew members, hit two businesses near the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport and that the death toll could rise. Mayor Craig Greenberg of Louisville said that four of the people who died were on the ground when the plane crashed, and that 11 others were injured.\n\nThe plane exploded into a fireball and left a fiery trail through an industrial area near the airport. Officials issued a shelter-in-place order for people living nearby. Hundreds of firefighters had nearly contained the blaze by late Tuesday, Brian O’Neill, Louisville’s fire chief, said at a news conference.\n\nThe crash disrupted operations at UPS’s air cargo headquarters, a central part of its global operations that hosts more than 300 flights and processes about two million packages a day, according to the company.\n\nMr. Greenberg said that the airport was closed on Tuesday night but would reopen on Wednesday, though the airport said that cancellations and delays were likely on Wednesday. UPS said in a statement that its Louisville hub was halting package sorting operations on Tuesday night.\n\nHelmuth Rosales/The New York Times\n\nUPS Flight 2976, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 bound for Honolulu, took off at 5:14 p.m. and climbed to 175 feet before swiftly descending, the governor said. It was carrying 38,000 gallons of jet fuel, his office said.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas was bought by Boeing in the 1990s. Boeing said in a statement that it had offered technical assistance to the National Transportation Safety Board, which will investigate the crash. The N.T.S.B. said its team would arrive in Kentucky on Wednesday.\n\nThere have been at least three crashes, two of them deadly, involving UPS planes since 2006. The most recent was in 2013, when a plane leaving Louisville crashed short of the runway in Birmingham, Ala., killing its two pilots.\n\nFootage of the crash broadcast on local television showed black smoke billowing skyward near the airport. In one video, the plane appeared to be on fire as it traveled down the runway. The plane struggled to climb, then crashed, creating an enormous fireball.\n\nBethany Adams said she was driving to her Pilates class after work when she noticed an ominous cloud in the sky.\n\n“It looked like it could spout several tornadoes,” Ms. Adams said.\n\nTwo businesses were directly hit by the plane: a waste company and an auto parts store. Mr. Beshear said that two employees at the auto parts store were unaccounted for.\n\nJoey Garber was in his office at the store, Grade A Auto Parts, on Tuesday afternoon when the power went out and the building shook.\n\n“Then we heard a bunch of explosions,” said Mr. Garber, the store’s chief operating officer. He ran outside and saw flames and plumes of black smoke engulfing the site of the company’s scrap metal department, which contains several buildings and is where the plane hit.\n\n“A bunch of people were running out that were inside those buildings,” he said.\n\nMr. Garber said an employee who safely escaped one of the buildings hit by the crash told him the power went out and someone suddenly screamed, “Everyone run, it’s coming right at us!”\n\nEmployees and customers in one of the buildings had to escape through a back window, Mr. Garber said. It was unclear how many customers were on-site at the time of the crash. The business typically sees as many as 200 to 250 customers a day, said Sean Garber, the company’s chief executive and Joey Garber’s father.\n\nShelby Shircliff, who works at the waste company that was hit, said no one was at the site at the time of the crash, though the business did have a pet cat that was most likely there. The company, which was previously called Kentucky Petroleum Recycling, is now run by GFL Environmental.\n\nDonald Anderson, of Louisville, rode a bicycle to a reunification center seeking information about his girlfriend. The couple had been collecting scrap metal earlier on Tuesday, and his girlfriend said she could run to the Louisville petroleum recycling center to cash in some of the scrap. That was around 4:30 p.m. Mr. Anderson has not heard from her since.\n\n“I’m very worried,” Mr. Anderson said. It is “very unusual not to hear from her.”\n\nMr. Beshear expressed relief that a nearby Ford Motor plant employing about 3,000 people was not hit by the plane. “With the number of employees working there, it’s a blessing,” Mr. Beshear said.\n\nMr. Beshear said no hazardous materials were ignited by the crash.\n\nJefferson County Public Schools, the main school district in Louisville, said that it was canceling classes, extracurricular activities and athletics for Wednesday.\n\nBetsy Ruhe, the city councilwoman who represents the area near the crash site, said UPS was one of Louisville’s economic backbones.\n\n“We all know somebody who works at UPS and they’re all texting their friends, their family, to make sure they’re safe,” said Ms. Ruhe, whose cousin works at UPS. “Sadly, some of those texts are going to go unanswered.”\n\nPooja Salhotra, Peter Eavis, Bernard Mokam and Kevin Williams contributed reporting.

After surveying her miniature arsenal of cough drops and aspartame-free gum, she triumphantly held up a honey-lemon Ricola as if it were the One Ring.\n\n“This,” she declared, “is a wild ride.”\n\nBig things can come in small packages, as Grande has now amply proved. Like her musical-comedy forebear Kristin Chenoweth, who originated the role of Glinda on Broadway before Grande brought her to the screen in last year’s “Wicked,” the 5-foot-2 star is a petite powerhouse. And the sequel “Wicked: For Good,” in theaters Nov. 21, will showcase Grande’s dramatic chops in a whole new way.\n\nWhile she was promoting the first film last year, there was still a lilt in Grande’s voice — and a Glinda-like glint to her blond hair — that suggested she hadn’t fully parted ways with the high-spirited character she had long dreamed of playing. But in New York, it felt like a transition was already underway. Clad in a black turtleneck and ballet flats, her hair neatly pulled back, she looked less like the bubblegum-pink Glinda and more like Audrey Hepburn auditing the Actors Studio.\n\nAt 32, Grande has already lived through several eras in the public eye — first as a teenager starring in Nickelodeon sitcoms, then as a pop princess with a string of chart-topping hits, and finally as a big-screen ingénue whose first major film role earned her an Oscar nomination. Still, we’ve never seen her go to the places she does in the second “Wicked” film, which brings Grande’s character to the fore in a much more significant way than audiences might have anticipated.\n\n“Being able to share it with people and talk about it is strange because it’s been a secret for such a long time,” she said.\n\nWhen “For Good” begins, the budding friendship between Glinda and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) has been severed, as the conniving Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and his second-in-command Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) have unfairly branded the green-skinned Elphaba a wicked witch hellbent on the destruction of Oz. Though Glinda knows the truth, she still plays along with their propaganda campaign and embraces her new role as a celebrity “good witch,” carefully crafted to be Elphaba’s opposite, that people can look up to and adore.\n\nBut all that flattery and frippery can only go so far, and the lies Glinda must cheerfully repeat begin to weigh on her. Her arranged engagement to Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) proves to be an especially miserable union, since the heartsick prince still longs for Elphaba. With her only real friend in exile, Glinda has no one left to confide in as her carefully constructed fairy-tale world falls apart.\n\nIn the film’s extensive reimagining of the Broadway musical’s second act, Glinda gets a brand-new solo number, flashbacks to her complicated childhood and some emotionally raw scenes that pushed Grande to her limits. “I have been quietly very eager this whole time for people to see the rest of her journey because she has a big arc in the first movie, and it’s just that much bigger in the second one,” Grande said.\n\nIn truth, the entire project hinged far more on Glinda’s second-film story line than anyone involved let on: Even before production began, when the director Jon M. Chu decided to split “Wicked” into two movies, he gave the first screenplay a green cover and the second a pink one. But expanding the material also made Grande’s casting a considerable risk.\n\nThough it wasn’t hard to imagine a pop star of her caliber singing the upbeat musical numbers from the first movie, nothing in her career had ever suggested she could tackle the heavy dramatic work required in the sequel. With her character often isolated or abandoned by those she loves, Grande would have to carry many of the most intense moments alone, in intimate close-ups. Wouldn’t the smarter move have been to cast an actress with more experience?\n\n“Every single person said that, including myself,” said Chu, who has also directed music videos and concert films. “I’ve worked with a lot of performers who have never led a movie before, who are becoming an actor, and there’s a huge barrier to their experience.”\n\nBut picking Grande was a risk that paid dividends. Though he initially worried his head would be on the line if Grande wasn’t up to the task, Chu found her so compelling as a dramatic actress that he began reshaping the second film around her, even adding back story scenes for Glinda in reshoots earlier this year. “In a weird way, she took the reins and I had to follow her and just capture it as much as I could,” he said.\n\nSo while Grande’s role in the first film was earning widespread acclaim last winter, Chu stayed patient in the editing room.\n\n“The whole time I was like, They don’t even know,” he said. “Movie 2, this is where the meat is.”\n\nGRANDE IS THE SORT OF PERSON who likes to write in the margins, and by the time she was done with her “For Good” screenplay, it looked something like a madman’s manifesto. Filled with scribbled notes, folded page corners and color-coded highlights meant to track Glinda’s emotional state, it was a symbol of her full-throttle commitment.\n\n“I don’t know that the projects I have acted in before required the range or the skill set that this one did,” she said. “I was on children’s television and then swept away by pop music for a long time, then I landed this extraordinary role and I wanted to earn it.”\n\nGrande soon learned she had to be ready for anything. Because both films were shot at once, she would sometimes toggle between a cheery musical moment in the first movie to a demoralized, wordless close-up in the second. At one point, when rainy London weather scuttled a planned outdoor scene, the production spontaneously moved inside to film the second movie’s wrenching 11 o’clock number.\n\nTo keep a firm grasp on Glinda through it all, Grande studied the Stella Adler acting technique, using it to meticulously plot out her character’s inner life, childhood and traumas.\n\n“This is my first time talking about it,” she said. “I just wanted to design this person inside and out, even if none of it was necessary for a scene, so that I could reference it for myself and leave my own stuff at home. So every time something had to trigger Glinda, it was a Glinda trigger that I used, not an Ariana one.”\n\nStill, some of the parallels between Grande and her character were undeniable, especially as Glinda grapples with the unexpected downsides of becoming a public figure.\n\n“When we began this journey,” Chu said, “she said to me, ‘I feel closer to Galinda’” — the character’s name in the first movie — “‘than maybe even Ariana Grande. I understand that struggle between trying to give people light and trying to understand where my light comes from myself.’”\n\nIn “For Good,” Glinda is so preoccupied with the magical power she lacks that she hardly realizes there’s an innate power within her to lead. Though the Wizard and Morrible recognize her charisma early on and exploit it for their own purposes, it takes Glinda two films to learn how to wield that gift for herself.\n\n“I’m sort of working through that as well, the permission to step into your own magic,” Grande said. “It’s so funny because in my work, I’ve always given myself that permission to kindly and lovingly ask for what I need. But when it comes to my real life, that is where I don’t know how. It’s been a work in progress for years.”\n\nThe emotional overlap between Grande and her character gave Chu the confidence that she could sustain some of the movie’s darkest moments, even as she wrestled with tumult in her personal life during the production, including a divorce and a subsequent relationship.\n\n“I got to watch her on days be upset in her real life and have to open up even more to deliver Galinda for us,” Chu said. “She was not hiding anything from this camera.”\n\nThough Grande’s big moment as a musical-comedy performer comes in the first film with the effervescent number “Popular,” her greatest challenge as a dramatic actress happens midway through the second film, when a demoralized Glinda turns the Wizard and Morrible against Elphaba’s sister. For Grande, who is so protective of how her character is seen, this moment had to be handled with the utmost care.\n\n“This sounds so silly,” she said, “but it feels personal when people accuse her of being the bad one.”\n\nOn the day that moment was shot, she kept to herself, creating a map of causality to chart what had led Glinda to this breaking point. “It’s OK that she has a worst self and that she does a thing that is not great,” she said. “That’s real.” What is the pain that pushed Glinda there, and how would she atone for it? Those were the things that most compelled Grande.\n\nWhen I first watched that sequence in “For Good,” I was surprised not only by Grande’s stripped-down performance but also by the way Chu had clearly re-conceived the scene to showcase her: Instead of cutting between the three principals, Chu lets things play out in an uncharacteristically long take that stays close on Grande’s devastated face. “The moment I saw that take, I knew that was the one that was going in the movie,” he said. It didn’t matter that there was nothing else in the film like it: “That was in my first cut when I arrived in L.A., and I never had to touch that shot.”\n\nIf they still showed extended performance clips during the Oscar telecast, you can imagine this moment would be Grande’s. But when Chu watches that sequence now, it’s her behind-the-scenes preparation that still moves him the most.\n\n“Young kids aren’t built for this,” Chu said. “Suddenly you have power and money and why would you even worry about craft if you’re getting it all anyway? And to watch her actually be different than all of what I’ve seen before, it’s amazing. It’s a miracle when one of those people comes out of this.”\n\nNEXT SUMMER, once the Oz dust has settled, Grande will embark on something she never thought she would do again: an arena tour. Meant to promote last year’s pop album “Eternal Sunshine,” the 41-show engagement will be her first such venture in seven years.\n\nGrande has always found touring to be one of the most challenging parts of the pop-star grind and she had long assumed the grueling 100-show world tour she mounted in 2019 would be her last. But working on “Wicked” changed that.\n\n“There was something broken about my relationship to pop music that was healed recently through the time away,” she said.\n\nWhen I asked what exactly it was about her pop career that needed mending, Grande laughed softly: “How much more time do we have?” Then she paused for a long time, her composure slipping.\n\n“I think it got away from me in a way I didn’t expect,” Grande said, tearing up. “There’s a thing that comes along with your dreams coming true that feels dangerous at times.”\n\nWhen she was a young girl singing show tunes in her Boca Raton bedroom, Grande envisioned a future as a musical-comedy actress on Broadway, the sort of artist whose solo albums would only be discovered by theater die-hards. But after her debut pop album, “Yours Truly,” vaulted Grande to global fame at 20, every other aspiration she had fell a distant second.\n\nThe pressures of superstardom came to define most of her adult life as Grande navigated accelerated album cycles as well as public scrutiny of her body image and the men she dated, including the late rapper Mac Miller, the comedian Pete Davidson, and the actor Ethan Slater, who plays Boq in “Wicked.”\n\nOf that level of fame, Grande shook her head and said, “Nothing prepares you for what comes with it. Until quite recently, it was really hard for me to navigate and I think it stripped a lot of joy out of this for me.”\n\nOccasionally, Grande managed to wriggle out of the pop-superstar machinery, as in 2016, when she paused promotion of her hit album “Dangerous Woman” to play Penny in NBC’s live adaptation of “Hairspray.” Why would a famous pop star be so eager to take on that second-banana role? Because it offered Grande something her high-flying music career couldn’t sate.\n\nThough working on “Wicked” was the furthest thing from a vacation, it provided a similar relief, allowing her to step away from her pop obligations and her team of representatives to sequester some place where nothing was more important than honing her craft.\n\n“And by the way, I have a different team now,” she said, alluding to her split from longtime manager Scooter Braun. “Said with love, but that was a piece.”\n\nThe shift away from the noise of pop stardom toward a more intimate and deliberate creative life is one Grande doesn’t take for granted.\n\n“I’ve never felt this connected to my art or inspired, and that’s just been such a tremendous gift,” she said. “It’s like, oh, I don’t actually have to take on those things that were projected onto me. I can focus on my art and that can be a separate entity. But I had to give myself the permission to think that.”\n\nSo what’s next? Grande has spent the fall shooting “Focker In-Law,” a “Meet the Parents” sequel in which she plays a driven, competitive woman who clashes with Ben Stiller’s Greg after she dates his son. She’ll also be appearing on the next season of “American Horror Story” and teased something stage-related coming up soon: “It’s not on Broadway, but it’s something that I’m very excited about and inspired by.”\n\nThough further acting commitments may keep her away from a full-time return to pop music, Grande isn’t walking away from the career that made her a megastar. “Of course, music will be in my life forever,” she said. “I have to say that for my fans who are reading this who are going to have a heart attack.”\n\nStill, she’s eager to make the most of her reintroduction as an actress. Though she hadn’t led a movie until her 30s, she has a bona fide blockbuster under her belt and plenty of talent left to tap. What will Hollywood do with her, now that she’s arrived on the scene as a fully formed A-lister?\n\n“Ariana Grande has always been there, we just didn’t look close enough,” Chu said. “I think in five years, she’s going to do something we would never have predicted because she has so much more to give.”\n\nAnd she’s ready to give it. For Grande, the “Wicked” era has been one of reclamation, reminding her why she loved performing in the first place.\n\n“Where do I feel I am now?” she said. “Exactly where I’m supposed to be.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/05/business/economy/trump-tariffs-us-imports.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"20:54:06-05:00","title":"Almost Half of U.S. Imports Now Have Steep Tariffs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A New York Times analysis of U.S. Census Bureau trade data reveals that nearly half of all goods entering the United States are now subject to tariffs, a dramatic shift from previous trade policies based on WTO agreements.

2025-11-04T20:54:06-05:00\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau international trade data. The New York Times\n\nJust under half of all goods that enter the United States are now subject to tariffs, a New York Times analysis of Census Bureau trade data shows, a stark sign of how President Trump has reshaped American trade since returning to office in January.\n\nThroughout the year, Mr. Trump has issued wave after wave of new duties, targeting almost every country in the world at levels not seen in roughly a century. The legality of the bulk of the new tariffs is now in jeopardy, as the Supreme Court on Wednesday begins hearing a case that challenges Mr. Trump’s use of an emergency powers law to impose the levies.\n\nIf the court rules against the president, it will nullify a major tool in Mr. Trump’s trade agenda. He has used the law under question, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose tariffs on an estimated 29 percent of all U.S. imports, the Times analysis found. So far this year, these emergency tariffs have hit more than $300 billion in imported goods.\n\nThis illustrates both how much the president has transformed longstanding U.S. trade policy in favor of protectionist tariffs and how much is at stake for him in the unfolding legal battle.\n\nThe Times analysis, based on years of product-level import data, provides one of the fullest glimpses yet of the White House’s attempt to rewire the global trade order.\n\nBefore Mr. Trump’s second term, almost all imports entered under long-established trade rules that were agreed upon within the World Trade Organization, the analysis shows. By July of this year, when many of Mr. Trump’s tariffs began taking effect, that trend had been inverted.\n\nNow, more than 90 percent of imports are subject to some aspect of Mr. Trump’s trade policy — a tariff he announced this year or during his first term, or a sweeping exemption granted to some products, at least temporarily.\n\nMr. Trump has used a broad range of presidential authorities to issue tariffs this year. He has imposed industry-specific duties on steel, automobiles, lumber and other products, using a national security provision known as Section 232. Those tariffs — as well as levies issued under separate legal authorities, some of which stem from his first term — are not being challenged at the Supreme Court.\n\nThat means that regardless of what the justices decide, nearly 16 percent of American imports will remain heavily tariffed.\n\nEvery nation is affected by a different mix of these new trade rules, meaning that a court ruling overturning the emergency powers act could be far more consequential for some countries than for others.\n\nSource: Analysis of U.S. Census Bureau international trade data. The New York Times\n\nChina was already subject to protectionist tariffs that were imposed during Mr. Trump’s first term, then expanded under the Biden administration. These tariffs, which affect more than half the country’s exports to the United States, would also remain in effect regardless of the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nThe emergency power tariffs imposed a higher rate on all Chinese imports, and in many cases, they are added on to existing duties. That means that China’s trade-weighted average rate — more than 40 percent — is one of the highest in the world.\n\nGoods from the European Union, on the other hand, largely entered the country duty-free before Mr. Trump’s second term. Only about a quarter of E.U. exports to the United States faced a tariff; now, roughly 60 percent face a tariff. Much of those are subject to the tariffs under review by the Supreme Court.\n\nFor some countries, emergency power tariffs have been largely toothless.\n\nMr. Trump used the emergency power law to issue tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico in the first months of his term, saying the countries had not done enough to stop the flow of fentanyl and migrants into the United States — what he deemed national emergencies. The fentanyl tariffs were then revised to cover only goods not entering under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a free trade deal that Mr. Trump signed during his first term.\n\nMost imports from the United States’ two closest trading partners, however, qualify for the U.S.M.C.A. trade deal. Their goods now enter duty-free, side stepping the harsh new provisions Mr. Trump has enacted.\n\nIn fact, the share of goods entering the United States from Canada duty-free has increased since Mr. Trump took office, despite an intense trade clash between the countries. That’s mainly because U.S. imports from Canada have dropped and what is entering is much more likely to be covered by U.S.M.C.A. tariff exemptions.\n\nSome imports from Canada and Mexico are subject to Mr. Trump’s tariffs on industries like automobiles, lumber and steel, and those would remain in place even if the court overturned Mr. Trump’s emergency tariffs.\n\nThe administration has also issued broad exemptions to its tariffs, often to ensure that critical products from certain nations remain available to consumers. Ireland is a major exporter of name-brand drugs to the United States, and many pharmaceuticals from Ireland have been given exemptions. A trade deal between the United States and European Union also caps the tariff rates on pharmaceuticals at 15 percent, sparing them from rates that could be as high as 100 percent.\n\nMany Taiwanese imports are similarly spared by an exemption on smartphones, computers and other electronics that was set up in April, shortly after many of Mr. Trump’s emergency tariffs went into effect. The administration has said those electronics will be subject to new tariffs in the future, although it’s unknown how high they could be.\n\nSome countries are already heavily affected by industry-specific tariffs, perhaps most notably economies that export automobiles to the United States.\n\nNearly a third of Japan’s exports to the United States are subject to auto tariffs, which were set at 25 percent before a trade deal lowering them to 15 percent was reached. South Korea is also heavily exposed to the auto tariffs and appears to be close to reaching a similar deal.\n\nIf the president’s power to wield tariffs is limited by the Supreme Court, the White House could wield these kinds of industry duties much more widely in the months to come.\n\nTo estimate the share of U.S. imports covered under different tariff regimes, The New York Times analyzed years of international trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The data covers imports through July 2025, the latest available month because of the government shutdown.\n\nThe classification of imported goods is determined by the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States code. For each trading partner, data was analyzed at the 10-digit H.T.S.U.S. level — the most detailed level available — and further broken out by the rate provision code under which the goods entered. Using the rate provision codes, we classified the share of imports by value entering under various broad categories.\n\n“Duty-free” includes anything entering under Provision Codes 00, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17 and 18. “Regular tariffs” includes anything entering under Provision Codes 61, 62, 64 and 70. “Exempted” consists of Provision Code 19.\n\nThe Times further classified the share of trade entering under Provision Codes 69 and 79, which contain imports tariffed under special rules, by cross-referencing those goods against the list of goods subject to Section 232 and Section 301 legal authorities for imposing tariffs. Goods that entered under Provision Codes 69 and 79, which are tariffed under special rules and are not in a Section 232 or Section 301 list and are considered to be subject to IEEPA “reciprocal” and “fentanyl” tariffs. In the case of China, imports covered under just Section 301, or both Section 301 and Section 232, are considered China-specific tariffs. Imports from Hong Kong are not subject to Section 301 tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/magazine/ukraine-russia-war-drones.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:01:06-05:00","title":"A Harrowing Escape From the Drone-Infested Hellscape of Ukraine’s Front Lines","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Ukrainian infantryman, Aleksandr, was attacked by a Russian remotely piloted drone during a night patrol in an open meadow near the front lines.

2025-11-05T05:01:06-05:00\n\nAleksandr heard the whine of an approaching Russian drone. A Ukrainian infantryman on a four-soldier foot patrol, he was picking his way at 2 a.m. through the waist-high vegetation of an August meadow. A high-pitched whir rose in the moonless quiet. An armed multicopter had detected them and was maneuvering to attack.\n\nNow luck would influence fates. The soldiers were on a mission to string wire across the forlorn emptiness between opposing trench lines, creating obstacles to entangle Russian infantry and strip invaders on motocross bikes from their seats. Weighed down by equipment, they were caught in the open and exposed. The nearest hint of protection — the woodlot they stepped out from minutes before — was about 300 yards back.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine operate remotely piloted mini-aircraft that watch over the battlefield with cameras and pursue targets on sight. Some drop bomblets. Others sweep low with explosive charges to strike quarry kamikaze-style. All fly more than twice the speed that even a fit soldier can sprint, a disparity ensuring that many engagements end in one-sided agonies and video-recorded gore. In this new form of warfare, chance still plays a role. When multiple soldiers appear together, most drones cannot strike them all. A pilot must decide: This man? That one? The fleeing soldier who tripped, becoming an easy kill? Or the pair running together who might be felled two at once?\n\nThe pilot chose Aleksandr, a silhouette holding a rifle in tall grass.\n\nThe drone stopped above him and released a small explosive munition. After a brief free fall, it landed beside him on dirt.\n\nLight flashed in Aleksandr’s eyes, accompanied by a blast that threw him down. His luck was bad: Shrapnel tore through him; pain flared in his left leg. His luck was good: The drone did not linger for the finish. It darted away, chasing his peers as they bounded for trees. Bleeding, pressed to soil, he heard more explosions, off in the direction from where he had come.\n\nQuiet settled over the field.\n\nAleksandr sat up. The Russian pilot, he thought, had mistaken him for dead. Or perhaps the drone, an improvised weapon based on a consumer gadget, was out of ammunition or needed a battery change. Whatever the reason, it no longer hunted here. Aleksandr was left wounded in the void of no man’s land, a zone surveilled by drones and roamed by animals scavenging the fallen. The darkness was almost total. Blood pulsed out from his lower leg, soaking his sock and boot. He pulled a tourniquet from his first-aid kit, slipped it around his calf and cinched it tight, then assessed his injuries by sliding his hands down the limb, feeling where shrapnel had blown through his shin. Without light, he could not see the wound but sensed it was bad. Bones were shattered and he could not move his foot, which he assumed hung by loose flesh and skin.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Forests\n\nPublished: 2025-11-05T05:02:24-05:00\n\nTo mow down a forest is usually lucrative. You can sell the wood, then clear areas for animals to graze, or mine for valuable ores, or grow corn or other crops year after year.\n\nThis is how most of the world’s tropical rainforests have vanished in the past 25 years, including in Brazil.\n\nBrazil is trying to change that. On Thursday it is due to announce the establishment of an ambitious fund designed to pay countries to keep their tropical forests standing. As many as 74 countries with tropical forests stand to gain a total of $4 billion per year if they leave their forests alone.\n\nIf fully financed, the fund would represent nearly three times the current volume of international forest financing, Brazilian officials have said. “It will mobilize large-scale capital with sustained financial flows to conserve our biodiversity,” Brazil’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, said this year.\n\nCritics say the fund’s structure has some flaws that could block success. It relies on raising $25 billion from governments and philanthropies to kick-start the fund, which is a tall order.\n\nOthers worry it’s not future-proof. Governments change from election to election, and even in Brazil, a future administration may be more interested in the proceeds from deforestation than in the proceeds from saving trees.\n\nThe fund foresees payments of around $4 per hectare, $1.60 per acre, of standing forest, which may not offer enough of an incentive to prevent deforestation, and it applies to areas with only 20 percent forest cover, which some environmentalists say sets the bar too low.\n\nTropical forests are inherently valuable. They are rich in biodiversity, and forests swallow vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, slowing down the heating of the planet. They regulate the hydrological cycle and also local weather.\n\nBy turning these standing forests into a protected asset, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, as the new financial instrument is called, seeks to monetize their value as a global public good and give forested nations financial incentives to not destroy them.\n\nInvestors in the fund stand to earn around 5 percent, according to an assessment by Zero Carbon Analytics, an independent research group.\n\n“It’s meant to reward countries for maintaining standing forests, and the measurement is only meant to be of forest cover,” said Andrew Deutz, managing director for global policy at the World Wildlife Fund, who has worked with Brazil on creating the new financing instrument.\n\nThe requirement for being paid is simple: Use satellite imagery to show that forests remain in place, and then receive money.\n\nThere is still a lot of forest to save. Forests cover about one-third of the Earth’s land mass, around 4 billion hectares. And while deforestation rates have slowed, they haven’t slowed nearly enough, international assessments have found. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, a United Nations agency, roughly 11 million hectares of forest ecosystems are disappearing every year.\n\nCountries with an annual deforestation rate above 0.5 percent are ineligible for payouts. That includes Indonesia, which has for many years rapidly lost forests to oil palm-oil cultivation and to mining.\n\nPalm oil, a leading driver of deforestation in Southeast Asia, is used in a range of processed foods and cosmetics. Soybeans, which are used to feed cattle, chickens and pigs for human consumption, are the third-largest driver of deforestation overall.\n\nOne-fifth of the payments are supposed to go to forest communities, though that may be difficult to enforce, particularly in countries where forest communities have few rights.\n\nThe fund is different from what is currently offered on the global market. Earlier systems for protecting forests were typically designed around assigning so-called carbon credits that can be bought or sold. The idea being that, say, a company that wished to offset its emissions of greenhouse gases would pay to purchase a credit representing protected forestland that would pull one ton of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, offsetting the company’s emissions. But systems like this have proven difficult to measure and verify, and the nascent carbon-credit market has faced concerns about its integrity.\n\nCarbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, warms the world by acting as a blanket in the atmosphere, trapping the sun’s heat.\n\nTo get started, the fund needs to mobilize $25 billion. That’s supposed to come from the governments and philanthropies, with private investors contributing the remaining $100 billion. So far, Brazil has put in $1 billion. The World Bank is managing the fund.\n\nThe forest fund is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s ambitions at the annual United Nations global climate conference, which begins on Thursday in the Amazonian city of Belém.\n\nPresident Lula has yet to raise anywhere close to the $25 billion required to set up the fund, and he faces powerful agribusiness industries that stand to gain from deforestation. The Amazonian state of Pará, where the climate talks are being held, is one of the states in Brazil with the largest deforestation risks, along with nearby Mato Grosso State. Deforestation has declined significantly in the past three years of Mr. Lula’s tenure.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/science/moon-asteroids-impact.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:02:18-05:00","title":"What Were Those 2 Spooky Flashes That Lit Up the Moon?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two bright flashes on the Moon were captured by Japanese astronomer Daichi Fujii over a span of two days, likely caused by small asteroids crashing into the lunar surface at speeds up to 60,000 miles per hour.

Moon?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-05T05:02:18-05:00\n\nLast week, a handful of watching telescopes captured something crashing into the moon. Then over the weekend, a second object punctured its silvery surface.\n\nThe two incidents were a reminder that the moon is not so much the serene orb we clearly see in night skies a few nights a month but rather a noisy battleground constantly gaining new craters.\n\nThe two lunar impacts were picked up by Daichi Fujii, a curator at the Hiratsuka City Museum in Japan, who keeps his telescopes trained on the moon’s surface. On Thursday, at 8:33 p.m. local time, he spotted a brief luminous outburst in the darkness. Then, on Saturday at 8:49 p.m., “I caught another bright one,” he said.\n\nThese flashes may have happened either side of Halloween, but there is nothing spooky going on here. Both were the result of asteroids smashing into the lunar surface.\n\nWithout an atmosphere to slow them, these two space rocks pounded into the moon’s volcanic soil at speeds of up to 60,000 miles per hour, about 30 times as fast as a fighter jet. The sizes of the objects are unknown, but even an asteroid just a few feet in length traveling at that speed would unleash a powerful explosion equivalent to a modest stockpile of dynamite — a fleeting firestorm that can be seen hundreds of thousands of miles away here on Earth.\n\nSuch lunar impact events are important to astronomers, who use them to figure out how often the moon is pummeled by smaller asteroids. Then, they can refine their estimates of how many larger asteroids are out there — the sort that can plunge through our planet’s atmosphere to potentially devastating effect.\n\nMr. Fujii, an astronomy enthusiast, is bewitched by the ever-changing nature of the night sky. “I want the public to enjoy science,” he said. And one way to do that is to show them how often the moon is struck by rocky missiles.\n\nMr. Fujii uses several telescopes in two locations — Fuji and Hiratsuka — to keep an eye on Earth’s alabaster companion. Software automatically detects motion and explosions on the lunar surface.\n\nThis setup has worked wonders: He has documented about 60 lunar impacts since 2011. Seeing two back-to-back impacts, though, is less common.\n\nThe first flash, on Thursday, emerged just east of the 70-mile-wide Gassendi Crater. The second appeared west of Oceanus Procellarum, or the “Ocean of Storms”— a colossal 1,600-mile-long plain filled with crystallized magma.\n\nSometimes flashes on the moon are made by illusions: cosmic rays that show up as strange sparks on telescopes. Were these two flashes genuine?\n\nWhen asked, America’s space agency was unable to comment. “NASA is currently closed due to a lapse in government funding,” a spokesperson replied, via email. (The planetary defense observatories funded by NASA continue to operate during the shutdown.)\n\nThe European Space Agency’s own telescopes did not see the flashes, as the moon was too bright when seen from Europe at the time they occurred. But because several telescopes in Japan caught the same glimmers from different angles, it’s easy to call them asteroid strikes.\n\n“Those impact flashes seem real,” said Juan Luis Cano, an aerospace engineer with the European Space Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. “What caught my eye is that they both seem to be somewhat above the average in terms of flash size” — suggesting they might have been more energetic impacts than usual.\n\nThe provenance of these asteroids isn’t certain. But Mr. Fujii suspects they might have come from the Taurid meteor shower, which streams off the Comet Encke. The Taurids, which peak this month, are known to feature larger-than-average meteors that move at particularly high speeds. It wouldn’t be surprising, then, if some crashed into the moon instead of flaming out in Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nMr. Fujii hopes that his vigilance will help improve lunar security. Both space agencies and private companies are seeking to make the moon an inhabited place — something not without its risks, including potential space rock strikes.\n\n“Understanding the frequency and energy of impact flashes can be used to inform the design and operation of lunar bases,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/world/europe/what-to-know-about-the-militia-that-kidnapped-elizabeth-tsurkov.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:05:04-05:00","title":"What to Know About the Militia That Kidnapped Elizabeth Tsurkov","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kataib Hezbollah, a powerful Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, kidnapped Israeli-Russian citizen Elizabeth Tsurkov in March 2023 and held her for over two years, subjecting her to torture and sexual assault.

What to Know About the Militia That Kidnapped Elizabeth Tsurkov\n\nPublished: 2025-11-05T05:05:04-05:00\n\nKataib Hezbollah, the militia that held Elizabeth Tsurkov hostage for more than two years, is one of the most hard-line and powerful Iranian proxies in Iraq.\n\nThe militia kidnapped Ms. Tsurkov, a citizen of Israel and Russia, in March 2023 in Baghdad, she told The New York Times in an interview. U.S. and Israeli officials confirmed that the group abducted her.\n\nMs. Tsurkov said she was beaten, subjected to psychological torture and sexually assaulted during her captivity. She was released in September after the United States put pressure on Iraq’s government, according to three U.S. officials.\n\nAfter her release, Kataib Hezbollah claimed knowledge of her captivity and shared details that she had provided in forced confessions, suggesting the militia had held her. The group declined to respond to questions.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Kataib Hezbollah, which the U.S. government considers a foreign terrorist organization and has repeatedly targeted with airstrikes in Iraq.\n\nIran’s theocratic regime has long wanted U.S. forces out of the Middle East. So it responded quickly when the United States led an invasion of Iran’s neighbor, Iraq, in 2003. Iran recruited, trained and armed Iraqi Shiite militias to attack American troops on Iraqi soil.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2011, Iran-backed militias in Iraq were responsible for the deaths of at least 603 American troops in Iraq, according to the U.S. military. One of those groups was Kataib Hezbollah, which was founded after the 2003 invasion. It is a separate organization from the Hezbollah movement backed by Iran in Lebanon.\n\nFrom its inception, the militia was closely tied to Iran’s Quds Force — the overseas arm of the powerful Revolutionary Guards. It made evicting U.S. forces from Iraq a primary focus.\n\nKataib Hezbollah’s repeated attacks on U.S. Army posts in Iraq and Syria over the years contributed to Washington’s decision in 2009 to designate it as a foreign terrorist organization.”\n\nDuring the Iraq war, Kataib Hezbollah, which translates to Party of God Brigades, used deadly roadside bombs and other means to target U.S. forces.\n\nIn 2014, the terrorist group Islamic State took over large parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria. Iran and its proxies in Iraq found themselves sharing a common enemy with the United States.\n\nKataib Hezbollah joined with other mostly Shiite militias to fill the vacuum left by Iraq’s faltering military forces and take on the battle against Islamic State, or ISIS.\n\nLoosely organized under an umbrella called the Popular Mobilization Forces, or P.M.F., those militias helped wrest back territory and, after years of fighting, demolished ISIS’s self-declared caliphate.\n\nOnce ISIS was largely defeated in Iraq, Kataib Hezbollah returned its attention to driving U.S. forces out of Iraq.\n\nThat left the Iraqi government in an uncomfortable position. It was too weak to establish true authority over some of the more established Iran-backed Shiite militias. And Kataib Hezbollah was the most powerful, militarily, among them.\n\nEventually, the P.M.F. came under the formal supervision of Iraq’s national security forces. But factions like Kataib Hezbollah continued to operate with significant independence from the government and remained under Iran’s influence.\n\nWhen the first Trump administration restored harsh economic sanctions on Iran, the militias closest to Tehran started increasingly striking American targets in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn 2019, Kataib Hezbollah was accused of an attack on an Iraqi air base that killed an American contractor. That contributed to the U.S. decision to kill Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leader of Iran’s Quds Force, while he was visiting Iraq.\n\nThe Iraqi militant leader who helped found Kataib Hezbollah, known by the nom de guerre Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, was killed alongside Mr. Suleimani — underscoring the close and persistent ties between the militia and its patron, Iran.\n\nIran has long supported Kataib Hezbollah by providing weapons and other aid. Today, the group is considered “the strongest and most ideological pro-Iran militia in Iraq,” according to the Atlantic Council, a think tank.\n\nKataib Hezbollah is also partly financed by the Iraqi government, with thousands of its members drawing salaries from the state.\n\nThe group has long pressed Iraqi leaders to expel U.S. troops from the country.\n\nIsrael’s war in Gaza against Hamas, another Iran-linked militant group, offered some new clarity about the current state of Kataib Hezbollah’s military capabilities.\n\nOnce Israeli forces began a military offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, other Iran-backed militias in the Middle East like Kataib Hezbollah responded with attacks on U.S. troops in Syria and Iraq, targeting Israel’s most important ally.\n\nBy early 2024, those groups had conducted more than 150 rocket and missile strikes directed at U.S. troops.\n\nThe United States responded with strikes in January 2024 that targeted training sites and storage areas for weaponry belonging to Kataib Hezbollah and other Iran-affiliated groups in Iraq.\n\nAlissa J.

Chapter\n\nPublished: 2025-11-04T21:54:34-05:00\n\nCongratulations to Zohran Mamdani, who has become the mayor-elect of New York after a stunningly effective campaign. He began it with little name recognition, let alone support, and captured New Yorkers’ attention with a joyful, social-media-driven campaign that focused on the city’s onerous cost of living. After winning the Democratic primary in June, he reached out to critics and displayed a pragmatic streak. From beginning to end, he outcompeted New York’s tired political establishment, vanquishing technocrats with more experience as well as the incumbent mayor and a former governor. On Tuesday Mr. Mamdani won a comfortable victory.\n\nThis board did not support his primary campaign, owing to our concerns about his policy proposals and his inexperience. But we are rooting for his success. New York — the world’s most dynamic city, but one where many residents feel priced out of a good life — needs him to succeed. The city’s direction is especially important now, when President Trump is flouting the law to consolidate power and falsely casting the country’s biggest cities as out of control. He has already begun to treat Mr. Mamdani as a foil.\n\nFor Mr. Mamdani to be effective, he will need to grapple with the recent history of big-city civic leaders promising bold, progressive change. They have mostly delivered disappointment, including in Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Ore., as well as in New York City itself under Bill de Blasio. They have tolerated a level of disorder that many voters found unacceptable and struggled to make progress on affordability or K-12 schools. Mr. de Blasio had one major success that Mr. Mamdani justly cites as an inspiration: universal pre-K, which has helped hundreds of thousands of children. Still, Mr. de Blasio’s overall record made him so unpopular that he could not win the Democratic nomination for a House district in Brooklyn after he left office.\n\nMr. Mamdani, who campaigned on sweeping promises, can build a more positive legacy by focusing on tangible accomplishments. He should take notes from successful mayors, moderate and progressive alike, including Muriel Bowser of Washington, Mike Duggan of Detroit and Michelle Wu of Boston, who have delivered concrete solutions to specific problems. Mr. Mamdani cannot solve economic inequality, the problem that fueled his campaign. But he can make progress. He can build more housing. He can expand the availability of child care and good schools. He can improve bus and subway speeds.\n\nIf he succeeds, he will offer a model of Democratic Party governance at a time when many Americans are skeptical of the party and have departed Democratic-run states for Republican-run ones. Across U.S. history, political progressives have a proud record of using government to ameliorate extreme inequality and enabling more Americans to live well. Mr. Mamdani has an opportunity to write the next chapter in that story.\n\nIn almost every area that featured prominently in the mayoral campaign, Mr. Mamdani can improve life in New York by marrying his admirable ambition to pragmatism and compromise. We will focus on six areas, and offer a yardstick for each.\n\nThe cost of housing is a defining problem of New York life. The city faces an affordability crisis mostly because its political leaders have sharply limited construction since the 1960s. They have made it difficult to replace existing buildings with larger ones in a misguided effort to preserve communities. The effect has been gentrification. Constricted supply has led to higher prices.\n\nUntil recently, Mr. Mamdani seemed determined to ignore the government’s role. He blamed landlords and developers and argued for more stringent rent stabilization, which does nothing to help people who do not already live in stabilized apartments. But housing is one of the areas in which he has demonstrated a willingness to listen.\n\nIn his campaign, Mr. Mamdani said that he had changed his mind about the need for more private development. That is vital because private developers have far more capacity to expand the housing stock than the government. He can make a difference by backing a bolder version of Mayor Eric Adams’s City of Yes plan, allowing denser development around transit stations and reducing requirements for elevators, among other things.\n\nMr. Mamdani is correct that the government also has a crucial role in subsidizing housing for lower-income New Yorkers, and he has proposed the construction of 200,000 rent-stabilized housing units. The plan faces obstacles, but the goal is a good one.\n\nThe yardstick: Experts estimate that New York needs about half a million new homes over the next decade, so a good measure of Mr. Mamdani’s performance will be whether the number of units under construction climbs toward 50,000 a year.\n\nMr. Mamdani has pledged to make buses both free and faster. Of the two goals, speed is more important.\n\nFaster buses — and subways — would help almost all New Yorkers, especially those who commute longer distances. Today, local buses travel at an average speed of just eight miles per hour. A dedicated bus lane on 14th Street in Manhattan has shown that improvement is possible, leading to faster speeds, fewer crashes and more riders. (Unfortunately, the Trump administration has halted a similar plan for 34th Street.)\n\nMr. Mamdani’s plan for free buses would obviously reduce costs for many New Yorkers, but it would leave the system without the revenue it needs to pay for speed improvements. Free buses could also reduce the sense of security for riders, turning buses into homeless shelters. Trying to wish away trade-offs like these is one of the mistakes that progressive leaders elsewhere have made.\n\nA better idea, championed by transportation planners, would enact a reduced fare for all riders on major bus routes, particularly those used by low-income riders. If Mr. Mamdani and Gov. Kathy Hochul can work together to make this happen, they would speed commutes and persuade more riders to use the transit system rather than cars.\n\nThe yardstick: Mr. Mamdani should aspire to raise average bus speeds to 10 miles per hour — a failed pledge of Mr. de Blasio’s — and average subway speeds closer to 20 miles per hour than the current 17.\n\nTypical New York families with young children today pay more than one quarter of their incomes for child care, leaving too little money for everything else. Mr. Mamdani has promised to deliver free, universal child care starting at 6 weeks old. It is a worthy goal. Decades of evidence have made clear that high-quality child care is a good investment, for both children’s development and parents’ ability to work.\n\nHe is unlikely to achieve this goal in full, given its costs and the lack of an obvious revenue source. He favors tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, which Ms. Hochul opposes. Still, it would be a signature accomplishment if he could fix the many problems with the current preschool system for 3-year-olds, including the long distances some families must travel to claim open spots, and begin to create a universal care program for 2-year-olds.\n\nThe yardstick: Only about two-thirds as many children are enrolled in the program for 3-year-olds as are in the one for 4-year-olds. By the end of 2027, all 3-year-olds should be able to enroll in a class convenient to their homes.\n\nEven though crime has fallen over the past couple of years, polls show that many New Yorkers remain concerned about it. Their worries are legitimate. Crime is still considerably higher than it was before the Covid-19 pandemic began. The rate of major felonies — a category that includes car thefts, burglaries, felony assaults, rape and murder — is on pace to be about 25 percent higher this year than it was in 2019.\n\nMajor felonies by year in New York City\n\nMajor felonies by year in New York City\n\nThe 12-month estimate for 2025 is based on data through Oct. 26. Source: New York Police Department\n\nThe past few decades have offered strong evidence about how to reduce crime, including lower-level crimes that foster a sense of disorder. The solution involves substantial policing, with officers who know the communities they patrol. Yet New York employs almost 3,000 fewer police officers than it did pre-Covid, a decline of 8 percent. Fortunately, Mr. Mamdani has stopped using the anti-police rhetoric he once did, and said he would ask Jessica Tisch, the current commissioner, to stay in the job. She has presided over crime declines this year and wants to hire more officers.\n\nMr. Mamdani continues to favor alternatives to police officers in certain situations, such as encounters with mentally ill people. Some of these ideas have shown promising results elsewhere, although they typically require collaboration between social-services workers and police officers, given the safety risks. Ultimately, New York should pursue an all-of-the-above approach that combines more officers and alternatives when feasible.\n\nThe yardstick: Major crime should return to the levels of the late 2010s, if not lower. That would require a decline of about 25,000 major felonies relative to the current annual level.\n\nMr. Mamdani has given less attention to education policy than he has to some other areas. He has even proposed that the mayor give up control of the city’s schools and decentralize authority to teachers and parents. That would be a mistake. The K-12 school system, like early child care, is crucial to the city’s future. And the most successful models of educational progress have depended on a strong central authority.\n\nChildren in Mississippi and Louisiana, for example, have made exciting recent gains in reading thanks to statewide policies that combine teacher training and high standards; most students there cannot advance to fourth grade without meeting a literacy minimum. Chicago outpaced other big cities in the 2010s with a top-down model in which the city held principals accountable for their students’ academic progress. There are no similarly inspiring stories involving cities where mayors ignored the schools.\n\nWe hope Mr. Mamdani uses the power he will soon have to improve the nation’s largest school district. He should be careful not to get bogged down by divisive issues — such as the future of relatively small gifted and talented programs — and focus on the programs that educate the most children.\n\nThe yardstick: Only 29 percent of eighth graders in New York are proficient at reading and only 23 percent are proficient in math, according to federal data. That is roughly average for a large U.S. city. It is also unacceptable. Both numbers should rise substantially under the Mamdani administration.\n\nMany business leaders are wary of Mr. Mamdani, if not outright alarmed, because of his embrace of socialism. But some executives who have met with Mr. Mamdani since his primary win have emerged hopeful. Both he and they should recognize that they have a common interest in the city’s well-being and in preserving its status as a hub of business and finance.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s No. 1 promise is to make New York more affordable for residents. He should extend that goal to the city’s small businesses, which also are struggling. Prime targets include simplifying regulations and making better use of tax policy to support small businesses. One example: Landlords should have an incentive to offer longer leases to independent businesses.\n\nThe yardstick: More businesses have closed than opened in recent quarters. Mr. Mamdani should set a goal of increasing the number of businesses operating in New York by 10 percent during his first term.\n\nMr. Mamdani will take office on Jan. 1, 2026, with a reservoir of good will. He inspires young people who are cynical about politics. He will be the city’s first Muslim mayor, its youngest mayor in more than a century and its first immigrant mayor since the 1970s.\n\nBut the reasons that many New Yorkers are skeptical of him also deserve to be taken seriously. He had almost no management experience before his campaign, and extreme rhetoric was his normal mode of communication until recently. He called the New York Police Department “a major threat to public safety.” He initially refused to condemn Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel. To this day, he proudly identifies with the Democratic Socialists of America, whose platform supports open borders, voting access for noncitizens and a weaker U.S. military.\n\nHe can win at least some of his skeptics over by getting results as mayor. He should start by building a leadership team light on democratic socialists and heavy on officials with records of accomplishment and proven management skills. He should then remain laser-focused on tangible improvements to city life. If he can build a more affordable city where New Yorkers feel as safe as they did in the early 2010s, where the subways and buses move more quickly, where both schools and early child care improve and where good-paying jobs are plentiful, he will have a claim on being one of the city’s great mayors.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Or, as Stephen Colbert put it, “everyone New Yorkers love.”\n\n“Cuomo has been polling behind in the race, but yesterday, he picked up a big endorsement, when Trump posted: ‘Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice’ — which, incidentally, was Andrew Cuomo’s go-to pickup line.” — STEPHEN COLBERT\n\n“Cuomo has also been endorsed by Subway Seat Puddle, your neighbor with the trumpet, and angry man in the park who wants you to know that you’ll burn in hell and/or do you have a boyfriend?” — STEPHEN COLBERT\n\n“Former governor Andrew Cuomo was trailing the newcomer, Zohran Mamdani, by about 16 points. But Cuomo picked up a last-minute endorsement from Trump and Elon Musk, so now he’s trailing by 30 points.” — JIMMY KIMMEL\n\n“Right before the election, Elon Musk endorsed Andrew Cuomo for mayor — or, as Cuomo put it, ‘Not helping.’” — JIMMY FALLON\n\n“Meanwhile, President Trump also endorsed Andrew Cuomo, and Cuomo was, like, ‘OK, that’s enough endorsements, OK?’” — JIMMY FALLON\n\n“New York City elected a new mayor today.

They worked side by side in Republican administrations, their wives and children were close, their families spent Thanksgiving together, they shared the same wedding anniversary.\n\nTheir relationship broke over the Iraq war.\n\nDonald J. Trump brought them back together again.\n\nIraq, of course, was a defining moment of Mr. Cheney’s life in government. Like many Americans, Mr. Adelman supported the war at first, only to grow disenchanted. He and Mr. Cheney stopped speaking for 16 years. Then Mr. Trump came along, and Mr. Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney spoke out against him. And so, one day, Mr. Cheney and his old friend were on the phone again, putting “the void years,” as Mr. Adelman put it, behind them.\n\nTheir reconciliation speaks to the complicated place Mr. Cheney occupies in the public life of the nation at this point in its story. When he left office in 2009 as the most influential vice president in history, Mr. Cheney was to many the embodiment of an unpopular and bloody war. By the time he died on Monday night, he had become an unlikely voice of resistance to what he saw as a different kind of threat to America, allied not just with those who had soured on him, like Mr. Adelman, but even with others who used to call him a war criminal.\n\nIt led to the head-spinning moment in 2022 when Mr. Cheney joined his daughter on the floor of the House as the only Republicans there to mark the first anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Democrats who once considered Mr. Cheney the chief villain of Washington rushed up to greet him warmly. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the speaker who used to joust with Mr. Cheney, held his hand as she spoke with him. And it led to his statement last fall that he would vote for Vice President Kamala Harris over Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Cheney never changed his mind about the war, and neither have his critics. But he saw his opposition to Mr. Trump as consistent with a lifetime of defending the nation. To the former vice president, Mr. Trump was the antithesis of a true conservative, willing to burn down the constitutional house for his own self-aggrandizement and accumulation of power, most notoriously by trying to overturn the 2020 election that he had lost.\n\n“Here was somebody running against everything he had worked for his whole life,” Mr. Adelman reflected on Tuesday after Mr. Cheney’s death was announced by his family. “There was no doubt that we were going to be on the same side on Trump because of his break with all the policies we stood for over the years and his opposition to a peaceful transfer of power, which is the basis of American government.”\n\nMr. Cheney was always more complicated than the cartoonish image that emerged during his eight years as President George W. Bush’s No. 2. It was true that he singularly drove policy more than any of his predecessors, but insiders said he was never the puppet master that many imagined. Indeed, by the second term, Mr. Bush had begun moving away from him on many issues, instead relying more on his secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice.\n\nMr. Cheney was calm and unflappable, he mastered his briefing books and, while partisan, he maintained friendships across the aisle when he served as White House chief of staff, congressman and defense secretary. But many confused his moderate mien with moderate politics and were surprised that he turned out to be so conservative as vice president. In fact, he was always conservative; when The Washington Post referred to him during his House days as a moderate, he had an aide call for a correction.\n\nHe was the steady hand on Sept. 11, 2001, helping coordinate the response to Al Qaeda’s attacks from the bunker under the White House, and he was a powerful advocate for the robust counterterrorism campaign that followed, including extreme interrogation techniques like waterboarding that were widely viewed as torture. He never entertained doubts about those policies and believed that preventing another Sept. 11 justified them. “I firmly believe that it was the right thing to do,” he said after leaving office. “It worked.”\n\nWith a trademark crooked grin, he had a dry wit and embraced his dark image. When his friend David Hume Kennerly jokingly asked, “Have you blown away any small countries this morning?” Mr. Cheney replied, “You know, that’s the one thing about this job I really love.” At another point, he puckishly tried on a Darth Vader mask that aides had bought and posed for a picture. When he later tried to put the picture in his memoir, his wife, Lynne Cheney, talked him out of it.\n\nAfter leaving office, he settled into semiretirement in a house in McLean, Va., that he and Mrs. Cheney had designed, the first they had ever built for themselves. He told a visitor he would never do it again. “There are thousands of decisions — doorknobs, by God!” he said.\n\nOn the wall he hung a sword from his great-grandfather, who had fought for the Union in the Civil War. Nearby he displayed a brick from the house of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, and another from the house where Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Al Qaeda leader in Iraq, had been killed. Intriguingly, his bookshelf included volumes critical of him, including one titled, “Dick: The Man Who Is President.”\n\nFor the first few years after leaving office, he was vocal in accusing President Barack Obama of watering down national security policies, but then largely withdrew, ceding the public stage to Liz Cheney, who won his old House seat. On Jan. 6, he was watching television when the mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. He called his daughter, who was on the House floor, to warn her.\n\nAfter that, he joined his daughter in speaking out. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Mr. Cheney said last year in announcing his vote for Ms. Harris. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.”\n\nHis statements and his appearance on the House floor prompted some Democrats to broaden their views of Mr. Cheney. “He put country above party and I think that was something I certainly respected,” Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, one of the Democrats who greeted him on the floor, said on Tuesday. “You saw a dad standing up for both principle and for family. You saw him in a different light.”\n\nFor Ken Adelman, it became a moment of re-evaluation too. He and Mr. Cheney first met in 1970 in President Richard M. Nixon’s Office of Economic Opportunity, where both worked for Donald H. Rumsfeld. They both worked for Mr. Rumsfeld again in President Gerald R. Ford’s administration. Mr. Adelman later served as President Ronald Reagan’s arms control director. His wife, Carol Adelman, was assistant administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Aid and hired Liz Cheney as an assistant.\n\nThey were men of different temperaments. Mr. Cheney was as stoic as Mr. Adelman was chatty. Mr. Cheney, a fly-fishing enthusiast, only invited Mr. Adelman to join him once. “I’m never taking you fly-fishing again,” Mr. Cheney told him afterward. “Why?” Mr. Adelman asked. Mr. Cheney answered, “You talk too much.”\n\nBut they shared a hawkish view of national security, particularly after the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Adelman was among the conservatives encouraging the invasion of Iraq in 2003. He wrote an opinion piece predicting it “would be a cakewalk.” After Baghdad fell, Mr. Cheney hosted a small dinner to celebrate. Mr. Adelman hugged him and they raised a toast.\n\nSoon, though, as the assertions that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction proved false, as sectarian strife exploded into civil war and as administration officials kept claiming the United States was winning, Mr. Adelman grew disgruntled. A member of the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board, he concluded that the war was being bungled and that Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld, now the defense secretary, were not facing facts as so many Americans and Iraqis were being killed.\n\n“There was just such neglect,” Mr. Adelman said. “It just drove me up the wall and I couldn’t stand it anymore.”\n\nMr. Adelman “had it out with Rumsfeld” in a 90-minute argument and the secretary fired him from the defense board. But Mr. Adelman never directly confronted Mr. Cheney. Instead, when the vice president invited him to a Christmas party in 2006, Mr. Adelman decided not to go. They did not speak again for the next decade and a half.\n\nThe estrangement gnawed at Mr. Adelman. “It bothered me every day of my life,” he recalled. But he admired the Cheney family’s willingness to speak out against Mr. Trump when other Republicans would not.\n\nSo as Liz Cheney helped lead the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack despite attacks from Mr. Trump and his allies, Carol Adelman called her up in the summer of 2022 to praise her courage. The Adelmans offered to host a campaign fund-raiser for her in the backyard of their home in Aspen, Colo.\n\nOne day soon after, the phone rang. “There’s someone who wants to say hi,” Liz Cheney said. Dick Cheney came on the line and he and Mr. Adelman began talking as if they had never stopped. “When we got back together, his first words were about Mussolini,” Mr. Adelman recalled. They left their rift over Iraq unspoken as they began seeing each other again for dinners and the like. “We never talked about it,” Mr. Adelman said. “We just went on.”\n\nInstead, they shared their antipathy for Mr. Trump and what he was doing to the country. They were turned off by what Mr. Adelman called the “corruption of the process,” the indecency, the abandonment of Reagan-era principles, the kowtowing to Russia and the attempt to reverse a democratic election.\n\nBut there was, at last, an upside, Mr. Adelman said. “It did bring us together.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/opinion/trump-mamdani-spanberger-sherrill-democrats.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"05:02:18-05:00","title":"Trump Is an Albatross","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article argues that Donald Trump, as president, has become a political albatross for the Republican Party, damaging its electoral prospects and fostering widespread voter opposition.

2025-11-05T05:02:18-05:00\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Donald Trump is a phenomenally effective vote-winner, capable of turning out millions of otherwise infrequent voters to deliver the White House and Congress to the Republican Party. But as president, Trump has been an albatross around the neck of his party.\n\nConsider his record as party leader. In the 2017 elections, Republicans suffered sharp defeats in the Virginia and New Jersey governor’s races, with Virginia Democrats sweeping all three statewide offices and winning a majority in the state General Assembly. The following year, in the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats won a landslide victory in the House of Representatives, their largest since 2006. Trump came close to victory in the 2020 presidential but may have contributed to the Republican Party’s defeat in the Georgia Senate runoff election, handing the Democratic Party full control of Washington for the first time since 2011.\n\nEven 2022, a midterm under President Joe Biden, was less successful than it could have been for the Republican Party because of Trump’s influence in the battle for the Senate, where voters rejected MAGA-aligned candidates in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. With the 2024 presidential election came another strong Trump performance as he brought out the voters who support him and him alone.\n\nTuesday was the first major election since Trump entered the White House for a second term. And although voters across Virginia, New Jersey and New York City were most concerned with the particulars of their respective states and localities, there was no question that this was also a chance to register their discontent in a way that might send a message to Washington and the rest of America.\n\nIn each place, Democrats delivered crushing defeats to their Republican opponents. In the Virginia race for governor, Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, cruised to victory along with Ghazala Hashmi, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, and Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, who struggled with scandal in the final weeks of the race. In the New Jersey election for governor, Mikie Sherrill delivered an unambiguous defeat to the Republican Jack Ciattarelli, and in New York City’s three-way mayoral election, Zohran Mamdani prevailed over both a former governor, Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, and the Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa.\n\nSupporters of the president might pooh-pooh these results as unrepresentative. This isn’t a presidential electorate, they might say; there are different circumstances. But New Jersey and New York City both had high turnout for off-year elections (Virginia had a slight increase). In other words, it really is the case that Trump specifically, in his capacity as president, inspires ferocious energy and opposition against him among a large part of the voting public.\n\nThe results, then, are a marked contrast to the accommodation, capitulation and outright surrender of prominent individuals and institutions in the face of Trump’s demands. They also serve to remind us of what ought to be a fundamental maxim of democracy: that there is no singular “people” and there are no permanent majorities.\n\nAs I have stressed again and again, it is a profound mistake to treat the 2024 presidential election as a referendum on the ideological direction of the United States or as evidence of a realignment or whatever else you happen to have as your hobbyhorse. (Here, I’ll observe that it is unclear if “realignments” actually exist. Even coalitions as seemingly durable as the one that made Franklin Roosevelt president four times showed signs of strain and fracture within a decade of their arrival.)\n\nFor some observers, the 2024 election seemed to show a shift of young people and Latinos to the Republican Party. This was said to herald a “vibe shift” in American politics and perhaps a durable turn to the political right. But the truth of the matter is that voters, and especially those who are new and infrequent participants in the political process, are as driven by events and circumstances as anything else. And the key factor last year was voters’ reaction to the inflation that plagued Biden’s term in office.\n\nAmericans voted in Trump to lower the cost of living and return the United States to the political and economic status quo as it was before the pandemic. But rather than meet the public where it was, Trump and his cadre of ideologues in the White House took their victory to mean that they could pursue their most radical dreams and try to make good on their extreme preoccupations.\n\nIn 2024, the Americans who decided the election voted for lower prices and a lower cost of living. What they got instead were soldiers on the streets, masked agents leading violent immigration raids, arbitrary tariffs, new conflicts abroad, dictatorial aspirations, endless chaos and a president more interested in taking a wrecking ball to the White House to build his garish ballroom than delivering anything of value to the public. At this moment, in fact, the government has been shut down for more than a month, the House of Representatives has not been in session since the middle of September, and Trump is still talking about defying multiple court orders to restore food assistance to hungry families, even though his own administration announced that it would partially comply.\n\nBoth Trump and his administration are less interested in helping ordinary Americans than they are in fulfilling their idiosyncratic program of austerity, pain and deprivation. They are all stick, no carrot.\n\nIt’s against this backdrop that voters just went to the polls and cast millions of votes against the president by way of Democratic candidates, moderate and progressive, who stood for both affordability and the nation’s most cherished values, who pledged to use their time in office to protect their new constituents from the provocations and assaults coming from the government in Washington.\n\nIf these elections had gone the other way — if the Democratic Party had underperformed or even lost one of these contests — then every commentator under the sun would say, rightfully, that Democrats were in disarray; that even the president’s deep unpopularity couldn’t keep them afloat with voters.\n\nBut Tuesday was a Democratic victory. And the party didn’t just win — it won by commanding majorities on virtually every field of play. In polls, in focus groups and now at the ballot box, the public is telling us something very clearly: Trump is simply too much. If this is an opportunity for Democrats to win back lost ground — and it is — then it is also a warning to a Republican Party that has tied its entire identity to the man from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Monday when a 6.3-magnitude quake struck northern Afghanistan. It shed countless turquoise, indigo and lapis tiles, and parts of its minarets collapsed. Others are filled with cracks and splits.\n\nNobody appeared to be injured or killed nearby — the quake struck just before 1 a.m. And yet, the damaged complex has become a symbol of sorts for a bruised nation and the catastrophes it has faced this year.\n\nBefore the earthquake struck on Monday, Afghanistan was already reeling from billions of lost aid money, military clashes with neighboring Pakistan and the threat of all-out war, and another deadly earthquake in August.\n\nAt least 26 people died in the quake, primarily in Balkh and Samangan provinces, near the border with Uzbekistan; more than 1,100 others were injured, and hundreds of buildings were destroyed, according to the Afghan authorities and the World Health Organization.\n\nLike Afghanistan, the Blue Mosque is still standing. But, like the country, it is increasingly weakened and frail, with hopes of reconstruction dimming by the day.\n\n“The Blue Mosque has the dignity of a mother for us in Mazar, but this mother is becoming poorer day by day,” said Naqib Ahmad Lawang, 25, a shoemaker who has a street stall in front of the mosque.\n\nThe Blue Mosque, built in the 15th century, sits in the center of Mazar-i-Sharif, which grew around it. It even gave the city its name, which means “Tomb of the Saint.” The mosque is said to be the burial site of Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and the first Shia imam.\n\nAlready weakened by neglect and lack of repair, according to local worshipers and religious scholars, the mosque appeared to be tottering when New York Times journalists visited it on Tuesday.\n\nThe upper section of two minarets had fallen from the shrine, and one appeared on the verge of collapse, sliced by a crack that looked like an open wound. Bricks were falling occasionally, smashing on the white tiled courtyard.\n\nA drizzle dampened the shrine’s courtyard and bathed the complex in a serene gloom, a stark contrast to the scenes of destruction a day earlier. Doves soared overhead as worshipers took photos and videos in silence. They walked barefoot across the cold, rain-washed surface while maintenance workers cleaned the courtyard’s white tiles, but some areas were still littered with debris and out of reach.\n\nSayed Osman, a construction worker who was visiting his brother, looked at the mosque with an expert eye. He said he feared the mosque would collapse if fallen tiles were not replaced and water seeped into its cracked walls. He said he wished it could be repaired, but added, “The government doesn’t care about this historical site, because some of the damage happened a long time ago, and the government hasn’t fixed it yet.”\n\nOthers voiced their frustration not just with the mosque’s damage, but with the rule of the Taliban, who returned to power in 2021, as the United States was withdrawing from Afghanistan.\n\n“They brought security, but people are only safe in a cemetery,” said Mir Agha, a farmer from one of the villages most affected by the quake.\n\nMr. Agha described the lack of job opportunities and widespread poverty as the main sources of frustration among Afghans. “We cannot tie stones to our stomachs and sleep,” he said.\n\nAbdul Aziz, a taxi driver, was waiting for customers at the Blue Mosque, with no luck. There used to be more visitors to the shrine, he said, including women and children, but the Taliban have banned women from entering.\n\nMazar-i-Sharif was one of the last cities to fall to the Taliban in 2021. It hosts a large population of Hazaras, a Persian-speaking, Shia Muslim minority that has long been persecuted by Afghan governments, including the current one led by the Taliban, who are predominantly Sunni Pashtuns.\n\nTaliban fighters killed at least 2,000 Hazaras in 1998, according to an estimate by Human Rights Watch, when the Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif during their first rule. The killings were in apparent retaliation for the thousands of deaths the Taliban had suffered when attempting to capture the city a year earlier.\n\nNo massacre of that scale has been documented since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, but there have been numerous attacks on Shia mosques as well as schools, markets and hospitals in areas predominantly populated by the Hazara minority, most of them carried out by Islamic State militants.\n\nFor many Hazaras in Mazar-i-Sharif and beyond, the Blue Mosque had brought a reassuring, albeit increasingly fragile, presence. Mohammad Arif Amiri, a Hazara and Mazar-i-Sharif resident, came on Tuesday to check on the mosque at his father’s request, because both were worried about “what happened to its beauty.”\n\nAs Mr. Amiri, 28, wandered around the Blue Mosque, he said, “When I see the damage, it feels like some parts of my own body have been injured.”\n\n"}]}
