public to be vigilant during shutdown \n       \n  By Brian Todd, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:42 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The site of one of the most iconic battlefields in American history suffered recent damage, prompting a law enforcement investigation.\n \n\n   \n  A National Park Service ranger, who asked not to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN there is extensive damage to a stone wall by a parking lot in the Devil’s Den area of  Gettysburg National Military Park  in Pennsylvania.\n \n\n   \n  The ranger says the damage was reported to the National Park Service on the morning of October 14, and the park service’s law enforcement arm is investigating.\n \n\n   \n  On its Facebook page, the  Gettysburg Foundation , a non-profit partner of the park,  posted  pictures of the wall with a section collapsed, and parts of stone strewn on the ground. The post implores the public to help protect the park. “Remember that we are all stewards of National Park Service sites! Our priority is the safety of our visitors, as well as the protection of our National Parks. Think like the cavalry and be the eyes and ears for the National Park Service during the government shutdown. If you see something, say something,” the post says.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the Gettysburg Foundation told CNN there is no video of the incident and there were no eyewitnesses, so they are not sure if it was vandalism or an accident.\n \n\n   \n  The park ranger noted “this isn’t just a little bump or dent” caused by a vehicle over-shooting its parking space. “This is significantly more than that.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if the wall could be repaired, the ranger said, “It can be repaired to its original state, but it’s going to take time and money, neither of which we have right now.”\n \n\n   \n  While the Gettysburg Foundation spokesperson says that the stone wall itself has no historical significance, Devil’s Den was the scene of intense fighting between Union and Confederate forces on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, with both sides suffering heavy casualties at the location.\n \n\n   \n  A  National Park Service  spokesperson told CNN in a statement, “preliminary indications suggest the wall was struck by a vehicle. The wall serves as a parking barrier and has been damaged before by vehicles attempting to turn or park in the small lot… The surrounding landscape and boulder formations remain intact and protected.”\n \n\n   \n  The incident has raised anxieties for the  National Parks Conservation Association .\n \n\n   \n  “These Civil War battlefields are open-air museums”, said Ed Stierli, Mid-Atlantic Senior Regional Director of the NPCA.  “We’re really concerned.”\n \n\n   \n  The National Park Service contends the parks are protected. “Our law enforcement rangers are at 100% capacity as we continue to prioritize critical functions that protect life, property, and public health, including law enforcement, emergency response, and visitor access. During this time, all of our law enforcement rangers are on duty and conducting regular patrols,” the statement said.\n \n\n   \n  The investigation comes as park advocates and local business proprietors have said there are increased reports of trash buildup and other problems at national parks during the government shutdown. CNN has received accounts of park-goers flying drones and base-jumping at locations like Yosemite National Park in California. These actions are generally illegal inside national parks.\n \n\n   \n  The National Park Service spokesperson said that at Gettysburg, “There has been no increase in vandalism, trash buildup or visitor misconduct unique to the shutdown period.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/us-military-strike-pacific-8th","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"15:30:00Z","title":"US military strikes boat in Pacific in apparent expansion of campaign against alleged drug trafficking","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military conducted a lethal strike in the Eastern Pacific, killing both individuals on board a vessel reportedly operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization engaged in narco-trafficking.

killing both people on board, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The strike on the vessel in the Pacific, the 8th known strike by the US military on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel since the start of September, appears to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, with all seven previous strikes targeting boats in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  At least 34 people in

said on X Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said the boat targeted in the Pacific was “being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific” and “was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route, and carrying narcotics.”\n \n\n   \n  The secretary added that no US forces were hurt in the strike and compared the traffickers to al Qaeda.\n \n\n   \n  “Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people. There will be no refuge or forgiveness—only justice,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has produced a  classified legal opinion  seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it treats drug traffickers as enemy combatants who can be summarily killed without any kind of judicial review.\n \n\n   \n  The US struck at least two other vessels last week in the Caribbean, one of which did not kill everyone on board. Rather than hold two survivors detained by the US Navy after one of those strikes, the US repatriated the survivors back to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia.\n \n\n   \n  The situation was potentially going to set up a legal and policy dilemma for the administration because it was unclear what legal authority the US military would be able to cite to detain them indefinitely.\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/white-house-east-wing-demolition-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:49:00-20:00","title":"Why Trump’s sudden East Wing demolition is extraordinary — and dicey","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The planned construction of a massive new ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, initially presented as a non-invasive addition, has led to the actual demolition of a key structural part of the building — contradicting early assurances that nothing would be torn down.

and dicey \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:49 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When President Donald Trump reflected last week on the looming construction of his White House ballroom, the longtime real estate developer was practically giddy about the lack of red tape. He noted his New York projects often took years to break ground.\n \n\n   \n  “They said, ‘Sir, you can start tonight,’” Trump said. “I said, what are you talking about? ‘You have zero zoning conditions. You’re the president of’ – I said, you got to be kidding.”\n \n\n   \n  The president continued to marvel: “He said, ‘Sir, this is the White House. You’re the president of the United States. You can do anything you want.’”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has now done what he wants — in ways that are causing plenty of consternation.\n \n\n   \n  Images of the  demolition of the existing East Wing , where the new ballroom will be located, have  spurred apoplexy  among Trump’s detractors and growing criticism from architectural and preservation groups.\n \n\n   \n  The optics have also, perhaps tellingly, set off some metaphorical damage control at the White House.\n \n\n   \n  The Treasury Department, which sits next to the East Wing, has instructed employees not to share photos of the demolition. (The department claimed in a statement to CNN this was to protect sensitive information.) The administration has railed against the “manufactured outrage” about the demolition in a series of social media posts and TV interviews. And the White House on Tuesday published  an extensive blog post  recapping previous renovations to the grounds.\n \n\n   \n  But there are a number of reasons why this situation is remarkable — and different from your usual presidential renovation.\n \n\n   \n  A big one is that the scenes this week fly in the face of how this was billed.\n \n\n   \n  When the project was announced in late July, Trump assured it “won’t interfere with the current building.”\n \n\n   \n  “It won’t be — it’ll be near it but not touching it,” he said at the time\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed that, saying, “ Nothing will be torn down ,” according to the Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  Much of the East Wing has now been torn down. While many Trump defenders wagered early this week photos made the demolition look more extensive than it actually was, the Washington Post reported late Tuesday that “ it appeared that what remained was also headed for demolition , with no evidence that the structure was being protected and only jagged damage visible in the exposed building.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked to account for Trump’s past comments, White House aide Will Scharf effectively acknowledged that plans had changed.\n \n\n   \n  “The scope and size was always subject to vary as the project developed,” Scharf, who also oversees federal construction as head of the National Capital Planning Commission,  told Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  The White House also assured that the construction planning would go through a robust process.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement when the project was announced, chief of staff Susie Wiles said Trump and the White House were “fully committed to working with the appropriate organizations to preserve the special history of the White House.”\n \n\n   \n  There is very little evidence that’s actually happened.\n \n\n   \n  A number of groups that you might expect to be involved in such a process have criticized the lack of consultation or pushed for more.\n \n\n   \n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a congressionally chartered non-profit tasked with preserving historic buildings, on Tuesday  requested a pause in the demolition . It urged the White House to “go through the legally required public review processes … and to invite comment from the public.”\n \n\n   \n  The Society of Architectural Historians last week expressed “ great concern ” about the ballroom project. The group said it generally limited “its advocacy to matters of national and international import,” while urging a more “rigorous and deliberate design and review process.”\n \n\n   \n  And the American Institute of Architects back in August urged a number of steps that don’t appear to have been followed, including a rigorous search for the best architect and transparency about the process and its funding.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has said the $200 million project, which he said last week has been fully funded, is being paid for by private donations. Some donors have been named. But the White House has  not yet released a comprehensive list  or a breakdown of the donations.\n \n\n   \n  “This is more than an addition to a building,” the American Institute of Architects   wrote in August , arguing that it should be “ guided by a process that is preservation-first, performance-driven, and accountable to the public.”\n \n\n   \n  As recently as last month, Scharf suggested that even the National Capital Planning Commission he leads hadn’t been involved up to that point. He noted that it had no specific role in the demolition aspect.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I’m excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,” Scharf said.\n \n\n   \n  And the last point is that, yes, other presidents have overseen renovations. But the scale of this is on another level.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the  projects listed by the White House  Tuesday were much smaller and included no structural changes — like building swimming pools, internal refurbishments and restorations, landscaping and hardscaping.\n \n\n   \n  The list even included President Barack Obama installing a garden for the White House kitchen and converting a tennis court so that it could be used for basketball.\n \n\n   \n  The Society of Architectural Historians said the new White House ballroom will be the first “major change to its exterior appearance” since 1942. And even then, that project was merely adding to the existing East Wing, with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt adding a second story featuring additional office space and an emergency bunker.\n \n\n   \n  Even that relatively minor change led to criticisms from Republicans, who called the project wasteful and accused Roosevelt of doing it for political purposes, according to  the White House Historical Association .\n \n\n   \n  The ballroom will also be massive. It was initially described as accommodating 650 guests, but Trump told NBC News last month that it would wind up  being “a little bigger” than initially billed . He has more recently said that number could stretch to nearly 1,000.\n \n\n   \n  Trump often exaggerates the size of properties, so it’s not clear whether the ballroom will now actually be bigger than the initially planned 90,000-square-foot facility. But the National Trust for Historic Preservation cautioned Tuesday that even the initially planned size would “overwhelm the White House itself,” given the main White House building is 55,000 square feet.\n \n\n   \n  And again, that calls into question how this project was billed.\n \n\n   \n  In between his boasts about his power to make this happen quickly last week, Trump expressed that he “didn’t want to dwarf anything.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-curtis-sliwa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:29:00-04:00","title":"Curtis Sliwa uses a ‘Braveheart’ reference to explain why he won’t drop out of the NYC mayoral race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee for New York City mayor, is refusing to exit the race despite intense pressure from allies of Andrew Cuomo, including WABC owner John Catsimatidis and billionaire investor Bill Ackman.

He’s become the radio guy; now I’m the politician.”\n \n\n   \n  A longtime fixture in New York City politics, Sliwa now has a key role in one of the most consequential mayoral races in decades. Heading into the second general election debate Wednesday at 7 p.m., Sliwa is likely to be at the center of the discussion, even as he runs third in the polls.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa is the target of a frantic pressure campaign to drop out of the mayoral race from opponents of Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani who want to create a one-on-one matchup between Mamdani and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. Among the people pressuring Sliwa is WABC owner John Catsimatidis, a top New York Republican and ally of President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, a Queens native himself, has all but written Sliwa off. Several of Sliwa’s former colleagues at WABC have urged him to drop out. And Cuomo on Monday predicted his “collapse.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa, however, insists he will not exit. He colorfully maintained his defiance Wednesday, accusing former WABC colleagues of “stabbing” him in the back and vowing that he would never come back to the station.\n \n\n   \n  Using another cinematic metaphor, Sliwa rejected any potential partnerships with Cuomo.\n \n\n   \n  “Remember that scene in ‘Braveheart?’” Sliwa asked. “Mel Gibson at the end, when the executioner was impaling him?  If all of a sudden, the executioner would’ve stopped, and I was on that gurney, and said, ‘Hey, you can work for Mayor Andrew Cuomo,’ I would say, ‘Finish the job. Impale me.’”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, has alarmed some moderate Democrats with his  progressive ideas ,  past criticisms of police  and relative lack of experience. Some Jewish voters are concerned about his  criticisms of Israel  and question his commitment to fighting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  But the upstart progressive has been consolidating his support since the primary, opening a double-digit lead over Cuomo and Mamdani in public polling. He’s won the endorsements of several key Democrats, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and  met with Jewish groups  and  police officers  as he tries to shore up perceived weaknesses.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s backers have watched with frustration and blame Sliwa for splintering the anti-Mamdani vote. The investor Bill Ackman, among the most vocal Cuomo proponents on social media,  claimed  that Mamdani “is actively working” to keep Sliwa in the race. Mamdani has mocked Ackman and dismissed that claim.\n \n\n   \n  In tearing into Cuomo and the business interests backing him, Sliwa at times seems to echo Mamdani, the democratic socialist, with his sharp criticism of billionaires and elites. In an interview with the journalist Nate Friedman released over the weekend, the GOP nominee told Ackman to “stay in your lane.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa’s Republican supporters in the city have signaled their intention to stand by the party’s nominee. On Tuesday ahead of the final debate, a collection of county Republican Party chairs – including Catsimatidis’ daughter Andrea, the Manhattan GOP chair – issued a joint statement affirming that “our party is united behind Curtis Sliwa.”\n \n\n   \n  Previous Republican mayor Rudy Giuliani has also maintained his support for Sliwa and hosted the candidate on his own show. “Curtis Sliwa has my complete and total endorsement,” he  said .\n \n\n   \n  “The undecided ones, if this is like any other political situation, are going to break the same way, or they’re not going to vote,” Giuliani said Monday. “Remember, it’s a poll. And it’s not just they’re unfair to Trump, they are, that’s given. They’re also very often completely useless.”\n \n\n   \n  And on WABC Wednesday, Sliwa dismissed hypothetical outcomes if he continued his campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “To me they’re the same,” Sliwa said, when asked if he’d prefer Cuomo or Mamdani to become the next mayor. “First day of voting is on Saturday. I’m going to be there, before the polls open up, to cast my vote for Curtis Sliwa and every Republican downballot.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/baseball-mlb-seattle-mariners-defeat-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:41:00Z","title":"It’s a failure: Seattle Mariners feel the deep pain of disappointment after narrowly missing out on first World Series","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Seattle Mariners, one of the only MLB franchises never to reach the World Series, narrowly lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series, falling 4-3 after a promising run that included leading 2-0 and 3-2 in the series.

World Series in franchise history, Seattle fell heartbreakingly short in Monday’s 4-3  defeat  against the Toronto Blue Jays.\n \n\n   \n  The gut-wrenching loss ensures that the Mariners’ unwanted record as the only team in Major League Baseball never to appear at the Fall Classic remains very much intact.\n \n\n   \n  To see how much this moment pained Seattle and its players, look no further than MVP candidate  Cal Raleigh , who was reduced to tears at the end of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “I love every guy in this room, but ultimately, it’s not what we wanted,” Raleigh told reporters after the game. “I hate to use the word failure, but it’s a failure.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what we expected: to get to the World Series and win a World Series. That’s what the bar is and the standard is – that’s what we want to hold ourselves accountable to – but it hurts.”\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh was far from alone in his pain. “We’ve put in so much work and effort through this whole year and it’s over,” said Seattle center fielder Julio Rodríguez. “That’s also part of the game too.”\n \n\n   \n  The disappointment is also felt strongly among the team’s supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “As someone who’s a Seattle transplant, I don’t quite have the decades of embedded angst that some locals may carry with them,” Mariners fan Gabe Guarente, 48, told  CNN Sports . “But I do sort of share their fatalistic view of the team. We don’t really expect good things to happen, so when they do, it’s more of a pleasant surprise.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s why this year’s ALCS Game 7 loss felt both inevitable and completely heartbreaking at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  Guarente described his emotions after the defeat as “gloomy … with an undercurrent of simmering rage at the cruel baseball gods.”\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions during this year’s American League Championship Series (ALCS), the signs looked so promising for the Mariners. They jumped into a 2-0 series lead, then went 3-2 up after victory in Game 5.\n \n\n   \n  And in the winner-takes-all game at Toronto’s Rodgers Centre, Seattle went 3-1 ahead when Raleigh launched his fifth home run of the postseason and fourth against the Blue Jays, putting his team in control of the contest at the top of the fifth.\n \n\n   \n  That, however, would be the high point of a miserable night for the Mariners. George Springer’s three-run homer saw Toronto move ahead in the seventh inning, and with that, Seattle’s hopes evaporated.\n \n\n   \n  Having never in their 49-season history been so close to appearing at the World Series, right now, it might feel like the Mariners have never been further away.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s crazy because, at the beginning of September, we weren’t even in the playoff running,” Mariners fan and podcast host Hayley  told  CNN affiliate KING 5 Seattle. “So to go this far, I think it’s really hard right now. But for every fan, it showed what we could do.”\n \n\n   \n  In time, they will be able to reflect on the team’s successful year, reaching a first ALCS since 2001 with a thrilling, near-five-hour win over the Detroit Tigers.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-year-old Raleigh has been the heartbeat of this Seattle team, hitting an MLB-leading 60 home runs in the regular season, only the seventh player in history to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  He signed a reported six-year, $105 million contract extension back in March, while Rodríguez is also locked into a long-term contract through 2029.\n \n\n   \n  For the Mariners – just the fourth team to lead a best-of-seven series 2-0 in the postseason and not advance – the ambition of reaching a first-ever World Series is still there, even in the post-mortem of a brutal loss.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us now have had a taste of how close we can get and how good this team can be,” said manager Dan Wilson. “Once you get that, that’s what you’re shooting for the next year and I know that will continue to be the goal … to get to that final step.\n \n\n   \n  “This year, we were one game short.”\n \n\n   \n  Fans like Guarente are cautiously optimistic about the future, given the talent and age profile of the Seattle team.\n \n\n   \n  “If they invest even a little bit in free agency, I think they can get back in this position,” he said. “It helps that the AL West is not a juggernaut, and the Astros’ empire is on the decline.\n \n\n   \n  “So, yes, I do think the Mariners can reach the World Series in the near future.

economy \n       \n  Analysis by Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:14 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Federal Reserve was already facing one of its most difficult battles, steering a shifting economy through a weakening labor market and stubborn inflation. The government shutdown just made that fight even harder.\n \n\n   \n  To make determinations about its rate policy and other decisions to help the economy, the Fed relies heavily on official economic statistics that are collected and disseminated by the government. The shutdown has effectively  cut off access to that data  — from the unemployment rate to retail sales — since the beginning of October.\n \n\n   \n  With just one week to go before the Fed’s next decision on interest rates, officials are flying partially blind as they assess whether the labor market requires additional support, after data through August showed  the weakest pace of hiring since 2010  and rising unemployment among young Americans and minorities.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest wrinkle for policymakers as they tackle a continued attack from the Trump administration on their independence, an ongoing housing affordability crisis that the Fed doesn’t have all the tools to fix, the potential effects of AI, persistent inflation, uncertainty around tariffs and a slowdown in the job market.\n \n\n   \n    The Fed and the shutdown\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of government data, Fed officials have turned to other sources to gauge the labor market and consumer spending — two important drivers of the US economy and the focus of the Fed’s so-called dual mandate to balance economic growth with keeping prices in check.\n \n\n   \n  The problem is that government data is undisputedly the “gold standard” of how the world’s largest economy is measured. Without it, the Fed’s decision making is not fully informed. And the Fed might have even less access to private employment data this time around, after payroll software provider ADP ended its data-sharing agreement with the Fed in August, according to  The American Prospect .\n \n\n   \n  “The risk is that the Fed misjudges where the state of its dual mandate sits, whether inflation or the labor market is the bigger concern,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at asset manager Glenmede, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Fed officials set monetary policy without key economic data was during the 2018-2019 shutdown. Minutes from the Fed’s  January 2019 meeting  showed how officials turned to figures on card transactions and vehicles sales in the absence of the Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t call it a data drought,” New York Fed President John Williams told the New York Times in an interview published on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still getting a significant amount of data,” he added, pointing to surveys from the Conference Board, the New York Fed and the Institute for Supply Management. Those surveys measure trends in prices, demand, production and overall economic activity.\n \n\n   \n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday will release the Consumer Price Index for September, having recalled staff to ensure the report can be used as a basis for  Social Security’s annual cost-of-living adjustments. \n \n\n   \n  Still, that leaves the Fed in the dark on the labor market’s true health and trajectory. Economists widely agree that private-sector figures cannot fully replace government data, especially considering that the government’s numbers serve as the benchmark for much of the private data.\n \n\n   \n    A housing affordability crisis the Fed can’t fix\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s main tool — its key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs more broadly — is particularly effective at making borrowing cheaper or more costly, depending on whether the Fed is trying to tamp down inflation or boost employment. So, it’s pretty good at changing how much consumers demand goods and services.\n \n\n   \n  But it does nothing to balance the “supply” side of the supply and demand equation, which is precisely what continues to drive up prices in some parts of the country, such as the Northeast.\n \n\n   \n  Sales of previously owned homes have been sluggish for the third-straight year, and persistently elevated mortgage rates have certainly played a role in keeping buyers on the sidelines. But so has the housing shortage.\n \n\n   \n  “Sales of affordable homes are constrained by the lack of inventory,” National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement last month.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed has already acknowledged that there’s only so much it can do to alleviate America’s housing woes.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a long-term housing shortage,” Powell said in a news conference after the Fed’s July meeting. “This is not something the Fed can help with.”\n \n\n   \n    The impacts of AI and economic uncertainty\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s aggressive bid to reshape global trade has forced many businesses to put hiring plans on ice as they wait to see how everything plays out. And at the same time, many companies are actively trying to figure out how to implement AI into their operations.\n \n\n   \n  The result: unusually weak hiring, largely driven by businesses feeling paralyzed. But for some workers, it’s also because of AI.\n \n\n   \n  “The labor market has been frozen up because people are just having a hard time making decisions,” Laura Ullrich, an economist at Indeed, told CNN. “And AI is certainly having some impact on entry-level tech jobs.”\n \n\n   \n  The Fed’s rate cuts should function like a tide that lifts all boats by making borrowing cheaper, allowing companies to expand head count. But that might not be enough to shore up demand for workers in roles that are increasingly being automated by AI.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, while the Fed is poised to lower rates further, “so long as economic uncertainty is high, it’s hard to know exactly how many people you should hire,” Ullrich said.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment is borne out by businesses in the manufacturing and services sectors surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management, who continue to express frustration over Trump’s significant policy changes and their ensuing effects on demand and planning.\n \n\n   \n  “Client demand in professional services remains steady, though decision-making timelines are lengthening due to continued economic uncertainty and interest-rate concerns,” one business said in ISM’s September services survey.\n \n\n   \n  The Fed is set to announce its latest monetary policy decision at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting ending on October 29, with a post-meeting news conference by Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET that day.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/tech/openai-chatgpt-atlas-browser-google-chrome-ai","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"14:45:00Z","title":"The battle for the future of the internet is underway","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, a new AI-powered web browser that integrates its popular ChatGPT chatbot into the browsing experience, directly challenging Google’s long-standing dominance in internet navigation.

Eadicicco, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:45 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The tug-of-war over the internet’s future escalated dramatically   on Tuesday after OpenAI unveiled a new product that takes direct aim at the heart of Google’s core business: controlling the world’s front door to the internet.\n \n\n   \n  OpenAI this week released ChatGPT Atlas, a desktop web browser infused with the popular AI chatbot. The product is more than just a way to expand ChatGPT, which now has more than 800 million weekly users. It’s an attempt to become the pathway to websites, social media and other online services, giving it a more direct role in everything people do online. Google has dominated that business for two decades. OpenAI is betting it can start to take over.\n \n\n   \n  OpenAI’s ChatGPT Atlas isn’t the first and only AI-driven web browser; AI search company Perplexity launched its Comet browser in July. Yet ChatGPT’s massive reach makes it the most formidable threat to Google, marking a turning point in the transition away from lists of blue links.\n \n\n   \n  “Your browser is where all of your work, tools, and context come together,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a blog post announcing Atlas. “A browser built with ChatGPT takes us closer to a true super-assistant that understands your world and helps you achieve your goals.”\n \n\n   \n  Google’s search engine – which is at the core of its Chrome browser –  isn’t going away anytime soon. But there’s some data to suggest consumers are indeed embracing AI for some of the tasks they may have previously relied on search links for. A study from  Pew Research  found that people are less likely to click on links when AI-generated summaries are displayed in Google. And Apple’s senior vice president of services said earlier this year in court testimony, per  Bloomberg , that search queries on its devices declined for the first time in April.\n \n\n   \n  The launch of Atlas, and whether it’s successful, will test whether consumers are truly ready to make a more dramatic shift to AI for their daily needs.\n \n\n   \n  For Google’s web browser and search engine, the move toward AI and away from links has been gradually built over the course of a decade. OpenAI’s Atlas, however, puts ChatGPT at the center of the browsing experience right from the jump.\n \n\n   \n  It’s ChatGPT’s search bar, not Google’s, that greets you upon opening the browser, along with suggestions for topics to research or tasks for ChatGPT’s AI agents to handle, like planning a weekend trip. A button at the top of the page pulls up ChatGPT in a sidebar, where users can ask questions or have it summarize the page. (I asked ChatGPT, for example, to explain the difference between “earnings” and “adjusted earnings” just by highlighting the text in an article and typing ‘what’s this?’).\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s ChatGPT’s agent mode, which can handle tasks on your behalf. When I asked it to find a bar in New York City’s Long Island City neighborhood with cheap drinks near the 7 subway and to book a table for three people, ChatGPT suggested a cocktail bar with happy hour deals located right near the train’s Queensboro Plaza stop. It also asked what time I’d like to book the reservation for.\n \n\n   \n  To be sure, Google is taking a very similar direction with its own browser, which accounts for a staggering nearly 72% of web traffic according to analytics platform  Statcounter Global Stats .\n \n\n   \n  Google search results have AI summaries at the top, the Gemini digital assistant can summarize web pages and answer questions in Chrome. The company also offers  a prototype web agent  that can handle certain tasks like hiring a Task Rabbit to build furniture or booking a hotel based on information from a user’s email and calendar.\n \n\n   \n  But Atlas’ launch comes at a time when industry analysts are raising questions about Google’s role in the future of the web, a key theme that came up in the Justice Department’s landmark search monopoly antitrust case against the company.\n \n\n   \n  The role AI plays in the future of how people search online was a big factor in Judge Amit Mehta’s decision, which allowed Google to keep Chrome rather than offloading it.\n \n\n   \n  “These remedies proceedings thus have been as much about promoting competition among (general search engines) as ensuring that Google’s dominance in search does not carry over into the GenAI space. Many of Plaintiffs’ proposed remedies are crafted with that latter objective in mind,” the court filing from September read.\n \n\n   \n  OpenAI’s browser is only a day old, and there’s no telling whether it will resonate with consumers as broadly as ChatGPT. But it further underscores OpenAI’s ambition  to play a fundamental role  in how people use technology, starting with ChatGPT, search and now now web browsers – eventually expanding into  consumer hardware .\n \n\n   \n  If that sounds familiar, it’s a page straight from Google’s book.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/weather/tropical-storm-melissa-caribbean-track","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"15:34:00-20:34","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa Expected to Become Major Hurricane as It Trends Toward Haiti and Jamaica","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, currently moving slowly through the Caribbean Sea and located 300 miles south-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) by Monday morning.

Waxman, Mary Gilbert, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:34 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tropical Storm Melissa is crawling through the Caribbean Sea, threatening to unleash life-threatening flooding and mudslides across parts of the region later this week. It’s proof this year’s  Atlantic hurricane season  is not over yet, and Melissa has plenty of time and fuel ahead.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa was more than 300 miles south-southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was churning forward at an agonizingly slow 2 mph.\n \n\n   \n  Heavy rain is already spreading north Wednesday as Melissa moves at a snail’s pace toward Jamaica and Haiti. A foot or more of rain is possible in southern parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic through this weekend. That much rain over mountainous terrain in the area could trigger catastrophic flash flooding and landslides.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is moving over water that’s so warm it’s essentially rocket fuel for storms this late in the season, and is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday morning.\n \n\n   \n  When that happens, it will be the 2025 Atlantic season’s fifth hurricane and the first to spin up inside the Caribbean. It’s also now forecast to become the season’s fourth major hurricane — Category 3 or greater.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica. There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    Two possible outcomes, neither good\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios. The possibilities have changed slightly from initial forecasts, but both place Hispaniola and Jamaica in harm’s way.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola, which is the island that houses the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as it drifts closer to the island through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  It’s still unclear exactly what parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides. Jamaica could also receive torrential, flooding rainfall beginning later this week.\n \n\n   \n  The islands will also face strong, potentially damaging winds from Melissa, especially after it reaches hurricane strength Saturday, according to the hurricane center’s forecast.\n \n\n   \n  Slow-moving storms like Melissa hit the same areas with torrential rain and strong winds for days, significantly increasing rainfall totals and   the likelihood of   power outages. Melissa will start moving quicker at some point, and exactly when and where that happens is extremely important to determine its impacts. It’s also still quite unclear.\n \n\n   \n  If Melissa’s current forecast track holds and the storm moves slowly west toward an area south of Jamaica into early next week, it could end up where the atmosphere and extremely warm water align to boost the storm.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is now expected to become at least a Category 3 major hurricane by Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Its anticipated explosion in strength from tapping into that energy is something that’s  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  A stronger Melissa would eventually turn northeast next week and threaten other portions of the Caribbean, like Cuba.   That scenario would increase the intensity of all of Melissa’s impacts from rain to wind and dangerous seas.\n \n\n   \n  Alternatively, there’s still a chance that another weather pattern could pull Melissa north toward Jamaica or Haiti early next week. This path would likely prevent Melissa from reaching the strength it might in the first scenario, but could also mean a direct landfall and more concentrated impacts in either location.\n \n\n   \n    Is this a threat to the US?\n \n\n   \n  A direct hit on the mainland US is unlikely, but not impossible. At this time, the storm’s most likely impact to the US could be some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n  Florida could be in play if Melissa takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa’s wind and rain.\n \n\n   \n  The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently,  Hurricane Nicole  slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and  Hurricane Zeta  smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.\n \n\n   \n  As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.\n \n\n   \n  Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/north-carolina-republicans-redistricting-battle-map-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:27:00-20:30","title":"North Carolina Legislature Gives Final Approval to New Congressional Map That Could Give GOP One More Seat in US House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Carolina's legislature has approved a new congressional redistricting map that shifts 11 out of 14 U.S. House seats to Republicans, primarily targeting the competitive district currently represented by Black Democrat Don Davis.

legislature gives final approval to new congressional map that could give GOP one more seat in US House \n       \n  By Fredreka Schouten, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:52 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The North Carolina House on Wednesday gave final approval to a new congressional map aimed at helping Republicans eke out an additional GOP seat to help shore up the party’s majority in the US House after next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Bill 249 passed on a 66-48 vote. Members of the public were escorted out of the chamber after protests broke out shortly before the vote.\n \n\n   \n  State law does not give Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, veto power over redistricting legislation – although litigation over the map is likely.\n \n\n   \n  Stein on Wednesday called the move a “disgraceful” abuse of power.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re afraid that they will lose in the midterms and afraid to say no to the president. So, they’ve turned their backs on you to silence your vote in the 2026 election. It’s outrageous,” Stein said in a video message posted after the vote. “When a candidate or a party loses an election, you’re supposed to work like hell to connect better with voters so that you can win the next time. You do not rig the rules of the game to guarantee your victory, the voters be damned.”\n \n\n   \n  The new map targets a House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis – one of three Black members of Congress from the state. The new district lines are explicitly drawn to give Republicans the advantage for 11 out of 14 US House seats from North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  Under the map used in last year’s elections, Republicans control 10 seats.\n \n\n   \n  “Now here we are in North Carolina, doing a fifth redistricting in five years. It’s not because of the census. It’s not because of a court order. It’s because of a command from a president. Unprecedented in U.S. history,” state Rep. Marcia Morey, a Democrat from Durham, noted, calling the process “map warfare.”\n \n\n   \n  Republicans acknowledged the motivation behind the new map was helping President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Please support this legal proposal to help North Carolina help President Donald J. Trump make America great again,” said Rep. Jimmy Dixon from Warsaw.\n \n\n   \n  The final vote came just two days after Republican lawmakers, who control North Carolina’s legislature, formally opened debate on the map.\n \n\n   \n  The state joined  Texas  and  Missouri  in drawing new lines to benefit the GOP, bringing to seven the total number of new Republican-friendly districts created this year.\n \n\n   \n  The Tar Heel State was the latest state to begin work on a once-rare, mid-decade redistricting. The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections, and Democrats need to flip just a handful of seats to take control of the House after next year’s congressional elections.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Sen. Ralph Hise, a Republican who helped oversee the map-drawing, described the high stakes in stark terms.\n \n\n   \n  “The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular: draw a new map that will bring an additional Republican seat to the congressional delegation,” he said. If Democrats take control of the House, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” Hise added.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans in North Carolina acted swiftly to accede to Trump’s wishes. State lawmakers held the first open meeting about the new map on Monday morning and approved it in the state Senate the following day – despite sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the public who showed up at the state Capitol in Raleigh to protest the move.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina is a politically competitive state. And Democrats such as Stein and his predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, have captured statewide offices in recent election cycles. But Republican leaders this week framed the lopsided congressional map as an outcome Trump deserved given his electoral success in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times,” the state Sen. Phil Berger, the top Republican in the Senate, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    State-by-state battle\n \n\n   \n  Legislators in deep-red Texas kicked off the political arms race this year with a  map that seeks to send five more Republicans  to Congress. Missouri Republicans also have drawn new lines aimed at adding  an additional GOP member  to the state’s congressional delegation. Both face court challenges, and activists in Missouri are seeking to overturn the map through a petition drive.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the biggest pushback from Democrats comes from  California, which launched a redistricting effort in response to Texas . A multimillion-dollar advertising and get-out-the vote campaign now is underway to persuade voters to temporarily override congressional maps drawn by an independent commission next month and create as many as five new US House seats for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have a clear advantage over Democrats in the number of states that could redraw maps. The GOP holds control of the governor’s office and both chambers of the legislature in 23 states, compared to Democrats’ 15.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in other Republican states also are contemplating new maps, including Kansas, where legislators have  approved  $460,000 to fund a special session that would target the lone Democrat representing the state in Washington, four-term Rep. Sharice Davids. Two-thirds of the state House and Senate must agree to call a special session.\n \n\n   \n  In Indiana, where Republicans hold a 7-2 edge in the US House, the White House has repeatedly urged the GOP lawmakers in the majority in the state legislature to target at least one of the Democratic-held seats. Vice President JD Vance has twice visited the state to lobby legislators.\n \n\n   \n  Two other Republican-controlled states, Ohio and Utah, also are in throes of redistricting battles that began before Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  In Utah, a judge found that an existing map hadn’t followed guidelines imposed by a citizen ballot measure. Earlier this month, the GOP-dominated legislature passed a new congressional map that could give Democrats a slim chance of breaking the GOP’s monopoly on the state’s congressional delegation.\n \n\n   \n  That map needs to go back before the judge for her approval, with a final decision expected in early November. At the same time, Republicans in the state have launched a signature-gathering petition in the hopes of blocking the new map.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, the redrawing of its congressional districts is an outgrowth of a state law that requires maps approved without bipartisan support be redrawn after four years. Crafting new maps will ultimately fall to the Republican-controlled General Assembly, likely next month.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are vowing to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  The top Democrat in the US House, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is weighing an effort to counter Republicans in Ohio. If the map is passed along partisan lines, state law allows a voter referendum that could invalidate the map, and Jeffries is prepared to go all-in to support that effort — including raising money, according to a person familiar with his planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose internal deliberations.\n \n\n   \n  John Bisognano, the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Democrats will mount lawsuits, protests and citizen-led ballot initiatives to push back on the actions in GOP-dominated states.\n \n\n   \n  “Republicans are openly stating that they need to take away the voting power of the American people through gerrymandering in order to win the 2026 midterms,” Bisognano said in a statement. “That alone is a sign of incredible weakness. The fact that they are taking the gerrymandering crisis to even more states beyond Texas and Missouri underscores just how scared they are of the opposition they are facing from the American people – even in deep red states.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic fury in North Carolina\n \n\n   \n  Trump has praised the new lines, writing last week on Truth Social that it “would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections, which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda, not just in North Carolina, but across our Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis’ district representing a swath of eastern North Carolina is the only competitive US House seat remaining in North Carolina after previous rounds of redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump won the district last November even as Davis won a second term by less than two percentage points. The new map makes the district more favorable to Republicans by swapping out several counties with more conservative communities on the coast.\n \n\n   \n  Some North Carolina Republicans argued that actions in California – and other deep-blue states – required them to respond. “This is a political arms race that Republicans did not start,” Hise said, pointing for former President  Barack Obama ’s support of the California redistricting initiative.\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic state lawmakers along with multiple members of the public who spoke during the elections committee meeting denounced the map as a brazen power grab.\n \n\n   \n  “California hasn’t redistricted a thing,” Mark Swallow of Democracy Out Loud, a liberal activist group, said during the public comment period in a Senate committee meeting. “What they’ve done is respond to Texas, which started this fiasco for our country, and put an initiative on the ballot to ask Californians if they should be redistricted.”\n \n\n   \n  “You should do the same,” he told legislators, “but I doubt that you will because you know that North Carolinians will never approve this scheme. So, you are liars and cheats. That’s what this boils down to. You’re liars and cheats.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic state Sen. Val Applewhite said Republican lawmakers were going along with Trump’s “coordinated national effort to reshape this country’s political map in his image to guarantee one thing: that Donald Trump and only Donald Trump remains in power.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/jeff-merkley-senate-floor-speech","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:03:00-04:00","title":"Democratic Senator Delivers Marathon Floor Speech to Protest Trump’s Threats to Democracy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley delivered a marathon 18+ hour floor speech on the Senate floor to protest President Donald Trump’s actions, which he claims threaten democracy through the halting of university research grants, the prosecution of political opponents, and the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.

Rimmer, Ted  Barrett, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:03 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sen. Jeff Merkley has been speaking on the Senate floor for more than 18 hours after announcing he would protest what he called  President Donald Trump ’s “grave threats to democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells. We’re in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution,” the Oregon Democrat, who turns 69 on Friday, said after kicking off his remarks at 6:24 p.m. ET Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Bending his legs at times, highlighting the physical strain that comes with committing to standing for so long, Merkley had delivered the sixth longest floor speech in modern history as he continued speaking into the afternoon. Senate rules do not permit lawmakers to take bathroom breaks or sit down without yielding their time – though there was a short interruption Wednesday at noon for the daily prayer and pledge before the senator began speaking again.\n \n\n   \n  Merkley’s marathon speech stands as a symbolic show of Democratic resistance as his party remains in a standoff with Republicans over health care subsidies amid the government shutdown. The shutdown is expected to drag on with the impasse entering a fourth week Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have so far held their position, blocking the GOP stopgap bill to reopen the government 11 times until their demands are met. There is expected to be another procedural vote on the Republican proposal once Merkley finishes speaking.\n \n\n   \n  The senator in his speech pointed to the Trump administration’s previous  halting of research grants  for universities in its battle over campus oversight as well as the  recent indictments  of several of the president’s political opponents as well as his push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots. Because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there’s a rebellion. And if there’s a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Early Wednesday, the senator condemned the tactics of federal law enforcement against protesters outside of an immigration detention facility in Portland, and in other cities that are seeing a surge of immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  His comments on the situation in Oregon come after  an appeals court  on Monday cleared the way for Trump to deploy troops there after a previous, Trump-appointed federal judge blocked his first efforts to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an extraordinarily dangerous moment,” Merkley added Wednesday morning. “An authoritarian president proceeding to attack free speech, attack free press, weaponize the Department of Justice, and use it against those who disagree with him, and then seeking the court’s permission to send the military into our cities to attack people who are peaceful(ly) protesting.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Democratic  Sen. Cory Booker  of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, warning against the harms he said the administration was inflicting on the American public. The effort broke the record for the longest floor speech in modern history of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  This was also not Merkley’s first time holding the Senate floor – he previously spoke for more than 15 hours in 2017  against Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court .\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators of both parties, including Sens. Chris  Murphy  on gun control in 2016;  Rand Paul  over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and  Ted Cruz  against the Affordable Care Act 2013.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/us/sonya-massey-shooting-trial-sean-grayson","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:57:00-05:00","title":"Sheriff’s Deputy ‘Got Mad’ and Fatally Shot Sonya Massey Without Justification, Prosecutor Says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In July 2024, Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Grayson fatally shot 36-year-old Black woman Sonya Massey in her Springfield, Illinois home after a confrontation over a pot of hot water she had removed from the stove.

and fatally shot Sonya Massey without justification, prosecutor says \n       \n  By Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:57 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  The Illinois sheriff’s deputy who killed  Sonya Massey  in her Springfield home last year eschewed his training and the principles of policing when he shot the Black woman who had called 911 for help, a prosecutor said Wednesday in Sean Grayson’s murder trial.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, who is white, faces three counts of first-degree murder for  shooting the 36-year-old single mother  on July 6, 2024, during a confrontation over her handling of a pot of hot water she removed from her stove.\n \n\n   \n  Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser told the jury of eight women and four men in Peoria, where the trial was moved due to national attention, that body camera video will show Massey posed no threat when Grayson and another Sangamon County Sheriff’s deputy, Dawson Farley, entered her home. Massey, who had mental health problems, had called 911 about a suspected prowler.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s a little scattered but she’s nice and kind and talking to him and you’ll see that interaction,” Milhiser said. “You will see what happens when the defendant gets mad at a woman who is in her kitchen and has called for help. He gets mad and shoots and kills her without lawful justification.”\n \n\n   \n  “He did not follow his training. He did not follow police principles.”\n \n\n   \n  But Grayson’s attorney, Daniel Fultz, implored the jury not to make a hasty decision. He said when Massey approached with the pan of water, Grayson repeatedly demanded she put it down before “making a decision no police officer wants to make.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ms. Massey lifted the pot of water above her head and the evidence will show that the use of force was reasonable under the circumstances without the benefit of 20/20 hindsight,” Fultz said. “What happened to Ms. Massey was a tragedy, but it was not a crime.”\n \n\n   \n  The killing has prompted continued questions about US law enforcement shootings of  Black people in their home s  and generated a change in  Illinois law requiring fuller transparency  on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson, 31, has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of murder, he faces 45 years to life in prison. Prosecutors dismissed single counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct.\n \n\n   \n  Grayson and Farley had entered Massey’s home to report they had found no suspicious activity when Grayson noticed the pan on the stove and ordered it removed.\n \n\n   \n  According to bodycam video that is certain to play a key role in the trial, Grayson and Massey joked about how the deputy backed away as she moved the pan before Massey said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Grayson later told sheriff’s investigators he thought Massey’s statement  meant she intended to kill him . He yelled at her to drop the pot and in the subsequent commotion, fired three shots, striking her just below the eye.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois State Police Lt. Eric Weston, a crime scene investigator, testified Wednesday that he retrieved two casings from the home shortly after the shooting, then returned two days later after learning about the third gunshot.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators did not collect the pan for weeks, Weston acknowledged during questioning by defense attorney Mark Wykoff.\n \n\n   \n  “You knew an hour after the event occurred that the pot was basically employed as a weapon, but you didn’t collect it then,” Wykoff said. “You didn’t collect it during the second search when the third casing was collected. You collected it about two weeks later.”\n \n\n   \n  Farley was expected to testify later in the day.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/russia-air-attack-kyiv-ukraine-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:58:00+00:00","title":"Deadly Russian air attacks force power cuts across Ukraine, as Trump-Putin summit shelved","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia launched a large-scale air attack on Ukraine early Wednesday, targeting cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv with drones, missiles, and fighter jets.

 The attack, which involved drones, missiles and fighter jets, targeted vast swathes of the country, including the capital Kyiv, and came as uncertainty swirled over a proposed Putin-Trump summit . \n \n\n   \n  CNN reported Tuesday, citing a Trump administration official, that there were “no plans” for such a meeting in the immediate future. Trump said later he didn’t want the summit to be “a waste of time,” despite the US president saying last week the two leaders would be meeting in Budapest, Hungary, “within two weeks or so, pretty quick.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite Trump’s comments on Tuesday, Moscow said the following day that preparations were continuing.\n \n\n   \n  “Preparations for the summit are ongoing.

According to preliminary information, many are experiencing acute stress reactions.”\n \n\n   \n  In his daily address Wednesday, Zelensky said Trump’s call for Ukraine and Russia to stop at the current frontlines was a “good compromise,” but added he doubted Putin would support it.\n \n\n   \n  Katarina Maternovak, the European Union’s ambassador to Ukraine, described a “night of horror” overnight on Tuesday into Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “I spent that night on the floor of my hotel bathroom, turned into a shelter.

The memo, dated October 15, does carve out an exception for the Pentagon Inspector General office, the agency’s internal watch dog.\n \n\n   \n  Breaking Defense  first reported  the details of the policy.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told CNN that the memo is “a pragmatic step to internally review the Department’s processes for communicating with Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Department intends to improve accuracy and responsiveness in communicating with the Congress to facilitate increased transparency,” Parnell said. “This review is for processes internal to the Department and does not change how or from whom Congress receives information.”\n \n\n   \n  The memo is the latest in a series of steps by Hegseth to control information at the Pentagon and how the Pentagon communicates with those outside the agency. Hegseth,  whose tenure  has been beleaguered by leaks, has also moved to restrict engagement by Defense Department personnel with think tanks or other outside events and conferences. The memo was signed the same day that dozens of reporters  turned in their badges  rather than sign a document the Pentagon had produced that included restrictions on their work.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Pentagon official told CNN that the memo is consistent with longstanding Defense Department policy that has not been enforced in the past. A 2006-era directive states that all legislative activities “shall be centrally directed and carefully coordinated with the [assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs] prior to execution,” and that the assistant secretary would have “overall supervision” of legislative affairs for the department.\n \n\n   \n  And while the memo says explicitly that engagements must be coordinated or approved with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Legislative Affairs), the senior official said some engagements can also be approved by the military services’ legislative offices instead of pushing them all the way up to the Pentagon’s legislative affairs office.\n \n\n   \n  However, a separate defense official told CNN on Wednesday that further internal guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense made clear the policy would restrict and centralize all communications with elected officials, and that even service legislative affairs staffers would need approval from OSD before responding to congressional inquiries.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not business as usual … They have been very clear across the military that this is a restriction, and they want to control it all centrally,” the defense official said.\n \n\n   \n  The memo says the Pentagon “relies on a collaborative and close partnership with Congress to achieve our legislative goals,” which requires “coordination of alignment of Department messaging.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously reported that Congress has had limited engagement with Hegseth to the frustration of lawmakers and staffers; a Senate aide told CNN there has been “significantly less” communication than what lawmakers expect.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways the memo is reminiscent of efforts by other administrations to control engagement with Congress, the Senate aide told CNN. For past administrations that has been in the form of a temporary pause in interactions or review.\n \n\n   \n  The aide said, the memo fits “a disturbing pattern of attempting to stifle communication with Congress and the public that is unique and characteristic to Pete Hegseth,” but that in practice it could be less restrictive than the language initially appears.\n \n\n   \n  “There is so much required and frankly beneficial interaction between Congress and the Department … There are very responsible and professional people who are doing their jobs and liaising with Congress, and 99% of it is business as usual,” the aide said. “I think this is a bad misunderstanding and frankly just another example of their paranoia to try to clamp down in this way.”\n \n\n   \n  The senior Pentagon official said the memo is not meant to be restrictive, but an effort to coordinate the Pentagon’s messaging to Congress to avoid mistakes like officials contradicting themselves to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  “When we go and we don’t coordinate our messaging, we run the risk of being in direct conflict with our budget request and our proposals on behalf of the Department,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  There has also been frustration with officials who are not in legislative affairs responding to questions from lawmakers or staffers on Capitol Hill, who are “answering on behalf of the Department and they’re not coordinating their messaging,” the senior official said.\n \n\n   \n  A former senior Pentagon official pointed to the logistical challenges of doing what the memo says is required, telling CNN that the Defense Department does thousands of engagements with Congress and state officials a month, talking with staffers regularly on everything from personnel and military installation issues to operational details. It would be logistically challenging to get prior approval and coordination for every one of those engagements.\n \n\n   \n  The memo says that the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, Dane Hughes, will conduct a review of all congressional affairs activities and submit a report to Hegseth detailing how to streamline activities, current issues with the congressional engagement process and more.\n \n\n   \n  Hughes said in a memo signed October 17 that he would be convening a working group as part of his review and directed senior leaders and combatant commanders to provide a senior official from their office who oversees legislative functions to participate.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/welfare-cuts-fuel-rise-far-right-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"11:43:00-04:00","title":"Welfare cuts are fueling the rise of the far right globally, the UN finds","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A United Nations report finds that cuts to social protection systems—such as tighter eligibility rules and reduced benefits—have created economic insecurity and alienation among people in poverty, fueling the global rise of far-right movements.

Around 20 million people in  India’s  capital woke up on Wednesday breathing the most polluted air of any major city in the world, a day after celebrations for the  Diwali festival , during which revelers typically set off fireworks and firecrackers.\n \n\n   \n  As of Wednesday, New Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration – a measure of pollutants in the air – was more than 40 times the World Health Organization’s annualized guideline level, according to Swiss air quality monitoring company IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi grapples with severe year-round pollution, but the winter months are typically worst, when millions of farmers in surrounding regions burn stubble in their fields to clear the way for the next crop.\n \n\n   \n  The sharp deterioration in air quality this week comes following celebrations for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, which traditionally involves the widespread use of firecrackers which release sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides into the air, as well as harmful heavy metals.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, authorities enacted a complete ban on making, selling or using firecrackers in New Delhi, citing hazardous pollution levels.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the Supreme Court permitted the use of so-called “green” firecrackers – which manufacturers claim are less polluting – but only within a certain time window. However, residents reported that this curfew was poorly enforced, with people bursting firecrackers long after the deadline, and that “non-green” firecrackers still appeared to be available.\n \n\n   \n  “Year on year, it goes from bad to worse,” said resident Anushka Singh.\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year-old graphic designer said she usually stays at home at Diwali with her dog, to “help him through the incessant noise that doesn’t stop until late at night or early morning.”\n \n\n   \n  She described how her throat becomes scratchy, and her eyes begin to burn as she steps out of her home the day after Diwali.\n \n\n   \n  “Living in Delhi is a pain… I just wish that given the decades of data we would at least have stricter rules, ones that are actually implemented,” Singh said.\n \n\n   \n  Chandra Tandon, 52, who owns a corner store in the capital, said bursting crackers are “part of the fun and happens once a year,” but agreed that it becomes “difficult” for people who must endure the aftermath.\n \n\n   \n  “I was breathing in those fumes throughout and it’s definitely not good,” she said. “It would be good if we left the crackers burning to the kids… If you’ve lived in Delhi long enough, you know how bad it gets every year with the pollution. So, adults at least should do their part.”\n \n\n   \n    A long-term crisis\n \n\n   \n  Despite the city being the political heart of the country, officials have had little success in cleaning up Delhi’s toxic air.\n \n\n   \n  Previous attempts to curb pollution have included sprinkling water on the roads, restricting traffic by requiring vehicles with odd or even license plates to travel on alternating days, and constructing in 2018 two smog towers worth 200 million rupees ($2.4 million), intended to act as giant air purifiers.\n \n\n   \n  But a lack of strict enforcement and coordination means progress has been slow, experts suggest.\n \n\n   \n  India is also desperate to fuel its booming economy and meet the energy needs of its 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, three Indian cities, including New Delhi, were ranked among the world’s most polluted, according to air quality tracker IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  Kolkata in the east was in fourth place, while Mumbai in the west ranked number 10.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/entertainment/oscar-race-movies-so-far","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:26:00-04:00","title":"Oscar Nominations Are Already Three Months Away: Where the 2025 Race Stands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the Oscar nomination window approaches, the 2025 awards race is shaping up with several strong contenders, led by Paul Thomas Anderson’s critically acclaimed film 'One Battle After Another', which has earned a 95% critic score and is a likely nominee for Best Picture.

Here’s where the race stands so far \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:26 PM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Where has 2025 gone? One way to mark the dizzying elapsing of time: The  Oscar  race is already coming into focus, now that we’re –  gulp  – three months out from nominations.\n \n\n   \n  The competition still has much time to take shape, but there are a few frontrunners emerging, starting with Paul Thomas Anderson’s recently released chaotic opus “One Battle After Another” – which has enjoyed the best word of mouth this year, notching an impressive critic score of 95 on both Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. (“One Battle After Another” is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n \n\n   \n  But not far behind are several other titles, including many yet to be released, like “Sentimental Value,” “Marty Supreme,” “Hamnet,” “Bugonia” and “Wicked: For Good,” to name a few.\n \n\n   \n  A preliminary breakdown of top categories follows:\n \n\n   \n    Best picture\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 15 years since the Academy opened up this race to more than the previously fixed number of five nominees – vacillating between eight and ten best picture contenders, and  settling consistently on ten  for the last few years. This year, that leaves the field open to quite a few possibilities. First, there’s “One Battle After Another,” whose director Anderson has frequently attracted Oscar love over the years and is seemingly a shoe-in for scoring a nomination for the night’s top honor. Ryan Coogler’s period-horror hit “Sinners” (also a Warner Bros. Pictures production) is also a solid contender, despite coming out in the summer months, which is a window often overlooked by Academy voters.\n \n\n   \n  At this juncture, other buzzy films generating a fair amount of Oscar buzz are the English-, Norwegian- and Swedish-language “Sentimental Value” (out on November 7) starring Stellan Skarsgård and Elle Fanning, “Hamnet” (out November 27) featuring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, and “Marty Supreme” (out on Christmas Day) with Timothée Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow. Let us also not overlook the Palme d’Or-winning  Iranian film “It was Just an Accident,”  out this month.\n \n\n   \n  In the “maybe…could be…you never know!” section, there’s summer actioner “F1,” Netflix’s “Jay Kelly” with George Clooney and  Guillermo del Toro-directed “Frankenstein.”  These are probably in the long-shot category, but hey, Hollywood loves a twist.\n \n\n   \n    Best actress\n \n\n   \n  The Academy certainly favors return nominees, but it also  can’t resist a new arrival . This year, look for newcomer Chase Infiniti – whose quietly explosive performance is at the center of “One Battle After Another” – to be in the conversation. And although not a newbie on the scene, acclaimed Norwegian performer Renate Reinsve could have a place in the race for her work as the resentful daughter of an estranged director in “Sentimental Value,” which would mark her first Oscar nod.\n \n\n   \n  As for returning favorites, there’s Buckley, who was nominated for best supporting actress in 2022 for “The Lost Daughter,” and is all but sure to receive one again this year for her lead role in Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” playing a grief-stricken mother and wife to one William Shakespeare (Mescal). It would also be a major upset if Cynthia Erivo isn’t again recognized for her performance as Elphaba in the sequel “Wicked: For Good,” even though the film has yet to be screened for most anyone.\n \n\n   \n  Other possible contenders who are not new to the Oscar race include Amanda Seyfried in “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Julia Roberts in “After the Hunt,” “Bugonia’s” Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence for “Die My Love.”\n \n\n   \n    Best actor\n \n\n   \n  Let’s assume we’re reserving one chair for “One Battle’s” Leonardo DiCaprio – already an Oscar-winner for 2015’s “The Revenant.” That leaves us four slots to play with in the best actor race.\n \n\n   \n  Actually, make that three, because “Narcos” actor Wagner Moura, who is making waves for his work in the Brazilian film “The Secret Agent,” already won best actor at Cannes for the espionage thriller. In the film, he plays a technology expert in late-’70s Recife who discovers he’s being targeted by some unsavory characters. Notable: Only  16 best actor winners from the ritzy Cannes fest  have gone on to be nominated for an Academy Award.\n \n\n   \n  The three other spots could go several ways. Michael B. Jordan, who plays twins with very different fates in “Sinners,” and Chalamet, who would be returning for a second consecutive Oscar nomination (and his third in total), are strong options.\n \n\n   \n  On their heels, however, might be “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White, whose portrayal of Bruce Springsteen in “Deliver Me from Nowhere” has certainly  generated press  and some voter buzz. Other potential nominees include   Dwayne Johnson for “The Smashing Machine,” Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon” – in which  he plays Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart  – and Jesse Plemons for his turn as a wild conspiracy theorist in Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia.”\n \n\n   \n    Best supporting actress\n \n\n   \n  The best supporting actress race is a tough one to predict, since as usual, there’s just so much to choose from. Amy Madigan, known to most for ’80s films like “Uncle Buck” and “Field of Dreams,” turned out a bonkers performance in this summer’s breakout elevated horror hit “Weapons” (also from Warner Bros.) and has appeared on several lists as a favorite to be nominated here. It would mark her second Oscar nomination in this same category in exactly 40 years, after 1985’s “Twice in a Lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n  While horror doesn’t often get recognized by the Academy, the precedent has indeed been set – Ruth Gordon won Oscar gold in 1969 for playing a somewhat similar character in “Rosemary’s Baby,” and landmark genre films like “The Exorcist” and “Aliens” also received Academy recognition for the actresses who starred in those films.\n \n\n   \n  Outside of that, keep your eyes on Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall, who each shine in “One Battle After Another,” and Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas for their work in “Sentimental Value.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’s too early to count out Ariana Grande, who will again portray Glinda in the upcoming “Wicked: For Good,” especially if the movie ends up being great.\n \n\n   \n    Best supporting actor\n \n\n   \n  If Sean Penn gets a nomination for his mercenary-like villain Colonel Lockjaw in “One Battle,” he could very well end up joining an elite group of three-time Oscar winners that includes Meryl Streep, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jack Nicholson and Frances McDormand.\n \n\n   \n  But “Hamnet’s”   Mescal, a returning nominee following 2022’s “Aftersun,” also has a strong chance.   While several actors have gotten nominated for playing roles in films based on Shakespeare’s works, no one has been nominated for playing the man himself. (Yes, 1998’s “Shakespeare in Love” was showered with Academy love, but the Bard-playing actor Joseph Fiennes was not nominated.)\n \n\n   \n  Other potential contenders in this category could include Skarsgård for “Sentimental Value,” Adam Sandler for Netflix’s “Jay Kelly,” and Jeremy Strong – who was nominated last year for his chilling portrayal of Roy Cohn in “The Apprentice” – for “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere.”\n \n\n   \n  Oscar nominations will be unveiled on the morning of January 22, 2026. The 98th Academy Awards will be held on March 15.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/football-nfl-pro-bowl-moves-to-super-bowl-week","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"11:43:00-04:00","title":"The NFL’s Pro Bowl is moving to Super Bowl week","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The NFL has announced that the 2026 Pro Bowl will be moved to Super Bowl LX week, taking place on February 3, 2026, at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.

is non-binding, but it does carry political weight and is expected to increase pressure on Israel to cooperate with the UN and other aid agencies.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s ambassador to the UN criticized the court’s opinion as “shameful.”\n \n\n   \n  Israel has accused UNRWA of having more than a thousand employees affiliated with Hamas, and of teaching hate against Israel in its schools. UNRWA has repeatedly denied the accusations, saying there are no grounds for “a blanket description” of the whole institution as being infiltrated by Hamas. A  UN investigation found  that nine employees from UNWRA’s 13,000 staff in Gaza “may have” been involved in the Hamas-led October 7 attacks.\n \n\n   \n  But the court said Wednesday that Israel has not substantiated allegations ﻿“that a significant part of UNRWA employees are members of Hamas or other terrorist factions.”\n \n\n   \n  “The court concludes that in the present circumstances, the United Nations, acting through UNRWA, has been an indispensable provider of humanitarian relief in the Gaza Strip,” the judge said, also criticizing the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which Israel has claimed was a replacement for some of UNRWA’s work.\n \n\n   \n  “The court recalls Israel’s obligation not to use starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare as an occupying power,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli officials have accused the UN court of being politicized and weaponized against Israel.\n \n\n   \n  “They are blaming Israel for not cooperating with UN organs … They should be blaming themselves. Those organs became breeding grounds for terrorists,” Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the UN, claimed Wednesday in response to the opinion, which he described as a “political document.”\n \n\n   \n  A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been in place for more than a week, and Israel is allowing increased aid into Gaza in line with the truce agreement’s goal of 600 trucks per day, according to US and Israeli officials.\n \n\n   \n  Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General, welcomed the “unambiguous” legal opinion in a post on X and stated that the UN has the resources to “immediately scale up” the humanitarian response in the territory.\n \n\n   \n    More international court cases pending\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s opinion is one of several cases related to Israel that the UN court has weighed in on since the war began in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  In July 2024, the ICJ said that Israel’s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an  unprecedented move  that called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation of territories that Palestinians want for a future state.\n \n\n   \n  The sweeping opinion ran through a list of Israeli practices that the ICJ said violated international law, including confiscating land, building Israeli settlements in the territories, and depriving Palestinians of natural resources and the right to self-determination. In a case that predated the Israel-Hamas war, the court said Israel abused its position as an occupying power and called on it to cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians firmly rejected that ICJ opinion at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The ICJ also issued a series of emergency measures related to Gaza in 2024, including ordering Israel to  immediately halt  its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, classifying the humanitarian situation there as “disastrous.”\n \n\n   \n  Those measures are part of a broader case brought by South Africa against Israel, which accuses Israel of breaching its obligations under the genocide convention – a claim Israel has vehemently and repeatedly denied.\n \n\n   \n  The ICJ case on genocide is ongoing and expected to last several years. It comes against a backdrop of an  independent UN inquiry ’s conclusion in September that found Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, which echoed the findings of other  genocide experts  and  human rights groups , and which Israel rejected.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli government has maintained that it conducted the war in Gaza in compliance with international law. The government has also repeatedly accused the UN of anti-Israel bias.\n \n\n   \n  The UN court’s proceedings are separate from the investigation into alleged war crimes in Gaza being carried out by  the International Criminal Court  – another international legal body based in The Hague, Netherlands.\n \n\n   \n  Late last year, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and a now-deceased senior Hamas official, Mohammed Deif, who Israel has said was one of the masterminds of the October 7 attacks, and others.\n \n\n   \n  Israel doesn’t recognize the ICC, but it is bound by the statute of the ICJ as a UN member state.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/entertainment/suzanne-somers-ai-clone-husband","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:11:00-04:00","title":"Suzanne Somers' AI Twin Created by Husband to Keep Her Memory Alive","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Suzanne Somers, a beloved actress and health advocate, died in 2023.

matters’: Advocates worry about Melania Trump’s rhetoric around returned Ukrainian children \n       \n  By Betsy Klein, Kylie Atwood, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:08 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While praising  first lady Melania Trump’s  work to return Ukrainian children from Russian captivity,  President Donald Trump  last week seemed to downplay the estimates of the number of children allegedly abducted since the war began.\n \n\n   \n  Seated across the table in the White House Cabinet Room, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not try to correct his counterpart, nor did he answer a reporter’s question about whether he appreciated the American first lady’s efforts. Instead, he turned, cocked his head and silently nodded.\n \n\n   \n  The moment underscored deep sensitivity around a complex issue that the first lady has sought to resolve through direct communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Melania Trump, who has made the well-being and safety of children a priority, advocacy on this issue appeared to be a natural fit and an opportunity to use her massive global platform to make a difference.\n \n\n   \n  But in the week after  she announced  the return of eight Ukrainian children to their families, some advocates who have lauded the children’s return also raised concern in conversations with CNN about the way the first lady got involved — and especially her passive-voice characterization of how the children ended up in Russia, fearing that it will only end up playing to Putin.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from the White House earlier this month, the first lady described “Ukrainian children residing in Russia” and said they’d been “displaced to the Russian Federation because of front-line fighting” — but did not talk about the war crime that many advocates see in Moscow’s alleged abduction of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is moving very carefully, but everyone is clear on the point that the first lady’s office needs to hear: Thank you — but it is 35,000 kids, not seven or eight,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, whose Ukraine Conflict Observatory is operating on private donations through the end of the year after the Trump administration  cut its funding .\n \n\n   \n  “It is kids who were taken as a war crime and kids who are being militarized and were abducted by a state — not lost in the war. Language matters,” Raymond said.\n \n\n   \n  A  September report  from the Yale lab found children have been taken to at least 210 locations, including military bases, orphanages and camps, where they have been reeducated in alignment with pro-Russian narratives and in some cases trained for combat. Many of them have had their identities changed, making them increasingly difficult to track over time.\n \n\n   \n  The first lady’s language ignores the reality of the situation — and could play in Putin’s favor, some advocates for the children told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Bill Taylor, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, applauded Melania Trump’s personal involvement while also noting that Putin likely has ulterior motives.\n \n\n   \n  “Every returned child is wonderful for that family and that child, so that is good. But there are more than 19,000 of these, and I do think that Putin is cynically using this in an attempt to make the Trumps more sympathetic to him,” Taylor told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The estimates of how many children have been allegedly abducted vary, depending on the source and who’s being counted.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump, a day after a  two-hour phone call  with the Russian leader last week, offered his own take on the number. “Some people say it’s 20,000 and some people say it’s 300,” he said during his Friday meeting with Zelensky at the White House. “So, nobody really knows, but she felt very strongly about the children.”\n \n\n   \n  Taylor doesn’t doubt Melania Trump’s compassion for the Ukrainian children — but he does question the Russian leader’s.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the first lady is genuinely interested in getting the Ukrainian children home. But the fact is that Putin is not. He could return all of these kids and end the war tomorrow if he wanted,” Taylor said.\n \n\n   \n  Melania Trump’s efforts came amid mounting pressure from the Ukrainians, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers and evangelicals to get the Trump administration involved in returning the Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska, for example,  traveled to New York  last month with a pressing mission to raise awareness among the international community. Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, she warned that at the current rate, it would take 50 years to return the Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  The American first lady, who employs a skeletal staff, kept the news of the eight children’s release to an extremely small circle of aides before revealing it publicly, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Some Ukrainians at the working level who have been focused on the issue were taken aback by the first lady’s involvement. They welcomed her efforts, but worried about Putin working with her only as part of an effort to downplay the enormity of the problem, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian official dismissed those concerns and said Volodymyr Zelensky was grateful for the US first lady’s intervention.\n \n\n   \n  In her initial announcement, Trump said she and Putin “have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children for the past three months.” She pointed to backchannel meetings and calls following a letter she wrote to the Russian leader, hand-delivered by her husband in  Alaska in August , that obliquely referenced the “darkness” around children impacted by war.\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, a group of key Senate Republicans and Democrats had been pushing for a  resolution  making the return of the abducted children a prerequisite for any negotiated peace agreement to end the war. But despite the first lady’s announcement, the White House has not yet stated a position on the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  While one Republican congressional aide said there is some skepticism regarding Melania Trump’s involvement, for now, there is no appetite on Capitol Hill to push the White House on the topic.\n \n\n   \n  “If there needs to be conversations with the White House on this, there will be, but I have no indication that Melania believes what Putin says,” the aide said, adding that there are some concerns about Putin using a direct line to the first lady to shift the narrative on the allegedly abducted children.\n \n\n   \n  Evangelical groups that have lobbied the White House and the first lady’s office on the issue praised Trump’s receptiveness and argued that the return of eight children was an important turning point.\n \n\n   \n  And Chelsea Sobolik, director of government relations at World Relief, an evangelical humanitarian organization, noted that the effort also marked a critical recognition from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Up until recently, Russia was denying this issue — or they were giving all these false narratives. So I think the fact that this is making waves at the top levels of our US government does mean there’s movement. I view this as a first step, not a last step. There’s so much more work that needs to be done,” Sobolik said.\n \n\n   \n  She signed onto a letter from a group of evangelical leaders thanking Trump — but also encouraging her to keep her foot on the gas.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to urge the Trump Administration to ensure that this remains a central issue and that all estimated 35,000 children are returned as a precondition to any peace talks,” they  wrote .\n \n\n   \n   This headline has been updated.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/sununu-new-hampshire-gop-senate-campaign","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"09:04:00-04:00","title":"Former Sen.

John E. Sununu enters GOP primary race in New Hampshire for the seat he lost in 2008 \n       \n  Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:04 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  New Hampshire Republican John E. Sununu announced a campaign for US Senate on Wednesday, hoping to reclaim a seat he lost nearly two decades ago and boosting the GOP’s chances of regaining a foothold in a region overwhelmingly represented by Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu, 61, is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated by  US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , a Democrat who ousted him in 2008. His decision sets up a primary featuring two former senators: Republican Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and losing to Shaheen in 2014, has been running since June.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe you’re surprised to hear that I’m running for the Senate again. I’m a bit surprised myself,” Sununu said in a video announcement. “Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now? Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  National Republicans consider Sununu a strong candidate and one that allows them to go on the offensive as they look to hold their majority in the chamber next year.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage, are defending seats in Ohio, Maine and North Carolina against a slate of high-profile Democratic candidates. But Republicans are also on the offensive in places like Michigan, Georgia and now, increasingly, New Hampshire — and if they flip one of those seats it will likely put the chamber out of reach for Democrats until at least 2028.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu must first win the primary though, and his past opposition to President Donald Trump could be problematic. While Brown has aligned himself closely with Trump and served as his US ambassador to New Zealand, Sununu backed Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, writing an op-ed calling Trump a “loser.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to win New Hampshire’s leadoff primary, but the state’s voters rejected him for a third time in the general election. And while Republicans control the Statehouse and governor’s office, Democrats have held all four of New Hampshire’s congressional seats since 2017.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu served three terms in the US House before being elected to the Senate at age 38. He was the chamber’s youngest member throughout his term, a fact he emphasized in a 2008 campaign ad that showed him sprinting up a steep mountain path.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s younger, faster, quicker,” a deep-voiced (and somewhat redundant) narrator intones. “Inexhaustible. Tireless. Energetic.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s now the same age Shaheen was when she defeated him and is 16 years older than US Rep. Chris Pappas, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Sununu said Congress has become “loud, dysfunctional, even angry” in his time away, but said he hopes to return “to help calm the waters,” while focusing on the economy, veterans, health care costs and Social Security.\n \n\n   \n  Pappas’ campaign countered that he is the one who has been fighting to lower costs for working families, seniors and small businesses while Sununu has spent years “cashing in and making millions selling out to corporations and working for special interests.”\n \n\n   \n  “Chris Pappas will stand up to corporate special interests and take on anyone to do what is best for New Hampshire, and that’s why Granite Staters will elect him to the US Senate next November,” campaign manager Rachel Petri said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Though Sununu has long been out of office, his name recognition remains high due to his family’s political prominence. His father, John H. Sununu, is a former governor and former White House chief of staff. One of his brothers,  Chris Sununu, served four terms as governor  and flirted with a Senate campaign of his own in 2021. He also shot down a bid this cycle, saying he had spoken to the White House but opted against it.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/09/16/science/earth-quasi-moon-2025-pn7","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00-04:00","title":"Astronomers discover previously unknown quasi-moon near Earth","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Astronomers have discovered 2025 PN7, a previously unknown quasi-moon that has orbited near Earth for about 60 years without being detected due to its small size and faintness.

\n  By Ashley Strickland, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Astronomers have spotted a quasi-moon near Earth — and the small space rock has likely been hanging out near our planet unseen by telescopes for about 60 years, according to new research.\n \n\n   \n  The newly discovered celestial object, named 2025 PN7, is a type of near-Earth asteroid that orbits the sun but sticks close to our planet. Like our world, 2025 PN7 takes one year to complete an orbit around the sun.\n \n\n   \n  Quasi-moons differ from temporary mini-moons that occasionally orbit Earth such as  2024 PT5 , which circled the planet for two months in 2024 and could be an ancient fragment that was blasted off of our primary moon.\n \n\n   \n  The newly found 2025 PN7 is just one of a handful of known quasi-moons with orbits near our planet, including  Kamo‘oalewa , which is also thought to be an ancient lunar fragment. Kamo‘oalewa is one of the destinations of  China’s Tianwen-2 mission  launched in May, which aims to collect and return samples from the space rock in 2027. Currently, there are seven known quasi-satellites near Earth, according to the  European Space Agency .\n \n\n   \n  The Pan-STARRS observatory located on the Haleakala volcano in Hawaii captured observations of 2025 PN7 on August 29. Archival data revealed that the object has been in an Earth-like orbit for decades.\n \n\n   \n  The quasi-moon managed to escape the notice of astronomers for so long because it is small and faint, said Carlos de la Fuente Marcos, a researcher on the faculty of mathematical sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid who recently authored a paper about the space rock. The paper was published on   September 2 in the journal  Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society , which is for timely non-peer-reviewed astronomical observations.\n \n\n   \n  The space rock swings within 186,000 miles (299,337 kilometers) of us during its closest pass of our planet,   de la Fuente Marcos said. For reference, 2025 PN7 is 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth on average, according to  NASA .\n \n\n   \n  “It can only be detected by currently available telescopes when it gets close to our planet as it did this summer,” de la Fuente Marcos explained. “Its visibility windows are few and far between. It is a challenging object.”\n \n\n   \n  Finding and studying quasi-moons can reveal more about our corner of the universe, de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  “The Solar System is full of surprises so we keep looking,” he wrote in an email. “For Earth’s neighborhood, the existence of 2025 PN7 suggests that there may not exist a lower limit to the size of a quasi-satellite.”\n \n\n   \n    A temporary companion\n \n\n   \n  Astronomers are still trying to figure out 2025 PN7’s size. About 98 feet (30 meters) across is a reasonable estimate, de la Fuente Marcos said. It also has the potential to be 62 feet (19 meters) in diameter, according to  EarthSky .\n \n\n   \n  The space rock is currently the smallest-known quasi-moon to have orbited near Earth, de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  Over time, 2025 PN7 switches between a closer, more circular Earthlike orbit and a horseshoe orbit, similar to Kamoʻoalewa’s. During the horseshoe orbit, the space rock can reach a distance of 185 million miles (297 million kilometers) from Earth.\n \n\n   \n  The quasi-moon is expected to remain in its current near-Earth orbit for about another 60 years before the gravitational tug of the sun pulls it back into a horseshoe orbit.\n \n\n   \n  Questions remain about the space rock’s composition, which is currently unknown.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on what little we know so far, it’s almost certainly a rocky and natural object — sometimes old satellites and rocket junk end up in these very-near-Earth kinds of orbits, but we can often tell ‘natural’ (e.g., asteroidal) from ‘artificial’ (e.g., satellite) based on how their orbits evolve on short timescales,” wrote Dr. Teddy Kareta, assistant professor in the department of astrophysics and planetary science at Villanova University, in an email.\n \n\n   \n  Kareta, who has previously studied mini-moons and quasi-moons, was not involved in the research   and said   bad weather has thus far interfered with his plans to observe it.\n \n\n   \n  While 2025 PN7, like Kamoʻoalewa, may also be a piece of the moon, more data is needed to confirm that, de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  De la Fuente Marcos believes that 2025 PN7 came from the Arjuna asteroid belt. Unlike the main asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the Arjuna asteroid is not a distinct belt. Instead, they are a group of small space rocks that have orbits around the sun similar to Earth’s.\n \n\n   \n  Previously, de la Fuente Marcos had proposed that mini-moon 2024 PT5 was also an Arjuna asteroid that could have come from Earth’s moon before becoming part of the belt.\n \n\n   \n  “Now we know that material ejected during lunar impacts may contribute members to the Arjuna secondary asteroid belt,” de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   \n  Even though   quasi-moons and mini-moons can closely approach our planet, they don’t typically pose an impact risk for Earth,   so 2025 PN7 is no threat, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Sending missions to investigate quasi-moons, as Tianwen-2 is expected to do with Kamoʻoalewa, could reveal the true origin and history of these intriguing space rocks — and provide other opportunities as well, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “These asteroids are relatively easy to access for unmanned missions and can be used to test planetary exploration technologies with a relatively modest investment,” de la Fuente Marcos said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/serbia-parliament-shots-fired-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:38:00-04:00","title":"Man seriously injured after shots fired outside Serbian parliament","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man was seriously injured in a shooting incident outside the Serbian parliament building in Belgrade on Wednesday, near a tent camp set up by supporters of President Aleksander Vucic.

expensive weather disasters. Now it’s back — and finding over $100B in losses \n       \n  By Andrew Freedman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters Database, which the Trump administration  “retired” in May , has relaunched outside of the government using the same methodology. In its first update at the new site, the database shows that the first six months of 2025 have been the most expensive first six months of any year since 1980.\n \n\n   \n  The Billion-Dollar Database tracks the financial costs of property and other infrastructure destroyed by extreme weather disasters in the United States, focusing on events that caused $1 billion or more in damages. So far, 2025 has racked up $101.4 billion in such losses. The climate research nonprofit Climate Central  now hosts the database  and makes this information available to insurers, policy makers, broadcast meteorologists and ordinary citizens.\n \n\n   \n  The database was rebuilt and will be maintained by its previous administrator Adam Smith, a former economist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency which used to host it. Smith found 14 billion-dollar disasters in the first half of this year, including the Los Angeles wildfires in January and a tornado outbreak across the central US in mid-March.   More billion-dollar disasters are likely to be added to the list before 2025 is over.   \n \n\n   \n  Without the database, the public would have no easy way to track the cost of extreme weather events, many of which are becoming more common and severe because of climate change.\n \n\n   \n  But climate change is not the sole reason the database shows an upward trend in both the number of billion-dollar disasters and the amount they cost. Population growth and an increase in the number of buildings in harm’s way are the dominant factors, according to Smith.   \n \n\n   \n  “Either way you look at it, the rise in damages relates to human activities and choices, and so you need to use information in context to better evaluate future choices,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The frequency of billion-dollar disasters has particularly increased in the last decade, Smith said, occurring nearly twice as often compared to the 30-year inflation-adjusted average.\n \n\n   \n  Between 1980 and 2024, there were nine such disasters on average each year. In the past five years, that annual average has jumped to 24. The  record for a single year  was 28 events in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  In the first six months of 2025, the list of billion-dollar disasters is mostly comprised of severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks, reflecting the conspicuous absence of landfalling hurricanes so far this season.\n \n\n   \n  However, the LA fires in January cost $61.2 billion, making them the costliest wildfires in US history, according to Climate Central.\n \n\n   \n  Climate Central hired Smith after the NOAA economist took early retirement this year, as part of the Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal bureaucracy.\n \n\n   \n  NOAA’s official list stops   at the end of   2024. Climate Central’s version picks up in 2025 and will continue from there.\n \n\n   \n  The relaunched list uses the same methodology as the old NOAA one, Smith said. It relies on data from insurance companies and other sources, some of which is proprietary, to tally up total losses. The decision to discontinue the database was due in part to Smith’s exit from NOAA. It would have been a difficult task for the agency to continue without him, but it could have done it, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The choice to discontinue the database was in keeping with the administration’s focus on cutting climate change datasets and programs across federal agencies. But there were calls for it to continue from multiple sectors.\n \n\n   \n  “This dataset was simply too important to stop being updated. Demand for its revival actually came from several aspects of industry and society, including decision makers in the insurance, reinsurance risk space, academia, Congress and local communities,” Smith said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/economy/bessent-argentina-lifeline-warren","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"Bessent calls $20 billion lifeline to Argentina a ‘mission-critical’ function of Treasury during shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the Treasury Department’s decision to provide a $20 billion currency swap to Argentina during a federal government shutdown, calling it a mission-critical effort to maintain global financial stability.

Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  His remarks came in response to a letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, who wrote to Bessent a week prior requesting an explanation as to why the Treasury Department was working on the Argentinian lifeline during a shutdown of the federal government that has restrained resources.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been forced to prioritize mission-critical efforts necessary to the discharge of the President’s constitutional duties — including national security and global financial stability,” Bessent wrote to Warren, in a letter the senator shared exclusively with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The $20 billion lifeline framework Bessent  announced earlier this month  is known as a “currency swap,” which gives Argentina’s central bank the ability to exchange pesos for US dollars with the Treasury. Doing so can help stabilize its financial markets by injecting more liquidity. Effectively, though, it’s a loan from the US government.\n \n\n   \n  The Argentine peso has significantly devalued against other currencies since President Javier Milei, a close ally of President Donald Trump, suffered major defeats in local elections, raising doubts that he’ll hold on to his legislative majority in midterm elections later this month. Trump said last week future efforts to boost the Argentine economy would be contingent on the election results.\n \n\n   \n  But on top of questions Trump has faced on the rationale for an economic rescue of the South American country, a looming concern is whether the efforts have been successful.\n \n\n   \n  While the Argentine peso initially rose following Bessent’s announcement, the currency set a fresh low earlier this week, suggesting more work could be needed to stabilize it.\n \n\n   \n  Warren also questioned Treasury’s plans to work with private-sector banks to generate a $20 billion loan to Argentina on top of the $20 billion rescue package from the government.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent, in his response, did not directly address her questions regarding private-sector involvement.

Jesse Jackson Sr., a civil rights leader and political outsider, ran for president in two groundbreaking campaigns that changed American politics. A son of the segregated South who went from nothing to eventually becoming one of the most well-known public figures in America, Jackson’s outsider political campaigns challenged the Democratic Party to reform its nominating process, more equitably include women and non-white voters, and appeal to Americans on a platform of economic populism. \n \n\n   \n   In 1984, Jackson lost the nomination but started a movement he called the “Rainbow Coalition.” By 1988, Jackson was a force to be reckoned with. This time, he faced a crowded primary of established political hands. The race, led by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, was heated from the beginning. Jackson, a polarizing but outsized figure, was a magnet for media attention. In both 1984 and 1988, Jackson appealed to Black voters in the South, who formed a critical voting bloc in the Democratic primary. But this time, his appeal among white voters was growing as well. In March 1988, Jackson came from behind to win the Michigan Democratic caucuses and set off a panic in his party. For the first time, the party and Jackson himself, began contemplating: What would happen if he became the Democratic nominee for president? \n \n\n   \n   Below is an excerpt from Abby Phillip’s  new book , “A Dream Deferred,” which publishes on October 28.  \n \n\n   \n  Jesse Jackson convened half a dozen of his closest advisers in his Chicago home. For the first time, he was beginning to lay out what he would have to do to build an actual presidency if he were to become the nominee.\n \n\n   \n  There was plenty of fear, too. In his own mind, the gravity of the presidency — or the potential of it — descended on him all at once. This was the same man who wore a bulletproof jacket provided to him by the Secret Service as a matter of course during both his campaigns. But for the first time, he was discussing with his closest aides what they would do about cabinet positions and White House appointments.\n \n\n   \n  “He was seriously thinking for the first time, ‘Wait a second, this could be doable,’” recalled campaign manager Jerry Austin, a white Jewish man from New York  with a long history of political campaigns in the heartland.\n \n\n   \n  “By that time, we had some momentum, and the issues that we raised were resonating,” Jackson said. “Our issues were on time, issues about economic justice and shared economic security, a connection between family farms and urban workers, how blacks and whites had to relate together, and browns. So, it was in full gear. We used to call it ‘poor campaign, rich message.’ Our message was winning.”\n \n\n   \n  A similar realization had come to Democratic Party officials, who watched in shock as Jackson beat Dukakis 2–1 in a key industrial midwestern state. The Michigan victory also would, potentially briefly, leave Jackson with an outright delegate lead — a nightmare scenario for some in the party. “The party is up against an extraordinary endgame,” Democratic pollster Paul Maslin told The New York Times. “If this guy has more convention votes than anyone else, how can we not nominate him? But how can we nominate him?”\n \n\n   \n  Others were blunter, though unwilling to put their names on the record. They whispered about denying Jackson the nomination if he entered the convention with the most delegates. “I’m not saying that he can do that,” one anonymous party veteran told the Times. “But if he could, we would be in an impossible situation. We’d have the choice of turning our backs on Jesse, and alienating the Blacks, or nominating him and almost certainly losing in November.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dukakis campaign  was suddenly under the microscope. The Massachusetts governor had plenty going for him organizationally, but almost nothing that gripped the hearts of primary voters. “We must acknowledge the strength of Jackson’s message,” one of Dukakis’s supporters, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, said. On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers were skeptical about Dukakis the man and the uninspiring campaign he was running. Even if they wanted to “stop Jackson,” they were trapped. They were deathly afraid of being called racist for opposing a Black candidate but were convinced that if Jackson were the nominee, the Republicans would run away with the race in historic fashion.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They were buying into his campaign’\n \n\n   \n  The relationship between Jackson and Austin, his campaign manager, had been cordial but uneasy until this point. Unlike many people around Jackson, Austin was not a longtime loyalist. Yet the victory in Michigan seemed to act as a pressure valve releasing some of the distrust Jackson may have felt for Austin—at least temporarily.\n \n\n   \n  The campaign finally seemed to be getting its footing. With Austin’s arrival and a more sophisticated finance team being brought on, Jackson was well positioned to take advantage of the financial windfalls that came from his better-than-expected performance on Super Tuesday. He was continuing to run, by far, the leanest of the campaigns still in the field. But the sudden uptick in fundraising among smaller donations and larger checks caught the attention of his rivals. The campaign began using mail solicitations to fundraise. And with each campaign victory, raising money from wealthy donors became easier.\n \n\n   \n  On that front, Jackson was playing catch-up with the other, more establishment candidates in the race. But where none of them could touch his candidacy was with his small-dollar appeal. It was one of the great gifts Jackson had, taken straight from the pulpit. At rallies and campaign events in churches and high school gyms, the ask would start at a thousand dollars. Could anyone spare a thousand? Not one hand in the room went up—nor did Jackson expect that any would. The ask then went down to five hundred, then to fifty, then twenty and ten, until virtually every hand in the room was raised and people put what they had into the collection hat.\n \n\n   \n  “Afterward, I said to him, ‘Why do you start asking for a thousand? There’s nobody in this church with a thousand dollars,’” Austin recalled. “And he said, ‘When I get to “Who will give me something?” everybody would give me something.’”\n \n\n   \n  “They were buying into his campaign,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n    Tranquilizing the establishment\n \n\n   \n  It was past time for Jackson to begin to calm the nerves of the party establishment in Washington. With the help of former DNC chairman John C. White and Bert Lance, former budget director for President Jimmy Carter, the campaign gathered around thirty-five Democrats representing a cross section of fundraisers, party officials, and tastemakers in a ballroom at the Jefferson Hotel in DC. Jackson worked the room. The aim was to “raise the comfort level” of party officials. One attendee called it a “tranquilizer” for the Democratic Party chattering class.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of those kinds of people wind up making up public opinion in a very small subset,” said Ann Lewis. “This was about, at the most basic level, relieving people’s anxiety because I consistently thought Jesse had been so underestimated and not quite caricatured, but unfairly portrayed by the press. … And for people to see him as he really was, which was this smart, thoughtful guy and someone who really wanted the Democratic Party to succeed. They didn’t know that.”\n \n\n   \n  Jackson was buoyant as he went into Wisconsin ahead of its April 5 primary. The crowds seemed to validate the growing interest in his candidacy. He and his campaign were confident that he could appeal to the state’s college towns and urban communities. Jackson had high hopes for the state, where his rallies had been enthusiastically received even in white farming communities.\n \n\n   \n  They held a rally on the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Paul Wellstone, who would later become a progressive US senator from Minnesota, was Jackson’s state director there. A crowd nearly the size of the town’s population of 2,800 showed up in rural Amery, Wisconsin, to hear Jackson speak. As they gathered on the Blu-Fay dairy farm, there was almost as much appreciation for Jackson showing up there as for his message. “The truly impressive thing is here’s a Black man coming up to rural Wisconsin, to a community where all the Blacks could fill that barn, and there would still be a lot of room,” said Skip Shireman, a 61-year-old retired schoolteacher.\n \n\n   \n  There was interest, no doubt, in Jackson’s candidacy and message, but the campaign was ill-equipped to capture that curiosity and transform it into votes. There were memorable messages, to be sure — “We will choose farms over arms in this generation” — but Jackson was characteristically short on specifics. If anything, his candidacy was beginning to be a repository for disenchantment with the rest of the Democratic field. “The man has something to say,” said Bob Jahnke, an electric plant worker who came out to see Jackson. “We had (US Rep. Dick) Gephardt and Dukakis here last Saturday. Gephardt had somewhat of a message, but Dukakis didn’t say much.”\n \n\n   \n  In more moderate La Crosse, old party hands who had thrown their support behind Dukakis or Gore found discord in their own homes. “My mother is voting for Jesse Jackson, my sister is voting for Jesse Jackson,” a state representative who had thrown his hat in for Gore told a reporter. “I can’t even convince my own family to vote for Al Gore.”\n \n\n   \n  The energy around Jackson’s candidacy was unmistakable and set his opponents’ more traditional campaigns in stark relief. As the April 5 primary approached, Dukakis was feeling the pressure to better define himself and his candidacy in the minds of uninspired voters. “I have no interest in being known as the Great Communicator,” he said. “I want to be known as the Great Builder. I want to make the American dream come alive again.” \n \n\n   \n    Electability concerns win out\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s growing populist appeal was rising just as rapidly as the panic among establishment Democrats and the party faithful. A U.S. News & World Report poll put a Jackson-led presidential ticket far behind Vice President George H.W. Bush in a general election. Meanwhile, a Dukakis-led ticket with Jackson as vice president would narrowly beat Bush. The survey quantified persistent reservations among the electorate about Jackson’s candidacy. Those two forces came crashing together in spectacular fashion on Election Night in Wisconsin.\n \n\n   \n  Thanks to Michigan, the expectations were sky high for Jackson. Austin’s strategy banked on defying expectations by overperforming among white voters in a state where Jackson could not necessarily rely on a large Black vote for credibility. But the Michigan victory changed all that. It refocused attention in the media on the question of “electability” and set victory as the standard that Jackson had to meet.\n \n\n   \n  By Election Day, the tides had turned, and Dukakis pulled out a decisive victory.\n \n\n   \n  “We got creamed,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of securing an easy victory that his large, enthusiastic crowds suggested, Jackson finished second. In a poll around the primary, about a third of primary voters said management skills and the candidate’s experience were the main factors that determined their vote—and that group overwhelmingly supported Dukakis.\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin was “the end of the hope that you might actually have this miracle take place,” Borosage said. Dukakis’s message of “competence not charisma” worked. Jackson performed better with white voters, but any momentum he was hoping for after Michigan was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “In Wisconsin there were people who would have voted for Jesse but didn’t want him to be the nominee because they didn’t think he could win,” Austin said. “Dukakis was a safe haven.”\n \n\n   \n   Despite a groundswell of grassroots support for Jackson’s insurgent campaign, it was never matched by elected Democrats and party leaders. Jackson finished second to Dukakis in the 1988 primary but secured leverage at the Democratic National Convention. He used it to push through a series of changes to the Democratic Party’s platform and rules, including one that would become pivotal in another primary where a Black candidate, Barack Obama, sought the nomination against a more establishment figure. Jackson hoped that he would be considered seriously as running mate to Dukakis. The two men and their wives met at Dukakis’ Brookline, Massachusetts, home in the lead-up to the convention. But ultimately, Dukakis chose a white Southerner, Sen.  Lloyd Bentsen  of Texas. After a sharply negative general election campaign against Vice President George H.W. Bush, Dukakis lost in an electoral landslide. \n \n\n   \n   The headline on this story has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/us/los-angeles-immigration-us-marshal-injured","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:43:00-04:00","title":"US Marshal and Undocumented Immigrant Injured in Shooting During ICE Stop in Los Angeles","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a routine immigration enforcement operation in South Los Angeles on October 22, 2025, a 44-year-old Mexican national named Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a popular TikTok streamer known as Richard LA with over 133,000 followers, was involved in a confrontation with ICE agents.

Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:46 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A key group of American borrowers is falling significantly behind on their car loans. It’s yet another sign that the US economy is forming some serious cracks, leaving the most vulnerable in financial distress.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of subprime borrowers – those with credit scores below 670 – who are at least 60 days late on their car loans has doubled since 2021 to 6.43%, according to Fitch Ratings. That’s worse than during the past three recessions – during the Covid pandemic, the Great Recession or the dot-com bust.\n \n\n   \n  America’s current subprime delinquency rate is at the second-highest level since the early 1990s. The only time it was higher: this past January. Cars are being repossessed at the highest rate since the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a disturbing trend to economists: Car loans are typically the last payments that Americans are willing to miss. They’re too important to their lives: Cars are essential tools to get to work, drive families and access food.\n \n\n   \n    No room for error\n \n\n   \n   Record car prices  and  high interest rates , combined with other  inflationary pressures , have sent average auto payments to record levels and have put significant stress on car owners.\n \n\n   \n  Although the financial stress on subprime car borrowers has stabilized in 2025 after large increases in late payments and repossessions over the past two years, economists fear what might happen if the  labor market  grows considerably weaker and layoffs become more common.\n \n\n   \n  For subprime borrowers, the default rate – those whose cars have been or are about to be repossessed – which stood at nearly 10% in September, according to Cox Automotive data. That’s down from a year ago but above the long-term average.\n \n\n   \n  Those borrowers often have no choice but to default. They can’t sell their cars because they owe so much more than it is worth. They often have already missed payments on other obligations, such as mortgage payments or rent, as well as payments due on credit cards and student loans.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no room for error,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.\n \n\n   \n    Surging costs\n \n\n   \n  Just over half of new car leases and more than three-quarters of new car loans made in the second quarter had monthly payments of $500 or more, and 46% of used car loans have payments of $500 or above, according to Experian. For new car loans, more than 17% have payments of more than $1,000.\n \n\n   \n  Repair costs have also surged – at a time when many are holding onto their cars for longer to avoid splurging on a new one. Motor vehicle  repair costs surged 15%  year-over-year in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s the most in nearly two years. And repair costs increased 5% between July and August, the biggest monthly increase on record.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, car insurance rates have increased significantly since the pandemic. In August, car insurance rose by the smallest annual rate in three years – but that still amounted to a hefty near-5% jump, well above the overall inflation rate.\n \n\n   \n    Consumer pain\n \n\n   \n  The increased costs of owning and maintaining a car aren’t happening in a vacuum: They’re taking place after years of rising prices at the supermarket and across the economy. And two years ago, many  student loan payments  that were paused during the pandemic became due again. A year ago, delinquent student loan payments started counting against credit scores again, pushing some borrowers into lower credit ratings that could raise the rates they were charged on other loans, including car loans.\n \n\n   \n  Elevated subprime delinquency rates demonstrate how beneath the surface of blockbuster stock market returns and strong overall economic growth, many consumers are hurting.\n \n\n   \n  Tellingly, Americans with stronger credit scores don’t appear to be struggling to make car payments. The delinquency rate among prime borrowers has increased significantly but remains very low at less than 0.5%.\n \n\n   \n  “There are no alarm bells going off for prime borrowers,” said Rod Chadehumbe, chief asset backed securities strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  The wide gap between delinquency rates of prime and subprime borrowers is another reminder of the so called K-shaped economy: Many Americans who have money in the stock market and own increasingly valuable homes are doing well and spending aggressively, but many others, especially lower-income consumers, are struggling to stay afloat.\n \n\n   \n  A number of lenders who specialize in subprime car loans expect a growing percentage of their clients to default and have their car repossessed, said Pamela Foohey, a law professor at the University of Georgia and an expert in both auto finance and bankruptcies.\n \n\n   \n  The repo business has been quite active lately. Subprime lenders build GPS features into cars to make it easier for teams repossessing the vehicles to find them, she said. The lenders can even disable the ignition of the cars to prevent owners from driving them once they’ve defaulted on the loan.\n \n\n   \n  “The (repo) numbers indicate it’s probably close to the Great Recession in volume,” said George Badeen, who runs Midwest Recovery and Adjustment in Detroit, and is also president of one of his industry’s trade groups. “It’s a target-rich environment at the moment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/economy/weight-loss-drugs-kff-employer-survey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:10:00-04:00","title":"More and more workers are using weight loss drugs.

It’s costing their employers a fortune \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:10 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weight loss drugs are proving to be super popular among many workers with job-based health insurance. But GLP-1 medications are busting their employers’ budgets, leading some firms to rethink their coverage.\n \n\n   \n  The share of very large firms covering these drugs for obesity soared to 43% this year, up from 28% last year, according to KFF’s latest annual  Employer Health Benefits Survey , which was released on Wednesday. These employers, who have more than 5,000 workers, are much more likely than their smaller counterparts to offer such a benefit.\n \n\n   \n  Among firms with between 200 and 999 staffers, only 16% provide coverage of drugs for weight loss this year, the same as last year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 drugs, which treat diabetes, obesity and certain other conditions, have been in great demand since they came on the market a few years ago because they help patients shed pounds. While employers typically cover the medications for diabetes, fewer of them do so for weight loss, in part because of the drugs’ high prices — which have also  limited Americans’ access  to them. The list price of Wegovy, for instance, is about $1,350 for a month’s supply, though discounts are available.\n \n\n   \n  Employers, however, recognize that covering the medications for weight loss is a valuable benefit to attract and retain talented staffers. Notably, even among firms that don’t do so, nearly half said the benefit is “very important” or “important” for employee satisfaction. More than 36 million people with job-based insurance have a body mass index that would medically qualify them for a GLP-1 drug.\n \n\n   \n  “Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” Gary Claxton, KFF senior vice president, said in a statement. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”\n \n\n   \n  Costs are higher than forecast because more workers are taking advantage of the benefit, KFF found. Nearly 60% of large firms said usage of the medications for weight loss is higher than they predicted, while two-thirds of such employers said the impact on their prescription drug spending was “significant.”\n \n\n   \n  One employer KFF surveyed found that it spent more on GLP-1 medications than any other drug this year, up from 32 nd  place last year.\n \n\n   \n  A large retailer told KFF, “Before we knew it, we spent half a million dollars and we’re projected to go up to $1.2 million the following year.”\n \n\n   \n  The high costs of GLP-1 drugs have long been a source of frustration for many Americans. President Donald Trump set off a kerfuffle last week when he said that the  medications  would soon be available for $150, prompting Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, to step in and say negotiations are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  Many employers told KFF they were looking at reducing coverage of the drugs through steps such as limiting eligibility to those with higher body mass indexes or requiring workers to participate in weight management programs.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to have a coach, and then you can only stay on it for a certain amount of time before you have to get reevaluated,” one large manufacturer told KFF.\n \n\n   \n  Other firms told KFF they have decided to drop the benefit for weight loss.\n \n\n   \n  However, employers will likely have to reconsider their coverage again in coming years, especially as more workers demand coverage, and the drugs are approved for even more medical conditions. Plus, prices coming down.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still writing the story of what GLP-1 coverage looks like in employer plans,” said Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF.\n \n\n   \n    Rising premiums\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 drug costs – and prescription drug prices in general – are also contributing to a rise in premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Annual insurance coverage for a family hit $27,000, on average, this year, up 6% from 2024, according to KFF’s survey. Workers contribute $6,850 toward the cost, on average, while employers pick up the rest of the tab.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, individual coverage topped $9,300, on average, this year, up 5% – with employees shouldering $1,440 of the cost and employers paying the rest.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past five years, the growth in premiums has been largely in line with inflation and wage increases.\n \n\n   \n  But  coverage for 2026  could be much pricier, according to several benefits consulting firms. KFF also points to GLP-1 medications, hospital prices and tariffs as factors that could push up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers next year.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a quiet alarm bell going off,” Drew Altman, KFF’s CEO, said in a statement. “Employers have nothing new in their arsenal that can address most of the drivers of their cost increases, and that could well result in an increase in deductibles and other forms of employee cost sharing again, a strategy that neither employers nor employees like but companies resort to in a pinch to hold down premium increases.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/football-nfl-russell-wilson-sean-payton-criticism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:41:00-04:00","title":"Russell Wilson labels former coach Sean Payton ‘classless’ after post-game comments","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the Denver Broncos' 33-32 victory over the New York Giants, former head coach Sean Payton praised rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, suggesting the team's change in starting quarterback was effective.

They came up to me at the beginning of the bye week – Monday or Tuesday – and told me that if I didn’t change my contract, my injury guarantee, that I’d be benched for the rest of the year … I was definitely disappointed about it,” said Wilson.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t going to take away injury guarantees,” he said. “This game is such a physical game.

Trouble is on the horizon \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tesla is set to report its best quarterly earnings so far this year. What lies ahead is the problem.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts forecast that the company on Wednesday   will report adjusted earnings of about $1.9 billion, driven by  record sales  of nearly 500,000 cars during the quarter. But that falls short of the $2.5 billion Tesla earned a year ago, a sign of the headwinds the company faces.\n \n\n   \n  The company’s third quarter sales surged as Americans rushed to buy electric cars before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired on October 1. But American electric vehicle sales   are widely expected to plunge in the fourth quarter because people who would have normally bought later in the year purchased early to lock in the tax break.\n \n\n   \n  That credit loss could also affect EV demand among American buyers going forward. Tesla gets nearly half of its revenue from US customers.\n \n\n   \n    The loss of a key source of income\n \n\n   \n  But the removal of the EV tax credit is only part of Tesla’s problem. The Trump administration also eliminated what has been a key profit driver throughout the company’s history – the  sale of regulatory credits .\n \n\n   \n  In years past, the federal government set emissions limits on the total greenhouse gases that came out of all the cars a company sold in a given year. If a car company sold too many gas-guzzling pickups, as opposed to economical hatchbacks or cars with no emissions at all, it would have to buy “credits” from companies like Tesla.\n \n\n   \n  Those sales have brought in $11 billion for Tesla since 2019, including $439 million in the second quarter of that year alone.   Sometimes   credit sales were   the only thing keeping the company profitable at all – including in the first three months of this year.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration’s massive tax and spending bill passed by Congress in July eliminated the federal penalties for violating emissions rules, and thus the need for automakers to buy regulatory credits.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, investors will be watching how much the company’s regulatory credit sales fell in the latest quarter as well as any guidance for how it will handle a future without them.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla is also facing increased competition for EV sales globally, particularly from Chinese automakers. Those automakers not only dominate their own domestic market, but are also moving into Europe. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to overtake Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs this year, despite the fact that it does not sell any of its cars in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla sales worldwide fell 13% during the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier both due to that increased competition as well as backlash to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s political activity.\n \n\n   \n  But Musk has said the future of the company’s success doesn’t ride on car sales but on self-driving technology and robotics.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla launched the company’s long-promised  robotaxi  offering with limited service in late June, with Musk promising much grander things to come. Investors and analysts will be listening closely to what he says about the state of those expansion plans during Wednesday’s earnings call.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s call will also be Musk’s first time talking to investors since the company unveiled a new proposed pay package for the CEO, which could award him stock worth  $1 trillion . Shareholders are set to vote on that pay package at Tesla’s annual meeting next month.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/basketball-wnba-pay-adam-silver-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:43:00-04:00","title":"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Says WNBA Players Will Get 'Big' Pay Increase in New CBA","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has announced that WNBA players will receive a 'big increase' in pay under the new collective bargaining agreement, citing the league’s significant financial growth and the need for greater player compensation.

They have until the end of next year, and federal officials are giving those jurisdictions a total of $200 million to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The policy change is one of several to free up money for Trump’s priorities, such as increased border security and tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  For now, state officials, health policy researchers, and consumer advocates are watching the pilot program in Louisiana and another in Arizona.  Mehmet Oz , director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has touted those test-drives and said they will allow people to verify their incomes “within seven minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  “There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven’t been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now,” said Oz,  during a television appearance  in August.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Blase, the president of the conservative Paragon Health Institute and a key architect of Medicaid changes in the new law, has chimed in, saying during a  recent radio appearance  that with today’s artificial intelligence “people should be able to seamlessly enter how they are spending their time.”\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News found scant evidence to support such claims. Federal and state officials have offered little insight into what new technology the two pilots have tested. They do say, however, that it connects directly with the websites of Medicaid enrollees’ payroll providers, rather than using artificial intelligence to draw conclusions about their activities.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said the Trump administration’s efforts started “as soon as the bill was signed” in July. But work on the pilot programs  began under the Biden administration .\n \n\n   \n  And Medicaid is a state-federal program: The federal government contributes most of the funds, but it is up to the states to administer them, not the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “Oz can say, ‘Oh no, we’re going to fix this. We’re going to do this.’ Well, they don’t actually run the program,” said  Joan Alker , a health policy researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Children and Families.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have also offered few details about the pilots’ effectiveness in assisting enrollees in Medicaid or other public benefit programs.\n \n\n   \n  The shortage of information has some state officials and health policy researchers worried that the Trump administration lacks viable solutions to help states implement the work rules. As a result, they say, people with a legal right to Medicaid benefits could lose access to them.\n \n\n   \n  “What actually keeps me up at night is the fear that members that are eligible for Medicaid and are trying to get health care services would fall through the cracks and lose coverage,” said Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  Officials involved in the Louisiana and Arizona projects declined to answer many specific questions about their efforts, instead directing KFF Health News to federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for Arizona’s Medicaid and Economic Security departments — Johnny Córdoba and Brett Bezio, respectively — did not share data on how many people participated in the state’s pilot test nor describe the outcome. They said the pilot had been used to verify eligibility only for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a smaller program than Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  The  Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona , a nonprofit that helps people sign up for such SNAP benefits, hadn’t heard of the pilot program.\n \n\n   \n  State officials and health policy researchers said neither pilot program could confirm whether a person meets other qualifying activities — such as community service — or any of the numerous exemptions. The tools being tested can verify only income.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Oz’s agency, wrote in a statement that the digital tools officials aim to share with states “are largely under development.”\n \n\n   \n  One person  doing that development  is Michael Burstein, a software engineer who, until recently, worked at the U.S. Digital Service, which later became known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  As the U.S. Digital Service was turned into DOGE, Burstein and other staffers left and started a nonprofit called  Digital Public Works  to finish supporting the technology to make it easier for people to verify their incomes for Medicaid enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  But without permission from state officials, Burstein would not describe the tool in development, aside from saying that it’s mobile-first, can quickly verify income for a new or returning client, “and we’re pretty happy with it.”\n \n\n   \n  The state agencies that manage benefit programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP, are understaffed, and they use different eligibility systems,  many of which need updating , which makes improving them “a challenging task,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The $200 million in start-up costs the federal government has earmarked for systems to track work requirements equals  roughly four times what it cost  to administer Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program alone.\n \n\n   \n  That state, which has the nation’s only active work requirement program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, in September was granted a  temporary extension , despite a  recent report  from a federal watchdog saying it hadn’t received enough federal oversight. A  complicated sign-up process  has kept enrollment in the program far below Georgia’s own projections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tax and spending law allows states to ask for extra time — until the end of 2028 — to start enforcing the rules, but only with the approval of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also allows counties with  high unemployment rates to be exempted , but states must apply for that exemption.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an app that states can use to prove people are eligible for Medicaid, enrollees would still need to know that app existed and how to use it — neither of which is a given, Alker said. There is also no guarantee they’d have reliable cell service or internet access. As  KFF Health News has reported , millions of Americans live in rural areas without reliable internet.\n \n\n   \n  Private vendors also have been working on such apps, said  Jennifer Wagner , who researches Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Wagner said she has seen several vendors demonstrate products they plan to pitch to states for the work rules. Many are limited in scope, she said, like those in the pilot tests.\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody has a magical solution that’ll make sure eligible people don’t lose coverage,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/basketball-nba-okc-rockets-warriors-lakers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"NBA Opening Night: OKC wins double-OT thriller against Rockets as they receive championship rings, Warriors topple Lakers","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 NBA season opened with two high-energy games: the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrated their 2024 championship by receiving rings and raising a banner, then defeated the Houston Rockets 125-124 in a dramatic double-overtime game, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leading the charge and hitting game-winning free throws after Durant's missed opportunities.

against Rockets as they receive championship rings, Warriors topple Lakers \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  NBA  is back for another intriguing season and it began in emphatic fashion on Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  On an evening which began with the celebration of the  Oklahoma City Thunder ’s title victory – with players receiving their championship rings and a banner being raised to the rafters of Paycom Center – fans were treated to two exciting games.\n \n\n   \n  First, the Thunder played a double-overtime thriller against the new-look  Houston Rockets , holding on to win 125-124 in an instant classic. And in California, the LeBron James-less Los Angeles Lakers lost their home opener 119-109 to the Golden State Warriors.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s everything you need to know about the two opening games of the 2025 NBA season.\n \n\n   \n    Thunder celebrate title victory, win double-OT classic\n \n\n   \n  Last season’s title victory was the culmination of years of hard work for the Thunder, whether it be through some savvy drafting or creative trades to acquire key pieces.\n \n\n   \n  Those moves all paid off in the form of a dominant regular season and a playoffs which saw Oklahoma City race past most of its opponents, eventually beating the Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals in seven games to secure the franchise’s first title since moving from Seattle in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  Before Tuesday’s home opener, the victorious Thunder players from last year were serenaded by their fans while receiving their championship rings from Thunder chairman Clay Bennett.\n \n\n   \n  Last season’s  NBA Most Valuable Player , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, was the last to get his ring, with fans chanting “M-V-P!” as he made his way onto the court.\n \n\n   \n  The players then posed for pictures with their new rings – designed by Jostens and which are set in 14-karat gold with more than 800 custom-cut, hand-set gemstones – while the championship banner was raised.\n \n\n   \n  “Seeing the banner up there was cool, knowing it’ll be up there forever,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after Tuesday’s game. “Special night.”\n \n\n   \n  After the celebrations were wrapped up, it was time to begin the defense of their crown. First up was the Rockets who, during the offseason, had asserted their own title aspirations by trading for former Thunder star Kevin Durant from the Phoenix Suns.\n \n\n   \n  Durant, 37,  reportedly signed  a two-year extension worth $90 million with the team on Sunday and the move to acquire the 15-time NBA All-Star hints that the franchise is all-in this season.\n \n\n   \n  The game at Paycom Center was a tight affair, with very little to separate the two teams. With 9.5 seconds of regulation time remaining and with the Rockets leading 103-102, Durant had two free throw attempts to potentially put his new team up by three. However, he missed the first and drained the second to give Houston a two-point lead, only for Gilgeous-Alexander to go up the other end and level the score to send it to OT.\n \n\n   \n  Durant almost had another disastrous moment at the end of the first overtime when, with 1.3 seconds left, he caught the ball and signaled for a timeout even though the Rockets didn’t have any left. This usually comes with a one-shot technical free throw for the opposing team but the  officials admitted afterwards  that they missed Durant’s signal and, with the score tied again, the game went to a second overtime.\n \n\n   \n  Ending an action-packed return to OKC for Durant, he played a part in the Thunder eventually securing the victory.\n \n\n   \n  With the Rockets up one, Durant fouled Gilgeous-Alexander with two seconds left, picking up his sixth personal foul and exiting the game. The reigning MVP then hit the two game-winning free throws.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, the new Houston star took responsibility for the defeat.\n \n\n   \n  “I missed the free throws, and I fouled somebody at the end,” Durant, who scored 23 points in 47 minutes, told reporters,  per ESPN . “I think those two plays are the reason we lost.”\n \n\n   \n  Alperen Şengün led the way for the Rockets with 39 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists, two steals and a block while the Thunder were powered by Gilgeous-Alexander’s 35 points and 28 from Chet Holmgren.\n \n\n   \n    Warriors topple Lakers missing LeBron James\n \n\n   \n  In Tuesday’s late game, it was an all-California match-up as the Warriors traveled to the City of Angels to face the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  LA played without superstar LeBron James, who watched from the bench having been  ruled out with sciatica  – an injury which is expected to sideline him until November. It was the first season opener James has missed in his 23 years in the NBA.\n \n\n   \n  In James’ absence, the Lakers were led by  Luka Dončić  who had a ridiculous game with 43 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and a block. Dončić was traded to LA midway through last season in a  blockbuster move .\n \n\n   \n  But it wasn’t enough as 31 points from Jimmy Butler and 23 from Steph Curry lifted the Warriors to a 119-109 victory.\n \n\n   \n  The two teams were evenly matched at 55-54 at halftime at Crypto.com Arena, but a 19-4 run to open the second half by Golden State led to a 17-point lead.\n \n\n   \n  Austin Reaves – who finished with 26 points and nine assists – did lead a fourth-quarter rally for LA, cutting the Warriors advantage to just six points, but that was as close as the Lakers got with Golden State able to hold on and clinch an impressive road victory.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Dončić said there was no reason to panic for the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there was a lot of positive things tonight, and obviously a lot of things we’ve got to work on,” the Slovenian told reporters. “But my confidence is fine.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/simplified-investment-strategy-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00-04:00","title":"The benefits of keeping your investing life simple","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article, written by Jeanne Sahadi for CNN, promotes the KISS (Keep It Simple and Smart) investing strategy as a way to reduce decision fatigue and simplify portfolio management.

And, instead, to feel confident you can do well enough for  your individual goals  by sticking with a few low-cost funds over time that track overall market performance.\n \n\n   \n  Why? Because, it turns out, “It’s extremely difficult to beat the market,” said Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, data from Morningstar suggest most actively managed funds don’t.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers compared their performance after fees to a composite of passively managed index funds and exchange-traded funds.\n \n\n   \n  “Just 21% of active strategies survived and beat their passive counterparts over the 10 years through June 2025,” they wrote in a  mid-year report  about Morningstar’s Active/Passive Barometer.\n \n\n   \n  As just one example of how actively managed funds may disappoint, Morningstar found that over 20 years, only 7.1% of large cap blend funds – which invest in both growth and value stocks and might compare their performance to the S&P 500 – performed better than index funds in the same category.\n \n\n   \n    Picking the right fund(s) for you\n \n\n   \n  If the bulk of your money is in a workplace retirement plan like a 401(k), chances are you will have the option to invest in a  target-date retirement fund .\n \n\n   \n  Such a fund allocates your money across other stock and bond funds – often index funds – to achieve an allocation that best suits your time horizon to retirement. So for someone who’s 40 they might be in a 2050 or 2055 target date fund.\n \n\n   \n  The fund’s allocation will grow more conservative (less in stocks, more in bonds) as you near your expected retirement year.\n \n\n   \n  “A target date fund can be a great option. It builds in portfolio diversification and an asset mix targeted to your age and retirement date,” Arnott said.\n \n\n   \n  If you don’t have a target date fund, or don’t like the one available in your plan, consider investing instead in three broad index funds and adjust how much you invest in each according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n \n\n   \n  “The average person probably will get better results with a target-date fund. But if you want a slightly more hands-on approach you could put together a basic portfolio of US and international stocks plus investment-grade bonds. Having exposure to those three asset classes is all you really need,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond retirement, for any investing you’re doing to meet intermediate-term goals with a five- to 10-year horizon, she suggests putting money into a high-quality intermediate-term bond index fund or a low-cost, actively managed one, since this is one arena in which actives have had a reasonably good track record against their benchmarks. Or you might also consider a low-cost, moderate-risk allocation fund of funds – which invests in both stocks and bonds.\n \n\n   \n    The psychological benefits\n \n\n   \n  Just as having fewer but better clothes in an organized closet can reduce your decision fatigue about what to wear, adopting a KISS strategy with just one or a few, low-cost funds can reduce the stress of managing your investments.\n \n\n   \n  With a simple, streamlined portfolio, you’ll know what you’re invested in.\n \n\n   \n  It will be easier to review – which you should do once a year to make sure the way your money is allocated still reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n \n\n   \n  And your portfolio will be easier to explain to a spouse or adult child, who may help you manage it if you become unable to do so alone, or who will eventually inherit it.\n \n\n   \n  “As I’ve gotten older and my financial situation has gotten more complicated, I’ve come to appreciate the value of simplicity more,” Arnott said. “There’s a lot of value in having a portfolio that is easier for someone to take over when you’re gone. Or if you’re an  older adult with a cognitive impairment .”\n \n\n   \n  And, perhaps most importantly, having a simpler portfolio may make it easier to assess whether you  need to save  more now. Because no matter how well your investments do, if you aren’t saving sufficiently, the best returns in the world won’t get you where you need to go.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/breast-cancer-invasive-lobular-carcinoma-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:25:00-04:00","title":"What to know about a rapidly rising form of breast cancer that’s hard to detect","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in the journal Cancer, analyzing data from 2012 to 2021, reveals that invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)—the second most common type of breast cancer—has increased in the U.S. at more than three times the rate of all other breast cancers combined, with a 2.8% annual rise.

rapidly rising form of breast cancer that’s hard to detect \n       \n  By Faye Chiu, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:25 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Rates of one type of  breast cancer  — invasive lobular carcinoma — have been rising in the United States more than three times faster than those of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade, according to a new study.\n \n\n   \n  This elusive breast cancer that’s hard to spot in routine mammograms is behind more than 1 in 10 cases nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  The research, published in  Cancer ,  the journal of the American Cancer Society, analyzed national data from 2012 to 2021 and found that rates of invasive lobular carcinoma increased by about 2.8% each year, while rates of all other breast cancer rose by about 0.8% a year.\n \n\n   \n  What exactly is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? How is it diagnosed, and why can it be more difficult to find during screenings? Who is most at risk? What are the treatment options? And what should women know about reducing their risk of developing this and other types of breast cancer?\n \n\n   \n  To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? \n \n\n   \n   Dr. Leana Wen:  Invasive lobular carcinoma, also known as ILC or lobular breast cancer, is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast, called lobules, and then spreads into nearby tissue. These malignant tumors are often hormone receptor-positive, meaning the cancer cells grow in response to estrogen or progesterone.\n \n\n   \n  ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, after invasive ductal carcinoma, and accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses, according to the  National Cancer Institute . About 47,500 ILC cases are diagnosed in the US each year, and more women are diagnosed with it than with brain, kidney, liver, pancreatic or ovarian cancer.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Why is ILC often more difficult to find with routine mammograms? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  This type of tumor tends to grow in a way that doesn’t change the breast’s structure as much as other cancers. Instead of forming a defined mass, the cancer cells spread through the tissue in thin strands that appear more like normal breast tissue on imaging. Because of this, mammograms may show only subtle changes, or sometimes none at all. Women may also be less likely to feel a distinct lump during a breast self-exam, which can delay detection.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What other imaging is used to diagnose ILC? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  A breast ultrasound can help spot areas of thickened tissue that don’t show up on a mammogram, and a breast MRI provides a more detailed view that can reveal cancers hidden in dense breast tissue.\n \n\n   \n  These tests aren’t routinely recommended for everyone. Mammography remains the standard screening tool for most women. But those at higher risk, including women with dense breasts and those with a strong family history of breast cancer or known genetic mutations, may be advised to have an ultrasound or MRI in addition to regular mammograms.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What does this study show in terms of the rise of cases and who is most at risk? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Researchers found that ILC has been increasing across every racial and ethnic group, but the steepest rise was seen among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, whose incidence grew by about 4.4% each year in the study period. Age is also a risk factor, as women 65 and older are more likely to be diagnosed with ILC than with invasive ductal carcinoma. About 70% of new ILC cases were diagnosed in women 60 and older; the median age of diagnosis is 66.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How do the study authors explain the rise especially in this type of breast cancer? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Several factors may be driving this greater increase. Because ILC is strongly linked to hormones, changes in hormone exposure over time could be part of the reason. Rising rates of obesity and alcohol use, along with changes in childbearing and menopause patterns, may also contribute to the steady increase.\n \n\n   \n  Improvement in diagnosis and greater awareness of ILC may be leading to more accurate identification. Some lobular cancers may have been misclassified as ductal cancers in the past, so part of the rise may reflect better recognition. In addition, more women are living longer after menopause, which can increase the likelihood of developing ILC compared with other types of breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What are the treatment options for ILC? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Treatment is similar to that for  other breast cancers . Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation, is common, as is hormonal therapy, since most tumors grow in response to estrogen or progesterone. Chemotherapy may be used in some cases. For advanced disease, newer targeted drugs combined with hormonal therapy can help slow progression and improve outcomes. However, ILC may have greater resistance to treatment, especially in more advanced disease, and tends to carry a poorer prognosis once it has spread.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How can women reduce their risk of developing ILC and other types of breast cancer? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Some risk factors can’t be changed, such as age or family history, but many  lifestyle choices  can make a difference. Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active all help lower the risk of breast cancer. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains supports overall health and may reduce inflammation linked to cancer.\n \n\n   \n  Regular screening and knowing what’s normal for your breasts are key for early detection. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors and decide together when you should begin screening and whether you need tests in addition to a mammogram.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, pay attention to changes in your breasts, such as thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, different colors or new areas of fullness, and seek medical evaluation as soon as something looks or feels different.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/europe/louvre-heist-jewels-recovery-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"04:27:00Z","title":"Stolen Louvre Jewelry Estimated to Be Worth $102 Million, Prosecutor Says, as Search Continues","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A high-profile robbery occurred at the Louvre Museum in Paris on a Sunday morning when armed thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to break into the Apollo Gallery, targeting two high-security display cases.

to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million), according to a French prosecutor, as the search continues for the stolen treasures.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told French radio station RTL the value of the loot taken in Sunday’s daylight robbery had been estimated by the museum’s curator.\n \n\n   \n  “This sum is indeed spectacular, but we must remember that this damage is economic. But it has nothing parallel or comparable to the historical damage caused by this theft,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 100 investigators are involved in the manhunt to track down the criminals who made off with artifacts from the French crown jewels, dating from the Napoleonic era, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Experts fear that the prospects of recovering the jewelry are slim. But Beccuau warned that the thieves may struggle to obtain the loot’s value if they chose to dismantle the pieces to resell the jewels or melt down the metals.\n \n\n   \n  The Louvre remained closed on Tuesday, in accordance with its scheduled opening times, but is due to reopen on Wednesday. The Apollo Gallery targeted by the thieves will remain closed.\n \n\n   \n    How did the heist happen?\n \n\n   \n  The thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the Louvre, through a window.\n \n\n   \n  Armed with tools including an angle grinder and a blowtorch, they targeted two high-security display cases.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutors say it took the robbers four minutes to break into the gallery, snatch the jewelry, and leave.\n \n\n   \n  “At 9:34 a.m., half an hour after opening, two men wearing yellow vests broke a window,” the prosecutor’s office said in a Monday statement. The robbers “left at 9:38 a.m,” and left on two scooters “along the banks of the Seine.”\n \n\n   \n  The entire operation lasted just seven minutes, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n    What was stolen?\n \n\n   \n  Among the items taken from the Louvre was a diamond and sapphire jewelry set including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The diadem – a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty – features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Also stolen was an emerald necklace and earrings set that was a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, containing 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.\n \n\n   \n  Eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for.\n \n\n   \n    Wider implications for France\n \n\n   \n  French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that the Louvre heist exposed security failings at the museum.\n \n\n   \n  “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn’t been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “What is certain is that we have failed.”\n \n\n   \n  “The French people all feel like they’ve been robbed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Elaine Sciolino, author of “Adventures in the Louvre: How to Fall in Love with the World’s Greatest Museum,” emphasized the significance of a robbery at the Louvre, which was originally built as a fortress before becoming a palace for the French royal family.\n \n\n   \n  “This attack really is a dagger into the heart of France and French history,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    How is the investigation going?\n \n\n   \n  Investigators do not have any solid leads as to who was behind the heist but are slowly amassing a body of evidence, a law enforcement official in France who has been briefed on the ongoing investigation told CNN on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves were not able to burn the truck they used for the break in, so investigators are combing it for any traces of DNA, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of this process, investigators have had to build a tent around the truck so they can fume it to bring forth fingerprints, which has slowed down the process slightly, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, investigators recovered one of the two scooters the thieves used to get away, according to the official. They have also retrieved a helmet believed to have been worn by one of the thieves, the official added.\n \n\n   \n    Will the jewelry be recovered?\n \n\n   \n  Natalie Goulet, a Centrist member of the French senate, told CNN on Monday that she believes the jewelry has probably already been taken out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the pieces are already abroad,” she said. “I think it’s lost forever.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet also appeared on BBC Radio about the prospects of recovering the jewelry, replying: “None.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jewelry will be cut up and sold and used as a money-laundering system,” she said. “It’s the easiest way to clean dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  The robbery was probably linked to organized crime, Goulet said.\n \n\n   \n  “They have absolutely no morals,” she said. “They don’t appreciate the jewelry as a piece of history but the way to clean their dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet added that she was “very, very pessimistic” about the prospects of recovering the jewelry.\n \n\n   \n  Sciolino, the author, was similarly downbeat.\n \n\n   \n  “They can be dissembled, they can be cut, they can be sold on the black market,” she told BBC Radio. “It is unlikely that all of them are going to be recuperated in the shape that they are now.”\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Marinello, the founder of Art Recovery International, said that if the thieves are just looking to get cash out as quickly as possible, they might melt down the precious metals or recut the stones with no regard for the piece’s integrity.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we’re going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Past heists\n \n\n   \n  The most well-known robbery at the Louvre took place in August 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa was stolen off the museum’s walls by handyman Vincenzo Peruggia.\n \n\n   \n  It was 24 hours before anyone even noticed the Mona Lisa was missing, with artworks often removed to be photographed or cleaned.\n \n\n   \n  A bungling police investigation then dragged on for two years before the painting was recovered in December 1913, making it the most famous artwork in the world.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, a work by French painter Camille Corot was stolen from its frame in 1998 and has never been found.\n \n\n   \n  More recent heists at other European museums include the  theft of four ancient gold artifacts  from a museum in the Netherlands in January.\n \n\n   \n  Robbers used explosives to break into the Drents Museum in Assen, making off with three gold bracelets dating from around 50 BC, as well as the 5th-century BC gold Helmet of Cotofenesti, a historically important artifact on loan from the National History Museum of Romania in Bucharest.\n \n\n   \n   Correction:   This story has been updated to reflect that there was a theft from the Louvre in 1998. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/world/canada-election-carney-quebec-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:41:00.000Z","title":"A blunder meant this voter’s ballot wasn’t counted – then her pick lost by one vote.

The Bloc Québécois have 22 seats.\n \n\n   \n  Carney won the election in a  stunning comeback  for his party,  abetted by US President Donald Trump’s threats  to enact sweeping tariffs on Canada and annex the country as the 51st US state.\n \n\n   \n  But Bloc Québécois incumbent Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné challenged the result, after a voter came forward to say her mail-in ballot, which she had cast for her, had not been counted.\n \n\n   \n  Terrebonne resident Emmanuelle Bossé  told public broadcaster CBC Radio-Canada  in May her ballot was returned to sender because of an incorrect postal code on the return envelope provided by the national elections commission.\n \n\n   \n  According to statements filed in the case at the province’s top court, an Elections Canada employee discovered he had mistakenly printed his own postal code on dozens of ballots in the lead-up to election day, according to the Canadian Press news agency.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t the one who got Elections Canada’s address wrong on the envelope,” Bossé told Radio-Canada. “Elections Canada glued this label on the envelope.”\n \n\n   \n  Bossé said she was upset her vote hadn’t been counted, especially given how close the race was.\n \n\n   \n  “I voted for the Bloc,” Bossé told Radio-Canada. “So it was maybe the vote that could have changed something.”\n \n\n   \n  The election result was muddled from the start. Auguste was initially projected to win the seat by just 35 votes. But following a standard validation process, Terrebonne went to Sinclair-Desgagné by 44 votes.\n \n\n   \n  The tight race triggered a judicial recount – required by law for any race won by a margin of less than 0.1%. Following the recount, Auguste was renamed the winner on May 10 with a total of 23,352 votes – just one more than Sinclair-Desgagné.\n \n\n   \n  In Quebec’s Superior Court this week, lawyers for both candidates put forward competing arguments over whether the result should be upheld, or if a new election should be called.\n \n\n   \n  Sinclair-Desgagné’s lawyer Stéphane Chatigny told the court Monday that solidifying the election result would “send a disastrous message to voters” and “undermine public confidence,” according to Canadian Press.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Auguste’s lawyer Marc-Étienne Vien said cancelling the result would “deny the right to vote” of the tens of thousands of Terrebonne residents that cast their ballots in April.\n \n\n   \n  David Baum, lawyer for Elections Canada, told the court elections are “not designed to achieve perfection,” according to the Canadian Press.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a big, complex machine, and errors are inevitable,” Baum said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump-visit-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:44:00-04:00","title":"North Korea test-fires ballistic missiles ahead of Trump’s Asia trip","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korea conducted its first ballistic missile test in five months on October 22, 2025, launching short-range missiles from near Pyongyang that flew about 350 kilometers toward the northeast and did not land in the sea.

Korea.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s military said it detected multiple short-range ballistic missiles that were launched from an area south of Pyongyang and flew about 350 kilometers (220 miles) toward the northeast. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t release more specific flight details but said the missiles didn’t land in the sea.\n \n\n   \n  The Joint Chiefs added that the South’s military remains ready to repel any provocations by North Korea based on its solid military alliance with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s new Prime Minister  Sanae Takaichi  told reporters that Tokyo was closely communicating with Washington and Seoul, including by sharing real-time missile warning data. North Korea didn’t immediately comment on the launches.\n \n\n   \n   Trump is to leave for Asia  at the end of the week in the first trip to the region of his second term. He plans to go to Malaysia first for a regional summit, and then head to Japan before travelling on to South Korea for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, an annual summit meant to promote economic integration and trade.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was expected to visit the South Korean city of Gyeongju ahead of the summit for bilateral meetings with leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, but South Korean officials say Trump won’t likely attend APEC’s main conference set for Oct. 30-Nov. 1.\n \n\n   \n  Experts earlier said North Korea could conduct provocative missile tests before or during the APEC summit to underscore its commitment to gain recognition as a nuclear weapons state. Experts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would need that status to call for the U.N. to lift the economic sanctions punishing it for its weapons program.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s ballistic missile launches by North Korea were the first of their kind since the country on May 8 tested short-range systems that simulated nuclear counterstrikes against US and South Korean forces. They were also North Korea’s first ballistic missile testing activities since Lee took office in June with a promise to push to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  Kim has been sharply accelerating the pace of weapons tests since his high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over the US-led economic sanctions. But last month, Kim suggested he could return to talks if the US drops its demand for North Korea’s denuclearization, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Kim displayed  a new intercontinental ballistic missile  at a military parade attended by Chinese, Russian and other top officials. The parade highlighted Kim’s growing diplomatic footing and his relentless drive to build a reliable arsenal of nuclear missiles targeting the US and its allies.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s state media said the Oct. 10 parade featured the Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, which it described as the country’s “most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system.” Observers said the new ICBM is designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to defeat US missile defenses and that North Korea could test-launch it in coming months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/football-nfl-week-7-takeaways-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"04:51:00-04:51","title":"NFL Week 7 Takeaways: Second-Year QBs Ascending, Colts on Historic Pace, Chiefs Back to Form","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season showcased a wave of breakout performances from second-year quarterbacks, with Caleb Williams and Drake Maye emerging as stars under new coaching staffs.

on historic pace, is Chiefs offense back to its best? NFL Week 7 takeaways \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:51 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Outside of arguably the wildest ending to a regular season game in recent NFL history,  Week 7  had plenty of other talking points.\n \n\n   \n  Whether it be the Philadelphia Eagles finally getting their offense back on track or the never-ending struggles of the New York Jets, the unusually parity-filled season in the NFL continues to produce storylines.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the three main takeaways from Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season.\n \n\n   \n    Second-year QBs ascending to stardom\n \n\n   \n  Last season saw 2024 No. 2 overall pick  Jayden Daniels  explode as a rookie sensation with the Washington Commanders.\n \n\n   \n  This year though, the two passers picked either side of Daniels in last year’s draft – No. 1 pick Caleb Williams and No. 3 pick Drake Maye – are having their time in the spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  After losing the first two games of the  season , Williams and the Chicago Bears have won their last four games under first-year head coach Ben Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  Although Sunday’s 26-14 win over the New Orleans Saints wasn’t a vintage Williams performance – he threw 15-of-26 for 172 passing yards with no touchdowns, one interception and two fumbles – his overall confidence level appears to have improved in Johnson’s offensive system.\n \n\n   \n  The 23-year-old came into the league as the consensus top pick in last year’s draft but struggled as a rookie, in a season which saw the Bears fire their head coach Matt Eberflus following a  disastrous Thanksgiving Day loss .\n \n\n   \n  After a game where everything wasn’t smooth sailing – Chicago had plenty of pre-snap penalties and Williams’ two fumbles came on botched snaps with the center – the young quarterback says these experiences are important if the team are going to continue improving.\n \n\n   \n  “Days like today are needed, just in the sense of it gives you a little bit more to be able to look back on something and figure out what’s important,” Williams told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “You have these moments, and then you get later in the season and you may start to have one of these moments, and you get to go back to the feeling, go back to what was wrong and what you needed to figure out early in the season. So it’s like: ‘Okay, I remember what it was, I remember how I can fix it.’”\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Maye is also thriving in New England under a new head coach with the experienced Mike Vrabel now at the helm and long-time playcaller for Tom Brady, Josh McDaniels, installed as offensive coordinator.\n \n\n   \n  Maye and the Patriots are also riding their own four-game winning streak following a 31-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Maye was almost perfect in the win, throwing 21-of-23 for 222 yards and two touchdowns, while also running for 62 yards on eight carries.\n \n\n   \n  As the Pats look for the quarterback to fill the sizable void left by the legendary Brady, Maye’s outing on Sunday hinted he might be just that man; his 91.3% completion rate broke Brady’s single-game franchise record of 88.5%, which he set against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  It’s rare you have three potential star quarterbacks in the same draft but Williams and Maye are showing that together with Daniels, they could make the 2024 class one for the ages.\n \n\n   \n    Colts duo on historic pace\n \n\n   \n  No one could’ve predicted how well this Indianapolis Colts season is going.\n \n\n   \n  Quarterback Daniel Jones was coming off being cut by the New York Giants and spending time as a reserve QB for the Minnesota Vikings. Jones won the starting job after an offseason battle with 2024 fourth overall pick Anthony Richardson but expectations were not high.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Colts have been everything and more through seven weeks of the 2025 campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Their 38-24 win over the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday saw them hold onto their spot atop the AFC and improve their record to 6-1.\n \n\n   \n  Indy’s proficient offense, led by Jones and running back Jonathan Taylor, has scored 232 points, averaging a league-best 33.1 per game. The 232-point tally is the most scored by a Colts team through seven games since 1964,  per the NFL .\n \n\n   \n   According to NFL researcher John Todd , Jones is the first player to complete two-thirds of his passes and have 200-or-more pass yards in each of his first seven games of a season since at least 1950.\n \n\n   \n  Jones has undoubtedly been helped by Taylor’s excellence; on Sunday, he rushed for 94 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries. It is his third game this year with at least three rushing scores.\n \n\n   \n  In doing so, he became the  fourth player since 1950  to have at least three games of scoring three-plus rushing touchdowns within the first seven games of the season, joining Derrick Henry, Priest Holmes and Jim Brown.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor  leads the NFL  in rushing yards (697) and rushing touchdowns (10) and is second in the league in rushing attempts (131). He led the league in all three categories in the 2021 season and, if he was to do so again this year, he’d be the first player since Brown to achieve the feat more than once.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s the best back in the league right now, there’s no doubt,” Colts head coach Shane Steichen said of Taylor. “He’s running hard, he’s running physical, he’s got great vision. Yeah, he’s just balling out man.”\n \n\n   \n  The Colts are the surprise playoff contenders, but if Jones and Taylor can keep performing at the highest level, who’s to say a deep postseason run couldn’t be on the cards?\n \n\n   \n    Is the Chiefs offense back to its best?\n \n\n   \n  When Patrick Mahomes exploded onto the scene with the Kansas City Chiefs, he had a revolutionary effect on how offenses operate in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  But as defenses have found ways to slow him down and some of the Kansas City QB’s key contributors have moved on or gotten older, the Chiefs offense has transitioned into more of a dink-and-dunk operation.\n \n\n   \n  That is until this year.\n \n\n   \n  After a slow opening two weeks, the explosive plays are back for Mahomes and the Chiefs, culminating in their 31-0 domination of the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas City has now scored over 30 points in its past four games – in contrast, they had scored 30 points or more six times over the past two seasons combined – and, following the return of receiver Rashee Rice from his  six-game suspension , boasts a plethora of offensive weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Rice was playing at an All-Pro level last year before suffering a torn ACL, second-year receiver Xavier Worthy is always improving and even tight end Travis Kelce is appearing more sprightly than last campaign.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Mahomes threw three touchdown passes – two to the returning Rice and one to Marquise Brown – while Isiah Pacheco ran for another. It was the 28th game of Mahomes’ career where he’s had at least three TD passes and no interceptions, surpassing Russell Wilson for the most such games by a quarterback in their first nine seasons in NFL history.\n \n\n   \n  It was also the 93 rd  regular season victory of his career, passing Peyton Manning for the most regular-season wins ever by a player under the age of 31.\n \n\n   \n  After Sunday’s dominant victory over the Raiders, head coach Andy Reid highlighted the impact of having Rice back on the field to help the offense.\n \n\n   \n  “He did a great job. I was a little cautious with him on how many plays and all that. I thought he came out and functioned at a high level for being gone for all this time,” Reid told reporters. “It’s crazy that he can come back and do what he did and do it at the level that he did it at.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll gradually build him up. We’ll get his reps up here a little bit as we go. You got to be careful with that when somebody’s been off for a while. I thought all of them together did some really good things. … There’s a lot of things happening there that are positive.”\n \n\n   \n  Even though the Chiefs’ 4-3 record is some way off the top of the AFC at the moment – the Colts lead the conference with a 6-1 record with the Patriots and Denver Broncos sitting at 5-2 – this revival in offensive production has put the rest of the league on notice.

government shutdown \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal workers are bearing the brunt of the government shutdown, with more than 1 million of them  going unpaid  while Democrats and Republicans in Congress argue over funding federal agencies for the current fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  But those lawmakers on Capitol Hill aren’t missing any paychecks during the impasse, which began October 1, with no end in sight. They continue to receive their salaries, as directed by the  Constitution  – although some have said they wouldn’t accept their pay or will donate the money.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically fall unevenly on those who work for the federal government. And this time, President Donald Trump is taking additional steps to shield — at least temporarily — certain employees and the  military  from the financial pain, even as he threatens that hundreds of thousands of other staffers may never receive the  back pay  guaranteed to them under a 2019 law that he signed.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Senate GOP leaders will put to a vote a bill that would  pay certain essential workers  during the shutdown, though Democrats don’t seem inclined to support the measure unless it applies to all federal staffers who aren’t being paid during the impasse. Some GOP lawmakers are also questioning the effort, saying it would remove one of the  main pressure points  that could help end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  With many federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, missing even one can be financially devastating. Scores of federal employees have written to CNN about the economic toll the shutdown is taking on them and their families, leaving them at risk of losing their homes or cars or making it difficult for them to feed and provide for their families.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who gets paid\n \n\n   \n  In addition to lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and federal judges will still receive their paychecks, thanks to the Constitution. So will political appointees who are confirmed by the Senate, along with certain other appointees.\n \n\n   \n  Also, roughly 830,000 federal workers are continuing to be paid during the impasse, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center review of shutdown contingency plans filed by agencies. That’s because their compensation doesn’t rely on annual appropriations from Congress. Instead, they are paid through other spending packages, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, through fees or through other resources.\n \n\n   \n  Only days before the roughly 2 million active-duty and reserve members of the military were set to  miss their first paychecks , the Trump administration announced it would use about $8 billion in Pentagon research and development funds to cover the October 15 payroll. But there isn’t enough money for the next distribution at the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Trump administration has  moved to pay  Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents, according to Kash Patel, the agency’s director. Plus, 70,000 law enforcement personnel in the  Department of Homeland Security , including in Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Secret Service and other divisions will receive their paychecks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  posted on X. \n \n\n   \n    Here’s who doesn’t get paid\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, while another roughly 670,000 have been furloughed, according to the latest estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center. However, agencies have made changes as the shutdown drags on. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service originally said it would use the Inflation Reduction Act to keep paying all of its roughly 74,300 employees but a week later decided to  furlough nearly half its workforce .\n \n\n   \n   Senate staffers  learned Friday that they will not receive their October 20 paychecks and won’t be paid for the remainder of the shutdown, while the judicial branch announced that it has run out of funding to sustain full operations. Essential staff will stay on the job, working without pay, while other court employees will be furloughed.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, federal workers typically received back pay when impasses ended, but Congress made it official in 2019. However, the White House budget office is considering a new interpretation of that law, arguing it doesn’t cover furloughed employees.\n \n\n   \n  Many  federal contractors , including those who handle security, clean offices and staff the cafes in federal buildings, are also laid off during shutdowns. But unlike federal workers, they have no guarantee of being made whole at the end of the impasse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/business/six-flags-travis-kelce-janus-partners-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:29:00-04:00","title":"Activist Investor Group Including Travis Kelce Aims to Revive Struggling Six Flags","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An activist investor group comprising Jana Partners, NFL player Travis Kelce, consumer executive Glenn Murphy, and technology executive Dave Habiger has acquired a 9% economic interest in Six Flags Entertainment and plans to engage with the company’s leadership to improve shareholder value and visitor experience.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:36 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has been given the green light to send the Oregon National Guard into Portland after a federal appeals court on Monday overturned a lower court’s order to bar the deployment – but there’s at least one more legal hurdle to clear before there will be boots on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “After considering the record at this preliminary stage, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority,” the 2-1  ruling  from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Monday said.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling, supported by two judges appointed by President Donald Trump, overturns a temporary restraining order issued by US District Judge Karin Immergut, who last week extended two orders blocking the mobilization of federal troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  It also marks a big win for the administration as it continues to battle other Democrat-led cities over troop deployment – efforts that local and state leaders say are a disproportionate response to protests against the administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what else we know:\n \n\n   \n    When will troops be deployed?\n \n\n   \n  The ruling overturns only one of two lower court decisions to block the deployment of the National Guard in Portland, and because a second decision is still in force, troops can’t immediately be mobilized.\n \n\n   \n  The second restraining order blocks the administration from mobilizing National Guard troops from anywhere in the US in Oregon. The administration argued in a Monday evening filing the second order should also be overruled given both lower court orders relied on the same legal reasoning.\n \n\n   \n  As the legal battle over Oregon continues, hundreds of National Guard troops are in a holding pattern far from home, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek said in a  news conference  Monday. “These citizen soldiers have been pulled away from their families and their jobs for weeks to carry out some kind of mission in Oregon.”\n \n\n   \n  If the second temporary restraining order is revoked, it is unclear when troops would be deployed or how many would be federalized, Kotek said, citing a lack of communication from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “We have approximately 200 Oregon National Guard members still at Camp Rilea in limbo, as well as California National Guard members at Camp Withycombe. No idea of the mission. No idea of the timeline,” Kotek said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A response Tuesday from the state of Oregon and others argued the court should not end or pause the second temporary restraining order.\n \n\n   \n  “Until there is an en banc vote, it would be legal error for this Court to construe the panel’s non-final decision as a ‘significant change in the law’ warranting dissolution of the Second TRO. Had Defendants appealed the Second TRO, the relief they now seek from this Court would already be before the Ninth Circuit,” the filing said.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, in their rush to file their Motion to Dissolve, Defendants have misconstrued the finality of the Ninth Circuit proceedings, failing to carry their burden for dissolution of the Second TRO,” it added.\n \n\n   \n    Will the state or city appeal?\n \n\n   \n  The sole dissenting vote on the three-judge appellate panel came from Judge Susan P. Graber, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.\n \n\n   \n  “Today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions,” Graber wrote in her dissent.\n \n\n   \n  Echoing Graber’s sentiments, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement, “Today’s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification.”\n \n\n   \n  Rayfield asked the 9th Circuit to “act swiftly” and throw out the majority’s ruling through an “en banc” review, in which a larger panel of 11 appellate judges would reconsider the case.   \n \n\n   \n  Separately, a 9th Circuit judge Monday afternoon asked the court to vote on whether the case should be reheard en banc. While such a request is not unusual, it’s more common for either plaintiffs or defendants to request such a rehearing.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the state and the Trump administration have until midnight on Wednesday to make their arguments.\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Portland against White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared  riot  and  arson  arrests in mid-summer. The scene was  largely calm  until Trump  declared  in late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials have characterized Oregon’s biggest city as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, which Kotek and other leaders in Oregon have  emphatically disputed . Kotek on Monday said in court that the situation in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Friday  to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, a group of senators, including those from Oregon, asked for an inquiry into recent deployments of National Guard troops across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The senators argued that deployments were dangerous, unconstitutional, and also “straining military readiness and resources,” according to the letter.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently request that you initiate an inquiry into the cumulative effects of these domestic deployments of U.S. active-duty troops and the National Guard—over the objections of state and local officials—on military readiness, resources, personnel, and our military as an institution,” the senators requested.\n \n\n   \n    What this means for other states\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s success in Oregon comes on the same day officials from Illinois and the city of Chicago asked the US Supreme Court to block the administration’s emergency request to keep National Guard troops in that state.\n \n\n   \n  The filing notes there is no rebellion or inability to execute federal law in Illinois, arguing the administration hasn’t met legal requirements to activate troops over the state’s dissent.\n \n\n   \n  “No protest activity in Illinois has rendered the President unable to execute federal law,” the filing says, describing protests at the ICE facility in Broadview, near Chicago, as “small,” manageable by local authorities and having “never hindered the continued operation of the ICE facility there.”\n \n\n   \n  The filing addresses constitutional concerns that the federal government is pressuring Illinois to either use its own National Guard to carry out the Trump administration’s priorities or let federal troops takeover, stating, “Such coercion is independently unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  The Monday filing comes after Trump on Friday  urged the Supreme Court  to allow him to deploy the National Guard in Chicago in an emergency appeal against a lower court order that blocked the deployment of troops in the city. That temporary restraining order is set to expire on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling, the administration argues, “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  Describing  those protesting  the administration in Chicago as “rioters” who are leading a “violent resistance,” the Trump administration  told the justices Tuesday  its decision to deploy the National Guard is unreviewable by courts or – at the very least – is entitled to great deference.\n \n\n   \n  “If the president’s determination is reviewable at all, such review must be extremely deferential,” the administration told the Supreme Court, pointing to recent decisions from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals that endorsed “the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles and Portland to address similar violent resistance to federal immigration enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  In Tennessee, a group of seven elected officials sued the governor and the state’s attorney general last week for allowing the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor (Bill) Lee’s deployment violates both the Tennessee Constitution and state statutes, which allow the Guard to be called up only in the event of a rebellion or invasion—and only when the General Assembly declares that public safety requires it,” the officials said in a  statement published  by the National Immigration Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  “No such conditions exist in Memphis today.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee’s office responded Monday to the lawsuit filed against him, saying the governor has the authority to deploy the state’s Guard troops under Tennessee law,  CNN affiliate WATN  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Federal troops were seen in Memphis for the first time on October 10,  the Associated Press reported , including soldiers accompanied by Memphis police officers patrolling at the Pyramid, a landmark in the city.\n \n\n   \n  And for the second time in a week, Trump said on Sunday he would send the National Guard to San Francisco, telling Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo that the city “went wrong, went woke.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to San Francisco and we’re going to make it great,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to Trump’s comments, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a  video address  that sending the National Guard would not help with the city’s ongoing efforts to combat drug dealing.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers – and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,” the mayor said.\n \n\n   \n  While welcoming stronger coordination with federal authorities, Laurie cited declines in violent crime rate reaching “levels not seen since the 1950s” and record low tent camps to show the city achieving safety “without compromising on our values or our laws.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody wants you here,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom also said in a  social media post  in response to Trump’s comments. “You will ruin one of America’s greatest cities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/americas/peru-lima-state-of-emergency-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:54:00-04:00","title":"Peru declares 30-day state of emergency in Lima to tackle rising crime","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Peru’s President Jose Jeri has declared a 30-day state of emergency in Lima and the neighboring province of Callao to combat rising crime, following protests that resulted in one death and over 100 injuries.

Zalmanovich and Tamir Adar’s remains had been identified and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had informed their families,   a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  Two coffins carrying the bodies of Zalmanovich and Adar crossed the border into Israel earlier on Tuesday and were taken to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine for formal identification and to investigate the causes of death.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has now returned 15 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages outlined in the US-proposed ceasefire agreement, which was signed on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  Zalmanovich was abducted alive from his house at Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel during the October 7 attacks and is thought to have been killed in captivity on November 17, 2023, at the age of 85.\n \n\n   \n  He was the oldest hostage taken by Hamas, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement, describing him as “a tough and modest man who demanded nothing for himself.” The kibbutz said he was one of the founders of the community.\n \n\n   \n  Tamir Adar, also from Kibbutz Nir Oz, died fighting to defend it against Hamas on October 7, 2023, and his body was taken to Gaza, the IDF said.

Israeli intelligence has assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has said “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies in Gaza. One of the bodies handed over by Hamas under the agreement last week did not belong to an Israeli hostage, according to the Israeli military.\n \n\n   \n  Initial assessments at the time suggested Hamas misidentified the body rather than intentionally sending the wrong one, an Israeli source said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Not going to happen overnight’\n \n\n   \n  The latest hostage release comes hours after US Vice President JD Vance touched down in Israel and the Trump administration moves to implement the next phase of its ceasefire plan.\n \n\n   \n  Over the weekend, Israel and Hamas  affirmed their commitment  to the ceasefire deal after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers, prompting waves of airstrikes.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas and the Israeli military have each accused the other of violations.\n \n\n   \n  Vance on Tuesday  downplayed concerns  about the fragility of the ceasefire  but declined to put a timeline on the return of all deceased hostages and Hamas’ complete disarmament.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a focus of everybody here to get those bodies back home to their families, so that they can have a proper burial. Now, that said, this is difficult. This is not going to happen overnight,” Vance said at a press conference in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The US vice president also said some of the deceased hostages are “buried under thousands of pounds of rubble.

Republicans are ridiculing ‘No Kings.’ A striking new poll shows Americans aren’t laughing \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:02 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republicans have spent many days trying to marginalize the massive anti-Trump “No Kings” rallies held across the country over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  They’ve argued the people involved were extremists and even  predicted they would be violent  (which turned out not to be true). They’ve claimed the protesters hate America. And they’ve argued that the “No Kings” message itself is nonsensical, given President Donald Trump is a democratically elected president who sometimes works with Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Sunday that the people were “not representative of this country.” He and his team have taken to mockingly posting memes and AI videos  with Trump donning a crown  — including one that the president shared in which he dumps brown waste on protesters.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson added Monday night on Fox News that the protesters’ messages were “completely the opposite of what America was founded upon.”\n \n\n   \n  New polling, though, reinforces how much the thrust of the “No Kings” message has resonated with much of the American public.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, a majority of Americans appear sympathetic to it, at least to some extent. And their ranks appear to be growing.\n \n\n   \n  The  survey from the Public Religion Research Institute  gave people two options. One was that Trump is a “potentially dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys democracy.” The other was that he’s a “strong leader who should be given the power he needs to restore America’s greatness.”\n \n\n   \n  Americans chose the “dictator” option by a strong margin, 56%-41%.\n \n\n   \n  And notably, that margin has nearly doubled since April, when Americans also sided with the “dictator” option but  by a smaller, 52%-44% margin .\n \n\n   \n  The same poll also showed a 54% majority sided with the view that Trump is waging an “assault on constitutional balances and the rule of law.” The alternative was that his overhaul of the federal government is “a long-overdue correction of disastrous policies” (43%).\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible to oversell poll numbers like this. Giving people binary choices can inflate numbers by making people choose one extreme or another. People who don’t like Trump but don’t think he’s a dictator might feel compelled to choose the “dictator” option to avoid endorsing a man they don’t like.\n \n\n   \n  But tellingly, the poll also asked people about the strength of their views. Fully 45% of Americans said they “strongly” agreed Trump was a dangerous dictator, and 43% strongly agreed that he’s waging an assault on checks and balances and the rule of law.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, nearly half of independents strongly agreed with those sentiments.\n \n\n   \n  These are, to put it mildly, not insignificant numbers. Say what you will about elements of the “No Kings” rallies; this polling suggests the thrust of the demonstrations hardly appears ridiculous to a majority of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And this is merely the latest indicator that huge numbers of Americans have such concerns.\n \n\n   \n    Clear majorities see him exceeding his powers\n \n\n   \n  Whether “dictator” or “king” are particularly apt labels, Americans are clearly sympathetic to the idea that Trump is abusing his power.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the rallies Saturday, a number of conservatives argued that invoking “Kings” was a non sequitur, given Trump was popularly elected in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t understand how Trump is a King when he won every single swing state, the electoral college and popular vote in a democratic election,”  said  Meghan McCain.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News analyst Brit Hume noted that at least some of Trump’s policies have gotten congressional approval. “ Some King ,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But there is no question that Trump has disregarded the limits of his authority — and disregarded Congress — in extraordinary ways. The protesters don’t seem to be arguing that Trump is technically a monarch, so much as that he’s seeking to exercise unchecked power when he can.\n \n\n   \n  And that seems to be an argument that a majority of Americans sympathize with.\n \n\n   \n    Many have worried about this for a long time\n \n\n   \n  If anything, these concerns already existed and have just gotten more pronounced as Trump has grabbed for more power.\n \n\n   \n  Before Trump’s second term began:\n \n\n   \n    It’s not just a partisan thing\n \n\n   \n  It might be tempting to look at these numbers and think, well, it’s just partisan.\n \n\n   \n  A decade ago, many Republicans  accused Barack Obama of acting like a king , too. And what about when Joe Biden tried to work around a Supreme Court ruling invalidating his move on student loans?\n \n\n   \n  But Americans clearly see a difference with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  For one, in that last poll mentioned above, only about 2 in 10 voters said Trump’s then-opponent, Kamala Harris, was a fascist — less than half of Trump’s number.\n \n\n   \n  For another, the Washington Post-Ipsos poll showed just 34% of Americans thought Biden had exceeded his authorities, compared with Trump’s 62%.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps tellingly, the AP-NORC poll in April showed a majority of Americans suddenly wanted to restrict that presidency in ways they hadn’t before. The percentage who said a president has “too much” power rose from 32% last year (under Biden) all the way up to 54% (under Trump).\n \n\n   \n  All of which suggests Americans — or at least a majority of them — see something extraordinary happening right now.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans can try to diminish the “No Kings” rallies all they want, but they’re speaking to something that’s very real to lots of people.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/trump-ballroom-east-wing-demolition-preservation-group","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-21:10","title":"Historic preservation group urges pause on East Wing demolition as Trump pushes ahead with his ballroom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration is proceeding with the demolition of the White House East Wing to construct a 90,000-square-foot privately funded ballroom, prompting strong opposition from historic preservation groups like the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Society of Architectural Historians.

East Wing demolition as Trump pushes ahead with his ballroom \n       \n  By Kevin Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:24 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of the nation’s premier historic preservation groups on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to pause  demolition of the White House East Wing , which excavators began tearing into this week to make way for President Donald Trump’s planned  ballroom .\n \n\n   \n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Congressionally chartered non-profit tasked with preserving historic buildings, wrote in a  letter  to the National Park Service and two administration commissions that Trump’s proposed 90,000-square-foot addition would “overwhelm the White House itself — it is 55,000 square feet — and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House.”\n \n\n   \n  The alarm among preservationists at the demolition now underway reflected the shock many felt this week as images emerged of the East Wing facade being crushed into a pile of rubble.\n \n\n   \n  The work continued Tuesday as the excavators tore further into the building, the sounds of rhythmic pounding and occasional crashing drifting across the 18-acre White House campus.\n \n\n   \n  “You hear that sound? That’s music to my ears; I love that sound,” Trump told a group of Republican senators having lunch in the Rose Garden. Trump has said the $200 million project will be funded through private donations.\n \n\n   \n  The structure being demolished includes the suite of offices traditionally used by the first lady, as well as space for White House calligraphers, certain military aides, and the social secretary. Staffers in those departments have been relocated to other areas on the complex.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing’s wood-paneled foyer has long been the main point of entry for visitors attending social events at the White House, as well as those going on tours of the building. The section emerged in its current form in 1942.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump announced months ago his plans to replace the East Wing with the new ballroom — a necessary addition, he says, to accommodate large events — the demolition appears to have proceeded without an extensive public review process.\n \n\n   \n  In Tuesday’s letter, the National Trust for Historic Preservation “respectfully” urged the administration to “pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public.”\n \n\n   \n  “These processes provide a crucial opportunity for transparency and broad engagement—values that have guided preservation of the White House under every administration going back to the public competition in 1792 that produced the building’s original design,” the letter read.\n \n\n   \n  The two commissions the letter was addressed to — the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts — have in the past reviewed proposed additions to the White House. That includes changes to the perimeter fence and the construction of a new tennis pavilion within the past decade.\n \n\n   \n  The current chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, Will Scharf, who serves as Trump’s staff secretary, said during a meeting of the commission last month that its jurisdiction covers construction, but not demolition — suggesting the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I’m excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,” Scharf said.\n \n\n   \n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation is not the only group to call for a more rigorous review of the ballroom project. Last week, before demolition began, the Society of Architectural Historians wrote in a  statement , “Such a significant change to a historic building of this import should follow a rigorous and deliberate design and review process.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s letter. But earlier Tuesday, officials distributed a lengthy list of past construction projects at the executive mansion, suggesting the ballroom fell into a pattern of improvements to the building.\n \n\n   \n  “In the latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump’s visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House — a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and renovations from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence as a beacon of American excellence,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  The images included construction of the West and East Wings, a multiyear gut renovation undertaken during Harry Truman’s administration, and the installation of a swimming pool overseen by Gerald Ford.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/asia/indonesia-uk-lindsay-sandiford-repatriated-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"21:46:00-04:00","title":"British grandmother spared firing squad in repatriation deal with Indonesia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A British grandmother, Lindsay Sandiford, was sentenced to death by firing squad in Indonesia in 2013 after being arrested in 2012 with 3.8 kilograms of cocaine, claiming she was forced to carry the drugs to protect her children.

Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Wishing for peace is far easier than making peace.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s grand ambitions in the Middle East and Ukraine are struggling against their own internal limitations and the horrific hangovers of two brutal wars.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ditched plans for a quick second summit with  Russian President Vladimir Putin , declaring Tuesday that he didn’t want to waste his time, in the latest dizzying gyration of his drama-laden but so far futile peace push.\n \n\n   \n  And  Vice President JD Vance  rushed to the Middle East, where Trump  just last week  expressed hopes he’d forged “everlasting peace.” The ceasefire he brokered  between Israel and Hamas  is holding … just.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s critics might take some satisfaction that his big plans risk stalling out. He’s brought some skepticism on himself with his hyperbolic presentation of promising incremental events as epochal breakthroughs. But rooting against him just to deprive him of wins would be crass, given that global stability and thousands of lives may depend on Trump’s success.\n \n\n   \n    Trump needs to work both wars around the clock\n \n\n   \n  Complications bursting up around both of Trump’s major peace efforts underscore how constant US engagement is needed along with the president’s personal attention despite the constant whirl of controversy that surrounds him.\n \n\n   \n  After he halted fighting in Gaza, a significant achievement, there were hopes he could vault into a fresh attempt to end the murderous  war in Ukraine  after previous efforts foundered following his August summit with a stubborn Putin.\n \n\n   \n  But on Tuesday, the president called an abrupt halt to the latest chapter in his wild ride with Putin, making clear that a summit he’d predicted could take place in Budapest within weeks was no longer on the front burner.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to have a wasted meeting. I don’t want to have a waste of time,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after a call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart on Monday failed to yield breakthroughs.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s disappointment was the latest shift in a confusing week in which he seemed poised to send  cruise missiles  to Ukraine, was talked down by Putin and then had a new Oval Office clash with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .\n \n\n   \n  So far, Trump’s Ukrainian efforts are only achieving one thing — disproving his own questionable assertions that Putin wants peace.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s hurried attempt to shore up progress in the Middle East, meanwhile, is meant to stop the administration’s other big peace initiative suffering a similar fate. After the fanfare of Trump’s victory lap in the region, the liabilities of his approach are becoming clear.\n \n\n   \n  The big question was always how to bridge an initial pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas and the ambitious peace plan that envisages Hamas giving up weapons and disengaging politically.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s visit followed — seeking to create an illusion of forward momentum to allow negotiators time to try to fill vacuums.\n \n\n   \n  The ceasefire teetered after Israel accused Hamas of killing two Israeli soldiers at the weekend and launched a wave of airstrikes that killed dozens of people in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But Vance, seeking to stop the situation deteriorating further, sought to reassert the big picture in a symbolic warning to Israel and Hamas to stick to the terms of the agreement. His visit also demonstrated US commitment to key Arab states needed to implement Trump’s plan.\n \n\n   \n  “What we’ve seen the past week gives me great optimism the ceasefire is going to hold,” Vance said in an upbeat assessment that didn’t necessarily jibe with reality. “I feel very optimistic. Can I say with 100% certainty that it’s going to work? No.”\n \n\n   \n    How the latest Russia plan fizzled\n \n\n   \n  If Trump needed confirmation that Putin is not ready to make peace in Ukraine, he got one in a swarm of drones that attacked Ukrainian power plants in a return to a brutal strategy of  using winter as a weapon  against shivering civilians.\n \n\n   \n  The US president had hoped for signs of true policy shifts from Russia to justify a relaunching of his personal diplomacy with Putin. But the Kremlin strongman just played his classic card, calling Trump a day before he hosted Zelensky in the White House in a show of flexibility designed to mitigate new US pressure and the president’s anger and frustration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had been speculating about sending Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine that would allow Kyiv’s forces to reach deep into Russia. But he snatched the idea off the table after speaking to Putin and rounded on Zelensky instead. But then, the call between Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday showed that any fresh summit would mirror Alaska’s impasse.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has not fundamentally changed a position that Ukraine could never accept. It wants Kyiv to cede territory in two eastern regions,  Luhansk and Donetsk , that it has been unable to fully capture in three years of fighting. Ukraine says such a step would leave it dangerously vulnerable to a future attack by Russia launched from the key lands.\n \n\n   \n  The melodrama repeated a well-worn cycle. Putin reacted when Trump looked like he might impose a price for Russian intransigence. Then the US president, after speaking to Putin, imposed pressure on Ukraine to give up territory. Then the process hit a wall again, leaving Trump frustrated.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is now back to his previous position that the enemies should stop fighting at current frontlines. “The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this, we take that,’” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky had earlier predicted that nothing will happen without Trump trying to coerce Putin to the table. “As soon as the issue of long-range capabilities became a little further away for us — for Ukraine — Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,” he said in his daily address on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The impasse suits Putin, who shows no sign of wanting to stop fighting and could use more time to pursue his war of attrition with the goal of winning as much Ukrainian territory as possible before any peace talks.\n \n\n   \n  After a week of acrimony and shifting positions, nothing much has changed.\n \n\n   \n    The Middle East win was meant to inject a boost into the Russia effort\n \n\n   \n  Time is also a problem in the Israel-Hamas standoff. The current interregnum between the ceasefire deal and the implementation of later steps of Trump’s deal are allowing tensions to boil and threats to its durability to grow.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has used the end of fighting with Israel to reassert its control over Palestinians in Gaza with revenge killings against alleged collaborators, raising doubts that it will ever lay down its arms as Trump demands. An international peace force is envisaged to keep permanent peace in the Gaza Strip, but until it can be formed, the ceasefire will remain fragile.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s trip was a sign to Netanyahu of just how important maintaining the ceasefire is to Trump and to states including Qatar and Turkey that they must keep up their pressure on Hamas to follow his 20-point plan. US negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff will seek to use the cover provided by Vance to try to create some progress to keep momentum alive.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s about 10 Tier-1 priorities, and we’re working all of them in parallel,” Kushner said in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  But more incidents in which Israeli soldiers die would almost certainly prod it to reopen hostilities with Hamas. This is why the complex transitional elements of the peace plan must be implemented quickly.\n \n\n   \n  “The critical issue right now is to begin to put in place the alternative administration. That starts with the Board of Peace, reinforced by having this technocratic Palestinian administration, and it is further strengthened by having the International Stabilization Force,” former US peace negotiator Dennis Ross told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga on Monday. “All that has to be implemented sooner rather than later. That creates some momentum on its own.”\n \n\n   \n  So far, however, the stabilization force hasn’t got much past the theoretical stage, prompting Trump to try to push regional powers into hurrying along.\n \n\n   \n  “Numerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East, have explicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and ‘straighten our Hamas’ if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  No regional states are publicly lining up to send their young soldiers into Gaza to insert them between Israeli and Hamas forces. So the president’s post was closer to hope than reality — a description that regrettably also applies to his interrupted plan to end the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  But at least he’s trying. And it’s not too late yet.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/adelita-grijalva-lawsuit-sworn-in-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"19:53:00-04:00","title":"Arizona Sues Over Mike Johnson’s Refusal to Swear In Democrats’ Newest Congresswoman","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, arguing that Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democrat Adelita Grijalva violates the Constitution.

sues over Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in Democrats’ newest congresswoman \n       \n  By Holmes Lybrand, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:53 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Arizona’s attorney general has sued the US House of Representatives over Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to seat an Arizona member of Congress – who was elected in late September – due to the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “This case is about whether someone duly elected to the House,” Kris Mayes and other attorneys wrote in the filing Tuesday, “may be denied her rightful office simply because the Speaker has decided to keep the House out of ‘regular session.’”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has said he is “following the Pelosi precedent” in not administering the oath of office to Adelita Grijalva, noting that when Republicans had won similar special elections, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi waited until lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill following periods of recess.\n \n\n   \n  In a news conference Monday, Johnson said that Grijalva won her race after the House “had already gone out of session.”\n \n\n   \n  “So I will administer the oath to her on the first day we come back [to] legislative session,” Johnson said. “I’m willing and anxious to do that.”\n \n\n   \n  Moments after the lawsuit was filed, the speaker dismissed the effort as “patently absurd” and a bid for publicity.\n \n\n   \n  “We run the House. She has no jurisdiction. We’re following the precedent,” he told reporters as he left the Capitol. “She’s looking for national publicity. Apparently she’s gotten some of it, but good luck with that.”\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Grijalva told CNN on Tuesday that she is trying to schedule a meeting with Johnson before she leaves town to go back to her district on Thursday to put an end to their back and forth and try to convince him to swear her in.\n \n\n   \n  “I am going to try to schedule an appointment and just sort of sit down to say this back and forth is not good. It’s not healthy. It’s, you know, a clap back here and there. It’s not something that I want,” Grijalva said in an office interview, adding that in the 28 days since winning her election, she has never spoken to Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit argues that “the Constitution does not give that authority to the Speaker—or anyone else” to delay Grijalva’s appointment.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit accuses Johnson of delaying Grijalva’s swearing in because he is attempting to prevent a petition that would force a vote in the House on releasing records around Jeffrey Epstein as well as “strengthen his hand in the ongoing budget and appropriations negotiations.”\n \n\n   \n  The Constitution, Mayes argues, requires elected members to be sworn in if they meet the standard qualification, which Grijalva does, the lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  “If the House wishes to remove a member for other reasons, it must first seat the member, then expel by a two-thirds vote,” the lawsuit states, adding that “the Constitution does not specify who must administer the oath, only that Representatives must take it.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson, Mayes says, “has been in the Capitol during this time and has not identified any reason that he (or a designee) is unable to administer the oath to Ms. Grijalva.”\n \n\n   \n  The Arizona attorney general also accused Johnson of arbitrarily delaying Grijalva’s seating since he does not dispute her qualifications or her election, adding there is “no practical reason why he is unable to administer the oath.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC’s federal court, also argues that Johnson’s refusal to seat Grijalva injures both the elected congresswoman, by preventing her from doing her job, and the people of Arizona by being down a member to represent their interests.\n \n\n   \n  Mayes is asking that a judge decide that if Johnson refuses to swear Grijalva in, another person qualified to administer oaths be allowed to do so for the new congresswoman.\n \n\n   \n   This story is updated with additional details.

       9:13 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he “could be” seeking $230 million from his own Justice Department as compensation for past investigations into him, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.\n \n\n   \n  “It could be,” Trump responded when asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about a  New York Times report  that he was seeking the money in connection with complaints he had filed about past DOJ investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it. All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Though many of the details remain unclear, Trump acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying himself” damages to resolve claims that the Justice Department under his predecessor had wronged him.\n \n\n   \n  “With the country, it’s interesting, because I’m the one that makes the decision,” Trump said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself. In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you’re paying yourself in damages?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A settlement to Trump would come from taxpayer funds.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has long claimed the Justice Department was weaponized against him, focusing his ire on the two federal indictments brought against him after his first term. Both cases  were dropped  after he won ree﻿lection last year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump argued Tuesday that he was damaged by the investigations into him and suggested he deserved to be paid for that, but added that he’d give away the money or use it to  renovate the White House .\n \n\n   \n  “As far as all of the litigation … they probably owe me a lot of money, but if I get money from our country, I’ll do something nice with it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The New York Times reported Tuesday on that Trump was seeking $230 million in compensation and that any settlement might be approved by Justice Department officials who defended Trump, or those around him, during the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump submitted the complaints in 2023 and 2024, before he was reelected, The Times report says. The first claim seeks damages for alleged rights violations including the investigation into  Russian interference  in the 2016 election.\n \n\n   \n  The second complaint focuses on Trump’s  classified documents case  — which was dismissed after he was reelected — including accusing the FBI of violating his privacy when it searched his Florida estate in 2022. CNN  previously reported  on that claim, which sought $100 million.\n \n\n   \n  Asked to confirm the $230 million amount, a spokesperson for Trump’s outside legal team said only that “President Trump continues to fight back against all Democrat-led Witch Hunts, including the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax and the un-Constitutional and un-American weaponization of our justice system by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers.”\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear what steps Trump or his legal team had taken more recently to press the Justice Department for a payment out of those complaints. According to The Times, both claims were filed as part of an administrative process that allows people who believe they have been wronged to seek compensation from federal agencies. That is different from a lawsuit filed in court and decided by a judge.\n \n\n   \n  The No. 2 official at the Justice Department — Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche — worked as Trump’s lead criminal defense lawyer. Another top DOJ lawyer, Stanley Woodward, who runs the department’s Civil Division, represented a Trump co-defendant in the classified documents case.\n \n\n   \n  In theory, both officials could be involved in discussions about paying a settlement to someone alleging wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether top Justice Department officials would be conflicted in this matter, DOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin told CNN, “In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.”\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department  fired its ethics chief  in July, part of a purge of at least a dozen employees who had worked with the special counsel who brought the federal indictments against Trump.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/paul-ingrassia-withdraw-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"20:10:00-20:30","title":"Trump’s nominee for whistleblower office is withdrawn after reports of racist texts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Ingrassia, a nominee for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), withdrew his nomination in October 2025 following reports of racist text messages allegedly sent to a Republican group chat, including claims that Martin Luther King Jr. should be 'tossed into the seventh circle of hell' and that he has a 'Nazi streak'.

\n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Paul Ingrassia is no longer the nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, two White House officials told CNN on Tuesday, after his chances of getting through the Senate confirmation imploded following reports of racist text messages that he allegedly sent to a group chat.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia posted earlier Tuesday evening that he was withdrawing himself from his confirmation hearing “because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time.” He added that he appreciated the “overwhelming support” he received and that he “will continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again!”\n \n\n   \n  His post came hours after Senate Majority Leader John Thune hinted that the White House would pull Ingrassia’s nomination following the reports of racist text messages. “I think they’ll have something official to say about that, but you know what we’ve said, and you’ll probably be hearing from them soon,” he told reporters at the White House.\n \n\n   \n   Earlier Tuesday, a White House official told CNN his nomination was “under review.”\n \n\n   \n  Thune said Monday night that he hoped the White House  would pull the nomination  after  Politico’s reporting  on the messages. “He’s not going to pass,” Thune added of Ingrassia, whom Trump nominated in May to lead the independent agency tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia was set to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, but one Republican senator on the panel had already announced he’d vote against advancing the nomination.\n \n\n   \n  “No, I do not support him,” Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Monday night. Scott’s opposition would have effectively sunk the nomination in committee, assuming every Democrat joined him.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, after Politico’s report,  CNN’s KFile reported  that Ingrassia lost the support of the main Jewish group backing his nomination\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia, whose nomination had already drawn scrutiny, allegedly texted a group chat of other Republicans saying he has “a Nazi streak” and that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell,” according to Politico, which viewed the group chat.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia’s lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, initially questioned the authenticity of the messages but added that if authentic, they were meant satirically.\n \n\n   \n  “Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted. However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters ‘Nazis,’” he wrote in a statement to Politico.\n \n\n   \n  “In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi,” Paltzik added. In a subsequent statement to Politico, he said, “there are who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs,” and that “we do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages.”\n \n\n   \n   KFile  has previously reported on Ingrassia’s history of racist invective and conspiratorial rants, and affinity for a well-known White nationalist and Holocaust denier. His nomination had drawn scrutiny over his past promotion of conspiracy theories and tweets from his podcast that included calls for martial law following Trump’s 2020 election loss and harsh anti-Israel rhetoric aimed at the GOP. Ingrassia also argued publicly that “straight White men” are the most intelligent demographic group and should be prioritized in education.\n \n\n   \n  Amid KFile’s initial reporting in July, the Trump administration insisted that Ingrassia had the backing of “many Jewish groups,” listing four — but most of those groups told CNN in July that they do not support him.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Morton Klein — president of the main Jewish group that had been backing Ingrassia’s nomination, Zionist Organization of America — told CNN in a statement, “If these text revelations are accurate, I have no choice but to immediately withdraw my support. In this time of a surge and growing antisemitism, it is incumbent upon all of us to fight even any hint of antisemitism or racism.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia, who was admitted to the bar only last summer, held a brief White House internship during Trump’s first term. This year, Ingrassia first worked as a White House liaison at the Justice Department  before reportedly  being pushed out and reassigned to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  He would have marked a sharp departure from previous heads of the OSC, a role designed to be politically independent and to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. Rather than a long record of managerial or prosecutorial experience, typical of those who previously held the job, Ingrassia brought a fervent loyalty to Trump and a lengthy record of inflammatory statements.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, Em Steck, Morgan Rimmer, Ted Barrett and Annie Grayer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/business/walmart-h1b-visa-pause","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"18:56:00Z","title":"Walmart halts job offers for applicants who need H-1B visas after Trump raises fees to $100,000","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Walmart, the largest private-sector employer in the U.S., has paused job offers to foreign applicants needing H-1B visas in response to President Donald Trump’s announcement of a $100,000 fee on these visas, which are designed for high-skilled workers.

Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN. “He has the strength and skills to get it done. The speaker is doing a great job, but we need Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The restlessness within the Republican conference comes as both sides have continued to dig in, leaving no clear avenue toward reopening the government without a major shakeup in the dynamics on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  And it signals growing unease in parts of the GOP with the toll that the shutdown is taking on the country and over  which party will ultimately shoulder the blame  — even as Trump and Republican leadership project confidence that their strategy will win out.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, to move this needle and get this thing off the bubble, President Trump will have to get involved,” said Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia. “That’s probably what will have to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not spoken with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries since before the government shuttered weeks back, a White House official confirmed earlier this week. The two Democratic leaders said Tuesday they’d put in a new request for a meeting with the president.\n \n\n   \n  Yet so far, Trump has opted to steer clear of the day-to-day maneuvering despite his self-fashioned image as a dealmaker, tasking House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune with managing the shutdown instead.\n \n\n   \n  They have so far refused to entertain any negotiations with Democrats, vowing not to bend to demands for concessions on health care in exchange for funding the government. Johnson, who has kept in regular touch with the president, has similarly dismissed the idea of getting Trump more directly involved.\n \n\n   \n  “He (Trump) is not going to negotiate with the Democrats, who have taken the American people hostage. We’re not going to pay a ransom to reopen the government,” Johnson told reporters on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  A frustrated Thune insisted to CNN on Tuesday that there is no “plan B” for ending the shutdown, signaling Republican leaders will keep forging ahead and pressuring Democrats to simply accept the House’s short-term funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  The extended standoff represents a departure from prior shutdowns, where funding lapses have typically prompted a scramble on both sides of the aisle to reach an agreement. During  the last lengthy shutdown  — a 35-day stalemate during Trump’s first term prompted by his insistence on funding for a border wall — lawmakers repeatedly floated proposals aimed at breaking the logjam, while Trump went as far as to cancel a holiday trip to Mar-a-Lago to remain in Washington amid the crisis.\n \n\n   \n  But this time around, Republican and Democratic leaders have so far found little reason to talk — with each resorting instead to attempting to outlast the other. There are no weekend meetings or meaningful negotiations. And the House hasn’t even been in session for over a month, with Johnson vowing not to bring the chamber back until Democrats are ready to cave.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Tuesday hosted Senate Republicans at the White House for a lunch billed in part as an effort to encourage continued solidarity, predicting in a speech that Democrats would ultimately lose out politically.\n \n\n   \n  “They are the obstructionists,” he said. “The reason they’re doing it is because we’re doing so well.”\n \n\n   \n  In conversations with senators over a meal of cheeseburgers, Trump signaled that he was open to talking with Democrats, and he later reiterated the stance in remarks from the Oval Office, saying he he had just “one little caveat”: only when the government opens.\n \n\n   \n  That stated position is in line with talking points echoed by congressional Republican over the last three weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s open to a conversation if there’s something substantive they have to offer, but the idea that they can hold the government hostage in a shutdown is not going to work,” Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota said, as senators returned from the White House clutching MAGA hats and other White House memorabilia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also touted the opportunity the shutdown has provided him to seize greater authority over the government’s vast operations and workforce, bragging about deep cuts to the federal workforce and funding cuts aimed primarily at ramping up pressure on Democrats. White House officials have sought to fire more than 4,000 government employees, while halting billions of dollars meant for infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic states and districts.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not going to get a lot of things back,” Trump said of the cuts, later adding that “maybe indirectly, they’re doing good” by giving the administration an excuse to hack away at unwanted parts of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has telegraphed deeper cuts in the coming days, with budget chief Russell Vought saying he hopes to lay off more than 10,000 federal workers in total. Trump in the meantime has redirected funding to pay military service members and law enforcement officers, in steps that have effectively allowed crime and immigration initiatives central to his agenda to move forward unimpeded.\n \n\n   \n  Yet while Trump has reveled in the newfound leeway, some on Capitol Hill have grown increasingly impatient with the standstill. And with Democrats showing no fresh signs of backing off their stance, they argued that Trump may be the only one who can apply the direct pressure needed to force a resolution.\n \n\n   \n  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley went as far as to encourage Democrats to start contacting Trump directly. “He would answer anybody. They could call him. He would answer. I mean, he’s like very accessible,” he said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have similarly called for Trump to re-engage with Capitol Hill, as part of their bid to secure an extension of enhanced Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that House and Senate Republicans don’t do anything without getting permission from their boss, Donald J. Trump. And the reason why there have been no negotiations – zero negotiations – since Republicans shut the government down is because Donald Trump clearly wants the government shut down,” Jeffries said, arguing that “Trump definitely needs to get involved” and “off the sidelines.”\n \n\n   \n  But despite the rising pressure on both sides of the aisle, Republican leaders have indicated no willingness to budge.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know what there is to negotiate,” Thune said at the White House. “Open up the government first.”\n \n\n   \n  Within the West Wing, officials have so far projected a similar resolve. They’ve seized on recent polling showing some subtle shifts among voters toward blaming Democrats for the impasse. And as Democrats’ have begun to push for direct talks with Trump, aides have interpreted it as a sign that the party’s position is growing increasingly untenable — and further confirmation that there’s no reason now to give them an easy out.\n \n\n   \n  “This is just frantic wishcasting from the Democrats because they’re in disarray and their shutdown strategy has led them into a trap,” one White House official said. “Our position has not changed in terms of what we want, and our feelings on the government shutdown.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/weather/tropical-storm-melissa-forecast-track-path-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-04:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa Expected to Become Hurricane in Caribbean","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday.

a hurricane. Its track is unclear, but it’s bringing a dangerous threat \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologist Mary Gilbert\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:42 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea, proving this year’s  Atlantic hurricane season  won’t be wrapping up quietly.\n \n\n   \n  The storm could slam the northern Caribbean with pouring rain and strong winds as it strengthens over extremely warm water this week. Melissa’s worst impacts could center on Hispaniola, where significant flooding and dangerous mudslides are possible for parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa was churning about 300 miles south of Haiti with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Tuesday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n \n\n   \n  The storm is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday, according to the center, but it’s still tough to pin down exactly how strong it will become from there.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus. Puerto Rico is much more likely to experience some of the storm’s rain.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    Days of rain and wind\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios forecasters have been monitoring for days. The one looking most likely at this point could spell disaster for parts of Hispaniola; the other could eventually take Melissa close to Central America.\n \n\n   \n  Both involve Melissa first loitering out over the Caribbean Sea for multiple days this week, churning up seas and bringing nasty weather to islands within the storm’s reach.\n \n\n   \n  From there, Melissa could take a turn to the north by late week and potentially move close to Hispaniola through the weekend, strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday morning. This is the scenario the hurricane center’s track for the system reflects.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is the 13th named storm of the season but is the first to churn in the Caribbean Sea. The lack of storms allowed the Caribbean to become so extremely warm that its water is now basically rocket fuel for storms.\n \n\n   \n  If Melissa taps into that energy, it could explode in strength – something that’s  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola. It’s still unclear exactly what parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could also deliver a considerable amount of rain to Jamaica and Puerto Rico in this scenario, with flash flooding and mudslides possible.\n \n\n   \n  Alternately, there’s still a chance that Melissa misses its window to take a northward turn and instead just creeps west over the Caribbean until it nears Central America — potentially Nicaragua or Honduras — next week. It could make landfall there or take a very late turn to the north and head for Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  The northern Caribbean would likely still receive a few days of wet and windy weather in this scenario, but rainfall totals would be lower, as would the flood risk, with Melissa moving steadily west.\n \n\n   \n    So… will it hit the US?\n \n\n   \n  It’s unlikely — though not entirely impossible — Melissa will deliver a direct hit to the mainland US. At this time, the storm’s most likely impact to the US could be in the form of some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n  Florida could be in play if Melissa remains a weaker storm for longer and takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa’s wind and rain.\n \n\n   \n  The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently,  Hurricane Nicole  slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and  Hurricane Zeta  smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.\n \n\n   \n  As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.\n \n\n   \n  Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/ddlj-bollywood-30-years-anniversary-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"19:49:00-04:00","title":"Why a Bollywood classic about forbidden love still captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the enduring cultural significance of the 1995 Bollywood film 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), which has remained a beloved and frequently screened film for nearly 30 years at the Maratha Mandir theater in Mumbai.

captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on \n       \n  By Rhea Mogul and Ayushi Shah, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Inside the Maratha Mandir movie theater, audience members jump to their feet as the first notes of an iconic mandolin riff play, their bodies casting silhouettes against the opening credits of a film screened here   nearly every day for 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  A joyous, collective roar erupts from the rows as the lead actors share their first fated glance. Near the front, a young couple mirrors that gaze, their wedding photographer capturing a timeless moment against the iconic backdrop.\n \n\n   \n  Governments have fallen, and a new millennium has dawned, yet people still come to this Mumbai cinema to immerse themselves in the comfort of a love story known by heart, for less than $1 a ticket.\n \n\n   \n  Released in 1995, “Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” commonly referred to as “DDLJ,” tells the story of two young Indians, Raj Malhotra and Simran Singh, raised in London, who fall for each other during a freewheeling trip across Europe, only to face the ultimate test – earning her father’s approval. It became a cultural touchstone and the second-highest-grossing film of its decade.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the cinema’s daily showing has drawn young Indians dreaming of their own epic romance, those seeking a brief escape from the pressures of city life in Mumbai, and curious tourists who want to see the fandom up close.\n \n\n   \n  “I watch it almost every day,” said Suneel Shedge, a 50-year-old diamond worker from a nearby neighborhood who speaks with leading man charisma, and is prone to bursting into songs from the movie. As the film hits its three-decade anniversary this month, he has come to pay homage to what he considers Bollywood’s greatest love story.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes I cry, sometimes there’s pain. There’s happiness, there’s sadness,” he said. “A movie like this will never be made ever again.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s the “most beautiful love story,” said 23-year-old Vaishnavi Deshmukh, who has lost count of how many times she has seen the film.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t explain how I feel,” her boyfriend, Tejas Raout, 23, said. “It’s nostalgia.”\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, “DDLJ’s” narrative mirrors India’s own pivotal journey in the early 1990s — a nation shaking off its socialist slumber, opening its arms to the world, and finding a confident new voice that was both global in its outlook and Indian at its core.\n \n\n   \n  This cultural resonance also had a seismic effect on its cast. The film catapulted Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who played lovers in the film, from rising stars into cinema royalty, cementing them as the definitive on-screen couple for years to come.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, pinning down the exact formula which created this cultural phenomenon is impossible, said prominent Indian film critic and writer, Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  You can’t attribute its success to “just one single thing,” the author of “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: A Modern Classic,” which analyzes the film’s commercial triumph, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “When the cinema gods deem that you create a classic, the stars align. Everybody’s stars align. And you get a film like this, which I think becomes a romantic blueprint for many generations.”\n \n\n   \n    Capturing the national zeitgeist\n \n\n   \n  In 1995, India was a nation beaming with endless possibility.\n \n\n   \n  Four years after the floodgates of economic liberalization had been thrown open, the country was in the midst of a cultural awakening. The state-run Doordarshan, which aired a mix of entertainment and news, was now competing with the vibrant pulse of MTV and Star TV, while the Indian-manufactured Ambassador car vied for space on the road with models made by Japan’s Maruti and South Korea’s Daewoo. On giant billboards towering over cities, Coca-Cola returned to wage war against Pepsi, and the American daytime soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful” had become a household name.\n \n\n   \n  This influx of choice created a thrilling but anxious juxtaposition: Indians were captivated by globalization but also fearful of losing their own identity.\n \n\n   \n  Into this cultural moment, stepped filmmaker Aditya Chopra (no relation to film critic Anupama Chopra), the son of the late Yash Chopra — Bollywood’s legendary “King of Romance.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the ’90s, the mood was about aspiration. The mood was about looking westward,” he said in the 2023 Netflix docuseries, “The Romantics,” which chronicles his family’s contribution to Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Aditya Chopra had an idea for his directorial debut: a script he wrote that would capture the energy of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  In “DDLJ,” Simran, the devoted daughter of Baldev Singh, a hardworking owner of a corner shop, is initially not attracted to Raj, the low-achieving but fun-loving son of a wealthy immigrant. As they dance and sing their way through Switzerland, however, they eventually fall in love. But Simran’s stern, conservative father, has already arranged her marriage to another man.\n \n\n   \n  “Love was always rebellious, against the parents,” Aditya Chopra said of other films at the time. “That always bothered me.”\n \n\n   \n  So, instead of eloping in defiance of tradition, the charming Raj embarks on a mission to win Simran’s father’s approval in elaborate, often comedic ways. Simran, on the other hand, struggles between her duty as a daughter and her desire to marry the man she loves.\n \n\n   \n  In the film’s climax, Baldev looks at his daughter and grants her his blessing. “Go, Simran, go. Live your life,” he says. What follows is an iconic sequence, captured in slow-motion: Simran’s desperate sprint down a train platform after ditching the planned wedding, her traditional bridal attire and thick, black hair billowing in the wind, Raj’s hand outstretched from the carriage door, his face bloodied after a fight with Simran’s doomed fiancé, and the triumphant embrace as he pulls her up to safety.\n \n\n   \n  The first half of the film unfolds in the cosmopolitan landscapes of London and continental Europe, while the second half transports the audience to the agrarian fields of India’s Punjab state.\n \n\n   \n  The characters take elements of Western culture to India, including the clothes they wear and their attitude towards love in a society where, in the mid-nineties, many parents claimed the right to choose — and veto — potential spouses.\n \n\n   \n  The central conflict captivated the nation back then and continues to resonate with many young Indians today. For viewers like Deshmukh, who was at the Maratha Mandir screening, the takeaway is clear: “Parents matter the most,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The score, composed by the duo Jatin-Lalit, created an enduring legacy, producing an all-hit album whose songs became timeless anthems for romance and celebration. All these years later, people “watch it for the music,” said Lalit Pandit.\n \n\n   \n  “I could feel right away this wasn’t just another film,” Manish Malhotra, the designer behind the movie’s costumes, told CNN. “(Aditya Chopra) was a first-time director, yes, but the way he spoke about Raj and Simran was so vivid, emotional, and precise that you almost saw the film come alive in that very moment.”\n \n\n   \n  Malhotra, who went on to become one of India’s leading fashion designers, was particularly inspired by the duality at the heart of the film’s message, which he channeled directly into Simran’s wardrobe. He looked at her “not just as a heroine, but as a young woman caught between London and Punjab, her wardrobe needing to echo both her Western upbringing and her Indian soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Simran wore short skirts and halter dresses, reflecting what young Indian women were wearing in the West. Meanwhile, “every pastel salwar, every floral skirt, every dupatta drape was about telling her story with authenticity,” he said, referring to some of her traditional Indian outfits.\n \n\n   \n  On the film’s impact, Malhotra admits he couldn’t have predicted its eventual scale. “But I did know it was special,” he said. “Because when you connect to a story that deeply, when the characters feel that real, the work flows with sincerity. And that sincerity has a way of staying with people long after the film is over.”\n \n\n   \n    Impact on future romance films\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” was the first mainstream Bollywood film not just to represent Indians living overseas but place their unique cultural conflict at the very core of its narrative.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the film’s release, Indians abroad were rarely heroes in Bollywood movies. They were confined to negative archetypes: the villain who had lost his Indian values, or the seductress whose drinking and smoking habits signaled moral corruption.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the reasons that ‘DDLJ’ is so amazing is that there’s a piece of everybody there in it,” said Snigdha Sur, founder & CEO of The Juggernaut, a media platform that writes stories about South Asia and the South Asian diaspora.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re very Indian, and if you’re very nationalist… this film is about returning home to India… and getting permission the right way. If you’re a diaspora kid, you’re saying ‘we haven’t forgotten our traditions,’” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “You see two people who really want to be together, fighting for something they believe in. For Indians, and specifically from my experience… that’s the story of my life,” said Indian Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh in the “The Romantics.” “I know, deep down, I really seek my parents’ approval. And that’s why the ending of ‘DDLJ’ meant so much to me.”\n \n\n   \n  The wider Indian diaspora’s connection to the movie was immediately tangible and reflected in the box office numbers at the time. Made on a budget of less than half a million dollars, “DDLJ” earned nearly $2 million overseas,  according to  movie analyst Taran Adarsh. Back home, it became a blockbuster hit and the highest grossing film of 1995.\n \n\n   \n  But beyond numbers, it created the blueprint for the modern Indian film that would dominate Bollywood for the next decade; “a watershed moment,” according to the author Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  The cinematic landscape prior to “DDLJ” was defined by two prevalent narratives. There was the “angry young man”— a working-class protagonist, typically a victim of a corrupt system, whose story was driven by a quest for vengeance or social justice. Then there were the family melodramas centered on romances thwarted by stark class divides. Crucially, both worlds were almost exclusively rooted in India.\n \n\n   \n  Aspects of “DDLJ’s” s storyline influenced a string of future blockbusters, from “Pardes” (1997), which explored the search for a traditional bride for a Westernized son; the grand family saga “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham” (2001), centered on a wealthy patriarch’s disapproval of his son’s marriage to a commoner and set between London and New Delhi; and “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003), which tells the story of love and sacrifice within New York’s vibrant Indian community.\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” also launched the legendary on-screen pairing of Khan and Kajol, who have starred in seven major films together, setting the gold standard for Bollywood romance for decades to come.\n \n\n   \n  “When you keep repeating (their pairing) and it keeps attracting an audience, it cements their position,” Anupama Chopra said. “And off the top of my head, I can’t think of any pairing that had that sort of longevity.”\n \n\n   \n    A step back in time\n \n\n   \n  Back at the Maratha Mandir, walking into the screening of “DDLJ” feels like stepping into a time capsule.\n \n\n   \n  A living museum of a bygone era, the building is an unassuming structure, its age showing in dilapidated sections and torn posters clinging to its gates. Inside, faded red leather seats evoke a classic, old-world ambiance. Popcorn and chips are still sold in simple, vacuum-sealed plastic bags.\n \n\n   \n  “People from all around the world come here,” said its manager Manoj Pandey, who has been working at the institution for 15 years. “When the movie came out in 1995, no one thought we’d be here watching it 30 years later… But it was definitely right after the opening that it was going to become a blockbuster and have a long life.”\n \n\n   \n  They still sell about 100 tickets a day, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The theater’s owner briefly flirted with the idea of stopping the show in 2015. But the announcement was met with outcry from the public. “We received hundreds of letters in protest,” said Pandey.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Khan and Kajol reunited on stage for the Filmfare Awards, one of India’s most notable annual events that honors excellence in Hindi cinema, where they danced to one of movie’s most beloved songs, “Tujhe Dekha Toh,” which translates to “When I See You.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet, for all the love and adoration, there are moments from the film that haven’t aged so well, according to some fans.\n \n\n   \n  Viewed through a contemporary lens, the film’s gender politics feel dated, said “The Juggernaut’s” Sur, particularly in a scene where Raj gaslights a panicked Simran into believing they slept together after a night of drinking. This is compounded by the reduction of Simran’s agency to the singular goal of marrying her beloved, leaving her own personal ambitions completely unexplored.\n \n\n   \n  “What does she do? What are her work ambitions?” Sur said. “I want to know more about what she’s studying, where she wants to work.”\n \n\n   \n  For Anupama Chopra, the whole idea of Simran “being parceled between lover and father” is equally frustrating. “But every film is a product of its time,” she said. “And I can tell you at the premiere, none of us thought there was any problem with it because we didn’t know any better. We were swept by the romance.”\n \n\n   \n  At the Maratha Mandir, crowds casually trickle in, well into the film’s three-hour runtime.\n \n\n   \n  It’s clear that most have seen the movie before, yet when a big moment arrives, phones go up to capture it for social media as cheers erupt with a joy that feels brand new.\n \n\n   \n  Sitting in one of the back rows, the diamond worker Shedge takes it all in.\n \n\n   \n  “As long as I’m alive and until my last breath,” he said. “I’ll keep watching this film.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/anti-immigrant-protests-dublin-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"18:37:00Z","title":"Anti-immigrant protesters burn police van in Dublin after young girl attacked","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 21, 2025, anti-immigrant protesters in Dublin burned a police van and attacked officers near a building housing asylum seekers, an event that follows a similar incident in 2023 involving the stabbing of three children.

Now, it appears, that timeline is unlikely.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Tuesday he didn’t want the meeting to be “a waste of time.” He may still meet with the Russian leader, he implied, but he indicated it was no longer a top priority. “We’ll be notifying you over the next two days as to what we’re doing,” the president told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said after the Thursday call that the US and Russia had “agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week,” and officials had expected Secretary of State Marco Rubio would meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to lay the groundwork for the Trump-Putin summit.\n \n\n   \n  But multiple officials told CNN that diplomatic engagement, too, was no longer happening — at least for the time being — and one source said Rubio and Lavrov had divergent expectations about a possible end to  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine . Rubio and Lavrov spoke by phone Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov had a productive call. Therefore, an additional in-person meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future,” the administration official said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Although the US described the call as “productive,” a source familiar with the matter told CNN that officials felt afterward that the Russian position had not evolved enough beyond its maximalist stance, and there was a sense that Rubio was not likely to recommend moving forward on a Putin-Trump meeting next week. The source said Monday that Rubio and Lavrov could speak again this week.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Lavrov rejected the notion of freezing the conflict — an idea put forward by Trump after  a meeting with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week and backed by Kyiv and Europe as part of negotiations toward an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin had previously sought to tamp down expectations of a rapid Trump-Putin summit, saying after the US president first announced it that it “may happen within two weeks or a bit later.” It added at the time that talks between Rubio and Lavrov would mark the first step toward organizing the Russia-US summit in Budapest, Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the summit cannot be postponed, because no date was ever set.\n \n\n   \n  “You cannot postpone what has not been scheduled,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The White House stressed Trump was still committed to brokering peace in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has consistently worked towards finding a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to end this senseless war and to stop the killing,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN. “He has courageously engaged parties on all sides and will do everything in his power to achieve peace.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Zelensky asserted that Russia “became less interested in diplomacy” after the United States declined to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  “As soon as the issue of long-range capabilities became a little further away for us — for Ukraine — Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,” Zelensky said Tuesday in his daily address. “This is a signal that this very issue — the issue of long-range capabilities — may be the indispensable key to peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “The greater Ukraine’s long-range capabilities,” Zelensky added, “the greater Russia’s willingness to end the war.”\n \n\n   \n  Even before revealing there were no immediate plans for Trump and Putin to meet, the Trump administration had come to believe that a big stand-alone meeting between Rubio and Lavrov was not essential to set the table for a summit. That is largely because Lavrov is not empowered to meaningfully move the process along, a senior administration official said.\n \n\n   \n  The administration views calls between the two aides as effective to get a sense of where the Russian side is on certain topics, but it does not believe a big meeting between the two would be useful, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat described Lavrov as someone who is “100% loyal to Putin but who’s never in the room when real important decisions are being taken.”\n \n\n   \n  “To negotiate with Lavrov is somewhat a diversion while the important discussions are only with Putin himself,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the conversations about setting up a meeting between the two diplomats remains fluid, a senior administration official said, adding that it is possible they meet on the sidelines of a meeting of world leaders organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, which is set to take place next week in Malaysia.\n \n\n   \n  In Rubio and Lavrov’s Monday phone call, they discussed “next steps” to follow up on the call between their two presidents last week about a possible end to the conflict in Ukraine, according to a brief US State Department readout. Rubio “emphasized the importance of upcoming engagements as an opportunity for Moscow and Washington to collaborate on advancing a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war, in line with President Trump’s vision,” according to the readout.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, described the call as a “constructive discussion” that dealt with “possible concrete steps to implement the understandings” Trump and Putin reached during their conversation.\n \n\n   \n  It has been more than two months since Trump held his last  in-person summit  with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. The nearly three-hour meeting ended without a deal as both leaders touted progress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly called for Kyiv and Moscow to “stop the war immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  “You go by the battle line, wherever it is. Otherwise, it’s too complicated. You’ll never be able to figure it out. You stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  European leaders and Ukraine put out a joint statement Tuesday saying that they support Trump’s position “that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations” and that pressure on Russia must increase.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is scheduled to meet NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/democrats-republicans-blame-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:40:00Z","title":"Could Democrats win the shutdown standoff?

Despite the Democrats making a popular policy demand—extending Obamacare subsidies—public opinion polls show Americans blaming Republicans more than Democrats, with the gap widening since the shutdown began. Historically, the party making the policy demand has lost politically, but this situation is different because the demand is popular and widely supported.

They’re still winning the blame game \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:40 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal government shutdown is now the second-longest in history. We’re on Day 21, and if it lingers into early November, Congress could surpass the current record of 35 days – from, as it happens, the first Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Who knows if we’ll get there. There is a premium in these debates on appearing resolute. That means neither side telegraphs that it might fold – right up until the moment one does.\n \n\n   \n  But there are also a number of dynamics pushing us toward an especially prolonged shutdown right now.\n \n\n   \n  And at the top of that list is the blame game, where we’re in uncharted territory.\n \n\n   \n  But plainly: History suggests it’s Democrats who would eventually back down. But they seem to have relatively little reason to do so right now.\n \n\n   \n  Generally speaking, it’s  the side that made extraneous policy demands that loses  politically in shutdowns. In this case, that’s the Democrats, who are demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. People overwhelmingly say they don’t like using shutdowns as leverage – by massive margins, in fact.\n \n\n   \n  But public opinion on this shutdown hasn’t gone that way.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats keep winning the blame game\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that Democrats were “getting killed in the polls.”\n \n\n   \n  “The public understands what they’re doing; they’re doing the wrong thing,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  This does not appear at all accurate.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, every quality public poll has shown Trump and Republicans continue to shoulder more blame than Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  In a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  conducted October 15-20, Americans blamed congressional Republicans more than Democrats, 50%-43%.\n \n\n   \n  The gap was larger in a  CNBC poll  conducted October 8-12. It showed Americans blamed Trump and the Republicans over Democrats, 53%-37%. (Independents blamed Trump by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, 58%-21%.)\n \n\n   \n  Before the shutdown started, polls showed the blame game favoring Democrats by between 7 and 11 points. Polling since it started has shown it favoring Democrats by between 7and 17 points.\n \n\n   \n    This is not normal\n \n\n   \n  The other longest shutdowns on record were in 1995-96 (21 days) and 2018-19 (35 days), both of which involved Republicans making the policy demand.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, the blame game was against the GOP from the start and seemed to get worse as things dragged on.\n \n\n   \n  In 1995-96, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll before the shutdown showed people were prepared to blame Republicans by 11 points. Polling after the shutdown began showed the GOP getting blamed by more than 20 points.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018-19, pre-shutdown polling showed Americans were predisposed to blame Trump and the Republicans by 14-15 points. Most quality polls after it began showed Americans blaming the GOP by 20 or more points.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, the GOP was arguably fighting a losing battle before things even got started, and then it became clear they weren’t winning either politically or policy-wise. So they gave up.\n \n\n   \n  That’s been flipped on its head now.\n \n\n   \n  A big reason appears to be that what Democrats are demanding  is actually popular  – unlike, for instance, the GOP’s demand of building Trump’s border wall in 2018-2019. The new Reuters-Ipsos poll shows 72% of Americans and even 51% of Republicans want health care subsidies to be extended. Those numbers have also been consistent.\n \n\n   \n    How much of a stomach do Democrats have?\n \n\n   \n  The question is whether Americans believe the policy goal that they very much want is worth continuing the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  That could be a tougher ask, especially as some key impacts of the shutdown set in. Federal employees will miss their first full paycheck later this week, for example. Small business loans will be held up. Aid to low-income Americans like food stamps  could soon be halted .\n \n\n   \n  But the looming impacts cut both ways. November 1 is as an especially important deadline for Democrats’ policy demand. It’s when open enrollment for the Obamacare plans begins.\n \n\n   \n  At that point, many Americans would begin to see the significantly higher premiums caused by letting the subsidies lapse – in most cases  doubling or close to doubling , according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.\n \n\n   \n  There is a school of thought that Democrats could give up at that point, believing they had forced Republicans to own the premium hikes and that they had cast a spotlight on the fact that the GOP stood in the way of renewing them.\n \n\n   \n  But if you’re a Democrat and you’re looking at these polls, you have to be intrigued by the possibility of holding out. What if Republicans really get scared about owning those premium hikes – like  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia and  even Trump’s own pollster  have warned them – and suddenly feel compelled to come to the table?\n \n\n   \n  Democrats haven’t had many wins since the November election, and this situation presents at least the possibility of a very significant one.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps as significantly, how would a Democratic base that has sharply criticized their party’s leaders for their lack of fight react to their side throwing in the towel when it looked like they were on the winning side of the issue?\n \n\n   \n  Plenty will play out over the next 10 days. But the plot is significantly thicker than in past shutdowns.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/business/cvs-pharmacy-outage","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:01:00-04:00","title":"CVS Says Pharmacy System Outage Resolved After Preventing Prescription Fills","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"CVS reported a system outage that disrupted prescription filling and pickup at some of its pharmacy locations on Tuesday, October 21, 2025, due to a network connection issue.

and Max Saltman\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:18 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As temperatures drop in Ukraine, Russia has stepped up drone attacks on power facilities supplying millions of homes across the country.\n \n\n   \n  There are signs that the Russian military is repeatedly hitting the same areas to aggravate the population’s suffering. The northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy – adjoining Russia and Belarus – have seen constant attacks over the past month.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands of people in Chernihiv were without power or water on Tuesday after more than 50 drones and missiles targeted essential facilities overnight. Two attack drones hit a heat supply facility and another energy installation, according to Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv regional military administration.\n \n\n   \n  Later Tuesday, some 20 Russian drones targeted the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi, according to Chaus, killing two men and two women.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has targeted Chernihiv’s power infrastructure on 15 days over the last month, according to the regional energy company.\n \n\n   \n  There was also a  massive  Russian attack on energy facilities in several regions, including Kyiv, on October 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s tactics are to kill people and terrorize them with cold,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  And the Ukrainians see another new Russian tactic.\n \n\n   \n  “The Russians are deliberately launching unmanned aerial vehicles that continuously circle over damaged facilities, making it impossible to carry out work safely and deliberately prolonging the humanitarian crisis,” Ukraine’s energy ministry said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has developed a mix of drones and missiles in its attacks on energy infrastructure that sometimes overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses. In Sumy, which borders Chernihiv, power is yet to be fully restored in the town of Shostka and surrounding area after strikes two weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  After the latest strikes, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called on allies “to urgently mobilize additional assistance for Ukraine’s resilience: from energy equipment to energy sources and air defense capabilities.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are 203 key facilities in Ukraine that we need to protect with air defense systems,” Zelensky said earlier this month, most of them to do with electricity, gas and water.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian government has a two-pronged response to the growing Russian onslaught: more and better air defenses and longer-range missiles to intensify  Ukraine’s own attacks  on critical Russian infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Later Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said that Ukraine had targeted Russia’s Bryansk Chemical Plant – which produces gunpowder and other explosive materials – with long-range Storm Shadow missiles. Without mentioning the plant, the regional governor of Bryansk claimed on social media that Russia had “detected and destroyed 57 enemy aircraft-type UAVs” during a Ukrainian attack on Tuesday. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But Ukraine is not getting  US Tomahawk  cruise missiles, as had been anticipated in Kyiv and it’s still chronically short of air defenses.\n \n\n   \n  “Just a few weeks ago, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin felt real pressure and the threat of Tomahawks and immediately showed a willingness to return to diplomacy,” Zelensky said Tuesday. “As soon as the pressure eased a little, the Russians began to try to jump off the diplomatic bandwagon.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian officials are anxious that US President Donald Trump is again souring on Kyiv ahead of a possible summit with Putin in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian source described Zelensky’s meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday as tense – if constructive overall. Zelensky himself said that “after many rounds of discussion” they had agreed the starting point for any ceasefire is “where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides understand what is meant.”\n \n\n   \n  Less than a month ago, Trump  mused  that Ukraine could win back all the territory it had lost.\n \n\n   \n    Zelensky eyes Russian assets\n \n\n   \n  Not for the first time, Zelensky is now turning to Europe for back-up, and will meet European leaders on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s stalling tactics have shown time and time again that Ukraine is the only party serious about peace,” Zelensky and 10   of the continent’s   leaders said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “We are developing measures to use the full value of Russia’s immobilised sovereign assets so that Ukraine has the resources it needs,” they added in a joint statement.\n \n\n   \n  About $200 billion of Russian assets in Europe have been frozen, and the European Union is exploring ways to use some of them as a loan to Ukraine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said last week he would call for the EU to provide a 140-billion euro ($163 billion) loan to Ukraine to finance its war effort.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin has described the idea as an illegal seizure of Russian property.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has suggested some of the frozen assets be used to fund the purchase of Patriot air defense batteries and long-range missiles. He’s aiming to procure 25 Patriot systems – but acknowledged this would take years rather than months.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky and Ukraine’s European allies are also wary of a summit in Budapest hosted by Putin’s closest ally in Europe, Viktor Orban – though the Kremlin said Tuesday that the venue and date have not been confirmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a prime minister who blocks Ukraine everywhere can do anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution,” Zelensky said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a clear pattern in Putin’s tactics, according to analyst Tatiana Stanovaya, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, based in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  “Whenever Trump becomes too angry or frustrated with Russia, Moscow reaches out,” Stanovaya  wrote on X  Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  After Putin’s conversation with Trump on the eve of Zelensky’s visit to Washington, “Trump’s tone seems to have shifted,” Stanovaya said. “He’s back to saying that Russia is winning, that Ukraine will have to give up territory, and that the US cannot afford to keep sending missiles. Russia’s position has not changed at all – it is the same as six months or even a year ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked on Sunday how Kyiv would respond if a meeting in Budapest went badly, the Ukrainian president replied: “Even when it seems you’re cornered, it’s not as hopeless as it looks.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/north-carolina-redistricting","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:38:00-04:00","title":"North Carolina Senate Advances New Congressional Maps to Help Republicans Gain Additional US House Seat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The North Carolina Senate has approved a new congressional redistricting map designed to help Republicans gain an additional seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, shifting power toward 11 out of 14 districts.

Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:38 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The North Carolina Senate approved a new congressional map aimed at helping Republicans eke out an additional GOP seat to help shore up the party’s majority in the US House after next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The vote   came one day after Republican lawmakers who control North Carolina’s legislature  formally opened debate on the map . It targets a House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis – one of three Black members of Congress from the state. The new district lines aim to give Republicans the advantage for 11 out of 14 US House seats from North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP currently controls 10 seats under the map used in last year’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  The map is now in the North Carolina House, which is expected to vote on it Wednesday. State law does not give Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, veto power over redistricting legislation – although litigation over the map is likely.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina is the latest GOP-controlled state to accede to President Donald Trump’s demands  to take up drawing new district lines  to prevent Democrats from flipping the US House. Off-year elections generally favor the party out of power in the White House, and Democrats need to gain just three more seats to gain control of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  A Democratic-controlled House could thwart Trump’s agenda and launch investigations during the final two years of his presidency into his actions and those of his administration.\n \n\n   \n  Battles over congressional districts are underway around the country – after Trump kick-started the fight by  pushing Republicans in Texas  to craft new maps to help the party pick up five more seats.  Democrats in California, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom , have responded with their own redistricting push that asks voters next month to replace the state’s current congressional maps with new ones that aim to net the party five US House seats.\n \n\n   \n  During the debate this week, North Carolina Republicans made clear their political goals.\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats take back the House, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” said state Sen. Ralph Hise, the Republican helping oversee the map legislation. He claimed that Democrats across the country had gerrymandered maps to favor their party in previous redistricting cycles.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina is fighting fire with fire,” he added in a statement. “If Gavin Newsom and his Democrat cronies want to try and take control of Congress to force their liberal agenda on the American people, then we’re going to respond in kind.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger also defended the vote, arguing that Democrats across the country have “spent decades” gerrymandering states they control.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina Republicans will not sit quietly and watch Democrats continue to ignore the will of the people in an attempt to force their liberal agenda on our citizens,” Berger said in a statement. “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, accused GOP lawmakers of bowing to Trump’s demands without regard for the state’s voters.\n \n\n   \n  “Clearly, this new congressional map is beyond the pale,” Davis said in a statement, noting that the district elected him and voted for Trump in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “What is happening today … is a response from a president who has demanded fealty from members of his party who control legislatures across this country,” Democratic state Sen. Julie Mayfield said during the floor debate on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Another Democrat, state Sen. Michael Garrett, cast Tuesday’s vote as a perilous moment for American democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “Future historians will look back at 2025 and ask, ‘When democracy was openly under assault, when a president demanded states rig their elections, when millions took to the street, begging their leaders to protect their rights, what did those in power do?’” Garrett said. “Did they stand with the people or did they stand with the powerful?”\n \n\n   \n   The story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arit John contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/lamonica-mciver-ice-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:03:00Z","title":"Democratic Congresswoman Appears in Court to Fight Charges She Interfered with ICE Arrest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver is facing a federal indictment alleging she physically interfered with ICE officers during a May 9, 2025, oversight inspection at a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey.

LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court Tuesday as she continues to fight a three-count indictment alleging she impeded and interfered with federal officers in a highly publicized incident at a Newark, New Jersey, ICE detention facility in May.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorneys have argued she’s being selectively and vindictively prosecuted because her political views are   at odds with the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Jamel Semper did not rule from the bench on McIver’s motion to toss the charges, but he did ask prosecutors to push Department of Homeland Security officials to  remove statements  from their online platforms that allude to the incident involving McIver. The judge said it is prejudicial for “fact free” social media posts from government officials to be floating on the internet to potentially taint a jury pool while McIver’s prosecution is pending.\n \n\n   \n  Semper   said he’d seen posts from government officials that suggest information ”counter to the indictment” like claims that McIver trespassed and that the incident was tied to Antifa activity.\n \n\n   \n  DHS press releases related to the incident have been removed, according to prosecutor Mark McCarren who also said he’d try to get the social media posts removed.\n \n\n   \n  One X post that’s still visible on the official DHS profile suggests members of Congress “stormed” the facility gate.\n \n\n   \n  The congresswoman was indicted in June on the charges connected to her alleged attempt to physically thwart the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, outside the facility.\n \n\n   \n  McIver, who joined the House Homeland Security Committee last year, was at the ICE facility with Democratic Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman for an oversight inspection.  McIver’s attorneys say employees at the facility actively tried to impede her oversight of the facility delaying the lawmakers’ access.\n \n\n   \n  Homeland security officials also forced Baraka out of the facility when he tried to join the congressional oversight visit. Baraka was then arrested for trespassing outside the facility gates in a crowd of protestors. The trespassing charge against Baraka was later dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say when McIver tried to intervene in the arrest, she “slammed” her forearm into the body of a uniformed agent and forcibly grabbed him in an attempt to restrain him. McIver also allegedly pushed another ICE officer and “used each of her forearms to forcibly strike (him) as she returned inside the secure area of the facility,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  If the case goes to trial on November 10 as currently scheduled, prosecutors said Tuesday they’ll rely heavily on  surveillance and officers’ body worn camera footage  that shows the scuffle that lasted just over a minute.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s defense attorney Paul Fishman argued any of the congresswoman’s conduct should be covered by the Speech or Debate Clause because she was there on legislative business. Semper questioned the idea that an alleged assault outside the facility gate was a part of her official legislative inspection.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s attorneys called her prosecution retaliatory and partisan claiming it’s “Part of a broader partisan agenda of ending ‘wokeness.”’ President Donald   Trump has publicly criticized McIver since the incident and said the “days of woke are over” when commenting on her case.\n \n\n   \n  Fishman said Tuesday that McIver’s prosecution is in stark contrast with Trump’s pardons of individuals accused of violent activity in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot.\n \n\n   \n  “She was charged with something she never would’ve been charged with if she was a Republican,” Fishman said.\n \n\n   \n  Semper challenged the defense, pointing out that the other Democratic lawmakers weren’t charged in connection to the incident on May 9.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was shoved by an ICE agent and caught in a scuffle she didn’t start, Fishman argued.\n \n\n   \n  The other members also weren’t as close to the action in the moment, Fishman added.\n \n\n   \n  Fishman  said ICE agents were “spectacularly irresponsible” in their handling of the mayor’s arrest, starting a “reckless” and “dangerous” situation in a crowd of civilians.\n \n\n   \n  McIver told supporters after the hearing, “I’m not going to stop holding this administration accountable.”\n \n\n   \n  Several Democrats, including Reps. Menendez and Watson Coleman, Ilhan Omar, Jasmine Crockett and Sara Jacobs appeared at the courthouse on Tuesday and spoke to a crowd of McIver’s supporters.\n \n\n   \n  Baraka called McIver’s prosecution awful and told reporters after the hearing that the process for McIver to clear her name takes time away from the work she was elected to do.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/chicago-national-guard-supreme-court","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:34:00Z","title":"Trump touts Oregon National Guard ruling as Supreme Court weighs deployment to Chicago","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, Illinois, to address protests against ICE agents, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supported similar deployments in Portland and Los Angeles.

In its latest filing, the Department of Justice framed Trump’s decision to send the Guard into Illinois as a response to what it described as a broader national threat.\n \n\n   \n  “As the Ninth Circuit recognized, ‘the president can, and should, consider the totality of the circumstances,’ and it is error for courts to ‘discount evidence they deem less relevant,’” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court. “That is especially so where, as here, the events in Chicago are not occurring in a vacuum, as violent riots have occurred in Los Angeles and Portland, a shooter tried to murder federal agents in Dallas, and Mexican cartels are offering bounties on DHS personnel.”\n \n\n   \n  The states fighting Trump have scoffed at the idea that protests merit sending in the troops. When she temporarily blocked the deployment in Illinois earlier this month, US District Court Judge April Perry disputed the administration’s description of what has been happening on the ground at the ICE facility in Broadview.

by Republican lawmakers that investigators in the January 6 election subversion case had “wiretapped” GOP members of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republicans in recent weeks accused Smith and the FBI of “political weaponization” after the FBI disclosed 2023 court orders used to obtain phone toll records belonging to eight senators and one House member. The records covered calls over four days surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack by Donald Trump supporters on the Capitol.\n \n\n   \n   The toll records  do not include content, but detail time and length of calls and the telephone numbers with which the lawmakers communicated, and are a routine part of Justice Department investigations.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and his Democratic counterpart, Dick Durbin, Smith’s lawyers dispute that there was any political motive in obtaining the records, which they note were disclosed in the 2024 indictment of Trump and in Smith’s report on his investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “As described by various Senators, the toll data collection was narrowly tailored and limited to the four days from January 4, 2021 to January 7, 2021, with a focus on telephonic activity during the period immediately surrounding the January 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol,” reads the letter from Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, which was reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The subpoena’s limited temporal range is consistent with a focused effort to confirm or refute reports by multiple news outlets that during and after the January 6 riots at the Capitol, President Trump and his surrogates attempted to call Senators to urge them to delay the certification of the 2020 election results.”\n \n\n   \n  The Smith attorneys note that toll records of then-President Joe Biden were obtained by special counsel Robert Hur in the probe of his mishandling of classified documents, and in the investigation of Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who was convicted on bribery and foreign influence charges.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Smith’s use of the toll records as Special Counsel was lawful and in accordance with normal investigative procedure,” the letter from Smith’s attorneys says.\n \n\n   \n  Republican senators raised the disclosure of the toll records during a recent Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Gascón’s decision to recommend a resentencing – the culmination of a review that came after  defense attorneys said in 2023 they had new evidence  pointing to abuse by their father – was made about an hour before he announced it, he said.   \n \n\n   \n  “I believe that they have paid their debt to society and the system provides a vehicle for their case to be reviewed by a parole board, and if board concurs with my assessment … they will be released accordingly,” Gascón said in front of a packed room that included several media outlets and family members.\n \n\n   \n  A Los Angeles Superior Court judge will ultimately decide whether to resentence the brothers, Gascón’s office  said . While Gascón said he’d make his recommendation to the court Friday, a date for a hearing on the matter has not been determined, his office said. Nancy Theberge, deputy in charge of Gascón’s resentencing unit, hopes a hearing will be held in 30 to 45 days, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Gascón   said he supports the resentencing of the brothers to life with the possibility of parole – which normally would mean 50 years to life in prison. But because the crimes happened when the brothers were under 26 years old, under California law they would be eligible for youthful parole.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re very sure not only that brothers have rehabilitated and will be safe to be reintegrated into our society, but they have paid their dues, not only for the crimes that they committed, but because of all the other things they have done to improve the lives of so many others,” Gascón said in the news conference﻿, indicating that the men created groups to address how to deal with untreated trauma and helping inmates with physical disabilities.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers “have been model prisoners by all accounts,” Gascón said in an interview with CNN later Thursday, after he announced his decision.\n \n\n   \n  “Not only have they worked on their own self-improvement, but they have done a lot of work to better the life of those around them, which that part is unusual,” Gascón told CNN. “I believe they have served enough time.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the brothers’ attorneys said his team is “hopeful” the decision will one day allow the men to have a life outside of prison.\n \n\n   \n  “We are grateful the district attorney recognized not only the extraordinary contributions Erik and Lyle have made while in prison, but the role that sexual abuse played in their actions as well,” attorney Cliff Gardner told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The reexamination of the case came more than 35 years after the fatal shooting of Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills home. Their sons, Lyle and Erik, who were 21 and 18 at the time, were arrested less than a year later, in 1990, and accused of first-degree murder.\n \n\n   \n  At their high-profile trials decades ago – one of the first cases to be televised – the brothers did not deny killing their parents. However, they argued they should not be convicted because they acted in self-defense after enduring a lifetime of physical and sexual abuse by their father.\n \n\n   \n  A first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors deadlocked on the charges. In their second trial, much of the defense evidence about sexual abuse was excluded. The brothers were found guilty in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison.\n \n\n   \n    What the 2023 defense petition said\n \n\n   \n  Gascón’s reexamination of the case came after attorneys for the Menendez brothers filed  a habeas corpus petition  in 2023, citing what they argue is  new evidence , as well as a recent  California law  on resentencing in which the court can take into consideration sentences in comparable cases. The judge can consider whether the defendants were victims of psychological or physical abuse, whether they are rehabilitated and whether they are a danger to society.\n \n\n   \n  Among the new evidence the 2023 petition asked a court to consider: a sworn statement by former Menudo boy band member Roy Rosselló, who alleged Jose Menendez sexually assaulted him in the 1980s. The attorneys also said  a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin  months before the killings alludes to the abuse he endured.\n \n\n   \n  The defense was asking the court to either vacate the brothers’ conviction and sentence, or permit discovery and an evidentiary hearing during which they can provide proof, the petition says.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers’ story has taken on new interest following the September release of the Netflix series, “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,” co-created by Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan. Netflix also  released a documentary  on the Menendez case this month featuring both men discussing what led to the killings.\n \n\n   \n  Gascón, who is campaigning for reelection next month on a platform that includes sentencing reform, told CNN this month times have changed regarding how the public and the courts treat victims of sexual abuse.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no question that a jury today would look at this case probably very differently than a jury did 35 years ago,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Brave and necessary,’ Jose Menendez’s niece says\n \n\n   \n  When asked about mounting criticism from opponents who suggested reconsidering the Menendez brothers’ sentence was a political move, Gascón said, “There’s nothing political about this,” adding that more than 300 resentencings have happened in the county since he took office in December 2020, including 28 for murder.\n \n\n   \n  Celebrity and criminal justice reform advocate Kim Kardashian, who has been  vocal  about her support of the brothers, also thanked Gascón for “righting a significant wrong.”\n \n\n   \n  “Your commitment to truth and fairness is commendable,” she wrote in a statement posted on Instagram stories. “This case highlights the importance of challenging decisions and seeking truth, even when guilt is not in question.”\n \n\n   \n  Anamaria Baralt, Jose Menendez’s niece, called the decision by Gascón “brave and necessary.”\n \n\n   \n  “Today is a day filled with hope for our family,” she said Thursday. “Together we can make sure that Erik and Lyle receive the justice they deserve and finally come home.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/science/elon-musk-sean-duffy-nasa-spacex","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:01:00Z","title":"Elon Musk calls acting NASA chief 'Sean Dummy' as SpaceX moon contract hangs in the balance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elon Musk launched a public criticism of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, calling him 'Sean Dummy' and accusing him of being out of touch, after Duffy expressed concerns that SpaceX was behind schedule on its lunar lander mission for NASA’s Artemis III program.

‘Sean Dummy’ as SpaceX moon contract hangs in the balance \n       \n  By Hadas Gold, Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:01 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Elon Musk lashed out at Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a series of insulting posts on his social media platform X on Tuesday, after Duffy suggested  NASA may sideline  SpaceX from its moon mission.\n \n\n   \n  Musk, SpaceX’s CEO, called Duffy “Sean Dummy,” accused him of having a “2 digit IQ” and posted sophomoric  memes  aimed at Duffy.\n \n\n   \n  “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America’s space program?” Musk asked in a  post  Tuesday morning, which he pinned to his X profile. (Duffy, a former member of Congress, is a world champion lumberjack speed climber.)\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Duffy said in an interview with CNBC that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon’s surface, is lagging behind schedule, potentially thwarting NASA’s efforts to return humans to the moon before China amid a new space race.\n \n\n   \n  “So, I’m going to open up the contract. I’m going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They do remarkable things,” Duffy told Fox News about SpaceX on Monday, “but they’re behind schedule.” NASA’s pivotal moon-landing mission, called Artemis III, is planned for as soon as mid-2027.\n \n\n   \n  Musk spent Tuesday morning posting about how SpaceX is “the only company to successfully human-certify a new orbital space vehicle in the US” and resposting criticisms of Duffy.\n \n\n   \n  Musk also responded to reporting from the Wall Street Journal that Musk ally Jared Isaacman may be back in the running to lead the agency, as Duffy jockeys to fold NASA completely under the Transportation Department. Trump had pulled Isaacman’s nomination for NASA administrator  earlier this year  – the same week Musk departed his role in Washington.   Though Trump cited Isaacman’s “prior associations” as the reason for pulling the nomination,  CNN previously reported  that a faction of people in Trump’s inner circle advocated against Isaacman after Musk left Washington and shortly before Musk’s very public falling out with the President.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman — who has twice flown to orbit on SpaceX capsules he commissioned — has reportedly been back in the running, and a source familiar with the matter confirmed he has met with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!” Musk  posted  on Tuesday, as well as reposting others’ praise for Isaacman.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman told CNN he has “never expressed confidence about renomination at any point” and that he has “a lot of respect for Secretary Duffy and I have always enjoyed the time I’ve spent with him.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m grateful to all the supporters and to President Trump for the consideration, and most of all, I just wish to see NASA continue to shine as the world’s most accomplished space agency,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a spokesperson for Duffy said that the transportation secretary “never said he wants to keep the (NASA) job himself.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson added that Duffy has suggested NASA “might benefit from being part of the Cabinet, maybe even within the Department of Transportation,” but reiterated he has not said he would like to become NASA’s permanent leader.\n \n\n   \n  “The President asked him to talk with potential candidates for Administrator, and he’s been happy to help by vetting people and giving his honest feedback,” the spokesperson said. “The bottom line is that Secretary Duffy is here to serve the President, and he will support whomever the President nominates.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/05/13/us/menendez-brothers-resentencing-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:54:00Z","title":"Erik and Lyle Menendez Resentenced to 50 Years to Life, Opening the Door for Possible Parole, Judge Rules","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a landmark decision, Judge Michael Jesic resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life for the 1989 murders of their parents, making them eligible for parole for the first time.

resentenced to 50 years to life, opening the door for possible parole, judge rules \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Matthew J. Friedman, Nick Watt, Melissa Gray, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:54 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A judge resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents, ruling Tuesday the brothers will be eligible for parole. The brothers have been serving life without parole for the killings.\n \n\n   \n  The stunning decision came at the end of the first day of what was scheduled to be a two-day hearing about resentencing for the brothers, who were convicted of first-degree murder for the killings in the living room of the family’s Beverly Hills home.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Michael Jesic said during the resentencing that a horrific crime was committed, but he was equally shocked by the letters from prison and corrections officers, saying it’s remarkable what the brothers have done.\n \n\n   \n  While they are immediately eligible for parole, Jesic said he is not suggesting they should be released, but “one day they should get that chance.”\n \n\n   \n  The state parole board and governor must still decide whether to grant parole. A hearing with the board is already scheduled for June 13 as part of a separate bid by the brothers.\n \n\n   \n  They’re also seeking clemency from the governor, which could allow for their immediate release, and they have filed a habeas petition for a new trial.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s now up to the parole board and the governor of California,” Jesic said. CNN has reached out to the governor’s office and the state parole board for comment on the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The parole board could either deny their request or recommend to the governor that they be granted parole. If the board recommends parole be granted, the decision will go to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n \n\n   \n  In California, the governor has “executive authority to affirm, reverse, or modify any Board decision to grant or deny parole to a convicted murderer,” according to  the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation . He’ll have 120 days to do that.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Newsom  used that authority  to deny parole for Sirhan Sirhan, the man convicted of assassinating Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, after the board recommended Sirhan for parole.\n \n\n   \n  Last fall, former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón  recommended resentencing for the brothers , but his successor, Nathan Hochman, has fought against it.\n \n\n   \n  “The decision to resentence Erik and Lyle Menendez was a monumental one that has significant implications for the families involved, the community, and the principles of justice,” Hochman said in a statement Tuesday evening. “Our office’s motions to withdraw the resentencing motion filed by the previous administration ensured that the Court was presented with all the facts before making such a consequential decision.”\n \n\n   \n  The hearing moved much more quickly than expected. Jesic had given no indication about when or in what form he would rule, acknowledging the complicated nature of the case in which the family members are victims who also support the defense. It was even thought a decision wouldn’t come before the end of proceedings Wednesday, he said.\n \n\n   \n    Brothers take ‘full responsibility’ for the murders\n \n\n   \n  The high-stakes hearing began Tuesday with arguments about whether Erik and Lyle Menendez should be resentenced in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers appeared remotely from prison before the judge made the decision, and both took “full responsibility” for the murders.\n \n\n   \n  “I committed an atrocious act against two people who had every right to live, my mom and dad,” Erik said, adding that he “created a crushing sadness” for his family and there was “no excuse” for his behavior.\n \n\n   \n  “I will never stop trying to make a difference whether I am inside or outside of prison,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lyle also admitted to killing his parents, saying he “was immature” and “filled with rage.”\n \n\n   \n  “Had I trusted others to help me, I wouldn’t have committed these crimes,” he said. “I didn’t think anyone would believe me about my sexual abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  If he was let out of prison, he would “continue to serve sexual abuse victims,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  After court, defense attorney Mark Geragos said, “I just know that on a day like today, that redemption is possible.”\n \n\n   \n  “The fact is, the Menendez brothers have done remarkable work, and today is a great day after 35 years,” he said. “They are a real family, real people who have lived through unimaginable horrors, and I’m hopeful and glad that we’re one, one huge step closer to bringing the boys home.”\n \n\n   \n  The brothers were hoping the judge would reduce that sentence to life with parole; Geragos said earlier Tuesday he hoped the judge would go even further and reduce the charge to voluntary manslaughter, with a sentence of time served.\n \n\n   \n    Family members and close supporters testify\n \n\n   \n  Family members who have long supported the brothers were in court Tuesday, with several taking the stand to plead for the brothers’ release.\n \n\n   \n  “We just want this to end,” cousin Anamaria Baralt testified.\n \n\n   \n  Relatives say the brothers have  demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation , and that the severity of the sentence should be revisited because of an evolving understanding of childhood sexual abuse. The brothers have maintained they carried out the murders in self-defense after years of abuse by their father, and continued to say that Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Diane Hernandez, another cousin who testified Tuesday, lived with the Menendez family in their Beverly Hills home and viewed herself as an older sister to the boys. On the stand, she described how Jose Menendez intimidated and terrorized the house, and testified about his “hallway rule” that when he was with the brothers, no one else could be.\n \n\n   \n  “Please be merciful,” Hernandez told the judge. The brothers, she said, “are remarkable human beings at this point.”\n \n\n   \n  Hochman, the current Los Angeles County district attorney, had said he was not opposed to resentencing, but doesn’t feel it’s justified yet. The brothers, he says, have “fabricated” their claims of abuse and self-defense and must admit it first.\n \n\n   \n  “The Menendezes have had numerous chances to come clean with all their actions and if and when they do, they’ll be ready for resentencing,” Hochman told CNN earlier Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors pressed family members on whether they were aware of the brothers having lied to them over the years.\n \n\n   \n  “Were you aware the brothers lied to the family, to law enforcement and to the media?” Seth Carmack asked Tamara Goodell, another cousin. She said she was, but that the brothers never spoke about it to her one way or another and they talk about the murders with her only to say sorry.\n \n\n   \n  Baralt was also asked whether the brothers had ever admitted to lying and trying to manipulate the case. She said Lyle had recently admitted asking a girlfriend to lie about his father’s abuse.\n \n\n   \n  Retired Judge Jonathan Colby, who knew the brothers through a prison program, also testified they were great inmates, calling them “peacemakers” in prison. Anare Brown, who met the brothers while he was in prison, said they have remorse and insight, and have helped “dozens” of people they were imprisoned with.\n \n\n   \n  Another factor Hochman cited in opposing resentencing is the recent finding the brothers would pose a “moderate” risk of violence if released. That came in a pair of comprehensive risk assessments conducted by the state parole board.\n \n\n   \n  Both brothers had committed cell phone violations while in prison, he said – Lyle in November 2024 and Erik in January 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutor Habib Balian asked Baralt on Tuesday about the cell phones, and she acknowledged some of her conversations with Lyle had taken place on an illegal burner phone he had in prison.\n \n\n   \n    Efforts toward release\n \n\n   \n  Unlike a new trial, which would focus on the facts of the case, resentencing allowed the judge to consider a variety of factors, including the brothers’ rehabilitative efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers have founded a long list of prison programs, with Erik starting at least five, including a support group for disabled and elderly inmates. Lyle founded a massive beautification program, raising more the $250,000 to install greenery to help prison life to resemble the outside world.\n \n\n   \n  Besides authority to change parole board decisions, Newsom also has the power to commute the brothers’ sentences, which would immediately free them – but he has so far refrained from doing so. The “comprehensive risk assessments” the judge requested ahead of the resentencing hearing were commissioned by the state’s Board of Parole after Newsom asked them to investigate whether the brothers would pose an “unreasonable risk” to the public if released.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the Menendez brothers are also pursuing a new trial, formally known as a habeas corpus petition. Attorneys claim to have new evidence against the brothers’ father, including a 1988 letter from Erik Menendez to a relative referencing the alleged abuse.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2023/11/08/world/panda-diplomacy-us-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:58:00-04:00","title":"The National Zoo’s panda program is ending after more than 50 years as China looks elsewhere","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. has ended its 50-year giant panda program, with three pandas — Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — departing to China in 2025.

Gray and David Culver, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:58 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Three giant pandas left their enclosure at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC, and departed by plane back to China on Wednesday, marking the end of more than 50 years of Chinese pandas being housed at the zoo.\n \n\n   \n  The black and white bears – Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their youngest cub, Xiao Qi Ji – were transported from the zoo in crates and loaded onto a FedEx aircraft at Dulles International Airport, taking off around 1 p.m.\n \n\n   \n  The Smithsonian National Zoo was the first US zoo to showcase pandas as part of what’s been called “panda diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zoo staff call it a “hiatus” in their five-decade wildly popular panda program; Chinese officials have yet to say whether it will continue.\n \n\n   \n  And with relations between the two superpowers in a constant state of flux, these national treasures may be finding themselves part of the extension of the diplomatic chaos that has taken over the relationship between the two countries.\n \n\n   \n  The   pandas’ departure from the National Zoo leaves Zoo Atlanta as the only other US zoo to feature pandas from China, and not for much longer. The contracts for Atlanta’s four bears expire next year, with no word on an extension.\n \n\n   \n    It started during the Nixon presidency\n \n\n   \n  China acknowledges the cuddly creatures are used for its “major political and diplomatic needs,” especially in places where it hopes to gain more influence or closer relations. China says its focus is on conservation and research and says the US program has been productive.\n \n\n   \n  “The two sides have formed good cooperative relations, achieved fruitful results and played a positive role in protecting endangered species,” said spokesperson Mao Ning of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  “The purpose is to better protect endangered species and promote global biodiversity conservation.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s panda diplomacy with Washington kicked off in 1972, following President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to China.\n \n\n   \n  Chairman Mao Zedong’s government gave two giant pandas to the United States in a sign of warming bilateral ties after decades of diplomatic deep freeze.\n \n\n   \n  First lady Pat Nixon welcomed the pandas to the nation’s capital, saying, “They will be enjoyed by the millions of people who come from across the country to visit the nation’s capital each year.”\n \n\n   \n  Seeing the pandas’ popularity rise among Americans, China sent more of the   cuddly and charismatic creatures   to other zoos across the United States, eventually loaning them instead of giving them as a gift.\n \n\n   \n    Changing diplomacy\n \n\n   \n  Agreements between China and the US zoos stipulate Beijing owns the pandas and any of their offspring, and they require payment “for the conservation of giant pandas in China.” The National Zoo has paid $500,000 a year; Zoo Atlanta says it has  contributed more than $16 million  since the start of its program in 1999.\n \n\n   \n  Since giant pandas arrived at the National Zoo in 1972, animal care staff and scientists have studied their biology, behavior, breeding, reproduction and disease,  according to the zoo .\n \n\n   \n  “The Zoo’s giant panda team works closely with colleagues in China to advance conservation efforts for giant pandas in human care and in the wild,” the zoo says on its  website .\n \n\n   \n  At the height of the program, there were 15 pandas at one time in the United States, but in the past decade, the numbers have dropped – coinciding with worsening US-China relations. And soon, there could be no more pandas at American zoos.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, videos surfaced on Chinese social media claiming pandas returning from the Memphis Zoo were being abused. Partially fueled by Chinese state media, the claims went viral.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese doctors defended the zoo’s treatment of the pandas, confirming that the giant panda, named YaYa, was suffering from a skin disease, but was in good health.\n \n\n   \n  But some in China still see it as a symbol of America’s bullying and oppression of China, with others highlighting countries such as Russia, which also hosts the animals, as a place where pandas are treated well.\n \n\n   \n  Assuming China chooses not to send over more giant pandas, and Atlanta sends theirs back next year, by the end of 2024 the only panda in zoos throughout all of the Americas would be Xin Xin in Mexico City.\n \n\n   \n  Xin Xin – who at 33 is old for a panda – is owned by Mexico and is a main attraction at the zoo, which is now bracing for a possible surge in visitors.\n \n\n   \n  “For the time being, come to Mexico!” said Fernando Gual Sill, director general of the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City. “In Mexico City we have the fortune to have (a panda) and to see it and to enjoy it!”\n \n\n   \n    Pandas around the world\n \n\n   \n  Pandas that are part of China’s loan program are meant to serve as an  envoy of friendship  between China and the host country, so the fading program in the United States may indicate a diplomatic shift.\n \n\n   \n  Russia, China’s northern neighbor, received a pair of pandas in 2019, with Chinese President Xi Jinping standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin as they welcomed the bears to the zoo in Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  Qatar received its first panda last year.\n \n\n   \n  Including the United States, 23 countries have pandas on loan from China, but that number is dwindling. Scotland will lose its two pandas in December when the  Edinburgh Zoo  must return them to China; Australia’s  Adelaide Zoo  has its two pandas only for one more year.\n \n\n   \n  The pandas leaving America will head to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, where in recent years conservation efforts have proven successful. Pandas are no longer on the endangered species list, and their population has jumped nearly 17% over the past decade,  according to Zoo Atlanta .\n \n\n   \n  Still, the total number of giant pandas in China – 1,864 as of the latest census, in 2014 – is considered low for breeding and maintaining a viable population. Only around 61% of China’s pandas are protected by reserves, and their habitat is threatened by logging in established forests, which eliminates the large tree hollows pandas like to use for dens,  Zoo Atlanta says .\n \n\n   \n    Will the pandas ever return stateside?\n \n\n   \n  Staff at the National Zoo say they’re hopeful China might one day send over more giant pandas. They’re even planning renovations for the soon-to-be vacant panda exhibit.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re hopeful for the future, so we have submitted an application that’s being reviewed,” said Bob Lee, director of animal care at the National Zoo.\n \n\n   \n  Zoo Atlanta’s panda habitat  cost $7 million to build  ahead of the bears’ arrival in 1999, and assuming the bears leave at the end of their contracted stay, it will now stand empty. Plans for the exhibit, with a welcome sign announcing the “Giant Pandas of Chengdu” and a panda-themed gift shop, aren’t clear.\n \n\n   \n  Remembering how the pandas first came to Washington, zoo visitor Jane Mahalik said she hoped the current first lady might work for their return.\n \n\n   \n  “Pat Nixon got the pandas here,” Mahalik told CNN, “and Jill Biden should go and get these pandas back for us.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Yong Xiong reported from Washington, DC, and New York; Melissa Gray reported from Atlanta; and David Culver reported from Los Angeles and Mexico City.

This week, scientists announced the discovery of three mosquitoes — marking the country’s first confirmed finding of these insects in the wild.\n \n\n   \n  Mosquitoes are found almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of Antarctica and, until very recently, Iceland, due to their extreme cold.\n \n\n   \n  The mosquitoes were discovered by Björn Hjaltason in Kiðafell, Kjós, in western Iceland about 20 miles north of the capital Reykjavík. “At dusk on October 16, I caught sight of a strange fly,” Hjaltason posted in a  Facebook group  about insects, according to  reports  in the Icelandic media. “I immediately suspected what was going on and quickly collected the fly,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  He contacted Matthías Alfreðsson, an entomologist at the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, who drove out to Hjaltason’s house the next day. They captured three in total, two females and a male. Alfreðsson identified them as mosquitoes from the Culiseta annulata species.\n \n\n   \n  A single mosquito from a different species was discovered many years ago on an airplane at the country’s Keflavík International Airport, Alfreðsson told CNN, but this “is the first record of mosquitoes occurring in the natural environment in Iceland.”\n \n\n   \n  The Culiseta annulata species is native to a huge part of the Eastern Hemisphere, ranging from North Africa to northern Siberia. It appears well adapted to colder climates, primarily because adults can ride out the cold in sheltered places, Alfreðsson said. “This allows them to withstand long, harsh winters when temperatures drop below freezing.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the mosquito arrived in Iceland, but theories include the possibility it came via ships or containers. Further monitoring will be needed in the spring to see whether the species can survive the winter and “truly become established in Iceland,” Alfreðsson said.\n \n\n   \n  Mosquitoes, which tend to thrive in warmth and humidity, are likely to be  one of the few real winners  as the planet heats up.\n \n\n   \n  As climate change accelerates, bringing more heat, storms and floods, the range of these disease-carrying insects is increasing, according to a growing body of research. Rising temperatures also allow mosquitoes to grow faster and live longer.\n \n\n   \n  Iceland is no stranger to the impacts of climate change and has experienced record-breaking heat. In May, temperatures in parts of the country were  more than 18 degrees  Fahrenheit above normal. This extreme heat was made 40 times more likely by climate change, an  analysis  from the World Weather Attribution network found.\n \n\n   \n  But there are a still a lot of unknowns about how mosquitoes are behaving as the world warms and experts urge caution when it comes to linking Iceland’s discovery with global warming.\n \n\n   \n  Alfreðsson said he’s not sure climate change played a role in the discovery but “warming temperatures are likely to enhance the potential for other mosquito species to establish in Iceland, if they arrive.”\n \n\n   \n  Iceland may have been hospitable to these insects even in the absence of climate change, said Colin J. Carlson, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University School of Public Health. Mosquitoes have been found  quite far north  into Scandinavia, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Climate change may have made this more likely, but I’m not convinced it’s a clear, direct impact,” Carlson said. “The truth is, we just don’t know a lot about endemic mosquito range shifts that are already happening.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/israel-vance-trump-administration-ceasefire","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:17:00-04:00","title":"Vance downplays concerns over ceasefire in visit to Israel as Trump administration officials privately worry","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Vice President JD Vance downplayed concerns about the stability of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire during a visit to Israel, expressing optimism while avoiding setting hard deadlines for Hamas disarmament or the return of Israeli hostages.

   \n  By Alayna Treene, Eugenia Yosef, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:17 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance downplayed concerns about the fragility of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire while speaking in Israel on Tuesday, even as some Trump administration officials are privately concerned the deal could fall apart, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What we’ve seen the past week gives me great optimism the ceasefire is going to hold,” Vance said at a news conference, adding, “I feel very optimistic. Can I say with 100% certainty that it’s going to work? No.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance also declined to put a timeline on both the return of all Israeli hostage remains and Hamas’ disarmament, saying it will “take a little bit of time” and that security and humanitarian structures must be implemented in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “If Hamas doesn’t comply with the deal, very bad things are going to happen. But I’m not going to do what the president of United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s presence in the region is meant, at least in part, to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to the US-negotiated deal as some Trump administration officials worry he could work to thwart it.\n \n\n   \n  One US official characterized it as “Bibisitting.” Another framed it as a “show of force from the highest-ranking person after the president himself” to make the administration’s view clear that the ceasefire needs to be durable enough to “outlast inevitable skirmishes.”\n \n\n   \n  The sources added that the general belief among US officials involved in the negotiations is that the truce is most threatened in the short term, which is why the trip needed to happen so soon after  Trump’s visit  just last week.\n \n\n   \n  The concerns reached new heights after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack over the weekend that killed two IDF soldiers. Israel responded with waves of airstrikes that killed dozens of people in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  US officials worked to minimize the fallout of the strikes and ensure the ceasefire was not threatened, the sources said. And while Israel and Hamas each accused the other of violating the deal, both sides  ultimately reaffirmed  their commitment to the truce.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president said Tuesday that it is going to be a “constant effort” to “mediate these disagreements as they come up.” He asserted the trip “had nothing to do with events in the past 48 hours.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance was accompanied at the news conference by Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, the key US architects of the deal. The pair are in Israel this week as the administration begins to work on the longer-term goals of the president’s  20-point peace plan  for the region.\n \n\n   \n  While there, Witkoff told Israel the country’s response to violence from Hamas needs to be proportionate to the violation, according to an Israeli source familiar with the matter. Witkoff also emphasized that the next 30 days are crucial for the deal to hold and for talks to enter the second phase, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israelis, meanwhile, are ramping up pressure on the US to demilitarize Hamas before talks move on to the reconstruction phase, an Israeli official said.\n \n\n   \n  All of this comes as Trump himself has argued both privately and publicly that Sunday’s attack on IDF soldiers wasn’t the work of Hamas leaders but part of a “rebellion.” He has said that some members of Hamas “got very rambunctious,” but he believes the group is still committed to the truce and negotiations, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump did, however, threaten to have the group “eradicated” if ultimately necessary.\n \n\n   \n  The president wrote on social media Tuesday that “great allies” in and around the Middle East would “welcome the opportunity” to enter Gaza and “straighten [out] Hamas” if they continue to “act badly.”\n \n\n   \n  Trum﻿p said he told these unspecified countries “not yet,” as “there is still hope that Hamas will do what is right.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Aileen Graef contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/uk/virginia-giuffre-memoir-epstein-prince-andrew-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:39:00-04:00","title":"Virginia Giuffre raped by 'well-known Prime Minister,' US version of posthumous memoir claims","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring, published her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl' in October 2025, alleging she was raped and violently abused by a 'well-known Prime Minister'—later identified as Prince Andrew—while being trafficked by Epstein.

‘well-known Prime Minister,’ US version of posthumous memoir claims \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:39 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Virginia Giuffre , one of the most prominent victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, wrote in her posthumous memoir that she was brutally beaten and raped by an unidentified prime minister and that she feared she might “die a sex slave.”\n \n\n   \n  “In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people. I was habitually used and humiliated – and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied,” Giuffre wrote of Epstein and his circle. “I believed that I might die a sex slave.”\n \n\n   \n  Six months after her  death by suicide  in Australia, Giuffre’s memoir “Nobody’s Girl” was published Tuesday and contains harrowing details of the abuse she allegedly suffered as a teenager, and her years attempting to get justice for herself and her fellow victims.\n \n\n   \n  In the US version, Giuffre claims she was raped by a man whom she had “taken pains to describe in my legal filings only as a ‘well-known Prime Minister.’” In the UK version, the passages are almost identical but refer to the man as a “former minister.” It was not clear what accounted for the discrepancy.\n \n\n   \n  While on the sex offender’s Caribbean island, Giuffre described how Epstein “trafficked me to a man who raped me more savagely than anyone had before.” She wrote she was 18 at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “He repeatedly choked me until I lost consciousness and took pleasure in seeing me fear for my life. Horrifically, the Prime Minister laughed when he hurt me and got more aroused when I begged him to stop,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Afterward, I tearfully begged Epstein not to send me back to him,” Giuffre wrote. “I got down on my knees and pleaded with him. I don’t know if Epstein feared the man or if he owed him a favor, but he wouldn’t make any promises, saying coldly of the politician’s brutality, ‘You’ll get that sometimes.’”\n \n\n   \n  The memoir will intensify a transatlantic scandal over the proximity of the rich and powerful to Epstein, which has claimed political scalps in Britain and for months wracked Congress in the United States. Its publication will heap fresh scrutiny on Prince Andrew, the disgraced British royal accused by Giuffre of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager. Andrew, who’s King Charles’ brother, vehemently denies the accusations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Facing further public outrage over his relationship with Epstein,  Andrew  announced last week he had relinquished the use of his royal titles and would no longer be known as the  Duke of York , saying: “I have decided, as I always have, to put duty to my family and country first.” He will, however, retain the title of “prince,” since he is the son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n \n\n   \n  While Buckingham Palace would have hoped Andrew’s decision could mark the end of a scandal that has plagued the royal family for years, the latest revelations in Giuffre’s memoir will likely deepen the prince’s disgrace.\n \n\n   \n  Among those is Giuffre’s claim that Andrew’s “team” tried to hire online “trolls” to harangue her around the time she brought a civil case against the prince in New York. Giuffre alleged that, having been trafficked by Epstein, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17.\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions to settle the civil case in 2022. Writing of that settlement, Giuffre said: “After casting doubt on my credibility for so long – Prince Andrew’s team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me – the Duke of York owed me a meaningful apology as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The allegation that Andrew tried to hire trolls comes after the Mail on Sunday, a British paper, reported that Andrew in 2011  asked a police officer  assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on Giuffre. London’s Metropolitan Police said it was “actively looking into” the report.\n \n\n   \n  Another damaging report found that Andrew had kept up his friendship with Epstein two months after he insisted he had broken it off. In a disastrous 2019 BBC interview, in which Andrew’s attempt to clear his name backfired spectacularly, the prince insisted he had broken off his friendship with Epstein during a walk in New York’s Central Park in December 2010.\n \n\n   \n  Newly unearthed emails have contradicted that claim. The Mail on Sunday reported that, in February 2011, a day after the British press published an image of the prince with his arm around the teenage Giuffre, Andrew wrote to Epstein: “It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/government-shutdown-congress-federal-workers-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:48:00-04:00","title":"What’s happening to end the government shutdown?

Nothing \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:48 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democrats are talking to their voters who are desperate to fight. Republicans rarely reach beyond their base. And President Donald Trump, supposedly the world’s greatest dealmaker, is tuned out.\n \n\n   \n  This Washington stasis explains why no end is in sight to  a government shutdown  now tied for the second-longest ahead of Trump’s expected departure for Asia at the end of the week for summits. There’s no sign he’ll emulate his first predecessor, President Barack Obama, who canceled a tour of the region in 2013 because of a similar stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  “Plan B is open up the government,” Republican Senate Majority Leader  John Thune told CNN’s Manu Raju  on Tuesday, pledging to continue to pressure Democrats to accept a short-term House spending bill they’ve been blocking to try to force Republicans to extend expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  As Congress keeps doing the same thing, with the same inconclusive result, the costs of the partial closure of federal operations are escalating.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands of government workers are furloughed. The administration has fired  several thousand more . On Monday, most specialists who oversee the US nuclear stockpile at the National Nuclear Security Administration got  furlough notices . More  air traffic control staffing shortages  were reported over the weekend, in an ominous foreshadowing of potential travel crunches if the impasse drags on until Thanksgiving. And time is ticking down to the expiry of  critical nutrition support  for 42 million Americans next month.\n \n\n   \n  Significant pain is being inflicted on federal workers who have mortgages and car payments coming due and on millions of citizens who rely on the government. But it hasn’t yet reached leaders in both parties in sufficient volume to force them to seriously negotiate on a reopening. Three weeks in, neither side has moved beyond the first stage of shutdown politics — blaming the other.\n \n\n   \n    At some point, Democrats and Republicans will have to change tactics\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have succeeded in using the shutdown to create a platform for their demands for Republicans to agree to  extend the enhanced ACA subsidies , without which millions of policies will shoot up in price at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is day 20 of the Trump Republican shutdown and the government remains closed because Republicans have zero interest in actually providing affordable health care to everyday Americans,” House Democratic Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “That’s the challenge that the country faces right now.”\n \n\n   \n  But how do Democrats turn their success in elevating a key issue into a meaningful political victory? Republicans aren’t shifting an inch on their refusal to hold talks on Obamacare subsidies until the government is opened — thereby depriving Democrats of leverage. And calls by some House progressives for multiyear extensions of the subsidies before the standoff ends appear rather optimistic.\n \n\n   \n  Centrist Democratic senators, who might be looking for a way out, saw their position complicated this weekend by “ No Kings ” protests  targeting Trump . They can hardly reach a compromise that looks like caving to the president after an estimated 7 million people got off their couches on Saturday to blast him as a wannabe dictator.\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic attempts to split the usually deal-hungry Trump from Republicans in Congress have so far failed.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s the way out of it? Trump,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the podcast “The Checkup,” according to a transcript released by his office. But Democrats are proving less successful than  Russian President Vladimir Putin  at getting the commander in chief to change his mind. He’s expected to lunch with GOP senators at his new “Rose Garden Club” terrace at the White House on Tuesday in a show of GOP unity.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker told CNN on Tuesday that Trump was absent from discussions. “He’s getting ready to do another trip overseas to negotiate on foreign policy issues. What he should be doing is calling Democrats to the White House and negotiating with us,” Booker said. “The urgencies are growing. But where is the president? Why is he doing nothing? Why isn’t he sitting down with people? Why isn’t he understanding that there’s no Democrat or Republican way to do this? It’s only a bipartisan way,” Booker said.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, meanwhile, are enjoying their daily media appearances in which they slam Democrats for closing the government. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday kept his speechwriters busy finding new superlatives, accusing the opposition of pulling off the “most selfish, most dangerous political stunt in the history of the United States Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson is no closer to solving the GOP’s own conundrum. How does the party in power escape blame for huge hikes in Obamacare premiums if the subsidies expire? That tough reality explains why Democrats believe Trump, already blamed for  massive Medicaid cuts , may eventually fold. And Republicans do understand the political threat. At the weekend, they twinned their willingness to talk about a solution — if the government reopens — with a call to reshape the 15-year-old health-care law, even though they’ve never proposed a viable replacement.\n \n\n   \n  “I have said that I’m absolutely open to having conversation, but we’re not going to extend a program that is wrought with fraud, waste and abuse,” Alabama Sen. Katie Britt told Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. “Our health care system is broken, the system that they put in place,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  This will only make Democrats more wary of a deal. Reform of the ACA sounds a lot like a fresh attempt by the GOP to finally kill a law the party has been trying to eradicate since it was an idea in the 44th president’s first campaign.\n \n\n   \n    Where is the House?\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of any serious discussions to end the shutdown, political games are escalating on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson is keeping the House dark, arguing that his members did their job by voting last month to temporarily fund the government, apparently ignoring all the other duties of the people’s representatives. “I refuse to allow us to come back and engage in anything until the government’s reopened,” the speaker said Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.”\n \n\n   \n  One reason Johnson might not want his members in town is they could spoil his attempt to stifle dissent after complaints about the shutdown spilled out from  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  and others. He’s also refusing to swear in  new Democratic member Adelita Grijalva , who has pledged the deciding signature to force a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, until the House fully returns to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are meanwhile arguing that as terrible as the shutdown is, they are alleviating even greater misery by fighting to extend health care subsidies. In an odd way, the extreme realities of life in Trump’s Washington might be mitigating some of the political duress that usually boils up to end shutdowns. Furloughs of federal workers don’t seem so extreme after thousands were already fired in Trump’s federal government purge. And at a turbulent moment when Trump is trying to  send troops into cities  and posting bizarre AI videos, the rituals of a government shutdown seem routine by comparison.\n \n\n   \n  In a futile and now-familiar dance unlikely to be noticed much outside the Senate chamber, Thune held a vote to pass a stopgap funding bill to reopen the government Monday evening. But Democrats stood firm for the 11th time, depriving the measure of the 60 votes needed to break the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  Thune may also bring up a bill this week to pay essential workers required to show up during the shutdown. The move might put Democrats in a tough spot. But they are likely to oppose any move that would allow Trump to pick and choose which workers get salaries. And in a signal that not all Republicans are on board with their leader’s strategy shift, Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville argued Tuesday that the bill could alleviate incentives to end the crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has already announced that his administration has shuffled existing funds to paying military personnel and FBI officers, two of the few categories of government workers about whom he seems to care.\n \n\n   \n  His move lifted one of the usual sources of political heat that usually end up solving shutdowns. None of the others are working either.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/tourism-shutdown-national-park-smithsonians","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00Z","title":"Tourism and Safety Concerns Mount Amid Government Shutdown in National Parks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During an ongoing government shutdown, national parks such as Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and those in West Virginia continue to operate with limited staffing, leading to concerns over safety, illegal activities, and environmental degradation.

businesses warn about long-term impact of shutdown \n       \n  By Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:19 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown didn’t deter 26-year-old Nudrat Mahajabin from visiting Grand Canyon National Park earlier this month, even though the signs were clear: No entrance fees would be collected, the visitors’ center was closed and no park rangers were nearby.\n \n\n   \n  “We had planned this trip a while back. So, there was really no going back,” she said. “I feel like a shutdown might not close the gates, but it does affect and impact the caretakers. And I guess that’s what worries me the most.”\n \n\n   \n  While many tourists like Mahajabin are yet to be discouraged by the government shutdown, national park advocates and businesses are worried about the safety of national parks and tourism’s impact on the local economies that surround them if the congressional stalemate continues.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown, which congressional leaders do not appear close to resolving, has meant tourist destinations like the Smithsonian museums in DC are closed and 9,000 National Park Service employees are furloughed, impacting the operations of the parks. The Department of Interior is keeping many national parks partially open amid the shutdown, and some sites have gotten a boost from state funds.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, where tourists typically flock for hiking, white water rafting and spotting fall foliage, New River Gorge National Park and Harpers Ferry National Historical Park are staying open using state funds because of an agreement made with the Department of Interior.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s Republican governor, Patrick Morrisey, said last week that West Virginia would keep the parks fully running through October 18 for Bridge Day, a festival where onlookers gather to see jumpers parachute off the New River Gorge Bridge.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that tourism is huge for West Virginia, bringing in billions and billions of dollars every year,” he said. “So, this was not the time to be shut down.”\n \n\n   \n  Some business owners near national parks say they have yet to take a hit, while others say they’re bracing for bigger impacts down the road if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Rob Dobson, the owner of West Virginia Adventures near the New River Gorge National Park, told CNN he’s not expecting a drop in reservations for white water rafting trips or cabin stays this fall.\n \n\n   \n  “This shutdown has had zero effect on us. We are open for business,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Elisabeth Barton, general manager of Echo Adventure Cooperative, a guide service in Groveland, California, told CNN that with no one collecting fees at the entrances to Yosemite, the business is “having a much busier October than we would normally have.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, where business leaders are worried the shutdown may deter tourists from traveling to the nation’s capital, the shutdown has been a boon for some private museums, which have seen a rise in visitors since the Smithsonian Institute was forced to  close its museums  and the National Zoo on October 12.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Mount Vernon, the nearby home of George Washington, said the estate has seen 50% more visitors than during the first two weeks of October last year and has been averaging 100 phone calls per day. The National Law Enforcement Museum and the International Spy Museum, both private museums, also told CNN they are already seeing an uptick in visitors.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether tourism overall in DC has taken a hit, nearly three weeks into the government shutdown. In the first nine days of the shutdown, total ridership on DC’s trains and buses was higher than the same period last year, according to a CNN review of  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s data  on daily train station entries and bus boardings.\n \n\n   \n    Concerns about long-term impact of the shutdown\n \n\n   \n  Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, a non-profit marketing group that promotes the nation’s capital, also warned of the shutdown’s economic impact on the city, which  lost about $47.4 million  in revenue during the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything from the small mom-and-pop sandwich shops to the larger entities are impacted by the shutdown,” Ferguson told CNN. “We are in the prime months and weeks for convention business and tourism. So, the impact is significant.”\n \n\n   \n  And at the national parks, which have limited staffing, advocates are warning about the consequences of staying open – there are no rangers at the park entrances to collect entrance fees, and there may be delays in law enforcement and emergency responses.\n \n\n   \n  With the absence of park rangers and other Park Service employees in Yosemite, Barton, the business owner, said the park is getting a “weird contingent of folks who have a need for unfettered access, who think ‘I can do anything I want.’”\n \n\n   \n  She said there have been instances of “people being frustrated, easily tuned-up.” Her guides have witnessed people flying drones, which are generally banned in national parks. When her guides approached the operators and told them it was prohibited, she said many became hostile. She said that people are also base jumping — leaping from structures and using a parachute to descend to the ground — which is illegal.\n \n\n   \n  With these concerns in mind, the National Parks Conservation Association is asking national parks to close.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors “might be able to access beautiful places, but they’re not going to have the full experience that they’re used to at national parks. And that also means that people are not going to be getting some of the fundamental guidance,” David Lamfrom, the vice president of regional programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, told CNN, adding that staff reductions could impact safety and search-and-rescue operations.\n \n\n   \n  Emily Thompson, the executive director of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, is concerned about the safety of the parks with limited staff.\n \n\n   \n  “Park rangers and Park Service employees do so much at parks regarding safety and preventative messaging,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Thompson’s group has already received reports of trash piling up in some national parks, an issue that arose in previous shutdowns, notably in 2018. One park ranger told CNN that as the shutdown goes on, they are increasingly worried about vandalism and trash buildup, which could create a backlog of work when the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  In Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park, staff and volunteers from the YMCA of the Rockies are gathering to clean up trash left behind on hikes.\n \n\n   \n  “My hope in all this is that people are leaning in,” said Jason Nelson, the group’s communication’s director. “We don’t know how long this government shutdown is going to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Interior Department told CNN earlier this month that “critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, some local businesses near national parks say they are doing OK but are watching closely for impacts to their business and their communities if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Eddie Love, who runs Mountain Mama vacation cabins with his wife in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, told CNN bookings are down 30%, and that anecdotally, at least one person canceled because they had been furloughed due to the shutdown. While his business will be OK, fewer visitors could harm the shops in the downtown area, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  “October is usually a pretty strong month for us,” he said. “We’ll be OK even if the shutdown continues, but I know there are lots of other businesses that are a little more on the margin and might have a harder time making ends meet if it dragged on.”\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, William Torres, the owner of DC Trails — a tour bus company — told CNN the government shutdown is not a big concern “at the moment.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it keeps going and it goes on, you know, past November and into the Thanksgiving season, then it could probably affect me some,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/marine-corps-artillery-155-mishap","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:05:00-04:00","title":"Marine Corps Artillery Mishap Part of Unusual Firing Over Highway","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a 250th-anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the US Marine Corps conducted a live-fire demonstration using 155mm artillery shells fired over the I-5 interstate highway, a route not used since the 1950s.

Marine Corps artillery mishap part of unusual firing over highway \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:05 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Marine Corps is no stranger to firing live ordnance as part of training, but it had been years — more than 70, according to one US official — since Marines had fired artillery over a stretch of the I-5 interstate in California like troops did last weekend during the Corps’ 250th birthday celebration.\n \n\n   \n  The very first shell fired as part of the demonstration exploded on Saturday over the interstate, stretches of which  serve as the busiest highway in America , dropping at least one shell fragment on a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser. The celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The Marine Corps is currently investigating what went wrong with the round, a 155mm artillery shell that had been fired by an M777 Howitzer. The day before Marines had successfully fired more than two dozen shells from the same batch of artillery, according to the official, lending more questions as to what happened on Saturday and why.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported there were no injuries from the incident, which the California Highway Patrol Border Division Chief Tony Coronado called “an unusual and concerning situation.”\n \n\n   \n  The Marine Corps did not respond to questions about who made the decision to fire over I-5, when the last time was that the Marine Corps fired artillery over the interstate, or if there were broader concerns regarding the artillery batch the shell that prematurely detonated came from.\n \n\n   \n  The US has been rapidly increasing its production of the 155 mm shells, more than  tripling production since 2022  up to 40,000 rounds per month that has included opening new production facilities as part of $5.5 billion in US investment in manufacturing the munitions. The driver of that surge in production has been Ukraine’s need for the shells in its protracted war repelling Russian forces, with the US already having sent  more than 3 million 155 mm rounds  to the country since the start of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  California’s Gov. Gavin Newsom, in an escalating spat with the White House over the safety of Saturday’s demonstration, had closed the interstate ahead of the exercise, which involved firing artillery from a beach area over the highway onto land that is part of the Camp Pendleton military facility.\n \n\n   \n  After Newsom had described plans to fire shells over the highway as “dangerous” and said he was making the decision to close the highway, a spokesman for Vance had told CNN that the showcase was “an established safe practice.”\n \n\n   \n  Live-fire exercises, where real ordnance is used for training, are a common occurrence for US military units around the country. However, the specific route planned for the shells on Saturday hadn’t been used since before I-5 became an interstate in the 1950s, according to the US official.\n \n\n   \n  “Firing from the beach, firing over I-5, in theory shouldn’t have been a problem,” Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel who served as an artillery officer and who is currently a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The shells were high when they went over I-5 and that’s why the Marine Corps apparently said shutting down the highway was not necessary because in theory, they’d be so high they wouldn’t interfere with anyone below,” he said. “And for some reason one of them went off prematurely.”\n \n\n   \n  The batch of artillery shells used during the demonstration has likely been frozen and will not be used again until the Marines further clarify what happened, Cancian said.\n \n\n   \n  A  2024 Reuters investigation  of artillery production found some issues with manufacturing lines of the munitions, including cracked shells in Iowa that shut down a production line further delaying their delivery, and a US decision to change the kind of explosive used in the shell.\n \n\n   \n  Years before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US decided to move away from using TNT inside the shell to an explosive believed to be “less vulnerable to detonation by accident,” the Reuters report said.\n \n\n   \n   The Army confirmed to Reuters it reversed course and began using TNT once again after the war began, due to cost efficiency needs and to increase the production rate.\n \n\n   \n  The military services often try to put together a compelling showcase when important leaders make a visit to a military facility, Cancian said.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that when a VIP shows up you do something special for them is totally normal,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  What is abnormal, he added, is that the shell detonated prematurely. The 155 shells, Cancian explained, weigh roughly 95 pounds – the majority of that weight due to the shell itself, and only 15 pounds of it attributed to the actual explosive. When the shell explodes, the metal casing is meant to splinter into tiny fragments in an effort to inflict more casualties on a battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  A photo of one of those fragments on a patrol car was shared in a press release by the California Highway Patrol, which said shrapnel struck and damaged a patrol vehicle. Cancian emphasized that the patrol car was not “hit” by an artillery shell but rather struck by fragments of the shell which exploded far overhead, slowing down as they fell through the air before landing on the patrol car.\n \n\n   \n  “It went off very high, and the shell fragments came down to the ground, didn’t look like they were going very fast,” he said, adding that “obviously that should not have happened.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/us/chicago-suv-ramming-case-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:26:00Z","title":"Federal vehicle in Chicago ramming case may have had repairs before defense looked at it.

Federal vehicle in Chicago ramming case may have had repairs before defense looked at it. Can the court do anything about it? \n       \n  By Andy Rose, Bill Kirkos, Andi Babineau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:26 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Thursday was supposed to be a day of no surprises for Marimar Martinez, the woman who was shot after allegedly  ramming the car  of a Border Patrol agent she had been following. She was headed to a routine court hearing.\n \n\n   \n  But earlier that day, defense attorney Christopher Parente learned a piece of evidence that may be critical to the case was no longer in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “I was informed about two hours before the hearing that the agent’s vehicle was gone,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Gone,” as it turned out, was more than 1,000 miles away. Department of Justice attorney Aaron Bond said in court the agent was told he could take it back to his home in Maine.\n \n\n   \n  Parente said he was concerned moving the vehicle so far away could leave it open to being altered, and his concern seemed justified in another hearing four days later.\n \n\n   \n  A government attorney said some repairs may have been “processed or at least approved,” but couldn’t say whether any work had actually been done.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Georgia Alexakis was “troubled by what I’m hearing in terms of the repair work in particular,” the  Biden appointee  said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While the government has accounted for the missing SUV, Parente says there are more questions to answer when it comes to the where, the how and the why of the SUV’s long journey.\n \n\n   \n    Vehicle’s condition is critical to defense, attorney says\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, and her co-defendant, Anthony Ruiz – who was driving a different vehicle – both entered not guilty pleas to a federal charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers. They are accused of “aggressively and erratically” following and then ramming a Border Patrol vehicle on October 4 as it was on security detail on Chicago streets.\n \n\n   \n  The incident took place as Chicago became one of the epicenters for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, with regular  protests  at a suburban ICE facility and dramatic  raids  and  patrols  in the heart of the Windy City.\n \n\n   \n  Both Martinez and Ruiz left the scene of the crash, prosecutors say, although Parente  said  his client drove “to a safe place where she pulled over and called 911” to report the shooting. She was treated at a hospital for gunshot wounds and released.\n \n\n   \n  They have not denied they were closely tailing the Border Patrol vehicle through Chicago streets. But Parente says Martinez, who was shot five times after the crash, did not cause the wreck, arguing the agent was the person who actually initiated the contact by sideswiping his client, making the condition of his vehicle crucial to her defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The cars are the big issue,” Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  The Border Patrol agent is expected to testify about his actions related to the vehicle at a November 6 status hearing. A trial for Martinez is set to start in February.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance video  obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times  shows the vehicles of Martinez and Ruiz following closely on the sides of the government SUV before the incident, but the only known video of the crash itself comes from a body-worn camera.\n \n\n   \n  Parente, who has seen the bodycam video but is not allowed to share it under a court order,  told CNN  it shows the agent behind the wheel turning into his client’s vehicle, with one  agent  heard saying “Do something, b*tch” before shots were fired.\n \n\n   \n  He also said the government has put out misleading information on Martinez. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said  in a news release  Martinez was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” But Parente  told  CNN his client is a licensed gun owner and had a handgun in her purse but never brandished it. The criminal complaint against her doesn’t mention she had a firearm.\n \n\n   \n  At some point after the crash, the agent, who has not been publicly named, was allowed to return home to Maine with the SUV because it was his “personal vehicle,” Bond told the court last week. It was not clear if Customs and Border Protection had consulted with prosecutors before giving that permission, Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  The  criminal complaint  stated the vehicle is owned by CBP, not the agent. CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and asking for clarification on how the agent is connected to the SUV. Through a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office, Bond declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  At the Monday hearing, Assistant US Attorney Ronald DeWald said the agent took the vehicle to a secured parking area of a CBP station in Maine.\n \n\n   \n    Can the judge punish the government for moving the SUV?\n \n\n   \n  As Martinez’s and Ruiz’s vehicles remain impounded in an FBI garage, Alexakis told the government to return the SUV to Chicago. No alteration is allowed – not even a car wash – before the defense gets a look. And this time, it will be making the journey on the back of a flatbed tow truck.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a reasonable request,” said Alexakis. “There’s only so much you can tell from photos.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Parente told the judge he couldn’t believe a key piece of evidence had been removed from the state by one of the main figures in the case.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not just the driver, this is the shooter,” Parente said incredulously in court.\n \n\n   \n  Parente isn’t the only attorney who was amazed the government’s Chevy Tahoe was allowed to leave the state. Patrick Griffin, a San Diego lawyer who has been a defense attorney in criminal cases involving Border Patrol vehicles, said the defense has a right to get access to the SUV.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not some novel concept. This is as basic as it gets,” Griffin told CNN. “It’s 101 that the vehicle needs to be maintained and needs to be able to be examined by the defense.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Alexakis agreed the car should be returned, Griffin says there is a high bar before the government can be punished for allowing the car to be taken away.\n \n\n   \n  In the  1984 Supreme Court decision  California v. Trombetta, justices said prosecutors are not required to preserve evidence unless they have a reason to believe it could help the defendant.\n \n\n   \n  “If it’s just not obvious that the evidence would be exculpatory, then you must show bad faith,” said Griffin.\n \n\n   \n  Even then, the Supreme Court said, it may not matter if the defense has other evidence that can still prove innocence.\n \n\n   \n  Parente, said he had asked the court to order DHS “to preserve and maintain any and all records, emails, text messages, documents, notes and other materials related to” the Martinez case.\n \n\n   \n  While Parente has focused in court on the physical condition of the SUV’s exterior, the most important piece of evidence is probably inside the Tahoe. Most vehicles now have an event data recorder – the EDR – that is similar to an airplane’s “black box.”\n \n\n   \n  “It can show all the data that leads up to a crash,” said Griffin. “Did the person swerve? Did they hit the brakes? What was the speed? And this is really just fundamental evidence that is necessary to determine what happened.”\n \n\n   \n    ICE detainees and officials have been suddenly moved\n \n\n   \n  It is not the first time concern has been raised about important elements in a Department of Homeland Security-related case being quickly moved from one state to another – although it usually involves people rather than physical evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple people who have been arrested in immigration cases this year – including  Mahmoud Khalil ,  Badar Khan Suri  and  Rümeysa Öztürk  – were quickly moved hundreds of miles away to remote detention facilities shortly after being taken into custody, frustrating the efforts of their families and attorneys to gain their freedom.\n \n\n   \n  Last week,  Arthur Berto , a 13-year-old boy who was taken by ICE after an arrest for allegedly threatening another student at school, was transferred to a juvenile facility in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The Massachusetts-based federal judge in that case ruled he didn’t have the authority to decide whether Berto should be freed because the child had crossed the Massachusetts border an hour before his family’s petition was filed. Defense attorney Andrew Lattarulo told CNN last week he was still working to find an attorney in Virginia to represent his client.\n \n\n   \n  Even ICE officials have sometimes been difficult to track down.\n \n\n   \n  In a  separate case  in Chicago challenging federal agents’ use of riot control munitions and tear gas against protesters and journalists, Judge Sara Ellis asked an ICE interim field director to testify in court and explain why an order she issued appeared to be ignored.\n \n\n   \n  But the government  announced  one business day before the Monday hearing the official  had been reassigned to Washington, DC, and  other officials  would have to testify in his place.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis said she would accept the last-minute substitution as long as those officials can answer her questions.\n \n\n   \n  But until the defense team actually gets a look at the vehicle and if anything has changed in the 2,000-mile round trip, legal experts say it’s not clear whether the Trump administration will be punished for allowing it to be moved.\n \n\n   \n  “The question arises whether the car will have been altered in a material way,” said Richard Friedman, a University of Michigan law professor who has written  books  on the rules of evidence. “If they haven’t done anything to the car, then maybe ‘no harm, no foul’ if they bring it back.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether rules of evidence were actually broken or not, Martinez’s attorney says it should raise concern.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a case involving the Border Patrol shooting of a US citizen in broad daylight and lack of integrity in this investigation is alarming,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/media/warner-bros-wbd-sale-paramount-skydance-suitors","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:58:00-04:00","title":"Warner Bros.

up to a Colorado dentist poisoning his wife’s protein shakes \n       \n  By Melissa Gray, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:53 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former Colorado dentist  James Craig  was convicted of murder Wednesday after a trial that lasted nearly two weeks, found guilty of killing his wife and the mother of their six children by poisoning her protein shakes.\n \n\n   \n  Angela Craig was 43 when she died in 2023, by which point she’d been hospitalized three times in 10 days with symptoms no one could initially explain. A coroner’s report later said her  cause of death  was acute cyanide and tetrahydrozoline poisoning, with subacute arsenic poisoning listed as a significant condition.\n \n\n   \n  Police  arrested  Craig for first-degree murder on March 19, 2023, hours after his wife was taken off life support. Prosecutors  added more charges against  him earlier this year, alleging he plotted to kill four people from behind bars while awaiting trial.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned about the events in Angela Craig’s final weeks.\n \n\n   \n   Late 2022-February 2023 : Three women meet James Craig on  seeking.com , a dating website, they separately testify. Each woman said their relationship with Craig evolves into a romantic one, with him providing monetary gifts. One woman testifies Craig bought a car for her daughter, while another said she received about $8,000 from him, mostly through Venmo transactions.\n \n\n   \n  One woman recalled a conversation with Craig about “The Purge,” a fictional horror movie about a short period of time when all violent crime, including murder, is legal. Craig said he would “purge” his wife if that were reality, she testified.\n \n\n   \n   February 22-25, 2023:  James Craig attends a dental conference in Las Vegas where he meets Karin Cain, a Texas dentist going through a divorce, prosecutor Ryan Brackley said in his opening statement. The two begin a relationship and discuss seeing each other again.\n \n\n   \n   Monday, February 27:  Craig creates a new email account with the handle “jimandwaffles” using a computer in an exam room at his Aurora dental practice, according to a probable cause affidavit. The Gmail address was used to conduct searches on arsenic and undetectable poisons,   order arsenic on Amazon and make arrangements for Cain to travel to Denver, the affidavit says.\n \n\n   \n   February 28:  Search queries for “how to make murder look like a heart attack” and “a dosage of tetrahydrozoline that is fatal” are in the search history on this day for the “jimandwaffles” account, according to a forensic exam of the computer from exam room 9 at Craig’s dental practice, testified Molly Harris, an Aurora Police detective with the Major Crimes Homicide Unit.\n \n\n   \n   March 1:  Angela Craig visits family in Utah and attends a genealogy conference with one of her sisters, Brackley said. It was a shared hobby, he said.\n \n\n   \n  When Angela Craig leaves for her trip, Craig texts Cain: “Maybe she will decide to stay gone for a long time,” according to the prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  A search for “how long does it take to die from arsenic poisoning?” is found in the search history of the computer from exam room 9, Harris says.\n \n\n   \n   March 4:  The arsenic order is delivered to the Craigs’ house, according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n   March 5:  Angela Craig returns home from Utah, the affidavit says.\n \n\n   \n    First hospital visit\n \n\n   \n   Monday, March 6:  After waking up, Angela drinks a protein shake her husband made for her; Brackley said the couple often made them for each other. She works out but starts to feel “strange.” She texts her husband, “My stomach feels fine, but my head feels funny and dizzy. Very strange.”\n \n\n   \n  James misses the daily 6:45 a.m. staff “huddle” at his dental office and arrives closer to 7 a.m., when the practice opens, according to testimony from office manager Caitlin Romero. He apologized and said his wife wasn’t feeling well, possibly because he had put too much protein powder in the shake he’d given her. He works for a couple of hours but then leaves to take Angela to the hospital, Romero testified.\n \n\n   \n  At the emergency room of AdventHealth Parker Hospital, Angela has tests including an MRI, CT scan and bloodwork, but she is sent home after nothing is found, Brackley said.\n \n\n   \n  James Craig texts Cain that his wife is at the hospital and says, “Just for the record, I will never drug you.”\n \n\n   \n  He returns to the practice that evening after business hours, according to Romero, who said she frequently stayed there late. Craig said he wanted to be alone and came back “just to get away for a minute.” Romero said his office lights were off when she was leaving and she thought he’d left again, so she was “startled” to see him working on a computer in one of the exam rooms with the lights off. She testified that while on her drive home, she received a text from Craig saying he’d be receiving a personal package at work and not to open it.\n \n\n   \n  Craig orders oleandrin from Adooq Bioscience, according to the probable cause affidavit. The compound had come up when Craig had searched lists of the world’s deadliest plants, Brackley said. Detectives intercepted the package before it could be delivered.\n \n\n   \n  There were searches found on the exam 9 room computer on this day for “visine” and “tetrahydrozoline poisoning timeline,” according to Harris.\n \n\n   \n   March 7 : Angela still feels sick and goes to an urgent care clinic but is sent home without a diagnosis, Brackley said.\n \n\n   \n   March 8 : James Craig orders potassium cyanide from Midland Scientific, according to the affidavit. He notes in the order: “Hopefully this is in stock and I can come pick it up tomorrow, March 9.”\n \n\n   \n  At 10:50 p.m., a credit card belonging to James Craig is used to purchase 12 packages of eyedrops from a King Soopers store in Aurora, according to testimony from a company representative. Tetrahydrozoline – a medication commonly found in eyedrops – was one of the poisons Craig used to kill his wife.\n \n\n   \n    Second hospital visit\n \n\n   \n   Thursday, March 9 : Angela Craig drinks a protein shake in the morning and her symptoms worsen, Brackley said. “There’s a moment on March 9 where her kids find her passed out, fainted,” he said in his opening statement. “There’s a moment on March 9 where she crawls across the floor because she can’t get up, and she goes back to the hospital.” She is admitted to AdventHealth Parker hospital and James Craig arrives. She will remain at the hospital until March 14.\n \n\n   \n  A sample of Angela Craig’s blood taken at 11:24 a.m. showed a high and toxic level of arsenic, according to testimony from Dr. James Brower, a forensic toxicologist with NMS Laboratories, which did the testing after she died. The level in her blood was 330 micrograms per milliliter, he said, an amount that causes gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, lightheadedness and a feeling of being uncoordinated.\n \n\n   \n  James Craig receives an order acknowledgement from Midland Scientific for the potassium cyanide, according to the affidavit. He’s told it is not in stock, but the company can overnight it to him. An employee then contacts him about additional documentation the product screening team requires for the order. Craig says he is a surgeon performing a craniofacial reconstruction and hopes to publish the results of using potassium cyanide for the procedure in a paper for the National Institutes of Health.\n \n\n   \n  The employee reaches out again and says because James Craig is a new customer, the supplier needs an additional day to establish him in their system and process the order.\n \n\n   \n  That night, at 10:16 p.m., seven packages of Visine eyedrops are purchased from the same King Soopers store as the day before, using James Craig’s credit card, the company’s representative testified.\n \n\n   \n   March 10:  James Craig contacts Midland Scientific to ask about the potassium cyanide shipment and is told it will arrive the next day, according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n   March 11 : James contacts Midland Scientific to ask about the shipment, saying it’s 7:30 p.m. and he has waited all day for it at his office, the affidavit says. It is a Saturday. He doesn’t receive an immediate response.\n \n\n   \n   March 13 : The potassium cyanide is delivered to James Craig’s office, but another employee, unaware of Craig’s instructions to Romero, opens it. Romero testified the employee handed her a silver foil package with a folded invoice from the box it was delivered in. The box was addressed to “Jim Craig – Personal” and had biohazard stickers on it. She looked at the packing slip and saw it was potassium cyanide. Romero put the items back in the box and placed it on Craig’s desk, but said she looked up potassium cyanide online because she’d never seen it delivered to the office before and was unfamiliar with what it was.\n \n\n   \n   March 14 : Angela is discharged from the hospital. Within an hour of returning home, she starts searching online for the possible causes of her symptoms, Brackley said.\n \n\n   \n  That evening, video from the Craigs’ kitchen security camera shows James making a protein shake for his wife.\n \n\n   \n    Third hospital visit and death\n \n\n   \n   Wednesday, March 15 : At 9:35 a.m., James Craig texts Angela’s sister to make sure she gives Angela a prescription. Brackley said Angela had been on medication (clindamycin) for a sinus infection and Craig had emptied one of the capsules and refilled it with potassium cyanide. Her sister gave her the pill.\n \n\n   \n  At 11:08 a.m., Angela Craig goes to UCHealth Anschutz with severe headache and dizziness, accompanied by her brother. James Craig arrives later. At 2 p.m., she suffers a seizure and rapid decline and is placed on life support in the ICU.\n \n\n   \n  A sample taken from Angela Craig at 11:50 a.m. showed high levels of arsenic, cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, Brower testified.\n \n\n   \n  The amount of arsenic was less than on March 9 but showed she’d been exposed to arsenic again, he said. She also had a level of cyanide that could have only come from ingestion or exposure, Brower said. The chemical can cause similar symptoms to arsenic, and eventually it results in organ failure, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The same sample showed Angela Craig also had a lethal amount of tetrahydrozoline in her blood that could have come only from ingesting it, Brower said. The concentration indicates it came from “a bottle or more” of eyedrops, he said. When consumed orally, the substance can cause a person’s heart to stop beating, he said.\n \n\n   \n  James Craig calls Caitlin Romero and says he doesn’t think Angela will make it through the night. She testified this was the second time he’d made that comment; she believes the first comment came on March 9, when Angela went to the hospital for the second time.\n \n\n   \n  Romero leaves the office around 3 p.m. and calls Jacqueline Calderon, the office manager of an affiliated dental practice, telling her about the potassium cyanide delivery and how Angela’s symptoms, as described by James Craig, lined up with poisoning symptoms she had found online. She testifies she didn’t mention her concerns on the 13th “because thinking that somebody was capable of possibly poisoning somebody else — it was not something that I was taking lightly.” Romero then speaks with Craig’s business partner, Dr. Ryan Redfearn, and his wife about the potassium cyanide.\n \n\n   \n  Redfearn and his wife visit the hospital where Angela is staying, the affidavit says. They speak briefly to James Craig, who steps away for a phone call. While he’s on the phone, Redfearn pulls a nurse away and tells the nurse about his concerns that Angela may have been poisoned with potassium cyanide.\n \n\n   \n  A blood sample taken from Angela Craig at 8:21 p.m. shows an even higher level of cyanide than in the morning blood sample — 3.7 micrograms per milliliter, compared to 1.7 earlier in the day, Brower said. It “looks like there had to have been a second administration of cyanide in the hospital,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   March 16 :  Karin Cain  visits Denver, a flight itinerary shows. Police speak with the Redfearns.\n \n\n   \n   March 18 : Angela Craig is pronounced brain dead at 4:29 p.m.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andi Babineau and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/food/coca-cola-cane-sugar-launch","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:18:00-04:00","title":"Coca-Cola’s Trump-approved soda begins to roll out in the United States","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Coca-Cola has launched a new soda in the U.S. using cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, following a demand from President Donald Trump.

Danaher and Camille Knight, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:51 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sunday’s audacious heist  saw thieves  break into the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery and make off with jewelry of “inestimable” value. The suspects carried out the burglary in just seven minutes, France’s interior minister Laurent Nuñez told radio station France Inter.\n \n\n   \n  French media reported that thieves had attempted to steal the crown of Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, but the crown was found outside the Louvre, according to French culture minister Rachida Dati. The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.\n \n\n   \n  The robbery, which prompted the swift evacuation of visitors and the museum’s closure for the rest of the day, is only the latest in a series of troubles to befall the venerable institution.\n \n\n   \n  A Court of Auditors report obtained by Franceinfo and covering the period between 2019 to 2024 noted a “persistent delay” in updating security systems at the Louvre. The report also identified “operational implementation” of security device renovations as an issue, stating that it appeared they were “uneven and generally very limited.”\n \n\n   \n  “The obsolescence cycle of the museum’s technical equipment has accelerated more significantly than the pace of investment made by the institution to address it,” the report concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Built in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace was the official residence of the kings of France for centuries. King Louis XIV’s decision to move his court to Versailles, on the outskirts of the French capital, allowed for the establishment of the Louvre Museum in 1793. Since then, it has become the most visited museum in the world and a cultural highlight of any stay in Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, with tourists from the United States making up 13% of all guests, second only to the French. But the large crowds entering through the museum’s doors each day have put a strain on the centuries-old building – and its staff.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, French newspaper  Le Parisien  reported on a confidential letter sent from the president of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, to Culture Minister Rachida Dati warning of the dilapidated state of one of Europe’s top attractions.\n \n\n   \n  In the memo, dated January 23 and confirmed to CNN by the Louvre, des Cars requested urgent help to address a slew of issues affecting the museum. She warned of an increase in damage to the museum’s spaces, with some areas becoming “very deteriorated.”\n \n\n   \n  Problems included water leaks, overcrowding, and worrying temperature fluctuations which threatened to “endanger the conservation of works of art,” the memo detailed.\n \n\n   \n  The museum president cautioned that the Louvre was offering “insufficient” services to the public due to overcrowding, with food services and restrooms “well below international standards” in number.\n \n\n   \n  “Visiting the Louvre constitutes a physical ordeal; reaching the artworks takes time and is not always easy,” the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors often flock to the Salle des États to see one of the most famous artworks in the museum, if not the world, Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.” But the museum president called for the placement of the artwork to be reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  French President Emmanuel Macron announced later that month that the “Mona Lisa” would get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre as part of major renovation plans. The expansion of the Parisian landmark is expected to take up to 10 years.\n \n\n   \n  Just six months later, in June, the museum closed its doors for a day as workers there went on strike, complaining of unmanageable crowds, understaffing and poor working conditions in a building unable to handle its current popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s brazen daylight robbery was also not the first instance of theft to beset the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Most famously, the jewel in the Louvre’s crown, the “Mona Lisa,”  was stolen in 1911  by Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia. Having slipped the painting under his clothing, Peruggia escaped the building undetected and wasn’t caught for two years. The public became fascinated by the two-year manhunt, with the daring burglary catapulting the “Mona Lisa” from a relatively unknown work to a world-renowned icon.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, two pieces of  16th-century armor  were returned to the Louvre Museum almost 40 years after they were stolen. The Renaissance-era helmet and body armor were on display in the Louvre when they were stolen overnight from May 31 to June 1, 1983. It wasn’t until March 2021 that the stolen artefacts were returned to the museum.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94389","dateOfPublication":"2023-11-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00+00:00","title":"Rising Human Rights Concerns in Immigration Detention Centers","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article highlights growing concerns about human rights violations in immigration detention centers, particularly in the context of increased asylum applications.

Here's what that means across the country \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 2:43 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It's Day 22 of the federal government shutdown, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it. Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid this Friday, the first full paycheck they'll miss as a result of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but  the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. Meanwhile, President Trump has tied the shutdown to his overall goal of shrinking the size of the government, laying off workers en masse while it continues — and promising more — while specifically targeting what he calls \"Democrat programs.\"  Read the latest on a case brought by some fired federal workers to pause the latest wave of shutdown layoffs. As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down?   A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.   Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer.  NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.  In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.  Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here.   Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR Will the military get paid on Oct. 29?    The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members , according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck, but it only covered one pay cycle. That was on Oct. 15; troops get paid every other Wednesday.  Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month.  Some workers are fighting back in court ; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees. Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order    What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? Tens of millions of people are at risk of losing food and nutrition aid if the shutdown continues into November. That includes nearly 42 million who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will  run out of money Nov. 1 . In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits \"until further notice\" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift  money from its contingency fund and other places  to keep SNAP at least partially funded. Meanwhile, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) — which helps 7 million mothers and young children — was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration  shifted $300 million in tariff revenue  to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's  calling for an additional $300 million  to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some  states  could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources. —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR And what about school lunches? Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals. Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown. \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\" According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist.  —  Kadin Mills,  NPR USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.  —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler ,  NPR National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees On Monday, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.  According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\"  Around 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week. —  Geoff Brumfiel , NPR In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting  more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada  could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open. Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.  At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.  This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.  In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support   WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.  Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue.  But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.  In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.

EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  entered a prison in Paris on Tuesday on the first day of a five-year sentence, marking the first time a former leader of modern France has spent time behind bars.\n \n\n   \n  Sarkozy was driven to the prison complex on Tuesday morning, waving to his supporters as he left his house.\n \n\n   \n  The car driving him was surrounded by dozens of police motorbikes and vehicles, making its way to  La Santé Prison  in southern Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Sarkozy was sentenced to five years in jail for criminal conspiracy last month, for his role in a scheme to finance his 2007 presidential  campaign with funds  from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favors.\n \n\n   \n  The former president, who left office in 2012, has appealed his conviction but in the meantime is expected to occupy a cell either in solitary confinement or in the so-called “VIP wing” of La Santé prison complex.\n \n\n   \n  That wing is usually reserved for prisoners who are considered unsuitable to be kept among the prison’s general population, usually out of fears for their safety.\n \n\n   \n  They could be politicians, former police officers, members of far-right organizations or those tied to Islamist terror groups, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.\n \n\n   \n    Notable previous inmates\n \n\n   \n  Cells in the wing are fitted with a metal bed and mattress, a small desk, a fridge, a cooking hob, a television, a shower, toilet and sink, and a fixed telephone line allowing prisoners to call certain authorized numbers.\n \n\n   \n  Previous inmates include Manuel Noriega, the former dictator of Panama who was held there following his extradition from the United States after the American invasion that deposed him.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan terrorist Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, also known as “Carlos the Jackal,” spent time in the prison, as did Jacques Mesrine, a notorious 1970s murderer and bank robber, whose criminal career was portrayed in a 2008 film starring Vincent Cassel.\n \n\n   \n  Mesrine famously escaped from La Santé while dressed as a prison guard alongside fellow criminal François Besse, according to French public broadcaster France Info.\n \n\n   \n  Marco Mouly, a former prisoner in the prison’s VIP wing told BFMTV in a 2022 documentary that the prison is “alright,” comparing it to a popular European budget hotel chain.\n \n\n   \n  Another former inmate, Didier Schuller, told BFMTV that “the problem is the noise… At night, you’re woken up by people shouting.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement posted to X  shortly after the car carrying him set off for prison, Sarkozy stressed that he is an “innocent man.”\n \n\n   \n  “As I prepare to step inside the walls of La Santé prison, my thoughts go out to the French people of all walks of life and opinions,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to tell them with my unwavering strength that it’s not a former president of the Republic being locked up this morning, it’s an innocent man,” he continued.\n \n\n   \n  The former leader said he will “continue to denounce this judicial scandal” but added that he is “not to be pitied because my wife and children are by my side, and my friends are countless.”\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday morning, however, Sarkozy said he felt “a deep sorrow for France, which finds itself humiliated by the expression of a vengeance that has taken hatred to an unprecedented level.”\n \n\n   \n  Sarkozy’s legal team has requested that he is granted an early release from jail, Christophe Ingrain, one of the lawyers, told BFMTV Tuesday morning. The court has two months to decide whether or not to grant this request.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with developments, as well as to clarify that Sarkozy has appealed his conviction. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/asia/japan-female-prime-minister-sanae-takaichi-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:38:00-04:00","title":"Hardline Conservative Sanae Takaichi Elected Japan’s First Female Leader","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sanae Takaichi, a hardline conservative and protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, has been elected as Japan’s first female prime minister, marking a historic breakthrough in a traditionally patriarchal political system.

She becomes the fourth prime minister to hold office since he stepped down in 2020, reflecting the political deadlock in the world’s fourth largest economy.\n \n\n   \n  Like Abe, she supports revising Japan’s pacifist constitution and has visited a   controversial war shrine that includes the names of those convicted of war crimes during World War II – both issues that spark anger in neighboring China and South Korea, who are also vital trade partners for Japan.\n \n\n   \n  She also opposes same-sex marriage, and   a growing movement to allow married couples to use separate surnames.\n \n\n   \n  Some of these stances, such as her hawkish views on China, could complicate Japan’s regional relationships. And within Japan, some worry about her economic proposals – to spend big and cut taxes – as the country struggles with sky-high inflation and living costs.\n \n\n   \n  She has openly aspired to be like Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to become British prime minister – known as the “Iron Lady,” a nickname that has since been used for Takaichi herself.\n \n\n   \n  “Like Thatcher, (Takaichi) is a conservative and she is also a woman in a male-dominated world,” said Shihoko Goto, vice president of programs at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “That said, Thatcher was then – Japan is now. It’s facing a great deal of change, it’s facing a lot of internal domestic pressure … She will be expected, first and foremost, to deal with those immediate threats.”\n \n\n   \n  In her news conference Tuesday night, Takaichi said that she will “build a strong Japanese economy and protect Japan’s national interests at all costs through diplomacy and security.”\n \n\n   \n  Vowing to “reclaim Japan’s diplomacy and let it flourish at the center of the world,” Takaichi said that “Japan faces a major crisis from within and without. There is no time to stand still.”\n \n\n   \n  She noted that she will soon be meeting with Trump, adding that she will work to “elevate Japan-US relations to new heights.”\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s neighbors offered lukewarm responses to news of her win on Tuesday, with China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying it had “noted the election results” and hoped for a “mutually beneficial relationship.”\n \n\n   \n  A South Korean foreign ministry spokesperson similarly promised to continue cooperating with “Japan’s new Cabinet,” without naming Takaichi, according to news agency  Yonhap .\n \n\n   \n    An unconventional start\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many of her male peers, Takaichi doesn’t come from a political dynasty. She was born in Nara, a city frequented by tourists for its wild deer, to a father who worked for a car company and a mother who was a police officer.\n \n\n   \n  Before entering politics, she interned for a US Democratic congresswoman and worked as a TV commentator.\n \n\n   \n  Since joining the ruling LDP party, Takaichi has been elected as a member of parliament nine times. She’s held multiple cabinet posts, including on gender equality and demographic issues, and chaired the party’s Policy Research Council. Most recently, she served as minister of economic security under the administration of Fumio Kishida.\n \n\n   \n  She was elected leader of the LDP earlier in October, beating more moderate candidates. It suggested a rightward turn for the scandal-hit party, which suffered bruising losses in the last two parliamentary elections after  discontented voters  switched to new far-right groups.\n \n\n   \n  But now as prime minister, she’ll have to answer to the populace of 120 million Japanese. Tackling the high price of goods will be one of her first challenges; for instance, the price of rice, a staple food in Japan, has almost doubled from last year.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the ever-present headache of Japan’s declining birthrate, shrinking workforce and swelling elderly population. There’s a growing public backlash against mass immigration. And then there is the Trump administration and its whiplash tariffs, which shook Asian economies earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the immense challenge of winning back public trust, with the LDP experiencing its biggest crisis in decades and being stripped of its parliamentary majority under former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba after a political slush fund scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Simply being elected as the leader of the ruling party would usually have been enough to secure the premiership. But Takaichi’s path to power was complicated; besides losing its majority, the LDP also lost its coalition partner of 26 years, Komeito, which terminated the alliance when she won the leadership race.\n \n\n   \n  That left the LDP scrambling to find a new coalition partner – and it ultimately joined forces with the opposition Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation Party) ahead of Tuesday’s vote.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s new cabinet will also include a female finance minister – another first for Japan. Satsuki Katayama, who also worked as a minister in Abe’s government, was appointed to the role on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  “Takaichi’s rise to become Japan’s first female prime minister is more about remaking party politics than transforming foreign policy,” said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n \n\n   \n  “She is tasked with rebranding rather than revolutionizing her party, along with co-opting smaller parties in a realignment of legislative coalitions.”\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s party hopes she can be the answer to their recent unpopularity. But with a revolving door of prime ministers in recent years, Japan’s so-called ‘Iron Lady’ will need to deliver results quickly to stay in power.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/entertainment/sombr-tiktok-drama-concert-review","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"09:01:00-04:00","title":"Sombr’s TikTok Drama May Not Be Something You Know About, But Your Kids Probably Do","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sombr, a 20-year-old singer known for viral singles like 'Back to Friends' and 'Undressed', has been at the center of a TikTok controversy following a scathing review by 25-year-old user Meg of his concert at The Anthem in Washington, DC.

something you know about, but your kids probably do \n       \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:01 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A social media standout-turned-music-star has some drama brewing on TikTok, and for those who are not chronically online, we’re here to explain.\n \n\n   \n  Shane Boose is 20-year-old a singer who performs under the stage name Sombr. His singles “Back to Friends” and “Undressed” went viral earlier this year, and he’s amassed quite the fan base on and off social media.\n \n\n   \n  One of those fans is a TikTok user named Meg,  whose scathing review  of Sombr’s show at the The Anthem in Washington, DC has lit up the comment section and prompted a response from the singer.\n \n\n   \n  Calling it “one of the worst experiences of my life,” Meg, who says she is 25 years old, explained that she was excited to see Sombr’s The Late Nights & Young Romance Tour, but it ended up being “by far, genuinely, the worst concert I’ve been to in my life, for a multitude of reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  She went on to explain that the show, which she attended with her boyfriend, was filled with so many young people that it was “the closest to a middle school dance I’ve ever been since I was in middle school at a dance.”\n \n\n   \n  “The only adults in the room were the parents (of the young concert goers) and then my boyfriend and I,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Meg said she tried to stick it out so she could hear her favorite songs, but regretted it as the humor skewed immature – with Sombr making references to niche memes, including  a 6-7 joke  – and, at one point, did a bit called the “Sombr dating show,” where he was solicited participants from the tween-skewing crowd to call their “toxic ex” while on stage.\n \n\n   \n  Calling the scene “cringe,” Meg also alleged that the artist made jokes that were inappropriate given the average age of the audience. She said she ended up leaving early.\n \n\n   \n  Boose seemingly responded to her post in his own  video , referring to the situation as a “TikTok drama.”\n \n\n   \n  “I am a 20-year-old artist – freshly 20 – and if you’re 25 years old, and you’re gonna come to my concert and not expect people younger than you to be there when I, the artist, am five years younger than you, it’s just a skill issue,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He also took umbrage with being attacked for the tone of his jokes, noting that anyone who has followed him online knows that he has “never uttered a serious word in my life.”\n \n\n   \n  “And, also, I make jokes for 5 minutes of the concert and the rest is music,” Boose said. “Like, live a little, enjoy life.”\n \n\n   \n  To underscore his latter point, toward the end of his video, he touched what appeared to be some fake grass as a “tutorial.” Telling someone to “touch grass” is a common social media diss.\n \n\n   \n  Meg later  responded , saying that even though she has often posted political content that could cause division, she’s never received as much “hate” as she did after posting her Sombr concert review video.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to both Meg and a representative for Sombr for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/sport/soccer-maccabi-tel-aviv-ban-ticket-allocation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"09:33:00-04:00","title":"Israeli Soccer Fans Banned from Maccabi Tel Aviv vs. Aston Villa Match in England","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Maccabi Tel Aviv has declined to accept ticket allocations for its upcoming Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham on November 6, 2025, due to a security ban imposed by the city's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) and supported by West Midlands Police, citing public safety risks and past incidents of fan violence.

banned from attending Maccabi Tel Aviv’s match against Aston Villa \n       \n  By Amy Woodyatt, Ben Church, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:33 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Maccabi Tel Aviv has said it will not accept any prospective ticket allocation from Aston Villa following a  ban  on the Israeli soccer club’s fans from attending a Europa League game in Birmingham next month due to security concerns.\n \n\n   \n  The ban was put into place by local authorities in England and triggered condemnation from many politicians, sports organizations and Jewish groups, who have since tried to reverse the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The wellbeing and safety of our fans is paramount and from hard lessons learned, we have taken the decision to decline any allocation offered on behalf of away fans and our decision should be understood in that context,” Maccabi Tel Aviv said in a  statement published to X  on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the ban and the subsequent reaction.\n \n\n   \n    Why was a ban on traveling Maccabi fans put in place?\n \n\n   \n  Aston Villa said that the decision was made following an instruction from the city of Birmingham’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG), which provides health and safety guidance at events and issues safety certificates for matches at Villa Park.\n \n\n   \n  The SAG wrote to Villa and European soccer governing body UEFA advising that no away fans should be permitted to attend the game, which takes place on November 6.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, West Midlands Police (WMP)  said in a statement  that it had deemed the match to be high risk “based on current intelligence and previous incidents” and that it agreed with the decision by local authorities to ban traveling fans.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on our professional judgement, we believe this measure will help mitigate risks to public safety,” said WMP.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain steadfast in our support all affected communities, and reaffirm our zero-tolerance stance on hate crime in all its forms.”\n \n\n   \n    What happened this past weekend?\n \n\n   \n  Days after the decision, the Tel Aviv soccer derby between Hapoel and Maccabi was canceled on Sunday after what police described as “public disorder and violent riots” – the latest episode of fan unrest involving Maccabi fans.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli Premier League match was due to be played at Bloomfield Stadium, which is shared by the two rivals, but videos on social media showed fans clashing with police both inside and outside the area.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement  Sunday, Israel Police said that 12 civilians and three police officers were injured in the unrest, with nine people arrested. Authorities said that a further 16 people were detained for questioning.\n \n\n   \n  Footage released by police showed pyrotechnics and smoke grenades being thrown from the stands before kickoff, and police  said  the decision to cancel the match was made due to “endangerment of human life.”\n \n\n   \n  This comes almost a year after Maccabi supporters were beaten and injured in violent clashes in Amsterdam ahead of a Europa League game against Ajax, which Dutch authorities condemned as antisemitic.\n \n\n   \n    What have politicians said about the ban?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson said that the UK government was “saddened” by Maccabi Tel Aviv’s decision to turn down its ticket allocation for the match but “respect(s) the club’s right to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson told reporters: “This government wants a Britain built for all. We will never accept antisemitism on our streets. The focus now is to ensure the game moves ahead safely and that Jewish people across the country feel secure in their communities.”\n \n\n   \n  UK authorities had previously sought to reverse the ban on Maccabi fans from attending the game at Villa Park.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Keir Starmer said last week that it was the “wrong decision,” adding that the “the role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”\n \n\n   \n  Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, meanwhile,  said  that the government would “find the resources” to allow Maccabi fans to attend the match next month.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the situation came “against the backdrop of rising antisemitism here and across the world, and  an attack  on a synagogue in Manchester in which two innocent men were killed.”\n \n\n   \n    What was Maccabi’s response?\n \n\n   \n  In addition to declining any possible ticket allocation to Villa Park, Maccabi said in a statement: “As a result of the hate-filled falsehoods, a toxic atmosphere has been created which makes the safety of our fans wishing to attend very much in doubt. Inflammatory rhetoric, trafficking in half-truths is never healthy, but in this particular case the remarks being generated are of the most concerning variety.”\n \n\n   \n  The statement added: “We acknowledge the efforts of the UK government and police to ensure both sets of fans can attend the match safely, and are grateful for the messages of support from across the footballing community and society at large.”\n \n\n   \n  “We as a club believe that football should be about bringing people together not driving them apart and no one should feel unsafe for simply wanting to come and support their team nor feel any hesitation about being accompanied by family and friends.”\n \n\n   \n  Maccabi said it looked forward to “being able to play in Birmingham in a sporting environment in the near future,” adding that it hoped “circumstances will change.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/longest-government-shutdown-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"09:58:00-04:00","title":"The last government shutdown was the longest in nearly 50 years.

Here’s how long the current shutdown has been going on:\n \n\n   \n  The last time the government shut down — which started on December 22, 2018, and went until January 25, 2019 — it lasted 35 days, making it the longest in history.

The first federal government shutdown happened in 1976, according to CNN research.\n \n\n   \n  While government shutdowns have become less common in recent decades — there have been six since 1990 — an increasingly partisan Washington has left Congress unable to resolve sticking points on spending for longer periods of time.\n \n\n   \n  With Republican Speaker Mike Johnson overseeing one of the  narrowest House majorities in history,  and the GOP lacking the 60 votes needed to overcome a Senate  filibuster , the path to avoiding a shutdown was murky in the 11th hour as negotiations stalled.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Tami Luhby  has more on which government services are expected to halt , and which are likely continuing, during this shutdown.\n \n\n   \n    The last government shutdown\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown that began in December 2018 was a partial shutdown, where Congress had approved annual funding for certain agencies, allowing them to continue operations while other federal departments went dark. During that time, an estimated 800,000 people were employed at the shuttered federal agencies, and about 300,000 of those were furloughed, meaning they were not paid and asked not to report to work, according to the CBO.\n \n\n   \n  The rest were considered exempt from furlough, meaning they needed to report to work but could not receive pay. Both furloughed and exempted employees received backpay when their agencies reopened after the funding agreement was passed.\n \n\n   \n  The current Congress has not passed any of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the US government.

and wounded Prime Minister Robert Fico last year was guilty of terrorism charges and gave him a 21-year jail sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Juraj Cintula, 72, shot at Fico five times from just over a 1-meter distance as the prime minister greeted people in the central Slovak town of Handlova in May 2024.\n \n\n   \n  The verdict of the Specialized Criminal Court in the city of Banska Bystrica closes a trial that began in July and whose main question was whether Cintula, who admitted shooting Fico, was guilty of terrorism or less serious crimes of murder or attack.\n \n\n   \n  Fico, 61, was struck four times and was seriously injured in his abdomen, and also suffered injuries to his hip, hand and foot. He made his first public appearance in July last year, a few months after the attack and returned to work shortly after.\n \n\n   \n  Cintula appeared in court in a blue shirt and black hooded sweatshirt, accompanied by guards with automatic weapons. He has said he wanted to hurt but not kill Fico, because he wanted to stop him from continuing his policies which he said damaged Slovak freedom and culture.\n \n\n   \n  Cintula told reporters when leaving court on Tuesday he would “for sure” appeal the verdict. “It was unjust,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting laid bare deep divisions in Slovak society, and animosity between the populist Fico and the opposition. Fico, who has held power for 11 years over three stints since 2006, has blamed the mostly liberal, pro-EU opposition for fostering a climate of anger that led to the shooting.\n \n\n   \n  The opposition accuses Fico of eroding democratic standards, media freedom, and covering up corruption.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Igor Kralik cited Cintula’s own reasoning for the attack when reading his justification for the terrorism count.\n \n\n   \n  “The court considers proven that the defendant did not attack a citizen but specifically the prime minister,” Kralik said.\n \n\n   \n  The sentence was less than the maximum of life in prison.\n \n\n   \n  The defense counsel for Cintula, a pensioner and former mine worker, stonemason, writer and public activist, argued that not every attack on an official was terrorism. It had sought a lesser sentence for an attack on a public official.\n \n\n   \n  David Lindtner, a lawyer for Fico, said it was clear that the defendant was “no pensioner but a terrorist” who wanted to set a precedent that “political confrontation should be resolved by violent means.”\n \n\n   \n  Fico returned to power in 2023 and ended state military assistance to Ukraine, sought better ties with Moscow, overhauled the public broadcaster and introduced some new criminal codes - changes critics say hurt democracy.\n \n\n   \n  Cintula has said he opposed the prime minister’s policies on Ukraine, media and culture and at his trial described the attack as a “scream against fear that is paralyzing the society”.\n \n\n   \n  Fico, who has suffered ongoing health problems related to the shooting, has said he has forgiven Cintula.\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581554","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump uses 'common sense' to make a political point.

It has populist appeal \n         By Danielle Kurtzleben  \n        \n           Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The idea of \"common sense\" has been central to American politics since the founding of the United States. Politicians still use the phrase all the time — and perhaps none more so than President Trump. Just this month at a Cabinet meeting, he used the phrase when he again recommended that pregnant women not take Tylenol. \"There's something going on, and we have to address it. And so, I'm addressing it the best I can as a nondoctor, but I'm a man of common sense,\" he said. He also used the term when he cast doubt on the monthly jobs report on CNBC in August: \"It's totally rigged. Smart people know it. People with common sense know it.\" The White House has also used it to explain the current government shutdown. \"Not enough Democrats voted for this common sense, clean continuing resolution to keep the government open,\" White House press secretary  Karoline Leavitt recently told NPR's  Morning Edition . This isn't exactly new. \"Common sense\" is such a widely used political phrase that University of Pennsylvania history professor Sophia Rosenfeld wrote an  entire book  on it. And yet, she says, Trump's usage of it is unique. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"He uses it more than almost anybody else in American politics,\" she said. \"Although, of course, it has a really old origin story.\" That goes back to Thomas Paine, in his 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" which made the case to the earliest Americans that British rule of the colonies was wrong. And in that, she says, Paine had hit upon the populist appeal of the phrase. \"It invokes some kind of primordial basic sense of ordinary people, a kind of lived experience that should transcend what the official or elite position is on something and particularly should transcend book learning and school learning,\" she said. And Trump often invokes that dichotomy of common sense vs. academic smarts. Speaking to military leaders in Quantico, Va., last month, Trump differentiated his administration from Joe Biden's, saying that Biden was surrounded by \"radical left lunatics that are brilliant people but dumb as hell when it came to policy and common sense.\" The phrase appeals more to several demographics that strongly align with Trump, says Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican strategist. \"Common sense is a higher priority to those who live in rural communities than those in the urban areas. Common sense does better among older voters than it does among younger voters,\" he said. \"And I think the reason why is that it reminds people of a more simple past.\" And that understandably appeals to people who want to make America great again. But Democrats use the phrase too. President Barack Obama tried to pass what he called \"common sense gun reform.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., used it this year on her Fighting Oligarchy Tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \"I believe that in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, if a person gets sick, they shouldn't go bankrupt. Common sense,\" she told a crowd at Arizona State University in March. One way to look at \"common sense\" is as an attempt to signal that a policy isn't extreme and could have broad appeal. But as Luntz points out, it can also be a cudgel, especially in Trump's hands. \"For him, common sense has an even broader meaning,\" he said. \"It's not just that you're right for the right reasons. It's also that the other side is wrong for being ideological, for being political or being outside the mainstream.\" Rosenfeld has a similar take. \"It's also potentially rather demagogic,\" she says of the phrase. \"Common sense also suggests not that there's another side to it. The other side in a debate with common sense is nonsense.\" And in that sense and others, common sense can be considered one of the most powerful pieces of rhetoric the MAGA movement has found. To Rosenfeld, Trump especially uses the phrase to try to excuse norm-shattering behavior — like a September social media post that Chicago was \"about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\" Here's how Trump explained that to a reporter: \"We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war — that's common sense.\" \"Common sense\" gives the impression of timeworn policy ideas, even if the policy — mass deployment of the National Guard into U.S. cities — was previously unthinkable. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   The idea of common sense has been central to American politics since the founding of the U.S. Politicians still use the phrase all the time, perhaps none more so than Donald Trump.

KURTZLEBEN: The White House has also used it to explain the current government shutdown. Here's press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaking to NPR's Morning Edition recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) KAROLINE LEAVITT: Not enough Democrats voted for this common sense, clean, continuing resolution to keep the government open. KURTZLEBEN: This isn't exactly new. Common sense is such a widely used political phrase that University of Pennsylvania history professor Sophia Rosenfeld wrote an entire book on it. And when it comes to Trump... SOPHIA ROSENFELD: He uses it more than almost anybody else in American politics, although, of course, it has a really old origin story. KURTZLEBEN: That goes back to Thomas Paine in his 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" which made the case to the earliest Americans that British rule of the colonies was wrong. And in that, she says, Paine had hit upon the populist appeal of the phrase. ROSENFELD: It invoked some kind of primordial basic sense of ordinary people, a kind of lived experience that should transcend what the official or elite position is on something and particularly should transcend book learning and school learning. KURTZLEBEN: And Trump regularly invokes that. Here he was speaking to military leaders at Quantico last month, differentiating his administration from Joe Biden's. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: People that surrounded him, radical left lunatics, that are brilliant people but dumb as hell when it came to policy and common sense. KURTZLEBEN: The phrase appeals more to several demographics that currently strongly align with Trump says Frank Luntz, a strategist who has worked with Republicans. FRANK LUNTZ: Common sense is a higher priority to those who live in rural communities than in those in the urban areas. Common sense does better among older voters than it does among younger voters. And I think the reason why is that it reminds people of a more simple past. KURTZLEBEN: Which understandably appeals to people who want to make America great again. But Democrats use the phrase too. President Barack Obama tried to pass what he called common sense gun reform. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used the phrase this year on her Fighting Oligarchy Tour with Senator Bernie Sanders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: I believe that in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, if a person gets sick, they shouldn't go bankrupt - common sense. KURTZLEBEN: One way to look at common sense is an attempt to signal that a policy isn't extreme and could have broad appeal. But as Luntz points out, it can also be a cudgel, especially in Trump's hands. LUNTZ: For him, common sense has an even broader meaning. It's not just that you're right for the right reasons. It's also that the other side is wrong for being ideological, for being political, for being outside the mainstream. KURTZLEBEN: Rosenfeld has a similar take. ROSENFELD: It's also potentially rather demagogic. Common sense also suggests not that there's another side to it. The other side in a debate with common sense is nonsense. KURTZLEBEN: And in that sense and others, common sense can be considered one of the most powerful pieces of rhetoric the MAGA movement has found. To Rosenfeld, Trump especially uses the phrase to try to excuse norm-shattering behavior, like a September social media post saying, quote, \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\" Here's how Trump explained that to a reporter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war. That's common sense. KURTZLEBEN: Common sense gives the impression of time-worn policy ideas, even if the policy - mass deployment of the National Guard into U.S. cities - was previously unthinkable.

But activism nearly cost Yousafzai her life; in 2012, when she was 15, she was shot in the head while riding home on a school bus.  Yousafzai survived the assassination attempt, but her life changed completely. Suddenly she was a symbol of resistance to the Taliban — praised, politicized and picked apart. When she was 17, she became the youngest person ever awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , an honor that weighed on her as she went off to Oxford University a few years later.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I always have felt that now I need to live up to the expectation [of the Nobel],\" Yousafzai says. \"It was given for the work I had done, but it was also given for the work that is ahead of us. ...

At Oxford, she struggled to know who she was as a person. \"This was the first time I allowed myself to be more of myself, to really just test it. ... Am I funny? Am I not?

In the new memoir,  Finding My Way , she writes about her life at Oxford and beyond. It's the story of a college student who, like many others before her, tries marijuana, fails exams and falls in love for the first time. But it also reveals Yousafzai's efforts to deal with the trauma of the attack she had survived years earlier. \"When you face violence, harm and trauma yourself, you understand how terrible and horrible it is,\" she says. \"Whether it's girls being banned from school in Afghanistan, or girls' schools being bombed in Gaza, or children being forced into labor, or girls being married off. … I just hope that we can create a world without any war and terror and harm for children.\" Yousafzai's foundation, Malala Fund, continues to advocate for girls' education worldwide.

I knew that we had to be married because in our culture for two people to be together you have to be married. But then marriage just felt like a very heavy topic for me. I even went to read some books. … I was like, please Virginia Woolf, help me, bell hooks, can you share a few words of wisdom? I was looking for an answer, like, just someone tell me yes or no.

College is often a time to figure out who we are, to fall in love for the first time, to experiment, to fail, to question what we believe. But for Malala Yousafzai, it was different. She spent her college years experiencing all of these things under scrutiny and 24-hour security. When she was 15, Malala survived an assassination attempt by the Taliban - a gunshot to the head while riding home on a school bus. But long before that, she'd been standing up to them, demanding the right for girls to go to school in her hometown of Mingora in Pakistan's Swat Valley. The Taliban had taken control, closing schools, banning women from public life and brutally punishing anyone who resisted. MOSLEY: After the shooting, Malala's life changed overnight. She became a symbol of resistance, praised, politicized and picked apart. While the world saw an unshakable young woman with a message, Malala was also a teenager undergoing surgeries to reconstruct what was destroyed by the Taliban, experiencing post-traumatic stress and navigating others' expectations of who she should be. Her new memoir, \"Finding My Way,\" reveals the person beyond the symbol. It's the story of a young Malala learning the bounds of what it means to be a free woman - trying on jeans for the first time, falling in love, failing exams and confronting the trauma of a shooting that for a long time she had no memory of. Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for her efforts to combat the suppression of children and advocate for their education. She's written several books, including \"I Am Malala\" and \"We Are Displaced: True Stories Of Refugee Lives.\" The 2015 documentary \"He Named Me Malala\" chronicles her family's activism. Malala Yousafzai, welcome to FRESH AIR. MALALA YOUSAFZAI: Thank you. MOSLEY: This memoir, in a way - in many ways, picks up where your first memoir left off. Just to, like, put ourselves in this place - I mean, such a dichotomy here because - in how remarkable this is because here you are entering college. I mean, you won the Nobel Prize at 17. So it's an unbelievable honor that I know you take great pride in, but it also comes, as you say, with this tremendous responsibility to always live up to all that you had endured and what you've accomplished, what it represents. Did that expectation also feel like a cage in a way? Like, you wanted to come into college almost as an anonymous person. YOUSAFZAI: Going to Oxford was my childhood dream, and I wanted to be myself, make as many friends. But I think with these titles and recognitions like the Nobel Peace Prize, I thought I had to act differently. And because, you know, a lot of the people who receive these titles are much older in their life, and they - you know, they're usually in their 50s, 60s. They have, you know, like, a family life already established. I received the Nobel Peace Prize when I was in my chemistry class. (LAUGHTER) YOUSAFZAI: So, you know, I was still a school student. So I see it as a big responsibility, and I always have felt that now I need to live up to the expectation. You know, it was given for the work I had done, but it was also given for the work that is ahead of us. So for me now, like, I have to work for the rest of my life to prove that it was well deserved. And for me, that is just, you know, seeing this dream of girls' education becoming a reality in every part of the world. But at the same time, I thought, OK, like, but do you have to change as a person? Like, are you supposed to live a certain way? In college, though, this was the first time that I allowed myself to be more of myself, to really just test it. And to be honest, I didn't even know who I was. Am I funny? Am I not? What do I enjoy? Like, I didn't know any of that. I have never seen boys my age. I have never, you know, been away from my parents or lived on my own. I can decide. I can go to a Diwali party. I can stay up late to 3 a.m., and, you know, like, my parents would not know about this. And, you know, I could sign up for rowing, or I could go to the aerobics '80s-themed party, any of that. We could do all of that. I was somehow feeling that I was reliving all the missed years of my childhood because of the activism that I had to take from such a young age that I missed. MOSLEY: Was there a particular moment when you realized - you're at college, when you realize, wait a minute, I could do whatever I want, you know? YOUSAFZAI: (Laughter) You know, I think about the roof climbing experience oftentime (ph) because that was offered to me by a stranger at college, who told me that there is this crazy thing that only cool college students do. And he offered it to me, and I said, OK, I'll see you at midnight. I told my security, like, I'm done for the day, and you guys can go to sleep. So the security were like... MOSLEY: And I just want to note... YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: ...For folks that you had 24-hour security because... YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: ...During this time period, in the years after you were shot, you received lots of threats against your life. That's why... YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: ...You had 24-hour security - in addition, in the same way that many heads of state have security in the United States. YOUSAFZAI: Yeah. I mean, it was awkward to have, like, guys following you. But at the same time, it just helped me have the opportunity to experience these things and not be worried about safety and security. So, yeah - but for that night, the roof climbing night, I told them, I think I'm going to be safe on my own. I said, you guys can go to bed. So it's midnight. I follow the stranger. We go up to the fourth floor of the building, and there's a small window in this room. And he tells me that we need to sneak out through the window and then walk by this narrow path on the roof. One misstep and you could fall. And I am just nodding, and I follow him, and it was a really scary way making up - making it up to the rooftop. And on the rooftop, there's this bell tower, like, the clock tower. And that moment just felt surreal. I just thought I had, like, conquered something. I was breathing in the fresh air, and I was looking down, just seeing some students still up at night or the light was still on in some rooms. And I was thinking maybe they are still trying to finish their essay or just feeling a moment of victory. And I was so scared that I might be, like, kicked out of college for this and this happening so soon. So I was terrified that - being an advocate for education and then getting in trouble and being kicked out. MOSLEY: What do you think it was about that that, like, really set your heart on this independent journey? Like, that - it's almost like another near-death experience. YOUSAFZAI: I think for me, it was just wanting to disobey rules. I thought I had to live up to expectations and be a certain way. I could never get in trouble. I thought if this is something that puts me in the cool kids category or the rebellious kids category, I want to give it a try. Like, I wanted these college years to be that experience that I otherwise would never come across. MOSLEY: You really did experience a lot of things in college that many students do, including getting high. You - your spring year of college, first year at Oxford, you're with friends. You're hanging out, as college kids do, and you're offered marijuana, specifically a bong. And you join in with your friends, and as the hours tick on, you have a reaction. You can't walk. Everything goes black. And this, you realize, is a very familiar place. Could I have you read what you wrote about it in the book? YOUSAFZAI: (Reading) Suddenly, I was 15 years old again, lying on my back under a white sheet, a tube running down my throat, eyes closed. YOUSAFZAI: For seven days, as doctors tended to my wounds, I was in a coma. From the outside, I looked to be in a deep sleep. But inside, my mind was awake, and it played a slideshow of recent events - my school bus. A man with a gun. Blood everywhere. My body carried through crowded streets. Strangers hunched over me, yelling things I didn't understand. My father rushing toward the stretcher to take my hand. As the images repeated in the same sequence over and over, I raged against them, trying to beat them away. This isn't true, I told myself. The real Malala is the one trapped in this nightmare, not the girl on the stretcher. Just wake up, and it will stop. Wake up. I had tried to force my eyes open, to see something other than this carousel of horrors. Inside, I screamed. Outside, my lips stayed closed, motionless. I was awake and buried alive in the coffin of my body. MOSLEY: It's hard to read. YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: It's hard to read it. Yeah. YOUSAFZAI: The bong incident, you know, just turned out to be an experience not that I had imagined. I had heard cool things about it. And of course, you know, like, it's different for everybody. But I think in my case, there was this unaddressed trauma. The memory, the visuals - everything, I think, had been there. My brain had tried to suppress them because, you know, it's just a moment of fear that you do not want to see again. And when the bong incident happened, my body froze, and I was reliving the Taliban attack. I - you know, I could see the gunman. I thought, this is happening all over again. I often, you know, say that I received my surgeries, and I recovered so quickly from the Taliban attack. But just when this happened, I realized that maybe I actually had not fully recovered. There was this unaddressed part of my recovery, which was mental health, which was the trauma that we did not actually count in the treatment process. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Malala Yousafzai. She's the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and co-founder of Malala Fund, which advocates for girls' education worldwide. Her new memoir is \"Finding My Way.\" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG, \"PEACOCKS\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, I'm talking to Malala Yousafzai about her new memoir, \"Finding My Way,\" which chronicles her coming-of-age after surviving a Taliban assassination attempt at age 15 and navigating life as a global icon while trying to live as a normal young woman. The book reveals her private struggles with mental health, her complicated relationship with fame and her evolution as an activist. When we left off, we were talking about the experience she had in college after getting high on marijuana. There are some dark moments that you experienced. After that night, you started to experience these intrusive thoughts that didn't stop, even after the high went away. You described being afraid of a kitchen knife - not that someone would hurt you with it, but that you might hurt yourself. And I just kept thinking as I was reading this, for someone the world has called the bravest girl on Earth, what was it like to suddenly be frightened of your own hands, of your own self? YOUSAFZAI: It was frightening. And even now, like, when I think about it, it's just - it's a really frightening place to be in. You feel trapped. You do not see a way out. That's exactly what I was going through in those days. I - you know, I would be - I was shaking. I was shaking every minute. I could not look at harmful objects. I could not look at a knife. I could not watch news that said anything about murdering people or - you know, or somebody being killed or shot or wounded. I just felt so disappointed with myself that somebody who actually faced a Taliban gunman was somehow now scared of these small things. It was all just, like, trivial stuff that - it made no sense to me. And I thought that I had lost my courage, that I was not brave enough - the titles I had received my whole life, and I thought I had to live up to them. I felt like an imposter. And then one of my friends suggested that I see a therapist. She said that a lot of students actually get therapy in college - that she herself is seeing a therapist. And I was a bit skeptical. I also thought a therapist would not understand what I'm going through. MOSLEY: Right, because your... YOUSAFZAI: But she said it... MOSLEY: Yeah. YOUSAFZAI: ...I should give it a try. Yeah. MOSLEY: Because your parents didn't believe in therapy. I think your father said only a completely nonfunctioning person needs a therapist. So there was a lot that you needed to get over to actually seek one. YOUSAFZAI: Yes. You know, growing up in Pakistan, we had not heard about therapy and mental health that now we are hearing, where it's been accepted as a normal conversation. People are opening up about it. It - you know, and we don't even have that much support around mental health. MOSLEY: Has it helped you? YOUSAFZAI: Therapy has definitely helped me. I remember the first session, where I told my therapist all my problems - past, you know, present, potential future ones. And I said, OK. Like, now give me some medication. How do we fix it? And she took a deep breath, and she said, you know, this is not how therapy works. And she told me that I had PTSD and anxiety. And this was, like, the first time that I actually heard the word PTSD. You know, people - I had come - like, I had heard it in a few different contexts. But I thought, you know, OK, I faced a trauma, but I think I don't have PTSD. But seven years later, the PTSD appeared. And, you know, I learned something - that when people - they talk about, like, a traumatic experience, it's not necessary that PTSD or the mental health issues appear immediately. It - like, they could appear seven years later, 10 years later. Like, you never know. And that happened in my case. MOSLEY: Let's talk about love. You write that you'd convinced yourself you'd never date, you'd never marry, that you'd be like a - quote, \"like a nun, but Muslim.\" Once you got past yourself and you and your now husband, Asser, fell madly in love, which - folks can read all about it in this book. But you were resistant to marriage for a long time. Why were you against marriage? YOUSAFZAI: I mean, growing up, I had seen many girls lose the opportunity to complete their education and, you know, just their dreams to become a doctor, engineer because they were married off. So like, marriage, that was like the last thing I wanted to think about. I did not want to get married. It was not a cool thing. If you wanted to have a future as a girl, you wanted to keep yourself away from marriage for as long as you could, because even later in your life, it just meant, like, more compromises for women, that, you know, you had to readjust to the husband's family. And you just had to pray that the husband turns out to be a nice, respectful person. I remember when I was thinking about marriage for myself, I put myself in my mom's shoes for the first time. I had never thought about anything from her perspective before. And, you know, I would always admire my dad. And I wanted to, like, follow his footsteps and all of that. But this was the first time I wondered what life would have been like for my mom. When she decided to marry, how did she trust this guy she had not even known and decided to, like, move into his house and be married off and restart a new life? And I asked my mom, actually, what were her dreams when she was a kid? And she said, you know, I just wanted to find a husband who would be respectful. And I can go into the city and, like, have nice food and, like, drive around in a car. And I realized that my mom didn't even have a dream for herself, that marriage was a way for her to find some sort of freedom, a little more freedom than she had right now. So it was sort of a fascinating time. When I saw Asser, I immediately fell in love with him. I knew that I wanted to be with him. And I knew that we had to be married because in our culture, for two people to be together, you have to be married. But then marriage just felt like a very heavy topic for me. I even went to read some books. MOSLEY: Yes. You read a lot of books about feminism and marriage, yeah. YOUSAFZAI: Yes. I was like, please, Virginia Woolf, help me. (LAUGHTER) YOUSAFZAI: bell hooks, can you share a few words of wisdom? MOSLEY: Well, you made this list of questions for him before... YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: ...You marry him. I mean, you asked him about fidelity, about whether he'd control what you wear, whether he'd take another wife. These were real considerations that you had to know. You were trying to extract guarantees, though, and he tried to give them to you, but then he said something to you that was really kind of profound. He said there are no magic words to take away all of your doubts. Why was that the right answer for you to kind of come to the realization that this was the step that you should take. YOUSAFZAI: Yeah, I mean, like, poor Asser. I was asking him every possible question about every horrible things that I had seen or heard about. Like, you know, a husband doesn't allow his wife to work. A husband has a problem that the wife earns more money. The husband is of this view that he can marry, like, more wives or things like that. And he is, you know, OK with, like, telling the wife off or, like, that she has to live by his rules and all of that. So I said, who knows? Like, I know he's a nice guy, but who knows? I think it's better to get a verbal (laughter) confirmation. It's just the fear, the fear that we all carry. I knew that I was a very independent person. I did not need a husband, like, literally. I did not need him. But I wanted him. And I wanted to make sure that this was, like, worth my time. But, you know, when he said that, you know, no answers would clear all my doubts, I think he was right. It was true, because even when he was answering, I still had that little hesitation in my heart. But what I really loved was just the way he was answering those questions. He was very patient. He gave me time. You know, this marriage conversation started, like, a while ago. But he allowed me to go and do my research and talk to people and just, like, take my time off. MOSLEY: My guest today is Malala Yousafzai. We're talking about her new memoir, \"Finding My Way.\" We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Tonya Mosley, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO'S \"GREAT DAY\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. And today, I'm talking with Malala Yousafzai about her new memoir, \"Finding My Way.\" She's the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate and co-founder of Malala Fund, which advocates for girls' education worldwide. In her new memoir, Malala writes about her college years at Oxford, her struggles with PTSD and panic attacks and her decision to marry despite her reservations about the institution of marriage. Malala, I want to talk to you a bit about your parents. Many of us know your father's story. He's an educator who raised you to speak up. Your mother is quieter in the public narrative. And in this book, though, she's complex. She once saved a girl from forced marriage. So she did have that within her, this understanding that whatever power she had, she also was - in a way, would you call her a silent activist, not as vocal and open as your father but still believing nonetheless? YOUSAFZAI: My mom is more an action-driven person. She, you know, doesn't care about, you know, like, what we say. But she - for her, it's more about the actions we take. My mom has helped so many women and girls. I - you know, some stories, like, I saw myself. I remember this girl in Pakistan, when we were living there, who was raped, and she became pregnant. And my mom saved her life. My mom saved her life. She took her for an abortion. And I - at the time, I did not understand any of that. But, like, now, when I reflect on it, I think, you know, my mom took such a brave step that it's - you know, if I ask her about her opinions on certain things, like, she may not give us - she - like, she may not give an answer that truly reflects her actions. But I think, you know, she - for her, it is about the safety and the protection of girls and how - you know, how we can help them and protect them from the harm and the - that they face. MOSLEY: Both of them, both of your parents, have been fiercely brave. But you also describe them as - what will people think? - people. And I found that to be such an interesting way to describe it. I think a lot of people can connect to that. How do you hold both of those truths about your parents, being fiercely brave but also very concerned with the opinions of others? YOUSAFZAI: My mom had a very different childhood than mine. She never went to school. Her female friends never went to school. It was actually normal and expected for a girl not to be educated. The best that she dreamed for herself was to be married into a family where the husband is a bit kind and just lets her have her favorite food or just takes her to one of her, like, favorite places to visit. That's all that she hoped for, and that it doesn't turn out to be a horrible, abusive kind of in-laws family or a husband. And, you know, when I think about it, I'm like, you know, like, my mom's journey was not easy. And she always says that she's so lucky that she found my dad because he is, you know, already known globally for his advocacy, feminism, for standing up for women's rights and, more importantly, for letting his daughter speak. I always tell people that there's nothing unique in my story of activism from Swat Valley. The only thing that's unique or different is that my father did not stop me. If more men are brave enough to allow the girls to do what they want or to not stop them, then we will hear different stories. We will hear more women and girls get the opportunities that they deserve. I know both of them are very kind and caring parents. But they are not just thinking as parents, but I think they're also thinking as representatives of the bigger community in Pakistan or relatives. And sometimes I feel like there are just too many voices that are speaking when they are speaking. And it affects everything - like, even a decision like what I was packing for college. My mom was packing all the traditional Pakistani clothes for me. I just wanted to wear jeans and gray jumpers or sweaters, and I did not want to stand out at all. So I remember packing all of these, like, more normal college clothes. I remember going on Google and looking up, Selena Gomez casual 2017... (LAUGHTER) YOUSAFZAI: Because I was like, you know, what is, like, a cool outfit, a casual outfit that everybody's wearing? MOSLEY: There's this moment in college when you wore jeans to rowing practice. YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: And a picture was taken of you wearing these jeans. Pakistani media went into an uproar. Your father wanted you to issue a clarification. And I'll just say - there's something almost comical in the way that you write about that. What did he say to you? What did he want you to say? YOUSAFZAI: You know, both my mom and dad were really upset when they saw the whole backlash in Pakistan. I remember, like, on phone with both Mom and my dad and just being so mad at them because I said, like, I am here at college, not for some pilgrimage or some, like, religious ceremony. This is my college life, and I want to be like every other student. What am I even going to say in a clarification statement? Like, apologies - I'm not going to wear jeans tomorrow? Or, OK, let me defend jeans and say, you know, there are, like, Muslim people who wear jeans. There's no fixed dress code for Muslims. Or, you know, like, it's - I was like, this is going to be a whole - another debate. Can women and girls just wear what they want? So my dad, in the end, agreed. My mom was still arguing with me, but in the end, she sort of accepted it. But I told them - I said, you know, the - you just never know. Jeans was, like, the last thing that I was worried about. To be honest, I was more worried about people taking photos if I were seen, like, with my friends at a party where we were maybe, like, dancing together. I thought, like, all of these things could be taken out of context. I was super aware of that. But when it happened with jeans, I was like, OK. You know what? I'm I'm just going to go for everything now because, like, people could criticize anything. Like, people could even criticize you for your existence. Where do you draw the line? MOSLEY: Let's take a short break, Malala. If you're just joining us, my guest is Malala Yousafzai. She's the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate and co-founder of Malala Fund, which advocates for girls' education worldwide. Her new memoir is \"Finding My Way.\" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF METALLICA SONG, \"... AND JUSTICE FOR ALL\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, I'm talking to Malala Yousafzai about her new memoir, \"Finding My Way,\" which chronicles Her coming of age after surviving a Taliban assassination attempt at age 15 and navigating life as a global icon while trying to live as a normal young woman. The book reveals her private struggles with mental health, her complicated relationship with fame and her evolution as an activist. The only panic attacks you still experience, you wrote in the book, are about Afghanistan. Is that still true? YOUSAFZAI: Yes. And I remember when I was in South Africa, I was giving a speech at the Nelson Mandela lecture. And I wanted to support the Afghan women's campaign of gender apartheid. So they're calling leaders to recognize what's happening in the country as a gender apartheid because it is actually systemic oppression. And they want it to, like, be considered as an international crime, and the Taliban should be held accountable for it. So I gave my speech. I did my interviews, you know, we had conversation with South African female activists and allies. And everything went really well. And then on the last night, like in the middle of my sleep, I just suddenly woke up. And I was shaking and sweating. And I had, like, this terrible panic attack where I thought, you know, I could die. I was sort of screaming. And, yeah, it was terrifying. But this time, my husband was with me. And he was holding my hand. And he helped me and supported me. So it was just a reminder that the fear is there. And the fear is for what other Afghan women and girls are experiencing right now. It is terrifying. It is truly terrifying. MOSLEY: And yet at the same time, when you're scrolling on your phone, you make yourself stop to watch the videos of Afghan women being beaten and assaulted. And so, in many ways, you're choosing to retraumatize yourself. Why is it important to be a witness? YOUSAFZAI: You know, I have lived through those experiences. I have seen them. And when we were going through the Taliban's brutal time in our hometown in Swat Valley in the north of Pakistan, we wanted the world to see it because this is a reality that women are actually living. These are not things that, you know, sort of have happened in the past and they have stopped. No, like, these terrible things are happening each and every day. Only a few stories actually make it to social media. So when we see something horrible happening to others, I think even just stopping for a moment and just seeing it, witnessing it so that they know that, you know, that you saw and you were there with them and that you feel anger, you feel the frustration. So I think even when we share emotions, it is a message of solidarity. But, you know, I want Afghan women to know that they're not alone. I think they need more support. And that's the work that I'm supporting through Malala Fund. I'm supporting Afghan activists in the country, outside the country. And I hope that things change for them. MOSLEY: I want to ask you about the United States. Having observed our political landscape, maybe what has surprised you most about the state of women's rights here in the United States? YOUSAFZAI: I think women's rights are a very fragile conversation in many parts of the world, including the United States. And in moments like these, I think women and girls and advocates of women's rights should take a moment to reflect on, you know, how much progress we have actually achieved. I know people often ask that, you know, are we shocked to see these setbacks? And I say, yes, I am shocked to see the setbacks everywhere, most importantly in Afghanistan because, like, imagine girls' education being banned. Like, that's a reality girls in Afghanistan have to live under. Or women being banned from work, that's a reality women have to live under. So it's also a reminder that the activism that we're doing for women's rights is more important than ever because of how fragile these accomplishments have been that they're taken away from us the next moment. So we need to do more to protect women's rights and, like, systematically protect them. So one of the campaigns that Afghan women are leading is to recognize what's happening in Afghanistan as a gender apartheid and to make gender apartheid a part of the crime against humanity treaty. And I know it sounds like too much, too many jargons. But what this basically means is that, you know, currently, we do not have anything in the international law that can recognize the level of systemic oppression that the Taliban imposed. Like, the scale of it is just so big and so intense that they're, like, getting away with it. So if it becomes an international crime, then countries are obliged to react. Countries should not be normalizing relationships with them. And it just helps us have a better accountability system. MOSLEY: The challenge is - you know, I think about the United States' role in this. I know the Trump administration's cuts to international aid, and the reinstatement of policies like this expanded global gag rule, it directly impacts women's access to education and health care worldwide. And I was wondering, given your work, have you seen U.S. policy changes impact girls and women in countries where you work? YOUSAFZAI: Yes. So a lot of the activists that Malala Fund supports also receive grants from USAID. And yes, because of the cuts, their organizations were affected, including one organization in Afghanistan as well. And, you know, for an organization like Malala Fund, so we don't receive government grants. But we knew that these activists, who are working in these important, tough areas of the countries where girls need help with education, need our support more than ever. So we are helping them get, like, fundraising in other ways, and we are also providing them with the funding that they need. So, yes, it's reaching to the work for girls' education. It has affected that. MOSLEY: There's this thing that this sociologist, Tressie McMillan Cottom, says - that freedom, she feels, is a responsibility. Her belief is that the more responsible she is to others, the freer she is. And I feel like this is what I'm hearing from you in a way. I was wondering, does that idea resonate with you? YOUSAFZAI: You know, I don't necessarily think about it in the sense of freedom, but I think about it as a purpose of life. I just reflect on the time when I could not be in school. I was only 11 years old, and the Taliban had banned girls from learning. It has been my life's mission since then that no other girl faces that. I remember recovering from the Taliban bullet and processing this moment that somebody could, like, hurt a child. And since then, it has now become my life's goal that no other child takes a bullet. No other child is punishing - no other child is punished for daring to be in school. So when you face violence, harm and trauma yourself, you understand how terrible and horrible it is that you can no longer see it even happening to anybody else. You know, people often ask me, like, how I felt. I'm like, you know, yes, you know, it was all horrible, but I just cannot see it happening to anyone right now, whether it's girls being banned from school in Afghanistan or girls - schools being bombed in Gaza or children being forced into labor or girls being married off, and, you know, they have to, like, live under these constant wars and violence, all of these things. Like, it's just scary. It's - but I just hope that we can create a world without any war and terror and harm for children, where they can have a childhood of joy and learning, and they can have a safe life. MOSLEY: Malala Yousafzai, thank you so much. YOUSAFZAI: Oh, thank you so much. Nice talking to you.

Stefano Pozzebon. Video by Lali Houghton, Ladan Anoushfar, Estefania Rodriguez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:37 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the bracing morning air, workers leave their homes in the outer suburbs and hurry toward the industrial buildings lining the Guatemalan capital’s highways.\n \n\n   \n  Some go by foot. Others by motorcycle; whole families on the school commute, children in their mothers’ arms. Many more travel on old yellow school buses, imported from the United States after decades of service.\n \n\n   \n  The workers are almost entirely women, ranging from their late teens to early 60s. They stream into factory buildings past heavy metal gates and 10-foot walls topped with barbed wire.\n \n\n   \n  What happens inside these garment factories, known as “maquilas” throughout Central America, is largely hidden from public view – even though they employ tens of thousands of workers and are crucial to Guatemala’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Cameras and other recording devices are not allowed inside, several of the workers told CNN. Independent inspectors are hamstrung by factory bosses, according to government officials. Trade unions are few and attempts to organize are met with threats, firings and, in some cases, violence, the workers said.\n \n\n   \n  What does emerge from these factories is box after box of garments overwhelmingly destined for the US: clothes for some of the biggest brands in North America, such as Carhartt, Target and Ralph Lauren, among others.\n \n\n   \n  After decades of nearshoring policies pursued by successive US administrations, Guatemala has become an integrated hub for cheap apparel – and some of the consequences for the local workforce have been brutal.\n \n\n   \n  A months-long investigation by CNN gathered dozens of testimonies of workplace abuse. Workers spoke of public dressing-downs and threats to fire staff unable to fulfill impossible quotas, wage theft and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n  Some maquila workers told CNN they were given daily quotas of thousands of apparel items, and made to stand for up to 15 hours a day, while earning a minimum wage of less than $500 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t keep up, they flag you out, they discipline you,” said one worker, Rosa Guerra. “They ask us to hurry up and say that they cannot pay us.”\n \n\n   \n  Others described deplorable working conditions: “The (drinking) water was dirty. Sometimes it even had soap or cockroaches in it,” said Merida Jacinto.\n \n\n   \n  But dissent is not an option for the vast majority of maquila workers. Of the more than 850 textile maquilas in Guatemala, only 76 allow a workers’ union, Labor Minister Miriam Roquel told CNN. That’s about 9% of factories.\n \n\n   \n  Guatemala has long been a cheap supplier for US companies. But maquilas took on an increasingly central role during the Covid-19 pandemic, when lockdowns meant many containers sat idle in East Asian ports for months – and US manufacturers looked to production closer to home. Between 2019 and 2022, apparel imports from Guatemala grew 37%, according to data from the US Department of Commerce.\n \n\n   \n  The sector now counts for almost 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, and is so crucial to the economy it was granted an exemption to continue operating during Covid-19 restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Back in Guatemala City, as the light begins to fade from the skyline, the maquila workers emerge from their factories. Now, some are ready to share their stories of the world inside.\n \n\n   \n    What a lifetime of maquila work looks like\n \n\n   \n  Rutilia Cano had worked for the same garment factory for 23 years – until she was abruptly made jobless in February.\n \n\n   \n  An indigenous woman from the Guatemalan highlands, Cano never learnt to read and moved to the capital as a young mother in the 1980s to escape the violent civil conflict between the Guatemalan Army and leftist guerrillas that caused the death of tens of thousands of Maya civilians between the 1960s and the early 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Working in the textile industry was the only job she could land, and the pace of work was brutal. “We were asked to make some 300 t-shirts an hour, but I never managed to,” Cano, now in her late fifties, told CNN. “I’m old, I could only get to 150, 175 t-shirts maybe, and the managers were always coming after me.”\n \n\n   \n  Her dream was to one day return to her village and purchase land to build a house. But for more than three decades her home has been a rundown apartment with a plastic curtain as a door.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of her fellow workers, Cano was never able to purchase the fruits of her labor. The t-shirts, skirts and more that she made at the factory – owned by Korean company KOA Modas – were supplied to US retailer Target and sold abroad. Throughout her employment Cano was never under contract with Target, who – as a third-party client – was not responsible for her layoff. Target used an intermediary to purchase garments from KOA Modas, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  On a rare visit to a large department store that sells international brands, Cano ran her strong hands shaped by a lifetime of sewing along the hanging rails of clothes. “It would take me days to afford what is on offer here,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the garment factories here are run by Korean companies, who control almost two-thirds of investments in the Guatemalan textile industry, according to a 2022 report by USAID.\n \n\n   \n  In this intricate supply chain, US brands do not have formal relationships with most of the Guatemalan workers who manufacture garments on their behalf, nor are they legally responsible for the working conditions inside the maquilas.\n \n\n   \n  However, they benefit from a pattern of sub-contracting deals that keep prices down and deliveries running unabated, advocates have said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a company fact sheet, big US brand Ralph Lauren purchases from 17 facilities across Guatemala, some of which are owned by Korean companies. Ralph Lauren did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on its supplier relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Mother-of-three Cano had been looking forward to retiring one day and spending more time with her family. But in February, that future was upended when Cano’s factory declared bankruptcy. Labor inspectors told her the factory’s ownership had left millions of dollars in outstanding payments to the Guatemalan welfare agency. Cano’s pension was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “I was due some 80-90,000 quetzales ($11,000)… and nothing. I feel so sad because we all lost our jobs, even me, a single mother. It’s just sad…” Cano told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Target told CNN suppliers are required to comply with lawful, safe and respectful working conditions and that the company decided to end the relationship with KOA Modas because the factory did not comply with its standards.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to KOA Modas for comment, but did not receive a response at time of publishing.\n \n\n   \n  After the factory closed, Cano joined litigation involving Sae-A Trading, another Korean company which used to purchase KOA Modas’s apparel on Target’s behalf and, after a lengthy legal battle, pledged to fulfill the vast majority of severance payments.\n \n\n   \n  While Sae-A Trading has no legal responsibility for the workers, it agreed to make a “humanitarian contribution” to those affected by the closure, it said in a resolution document. Its contribution of $3.3million is “considered a loan,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Such severances are “by far the largest single sum of money most of these families will ever see in their lives,” Scott Nova, executive director at the Worker Rights Consortium, a US-based organization that investigates the garment industry, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He said it was common in the industry for workers not to receive their pension, adding “it’s difficult to put into words how financially and psychologically devastating it is to work 20 years to earn this one sizable, real pot of money, and then just have it taken from you.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN last spoke with Cano in late September, she was still waiting to be paid under the settlement with Sae-A Trading. “I need that money,” she told CNN, adding “at my age I’m struggling to get work – the only thing I could do is cleaning houses but that is very tiring.”\n \n\n   \n    A culture of fear\n \n\n   \n  For other maquila workers, simply joining their factory’s trade union – if it even exists – can be met with trepidation.\n \n\n   \n  Corina Olivares is one of the union representatives at the Texpia II factory, also owned by Sae-A Trading. She took over after her predecessor, Anastacio Tzib Caal, was shot dead outside of Guatemala City in June last year.\n \n\n   \n  In the months leading up to Caal’s death, obscenity-ridden threats appeared on the walls of workers’ toilets, which CNN has seen photos of. “Unionists, son of b****es, resign or we will lynch you,” read one, with the stylized image of a revolver mimicking a signature. “Unionist b**ch, go to sh*t don’t mess with the factory, be grateful it’s given you to eat for many years,” read another.\n \n\n   \n  While the US Department of Labor implied Caal’s murder was linked to his union activity, Olivares wasn’t so certain. However, she added, the threats made her seriously question whether to run as his successor: “For months, I was genuinely scared to walk to work,” she said. Olivares told CNN that the company blamed the union – which had campaigned for reduced working hours and clean drinking water being made available between shifts – for a contraction in trade. The resulting hostility from other workers toward union members made her feel unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Texpia II confirmed that threatening graffiti appeared between May and June last year but stressed that factory’s management took actions to condemn the threats and support union activities.\n \n\n   \n  Any form of verbal abuse or personal harassment is not tolerated at Texpia II, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, VESTEX, the civil association representing the textile export industry in Guatemala, said in a statement to CNN that the group’s Code of Conduct strictly bans verbal and physical abuse, including corporal punishment, coercion and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n    Power dynamics and sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n  Inside factories, the balance of power between the male-dominated management and the mostly female workers can lead to another disturbing problem.\n \n\n   \n  Worker Laura, who chose to remain anonymous, described how one manager would touch her inappropriately at work. “I knew it was not okay, but I was too scared to speak out,” she told CNN. “I didn’t know that inside a maquila, female workers were so exposed to the middle managers, as if a man who thinks he’s superior to us can dominate in such a way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Another worker, Alexandra, who also preferred to remain anonymous, told CNN of a manager who sexually harassed her for years. “He would come toward me from my back in a really creepy way, putting his hands on my neck, touching me in a way that made me very uncomfortable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When she rejected his advances, Alexandra said the manager would change her shifts, and scold and insult her in front of other workers.\n \n\n   \n  When Alexandra and her colleagues complained about sexual and workplace abuse, she told CNN that the answer from upper managers was always that they were free to leave.\n \n\n   \n  In reality, Alexandra had few options but to stay on, telling CNN that she could not afford to be unemployed, and resigning would have meant giving up her severance pay.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory sells almost exclusively to the US market. Past clients include Carhartt, which told CNN it parted ways with the factory in 2019, though it does continue to purchase from Guatemala more broadly.\n \n\n   \n    Powerless to intervene\n \n\n   \n  Instead of quitting, Alexandra decided to join a workers’ union. The group relayed the abuse to the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor. But when labor inspectors were sent to the factory earlier this year, the company’s management refused to meet with them, video seen by CNN shows.\n \n\n   \n  The following week, all the members of the union were laid off.\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, the Ministry of Labor has continued to engage with the company, with no results. “(More recently) We tried to enter that maquila with our inspectors to register the workers’ conditions,” labor inspector Silvia Juarez told CNN. “We simply couldn’t: the management barricaded behind a shut door and we would need police intervention to break through,” she told CNN, gritting her teeth.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory did not respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN. However, the textile factories trade association VESTEX, told CNN in a statement that the group works hand in hand with the labor inspectorate to make sure regulations are respected.\n \n\n   \n  The Guatemalan president, Bernardo Arévalo, is the first progressive leader to be elected in the country in decades. His inauguration in 2024, after years of political malaise, raised hopes that rampant corruption and chronic malpractices could finally be reined in. But change is taking longer than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “What has been lacking in Guatemala is the political will to make public institutions work,” the president told CNN, a nod to the abuse in the maquila sector that has been infamous since at least the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Arévalo’s government raised the minimum wage for maquila workers by 6% and has pledged to do more to enforce existing regulation. But as the labor ministry’s inability to engage with shows, the state can do only so much.\n \n\n   \n  Months after their dismissal, most of the workers fired along with Alexandra told CNN they were getting by doing odd jobs and had struggled to find a new employer – their membership in the union apparently a stain in the eyes of other maquila   owners.\n \n\n   \n  The future for these maquila workers feels even more uncertain as the White House has imposed import tariffs on several countries that play a key role in the supply chain, leaving textile workers around the world exposed. The impact of those tariffs is yet to be felt in Guatemala, but other countries such as Lesotho and Haiti are already facing a bleak outcome.\n \n\n   \n  Prachi Agarwal, a research fellow at the ODI think tank, has written about a “gendered supply chain shock” as the vast majority of the workforce in the global garment industry are women.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra meanwhile has decided to cut ties with the sector altogether. She hopes her daughter – who is studying law – will have a brighter career.\n \n\n   \n  “I will never want my daughter to work in a maquila. Ever,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Credits\n \n\n   \n  Reporter: Stefano Pozzebon\n \n\n   \n  Editor: Sheena McKenzie\n \n\n   \n  Video Journalist: Lali Houghton\n \n\n   \n  Video editor: Estefania Rodriguez\n \n\n   \n  Field producer: Sofia Menchú\n \n\n   \n  Commissioning editor: Ladan Anoushfar\n \n\n   \n  Copy editor:   Andy Raine\n \n\n   \n  Associate Producer: Marta Simonella\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/sport/soccer-mjallby-sweden-champion-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"06:25:00+00:00","title":"How a tiny Swedish team achieved one of the biggest ever shocks in European soccer","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mjällby AIF, a tiny football team from the Swedish fishing village of Hällevik with a population of around 1,500, has won the Allsvenskan — the top-tier Swedish league — in a stunning upset, defeating elite teams including Malmö FF and IFK Göteborg.

Barton, Issy Ronald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:25 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a small  Swedish  fishing village, there is a tiny soccer stadium tucked away beside a campsite and the shores of the Baltic Sea. It is the type of place where the land is so flat that the horizon sits just above the trees and the sky stretches so wide it seems possible to touch.\n \n\n   \n  Here, in this unassuming spot, is where one of the greatest ever stories in  European soccer  unfolded this season. No one expected Mjällby AIF, a team that plays in a village of around 1,500 inhabitants, to contend for the Swedish league. After all, its budget is a fraction of some of Sweden’s biggest teams.\n \n\n   \n  Yet somehow, on Monday, the team completed one of the sport’s biggest shocks and won the  Allsvenskan  – the top tier of Swedish soccer.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s 1,500 inhabitants in the village where they play, and you’re just flabbergasted when you see this elite football going on,” Erik Hadzic – a reporter for TV4 Fotbollskanalen, who has covered the team for the last five years – tells  CNN Sports .\n \n\n   \n  “Mjällby winning the Swedish championship is arguably the biggest sensation in the history of the Swedish league.”\n \n\n   \n  The tiny team from Hällevik has not just won the league, either. It has absolutely blown away the competition.\n \n\n   \n  Having lost just one game all season, it is currently 11 points ahead of nearest challenger Hammarby in second, and with its 2-0 win over IFK Göteborg, Mjällby assured the title with three games remaining.\n \n\n   \n  Win even one of its remaining fixtures – or draw two – and Mjällby will set a new record for the  most points ever  amassed by an Allsvenskan team, beating the record set by Swedish giant Malmö FF in 2010 and matched by AIK in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “Malmö is the richest club in Sweden and Mjällby has something like 15% of their budget, so everyone believed that Malmö would go on and win their third title in a row before this season started,” explains Hadzic.\n \n\n   \n  Even when Mjällby enjoyed a strong start to the season, the team still wasn’t seen as a title contender. It was only after defeating Malmö in August that “all of a sudden, it felt like, ‘Yeah, they could really make it,’” Hadzic adds.\n \n\n   \n  European soccer is no stranger to David and Goliath stories in recent years.  Leicester City ,  Bayer Leverkusen  and Montpellier have all shocked their respective leagues to claim unlikely titles.\n \n\n   \n  But even those stories did not begin a decade prior, stranded in the third tier and fighting bankruptcy.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t really compare because Leicester still had really wealthy owners,” Olof Lundh, a Swedish sports journalist, tells CNN Sports. “I have a hard time finding equivalent achievements, especially considering they’re from this really small municipality.\n \n\n   \n  “They shouldn’t even be in the top division,” he adds. “Just being in the top division is impressive, and being in the top half of the top division is super impressive and then winning the title, it’s incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  The obvious question, then, is: how exactly did this happen? How is it possible for a team from a village approximately 1/250th the size of Malmö to fight off Sweden’s elite and have arguably the best season in the nation’s history?\n \n\n   \n  Under chairman Magnus Emeus, a local businessman who returned to his hometown after working abroad, Mjällby has followed a philosophy whereby “you’re supposed to be able to measure everything,” says Lundh.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they’ve just been really smart and worked really hard,” adds Hadzic. “They’ve been tremendously good in their scouting. They’ve found some good players, they’re giving players a second chance and they’ve just blossomed at Mjällby.”\n \n\n   \n  And when your town is so small that everyone knows everyone else – Mjällby’s head coach is a school principal and its scout is a postman – your weaknesses can become your biggest strengths.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a team based on very high team spirit,” Hadzic explains. “Some of the players live in the same flat.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something I never thought would happen in my life. I’m so incredibly grateful for this group,” striker Jacob Bergstrom said Monday, according to Reuters. “We showed that a collective can take you incredibly far, we have a lot of players who give everything for Mjällby, it’s fantastic.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been here for eight years (in total) and I have my best friends playing here and it’s all just wonderful, so I’m grateful.”\n \n\n   \n  That spirit seeps out into the local community, too; the local florist recently  developed  its own chocolates to honor the club’s achievement.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, in sporting director Hasse Larsson, Mjällby has a man who has given decades of his life to the club.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s like the heart and soul of the club,” says Hadzic. “He’s been a player, a manager, and now he’s a sporting director. Somehow, his soul embodies the whole club. He’s willing to do so much for Mjällby and willing to work so hard for them.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, luck has played its part in Mjällby’s triumph. The club has taken advantage of several of the league’s biggest teams, including Malmö, underperforming and all beating each other, Lund pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  That hard work will most likely continue ahead of next season when, should it emerge from the qualifying stage, Mjällby would be taking on Europe’s elite in the  Champions League . The thought of the likes of  Real Madrid  or Liverpool making the journey to the edge of the Baltic Sea is one that the team’s fans would have laughed at just 12 months ago.\n \n\n   \n  “I have a hard time putting it into words, I can honestly say. It’s so incredibly powerful,” Mjällby head coach Anders Torstensson said after Monday’s win, per Reuters. “Together with the team, we have kept it away from us, the pressure, the speculations and what is possible and not possible. It’s fantastic.\n \n\n   \n  “Redeeming to stand here as Swedish champions with little bloody Mjällby. It’s unreal.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581409","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Mental exercise can reverse a brain change linked to aging, study finds","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 10-week study of 92 healthy individuals aged 65 or older found that intensive cognitive training—specifically using the scientifically backed BrainHQ program—led to a 2.3% increase in acetylcholine levels in brain regions critical for attention and memory, including the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus.

A 10-week study of people 65 or older found that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day increased levels of the chemical messenger  acetylcholine  by 2.3% in a brain area involved in attention and memory. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The increase \"is not huge,\" says  Étienne de Villers-Sidani , a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal. \"But it's significant, considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade normally just with aging.\" So, at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years.

Never skip brain day  The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, comes amid a proliferation of online brain-training programs, including Lumosity, Elevate, Peak, CogniFit and BrainHQ. But it has been hard to know whether these programs really work, says de Villers-Sidani, who directs the cognitive disorders clinic at McGill's Montreal Neurological Institute. \"They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures,\" he says, \"but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain and how is it changing the brain?\" So de Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that's closely associated with cognitive performance. Acetylcholine levels typically begin a gradual decline around middle age. The levels drop sharply, though, in people with Alzheimer's disease. The team studied 92 healthy people who were 65 or older. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Half the participants spent 30 minutes a day playing computer games like solitaire and Candy Crush. The others spent the same amount of time each day doing cognitive exercises that are part of the scientifically tested program BrainHQ. The program challenges users to remember the type and location of items that appear and disappear with increasing speed. \"It's really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and it kind of pushes you to the limit,\" de Villers-Sidani says. The researchers used a  special kind of PET scan  to detect changes in acetylcholine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors. \"I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest,\" de Villers-Sidani says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But they did. In people who played games like solitaire, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But in people who did cognitive training, there was a significant increase. Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory. Even modest changes are meaningful, Hasselmo says, because acetylcholine does more than carry messages in the brain. It also modulates the behavior of neurons in ways that affect learning, memory and attention. So when a person takes, say, a high dose of the motion sickness drug scopolamine — which blocks the effects of acetylcholine — things start to go awry. \"If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain, a person can't even think,\" Hasselmo says. \"You go into a delirious state.\" On the other hand, even small increases in acetylcholine can have a \"profound and notable effect\" on memory and thinking in older people. Hasselmo notes that the  earliest Alzheimer's drugs  reduced symptoms by increasing levels of acetylcholine. Now, he says, intensive brain training has the potential to achieve similar gains and stave off cognitive decline. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Scientists have produced the first compelling evidence that mental exercise can cause biological changes in a human brain. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on a new study showing that intensive cognitive training reversed a process associated with aging. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: The internet is filled with brain-training programs that promise to improve thinking and memory. But Etienne de Villers-Sidani of McGill University in Canada says it's been hard to know whether they really work. ETIENNE DE VILLERS-SIDANI: They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures, but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain, and how is it changing the brain? HAMILTON: So De Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of a chemical messenger that's closely associated with cognitive performance. It's called acetylcholine. He says levels tend to fall starting in middle age. DE VILLERS-SIDANI: For every decade after the age of 40, 45, you get around 2.5% decline in this neurotransmitter in key brain areas. HAMILTON: The decline is much faster in people with Alzheimer's disease. The researchers studied 92 healthy people who were at least 65 years old. De Villers-Sidani says during the 10-week study, half of the participants spent 30 minutes a day doing mental exercises. These came from a science-backed cognitive training program called Brain HQ. DE VILLERS-SIDANI: Which is really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and its characteristic is that it kind of pushes you to the limit. HAMILTON: By asking you to remember more and more in less and less time - other participants spent their time playing video games like Solitaire and Candy Crush. The researchers used a special kind of PET scan to detect changes in acetylcholine levels. De Villers-Sidani says they focused on the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors. DE VILLERS-SIDANI: I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest. HAMILTON: But they did. In people who played video games, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But De Villers-Sidani says in people who did cognitive training, there was a meaningful increase. DE VILLERS-SIDANI: It was about 2.3%, which is not huge, but it's significant considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade, normally just with aging. HAMILTON: So at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years. Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, appears in the journal JMIR Serious Games. Michael Hasselmo, a neuroscientist at Boston University, says he was impressed by the result. MICHAEL HASSELMO: It was compelling enough that I looked up the task myself and thought, maybe I need to be doing this task. HAMILTON: Hasselmo has spent much of his career studying acetylcholine, which is a chemical messenger that also modulates the behavior of neurons. HASSELMO: If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain with a drug such as scopolamine, a person can't even think. You basically go into a delirious state. HAMILTON: Low levels of acetylcholine are a hallmark of Alzheimer's and appear to contribute to the declines in memory and thinking. But Hasselmo says even small increases in this neurotransmitter can noticeably improve cognitive function. He says a cup of coffee boosts levels enough to improve attention and speed up reactions. HASSELMO: Changing things by 2.5% could have a pretty profound and notable effect even on a subjective level. HAMILTON: Hasselmo says the first Alzheimer's drugs reduce symptoms by increasing acetylcholine. Now, he says, it looks like hardcore brain training can offer a similar benefit.

the Israel-Hamas truce on track \n         By Greg Myre \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 9:04 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         TEL AVIV, Israel — Vice President Vance said Wednesday the Israel-Hamas ceasefire is holding, but he acknowledged the challenges involved in trying to end the war entirely. \"We have a very tough task ahead of us, which is to disarm Hamas but rebuild Gaza,\" Vance said after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Vance is part of a high-profile U.S. team that's in Israel this week with the mission of keeping the truce on track and trying to extend it to a more challenging second phase.    Netanyahu is universally known in Israel as \"Bibi.\" The Israeli media is calling this American contingent the \"Bibisitters.\" In addition to Vance, it includes Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of U.S. Central Command. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also expected this week. For his part, Netanyahu described the meeting with Vance as an \"opportunity to make decisions jointly in a very tight-knit and trusted partnership.\" While the Americans are having wide-ranging talks with the Israelis, U.S. officials are not expected to meet Hamas. The U.S. classifies Hamas as a terrorist group, which prohibits contact. In a rare exception, Witkoff and Kushner said they met Hamas leaders in Egypt to nail down the final details of the ceasefire, which took effect Oct. 10. The truce holds, with many steps ahead The Gaza ceasefire has largely held aside from a  flare-up in fighting  last Sunday that left two Israeli soldiers and more than 40 Palestinians dead. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       However, the so-called Phase 2 of the truce deals with more difficult problems. Gaza doesn't have a government, and it's not clear when it will get one. The Hamas leadership was decimated in the war, and the  ceasefire agreement  says the group will not take part in a future government. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The agreement says 15 nonpartisan technocrats will take over on an interim basis, but there's no timetable. Asked about the lack of government in Gaza, Vance said other needs should be meet first, including food, medicine and security. \"If we get to the point where we're arguing exactly what the governing structure in Gaza is long term, we should pat ourselves on the back because that's a very good problem to have. But I won't anticipate that problem before we actually have it,\" Vance said. Vance made those remarks Tuesday in southern Israel, barely 10 miles from the Gaza border. He visited a civilian-military coordination center built in the last few days by 200 U.S. troops. This center will include officials from the U.S. and other countries, as well as aid groups and others working in Gaza. The goal is to make sure everyone is operating from the same playbook. The ceasefire plan also calls for Hamas to \"decommission\" its weapons, though the group has not publicly stated it will do this. Vance stressed that it should happen, but declined to say exactly how this would work. In addition, Israeli troops — who still control half of Gaza — are required to pull back as the territory stabilizes. Foreign troops are supposed to replace the Israelis in Gaza as an international stabilization force. However, there's no word on what countries will supply the troops, when they might arrive or exactly what their mandate would be. Israel is already making clear it will have the final say on which troops are allowed to take part in the force. Trump plays a leading role, but no troops on the ground Meanwhile, Trump has long said he will keep the U.S. out of \"forever wars.\" Yet he also sees himself as a master negotiator who's able to end wars. He's widely credited for bringing about the Gaza truce after two years of intense fighting. His administration also stresses that the 200 U.S. troops in Israel will work at the coordination center in Israel and will not go into Gaza. Still, U.S. presidents dating back to Harry Truman have sought to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And so far, none has managed a full-fledged peace. \n         \n         Transcript \n         A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:   Vice President JD Vance is in Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Vance says the Gaza ceasefire is making progress despite fighting between Israel and Hamas over the weekend. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Vance and several other U.S. officials in Israel are trying to get the two sides to take the next steps under the deal. They acknowledge it will be challenging. MARTÍNEZ: All right. Let's hear from NPR's Greg Myre in Tel Aviv. So, Greg, the ceasefire mostly is holding. So how is JD Vance describing what he's seeing? GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Yeah. The vice president says it's actually going better than he expected. We're almost two weeks in and the ceasefire is largely holding, aside from a significant flare-up of fighting last Sunday. But the next phase poses some hard problems, and we can't emphasize this enough. Gaza doesn't have a government, and it's not clear when it will get one. When asked about this, Vance said other things should happen first. The people of Gaza need food, medicine, security. And then he added... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JD VANCE: If we get to the point where we're arguing exactly what the governance structure in Gaza is long-term, then we should pat ourselves on the back. That's a very good problem to have. But I won't anticipate that problem before we actually have it. MARTÍNEZ: OK. So what is the Trump administration doing to work on these priorities that Vance has mentioned? MYRE: Vance spoke in southern Israel, just 10 miles or so from Gaza, at a civilian military coordination center built in the last few days by 200 U.S. troops. This operations center will include officials from the U.S. and other countries, as well as aid groups and others working in Gaza. The goal is to make sure everybody is operating from the same playbook. The head of the U.S. Central Command, Admiral Brad Cooper, has overseen this work, and he was there as well with Vance. So was Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Collectively, this reflects the major effort the Trump administration is making to get this ceasefire to stick. Now, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is universally known here as Bibi, and the Israeli media is calling this American contingent meeting with him Bibisitters. They have a lot of work ahead of them. This next phase calls for Hamas to give up its weapons, for Israeli soldiers to pull back and for international troops to replace them in Gaza as a stabilization force. MARTÍNEZ: The thing is, though, these ceasefires between Israel and Hamas don't have a great track record. I mean, did President Trump get ahead of himself by declaring peace in Gaza? MYRE: Well, you can certainly see some parallels to President George W. Bush in the Iraq War back in 2003. Just a few weeks into that war, Bush went aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier and essentially declared the fighting over in front of a huge banner that read, mission accomplished. And of course, the U.S. ultimately fought for many years in Iraq. That should be a cautionary tale for the Middle East. Yet at the ceasefire signing ceremony last week in Egypt, Trump stood in front of a huge banner that read, peace in the Middle East. MARTÍNEZ: But, you know, Trump has long said that he'll keep the U.S. out of what he calls our forever wars. I mean, isn't Israel and Palestine - isn't that conflict the very definition of a forever war? MYRE: Well, absolutely, A. And Trump sort of seems torn about this. He says he wants to avoid open-ended conflicts, yet he also believes he's a master negotiator who's able to end wars. He keeps saying he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize, but he's very much taking ownership here of this conflict. Now, that's also true of many previous U.S. presidents, and none of them were able to forge a full-fledged Middle East peace. MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Greg Myre in Tel Aviv. Greg, thanks.

Republicans advance Trump's redistricting fight into swing-state North Carolina \n         By Adam Wagner \n        \n           Updated Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 1:49 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina has become the first swing state to draw new congressional districts amid a nationwide arms race between Republicans and Democrats to secure additional seats ahead of next year's midterm election. President Trump initiated the mid-decade battle to help the GOP keep control of the U.S. House. In North Carolina, Republican legislative leaders  announced last week  they wanted to redraw the map with the aim of winning 11 of the state's 14 congressional districts. The GOP currently controls 10 of the seats. To accomplish that, Republicans focused on the 1st Congressional District, in the northeastern corner of the state. The 1st is the state's only swing district and has been represented by Black lawmakers for decades, most recently two-term U.S. Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat. \"These maps are a political weapon\" The map moves six coastal counties and some precincts in another county into the 1st Congressional District, making it more conservative. In return, four agriculture-oriented counties around Goldsboro, Kinston and Wilson are shifted into the 3rd District. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Opponents argue that the new map dilutes the voting power of Black residents in eastern North Carolina. \"These maps are a political weapon, and Black voters are the target,\" said Sen. Kandie Smith, who along with all 19 of her Democratic colleagues formally protested the new map Monday. The proportion of Black voters in the prior 1st District was about 40%, higher than any other in the state. That drops to 32% under the new map, while the proportion of Black voters in the 3rd District only rises to 29%. Republicans have maintained they are drawing the new districts to help their political party. \"Republicans hold a razor-thin margin in the United States House of Representatives,\" state Sen. Ralph Hise, who drew the new map with help from staff, told a legislative committee on Monday. \"And if Democrats flip four seats in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take control of the House and torpedo President Trump's agenda.\" The GOP rationale is likely an attempt to get ahead of lawsuits, said Chris Cooper, director of Western Carolina University's Haire Institute for Public Policy. Both North Carolina courts and the U.S. Supreme Court have ruled in recent years that they will not overturn maps on the basis of partisan gerrymandering but could if a map represents a racial gerrymander. (The U.S. Supreme Court  may soon rule differently  on racial gerrymanders.) \"If [North Carolina Republicans] can say that partisanship part out loud, I think they probably think that puts them on even better, firmer grounds,\" Cooper said. More congressional maps than elections Redistricting has become a near-constant in North Carolina politics. Typically, redistricting only happens at the beginning of a decade, after new census results. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But lawsuits and court rulings have meant that the map just passed is the state's seventh congressional map since 2016, and the fifth version this decade. That's more maps than elections. Unlike most of the other maps, the North Carolina General Assembly decided to draw this latest one. In most other cases, either state or federal courts directed it to draw new districts in response to claims of partisan or racial gerrymandering. The most recent congressional map follows a 2023 ruling by a new GOP majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court, which  reversed a previous decision  finding a map unconstitutional due to partisan gerrymandering. That 2023 ruling set the stage for the general assembly to do away with a map that had resulted in seven Republicans and seven Democrats in Congress, in favor of a 2024 map that made three additional seats safely Republican. Part of a national arms race The Republican-led North Carolina House gave final approval to the plan Wednesday, after passage in the state Senate. Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, can't veto redistricting proposals. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The new North Carolina map has become part of a larger congressional redistricting battle. At Trump's urging, Texas started the fight earlier this year, with GOP lawmakers there redrawing maps to shift five seats toward their party. California responded by putting a referendum on the state's ballot in November that, if passed, would shift five seats toward Democrats. Meanwhile, Republicans in Missouri redrew their districts to shift one seat toward the GOP, although there is  an effort underway  to secure enough signatures to require that voters approve the new map in a referendum. Republicans have their sights on other states, including Indiana and Kansas. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   The mid-decade redistricting battle between the two major political parties has now moved to the swing state of North Carolina. This is a battle President Trump is waging to help Republicans hold the U.S. House. And in North Carolina, GOP lawmakers are hoping to pick up one more congressional seat. The North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner is in Raleigh, and he joins us now with the latest. Hey, Adam. ADAM WAGNER, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: So give us a little primer. What's the plan in North Carolina? WAGNER: Sure. Republicans are targeting North Carolina's 1st Congressional District. That's represented by Don Davis, a moderate Democrat. It's also the only swing district in the state, and Davis has narrowly won it twice. The new map basically swaps a total of 10 counties between the 1st and the 3rd Districts, and if it goes into effect, Republicans would have a clear advantage in 11 of North Carolina's 14 congressional districts. KELLY: Eleven of the 14 seats - and I just called North Carolina a swing state. I mean, it basically is a swing state. That's pretty remarkable. WAGNER: It is, yeah. So this is a state that President Donald Trump has won three times, but at the same time, it elected Democratic governors all three times. And North Carolina's governor can't veto redistricting proposals. What's kind of striking about this particular one is how quickly it's moved. Republican leaders announced their plan last Monday, and it's moving through the legislature this week. KELLY: And Republican lawmakers, when you ask them what's the rationale, what do they tell you? WAGNER: They've been pretty clear. This is to help the GOP hold the House and to boost the Trump administration agenda. Here's Senate Republican leader Phil Berger answering questions on the Senate floor yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PHIL BERGER: The redrawing of District 1 was done based on a political calculation and a determination that that district could be redrawn for a Republican to have a better chance of winning. That's the only reason it was done. WAGNER: There's some thought that insisting that this gerrymandering is being done for partisan reasons is an attempt to get ahead of the lawsuits that everybody's expecting. Both state and federal courts have said that they can't overturn maps because they offer one party or the other an unfair advantage. KELLY: And what do Democrats say to all this, Adam? WAGNER: So all 20 Democratic members of the North Carolina Senate have formally protested the bill. And during debate yesterday, they argued that this new map splits up a bloc of Black voters in rural North Carolina. Here's Senator Kandie Smith. She represents the area around Greenville, North Carolina. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KANDIE SMITH: These maps are a political weapon, and Black voters are the target. This bill and these maps are designed to fracture historic coalitions, diminish voter turnout and protect incumbents at the expense of the will of the people. WAGNER: The racial elements of this new map will likely be the crux of any lawsuit against it. Republicans are insisting that they didn't consider racial data when they were drawing this map. But the 1st District has elected Black lawmakers to Congress for 32 consecutive years, and the new map moves a significant proportion of Black voters out of that district. So right now, about 40% of voters in the 1st are Black. That's the highest of any congressional district in the state. And this new map would drop that to about 32%. KELLY: And just by way of backdrop, we're talking about the new map, but one thing that is striking is how many new maps North Carolina has had - how often the map has changed there over the last decade, right? WAGNER: Yeah. Redistricting is basically a near constant in North Carolina politics. Because of lawsuits and court orders, the map that's now under consideration would be the state's seventh congressional map since 2016... KELLY: Wow. WAGNER: ...And the fifth version this decade. And just to be clear, that's more maps than there have been elections. What's different here is that typically, state or federal courts have told the general assembly to draw a new map because of claims of partisan or racial gerrymandering. But lawmakers are doing it this time on their own - they say to help Trump. KELLY: That is North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner. Thank you, Adam. WAGNER: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580211","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:40:00-04:00","title":"Reversing peanut advice prevented tens of thousands of allergy cases, researchers say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2025 reveals that reversing the long-standing advice of avoiding peanuts in early infancy has led to a significant drop in food allergies.

tens of thousands of allergy cases, researchers say \n         By Bill Chappell \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 3:40 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         For years, parents were told not to expose their babies to peanuts, to prevent a potentially dangerous allergy. But 10 years ago,  a landmark study  found the opposite to be true, stating that if babies consume peanut products at an early age, they were far less likely to become allergic to them. Health experts quickly took notice — and the resulting reversal in pediatric guidance has helped to push peanuts out of the No. 1 spot as the cause of food allergy for children under 3 in the U.S., according to  a new study published  in the peer-reviewed journal  Pediatrics . \"Early allergen introduction works,\" Dr. David Hill, who led the study, tells NPR. \"For the first time in recent history, it seems like we're starting to put a brake pedal on the epidemic of food allergy in this country.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Growing concerns over food allergies have reshaped parts of Americans' diet, from schools and camps banning peanut butter in sandwiches to airlines nixing once-ubiquitous bags of salted nuts. In 2015,  The New England Journal of Medicine  referenced a quadrupling of peanut allergy's prevalence in U.S. children, citing growth from 0.4% in 1997 to more than 2% in 2010. But when U.S. health guidance changed in 2015 and 2017, so did that trend, according to Hill, a pediatric allergist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who's also an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania. \"There was a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence,\" Hill says, \"and a 36% reduction in any food allergy prevalence.\" He estimates that the changed guidelines have prevented peanut allergies in at least 40,000 children in the last decade. The tipping point in peanut allergy prevention dates to 2015, when  research was published  that aimed to solve a puzzle: Why was peanut allergy 10 times higher among Jewish children in the U.K. than among Israeli children with similar ancestry? Researchers noted that while British and U.S. parents kept their babies away from peanut products, many Israeli parents  routinely fed their infants a puffy peanut snack  called Bamba. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The revised recommendations, including in the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans , calls for introducing infants deemed at high risk for peanut allergy to foods containing peanuts as early as 4 to 6 months, in line with advice published in 2017 by the  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . Hill and his colleagues looked at the rate of food allergy in young children before and after the revised guidelines for peanuts and other allergens were published. They did that by analyzing the health data of more than 120,000 children in the U.S. using records from dozens of different pediatric practices. Dr. Corinne Keet, a professor of pediatrics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who works in the epidemiology of food allergy, says she finds the study interesting, even if she's cautious about reading too much into it. She wasn't involved in the research. \"I'm a little bit surprised by these findings because I might have expected that we might have more diagnoses just because people were thinking about allergies more\" in the past decade, she says. Part of the reason for her caution, Keet says, is that her own research has found families haven't been fully implementing the new guidelines, in many cases due to fear that exposing an infant to peanut products might also endanger a sibling or parent who's allergic. Keet also says it's simply difficult to conduct a high-quality study about food allergy prevalence. She notes that the influential 2015 study, called  LEAP  (Learning Early about Peanut Allergy), produced definitive results by conducting a large clinical trial following hundreds of young kids over time. Hill and his colleagues acknowledge that their study has limitations, such as relying on diagnostic codes — which aren't necessarily equivalent to actual allergy rates. Their data also does not include information about children's eating habits. Still, he sees the study as another positive sign that a strategic shift is helping children. The benefits are far-reaching, he adds, because many peanut allergies are a lifetime condition. \"It's highly persistent,\" Hill says. \"Only about 10% of kids who develop a peanut allergy will outgrow that peanut allergy.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   A major study from 2015 changed our understanding of how to prevent peanut allergies. Ten years later, researchers say that approach is working. NPR's Bill Chappell reports. BILL CHAPPELL, BYLINE: For years, American parents were told not to expose their babies to peanuts too early to prevent a potentially dangerous allergy. Dr. David Hill is a pediatric allergist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. DAVID HILL: And that was well-intentioned, right? These are the youngest, potentially most vulnerable of our society. CHAPPELL: But in 2015, a landmark study found the opposite to be true, saying that if babies eat peanut products at an early age, around 4 to 6 months, they're less likely to become allergic. To gauge the success of early introduction, Hill and his colleagues conducted another study. They looked at the rate of food allergy in young children before and after the guidelines changed by analyzing the health data of some 120,000 children across the U.S. HILL: What we found was that there was a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence. CHAPPELL: They also found more than a third reduction in any food allergy prevalence. HILL: That equates to around 40,000 prevented cases of peanut allergy and around 60,000 prevented cases of food allergy altogether. CHAPPELL: Their findings were published on Monday in the journal Pediatrics. CORINNE KEET: I would definitely say I'm cautious about reading too much into it. CHAPPELL: Dr. Corinne Keet is a professor of pediatrics at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (ph). KEET: I'm looking for more information to confirm these findings.

The measure,  intended to  shorten the amount of time successful songs spend on the Hot 100, knocks 10 tracks off this week's chart — including Swims' \"Lose Control,\" which spent more than two years on the Hot 100 — and in the process cements a record that could take a decade to surpass. Billboard  has long had a problem with streaming — as well as with radio stations' growing reluctance to pull hit songs from heavy rotation after many, many months. When you look at the list of the songs with the longest-ever runs on the Hot 100 (a chart whose history dates back to 1958), they're all from the streaming era. Streaming services use algorithms that feed people songs they've already played, and that's created a doom loop that's allowed recent-vintage songs like  The Weeknd 's \"Blinding Lights\" (90 weeks on the Hot 100),  Glass Animals ' \"Heat Waves\" (91 weeks) and Swims' \"Lose Control\" (112 weeks) to stay on the chart for absurdly long runs. Until this week,  Billboard  employed a system that seemed reasonable enough: Songs were pulled from the Hot 100 if they'd dropped below No. 25 after 52 weeks, or below No. 50 after 20 weeks. That generally prevented the chart's lower reaches from getting crowded with stubborn-but-declining hits — endlessly charting smashes like  Post Malone 's \"I Had Some Help (feat.  Morgan Wallen )\" and  Shaboozey 's \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" finally dropped off the chart in recent months thanks to this system — but didn't have an answer for songs that just weren't descending far enough or quickly enough. Effective this week, the thresholds have moved dramatically, in ways that will reshape the charts in the months and years to come. Now, if a song drops below No. 5 after 78 weeks — a year and a half! — it's gone. (Consider that \"Lose Control\" sat at No. 6 before  The Life of a Showgirl  came along.) If a song drops below No. 10 after 52 weeks, it's gone. If it drops below No. 25 after 26 weeks? Bzzzt. And if it drops below No. 50 after 20 weeks? That's a wrap. Billboard  is reserving the right to bend its own rules and keep songs on the chart beyond those benchmarks on a case-by-case basis, and you can see a handful of exceptions on this week's chart. Most notably,  Billie Eilish 's \"Wildflower\" — the longest-charting song left on the Hot 100 — is in its 70th week on the chart and sits at No. 50. But, while it's lasted way more than 26 weeks, it's actually  climbing , jumping from No. 63. Also, once the holidays roll around, the usual chestnuts won't be held to precisely the same standards, provided they rank at No. 50 or higher, same as in previous years. So be sure to take a moment, light a candle and pause to reflect on such once-immortal, now-vanquished eternals as…  [lights dim as a screen bears the words \"In Memoriam\"]   Lady Gaga  and  Bruno Mars ' \"Die With a Smile\" (60 weeks),  Benson Boone 's \"Beautiful Things\" and \"Sorry I'm Here for Someone Else\" (89 and 32 weeks, respectively), Morgan Wallen's \"I'm the Problem\" and \"Just in Case\" (36 and 29 weeks, respectively) and  Kendrick Lamar 's \"Luther (feat.

Paul Ingrassia, who was nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, had been scheduled to have his confirmation hearing this week. On Monday, however, Politico reported on a text chat that showed him saying the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be \"tossed into the seventh circle of hell.\" Ingrassia also described himself in the chat as having \"a Nazi streak\" at times. After the texts came to light, several Republican senators said they would not support his nomination. They included some of the most conservative and stalwart Trump allies in the Senate. \"I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday's HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time,\" Ingrassia posted in an online message. \"I appreciate the overwhelming support that I have received throughout the process and will continue to serve President Trump and the administration to Make America Great Again!\" HSGAC is the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Asked for comment on Ingrassia withdrawing his name from consideration, the White House said simply, \"He is no longer the nominee.\" But Ingrassia's post came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune had said he hoped the White House would withdraw Ingrassia's nomination and several GOP senators said they would not support him. \"I'm a no,\" said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the committee that would've taken up Ingrassia's nomination. \"It never should have got this far.\" Republicans have been able to muscle through the vast majority of Trump's nominees in roll call votes despite stiff Democratic opposition. But there have been sporadic instances when Republicans have pushed back, generally behind the scenes, showing there are limits to their support. Most notably, Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump's first choice for attorney general soon after being tabbed for the job. In May, Trump pulled his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist's modest legal experience and support for Jan. 6 rioters. Last month, the White House announced it would be withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni was supposed to succeed a BLS director who was fired following a disappointing jobs report. But Democrats weren't satisfied with Ingrassia's withdrawal, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling on the president to fire him from his current position as a White House liaison for the Department of Homeland Security. \"This isn't anywhere near enough,\" Schumer said on social media. According to texts viewed by Politico, Ingrassia told those in the chat that \"MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his 'holiday' should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs.\" Politico spoke to Ingrassia's lawyer, who said the text messages might have been manipulated or were missing context. The lawyer did not confirm the texts were authentic. The Office of Special Counsel is an investigative and prosecutorial office that works to protect government employees and whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It's also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. In May, Trump described Ingrassia in a social media post as a \"highly respected attorney, writer and Constitutional Scholar.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580542","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00Z","title":"The not-so-spooky origins of 'ghost' — and why the word still haunts our language","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the origins and evolution of the word 'ghost', tracing it from its Old English roots meaning 'breath' or 'life' to its modern connotation of a spooky, supernatural entity.

language \n         By Joe Hernandez \n        \n           Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It wouldn't be spooky season without ghosts. The otherworldly white apparitions are a standby of Halloween celebrations. But they weren't always the stereotypical evil spirits we see in books and movies today. The messengers from the afterlife have gone through a variety of makeovers over the centuries, and the word continues to influence the English language in many ways. Part of the reason for that, said Lisa Morton, author of  Ghosts: A Haunted History , is just like ghosts themselves, our fascination with the afterlife just won't die. \"I think one of the reasons we fear them is that sense that this is the worst part of us and this is what's going to survive after death,\" she said. For this installment of  Word of the Week , we look back on the origins of \"ghost.\" Don't be scared! It's just a little etymology. It originally meant \"breath\" or \"life\" \"Ghost\" can be traced to the Old English root  gast , but back then it didn't carry the haunting connotation it does today. \"All of [its meanings] centered on breath, life and the human spirit,\" and it was also used in Christian contexts like the notion of the Holy Ghost, said Jess Zafarris, author of  Useless Etymology  and other books about the origins of words. \"These broad spiritual concepts predate the narrower idea of a ghost as a spooky creature or an apparition of a deceased person,\" Zafarris said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Still, the idea that the spirit of a dead person or animal could return to the land of the living was present as far back as the ancient world, according to Morton, the author of  Ghosts . In the Mesopotamian text  Epic of Gilgamesh , Gilgamesh's late friend Enkidu  appears as a specter  and recounts to Gilgamesh his experience in the underworld. One section of Homer's  Odyssey  describes Odysseus traveling through the underworld and encountering the ghost of his mother, Anticlea. Ghosts take a turn for the malevolent Over time, the word \"ghost\" does some shape-shifting, both in its meaning and in how it's spelled. The Old English  gast  and Middle English  gost  picked up a silent \"h\" centuries later thanks to the influence of Flemish typesetters, said Zafarris. When William Caxton introduced the printing press to England in 1476, the Bruges-trained printer also brought with him compositors from the Low Countries, who modified some English words using Flemish spellings. \"That also happened to words that are related to ghosts, like 'aghast' and 'ghastly,'\" Zafarris said, \"and you'll notice that those also have that breathiness to them, things make you gasp.\" The 19th century ushered in a cultural obsession with spiritualism. Ghosts peppered Victorian literature, and séances soared in popularity. The supernatural rituals, in which participants called upon the spirits of their deceased loved ones and others, challenged the idea that the living couldn't communicate with the dead, said Morton. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Suddenly, along came this notion that any group of people could sit down around a table and call up spirits that they could actually hold conversations with,\" she said. Even Queen Victoria  took part  in séances, which Morton said people of that era found to be \"joyous.\" The physical appearance of ghosts has also fluctuated over time and geography. \"In many parts of Asia, a ghost will appear in such a way that it's almost impossible to distinguish from a living person,\" she said. \"The idea of this sort of wispy, translucent thing is very Western and is fairly modern.\" In the decades that followed the Victorian era, ghosts took on the more sinister reputation they now hold thanks to the growth of horror films and novels, Morton noted. Considered by some as the  first horror film , 1896's  Le Manoir du Diable , translated into English as  The Haunted Castle  or  The House of the Devil , featured a group of what appear to be ghosts shrouded in white. The works of horror writers such as Shirley Jackson and Stephen King have continued to terrify readers for decades. Then again, not all ghosts in pop culture are out for revenge.  Ghostbusters  rubbed elbows with both evil and more eccentric spirits, while the friendly ghost Casper has transcended decades after getting his start in midcentury comic books. How phantasms haunt our modern slang The spectral and unreal quality of the modern ghost has lent itself to several English idioms used to describe things that are both there and not there. Ghost towns evoke abandoned places that were once full of life, while \"to give up the ghost\" means to die or stop working. (Those tiny clumps of lint under your furniture?  Ghost turds .) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The word was used as a verb as early as the beginning of the 20th century, Zafarris said, to describe when someone secretly did work on someone else's behalf, such as ghostwriting. More recently, \"ghosting\" has taken off as a slang term in the dating world for the act of suddenly cutting off contact with a romantic partner. Merriam-Webster  officially committed to the new definition  in 2017. Ghosts — along with the word \"ghost\" — look to be sticking around. You might even say they're still part of the zeitgeist, which itself is based on the German cognate  geist  and  translates as  \"the spirit of the time.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1226911278","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"14:45:00-20:00","title":"Scientists can tell how fast you're aging.

Is there anything we can do about the inevitable? But recently I've been digging into a new wave of longevity research that is making it an exciting time to be an aging human — which is all of us. It turns out, we all age at varying rates. Super-agers may have great genes, but research shows our habits and routines — everything from what we eat and how we move our bodies to who we spend our time with — matter a lot, when it comes to aging well. Now, the next frontier is to target the basic biology of aging and come up with new interventions to slow it down. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Many scientists are optimistic that we're on the cusp of breakthroughs. Not only to help us live longer, but — more importantly — to extend the number of years we live with good health. This is the goal of researchers at the  Human Longevity Lab  at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. They're recruiting study participants so they can test what kinds of interventions may slow the rate of aging. To that end, I decided to roll up my sleeve for science. Welcome to aging: My visit to the longevity lab When I arrived, the first step was a quick blood draw. The Potocsnak Longevity Institute is housed on the light-filled 21st floor of Northwestern Memorial Hospital, overlooking Lake Michigan. It felt more like a spa than a doctor's office. I didn't anticipate the vast range of data and insights scientists could glean from a battery of tests. Over a four-hour period, they performed more than two dozen assessments. At first it felt a bit like an annual physical. They checked my blood pressure, weight, glucose and cholesterol. But then, the tests got a lot more interesting. Inside a small exam room, a medical assistant opened the hinge of a  BodPod , a capsule that looks like a submersible. The machine assessed my body composition, determining the ratio of fatty mass to lean mass, which includes muscle. Strength is a key marker of healthy aging, helping us fend off frailty and falls. Next, I was asked to sniff and identify a range of distinct smells — from leather to chocolate — to test olfactory function. The loss of smell can be an  early sign of disease and cognitive decline . They scanned my retina and took digital images of the inside of my eyes, which can also help detect disease. And I took a memory and cognitive function test, called  MOCA . Thankfully, all was healthy. Then I went through a slew of cardiovascular health tests. They measured my  endothelial function,  which keeps blood flowing smoothly through the body. They looked at my heart rate variability and pulse-wave velocity, which is an indicator of stiffness of the arteries. I had electrodes placed onto my chest for an electrocardiogram. Midway through I was feeling a bit nervous, and my mind raced to  what ifs.  Of all the tests they performed, the most intriguing is the  GrimAge test . This test predicts  biological  age. It's gauging whether your DNA age is younger, or older, than your actual age, known as chronological age. Conjure images of the Grim Reaper? Yep, that's the idea: The test can estimate how quickly, or slowly, you're aging. To figure this out, researchers use a technique based on  DNA methylation,  which is a measure of modifications in our DNA. Basically, as we age, compounds called  methyl groups  attach to some of our DNA molecules, which can turn genes on or off. Researchers have shown that the higher the proportion of methylated DNA in certain locations, the more accelerated a person's biological age. Published research suggests this is a  reliable way to predict life span and health span . Can you change your biological age? No one wants to find out they're aging faster than their peers, right? But here's the exciting part. Our biological age may be malleable. The hope is that we can slow down our rate of aging — by making changes to lifestyle. Down the line, there may be anti-aging pills or other interventions. For researchers, the GrimAge test isn't just a way to estimate DNA age. It's a tool to study whether interventions can alter it. \"That's the big ray of optimism that comes through all of this — the possibility that we can slow down aging and extend the health span of people,\" says Dr.  Douglas Vaughan , director of the Longevity Institute. Health span is the number of years we live with good health. \"It can be changed very rapidly in experimental models and probably in people, too,\" he says. For example, smoking has a very strong effect on methylation. \"Tens of thousands of locations gain methylation when you smoke,\" explains researcher  Steve Horvath,  who developed the  epigenetic clock  used as part of the GrimAge test. People with obesity also exhibit higher methylation at certain locations. \"Conversely, if you eat vegetables, if you are lean, if you exercise, that slows methylation age,\" he explains. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Now, of course, it's long been known that smoking and eating poorly are bad for you. But researchers can now test specific interventions to see if it's possible to move the needle. Vaughan's deep interest in aging took off when he identified a distinct genetic variant in an Amish community in Indiana. People who have the variant are protected from diabetes and have healthier cardiovascular systems compared to people who don't. In the laboratory, when Vaughan engineered mice to have only a 50% level of a protein associated with this mutation, their life spans increased by nearly fourfold. \"This was a eureka moment,\" he says. He tells his current medical students that in their careers they will prescribe interventions to slow down biological aging in their patients. \"I don't know exactly what that's going to be. It might be a drug. It might be a lifestyle intervention, for all I know it might be gene editing,\" Vaughan says. \"But there are going to be ways that we are going to slow down this process and give people a longer health span.\" Democratizing aging People who live in the upscale Chicago neighborhood where the Human Longevity Lab is located can expect to live a much longer, healthier life compared to people who live just a few miles away. Vaughan wants to help close this gap. \"I'm worried about the poor soul in south Chicago who has a life expectancy of 55, compared to 92 in the neighborhood where we're standing right now,\" he says. A stunning difference of more than 30 years. (You can check out life expectancy in your ZIP code  here .) A lot of factors play into this life expectancy gap including   poverty, housing, stress  and crime, which can all work against health span. Vaughan and his collaborators are enrolling people from a wide range of ages, ethnic groups, neighborhoods and socioeconomic status to see what works to slow biological aging for everybody. \"There are lots of people who've been dealt a bad hand with regard to aging,\" Vaughan says. Their goal is to find affordable, evidence-based interventions that can benefit everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status. For example, he and his team are studying stress,   which Vaughan says could be \"part of the reason for the discrepancy in the life expectancy in different neighborhoods of Chicago.\"   They have begun a study to measure people's biological age at baseline, have them try a  stress-reduction  program, and test again to see if their results changed. Vaughan is also interested in studying people with chronic HIV, who tend to age at an accelerated rate. A charitable gift from a Chicago family with a shared interest helped  launch the institute.  Vaughan's team is considering a range of interventions to test whether they can slow down aging in this population. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It might be  weight training , it might be  intermittent fasting,  it might be dietary manipulations, it might be drugs that are available now that might have  anti-aging effects,\"  Vaughan explains, citing the diabetes drug metformin. Longevity and health span research is attracting lots of funding and attention, from places like the  Hevolution Foundation , which provides grants and early stage investments, and  Altos Labs , a biotechnology company, founded by  Dr. Rick Klausner , which is investigating ways to reprogram or rejuvenate cells. Over 600 competing teams from more than 50 countries have entered  a $101 million X-PRIZE global competition  focused on treatments that support healthy longevity — everything from lifestyle interventions to biologic therapies, drugs, medical devices, nutraceuticals and functional foods \"Teams have to come to the starting line and we're going to set up the frameworks by which they prove their therapeutic works,\" says XPRIZE's  Jamie Justice , who is also a researcher at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Embracing aging science Fortunately, my GrimAge score came back younger than my actual age, though I did get some surprises. I learned that my body composition isn't optimal. Turns out, I need to build more lean muscle mass, which is pretty common as we age — especially for women. With muscle mass, if you  don't use it, you lose it . After the age of 30 muscle can slowly start to decline. And, if you don't do strength training after age 65 or so, this loss can accelerate. So it's never too soon to start building a reserve. My goal for this year is to build muscle through resistance training and an optimal diet. And also, to reduce stress.

Today, NPR is starting a new project, How to Thrive as You Age. And Allison Aubrey kicks it off with a visit to a longevity lab. DOUGLAS VAUGHAN: Are you ready for this? ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: I am not sure. Should I be doing this? VAUGHAN: I think you should. I think you'll find it interesting and maybe insightful for what your future might be about. FADEL: Oh, my gosh. What are you doing there, Allison? Allison is joining us now. (LAUGHTER) FADEL: And you sound kind of hesitant. What is happening? AUBREY: Good morning, Leila. Well, we all age at different rates. And Dr. Doug Vaughan, who you just heard there, leads the Human Longevity Lab at Northwestern University in Chicago, where they can measure your rate of aging. Are you a super-ager, more likely to live to 100 or beyond, an average ager or is your aging accelerated? Now, to figure this out, they put you through a whole bunch of tests. One of them is called the grim age test. FADEL: OK, well, that doesn't sound very good. Can they call it something else? (LAUGHTER) AUBREY: It actually gives you a prediction or indicator of your biological age. So we all know our chronological age. That's the date on your birth certificate. But our biological age is a gauge of how well your cells, your DNA are holding up, how well your muscles and cardiovascular system are holding up. FADEL: OK, so now I understand why you're nervous. If you get bad news, you're aging fast... AUBREY: Right. FADEL: ...Is there anything you can do? And are you aging? What is your - are you a super-ager? AUBREY: (Laughter) Well, we'll find out. I mean, some of this is definitely beyond our control, right? But let me give you an example of information that can be helpful. One of the tests I did was in a device called a BodPod. It's a capsule. It looks like a little marine submersible that you got to climb into. And I started to feel claustrophobic the moment the medical assistant, Jessica Garcia (ph), opened the door. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SQUEAKING) JESSICA GARCIA: Before you jump in, let me point out that blue button to the side there. That stops the test if you wish to for whatever reason. AUBREY: OK. GARCIA: OK? VAUGHAN: You see the Titanic, hit that button. GARCIA: Yeah (laughter). AUBREY: OK. All right. So over the course of a few minutes, the BodPod measures your body composition, gives you a ratio of body fat to lean mass, including muscle. And the reason it's helpful to know about muscle mass is that as we age, we all start to lose muscle, as early as age 30. It happens at different rates, so maintaining strength is really key. It's a key way to prevent the risk of falls, which is the top cause of death from injury for older people. And so this test tells you how you stack up. FADEL: OK. So once you go into the BodPod and you get all this information, what do you do with that information? AUBREY: Well, in the case of, say, what you learn in the BodPod, if you need to build muscle, you can do resistance training. That is the key thing. You can make some changes to your diet. And this is actually the big goal of the Longevity Lab. The idea is that if they gather this baseline data on body composition - strength, cardiovascular function, biological age - on a whole bunch of people, then they can run tests, clinical studies to figure out which things may slow down aging. VAUGHAN: It's a healthspan prolongation lab. We want to push back the onset of aging-related disease. That's our fundamental goal. AUBREY: And Dr. Vaughan and a lot of other researchers in this space are optimistic that by targeting the basic biology of aging, they can eventually figure out how to prevent or really delay some of the common diseases that accelerate as we age, diabetes, heart disease and many more. FADEL: OK, so how do they plan to do that? AUBREY: Well, they're recruiting a mix of people of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, incomes, people who live in low-income neighborhoods. They'll get baseline measurements to gauge their rate of aging using these biomarkers and these tests, then they will test interventions that have the potential to slow it down. One population Dr. Vaughan plans to study are people with chronic HIV, who tend to age at an accelerated pace, and he wants to test a bunch of different things. VAUGHAN: It might be weight training, it might be intermittent fasting, it might be dietary manipulations. It might be drugs that are available now that might have anti-aging effects like Metformin or even Ozempic. But we want to see if we can't actually slow down the pace of aging. AUBREY: Now, in recent years, life expectancy has dipped in the U.S., but not for everyone, Leila. Life expectancy is very much influenced by where we live. The Longevity Lab is in an upscale neighborhood near fine dining, gyms, expensive apartments. People in this high-income neighborhood can expect to live a much longer life compared to people who live just a few miles away. VAUGHAN: I'm worried about the poor soul in South Chicago who's got a life expectancy of 55 compared to 92 in the neighborhood that we're standing in right now. FADEL: Allison, that's more than a 30-year difference just based on where you live. AUBREY: Yeah, it's stunning. And a lot of factors play into this. I mean, poverty, housing, crime, stress, all of these can shorten lifespan and lead to diseases earlier in life. And these societal issues are very challenging to address. But Dr. Vaughan says the goal of researchers is to figure out ways to intervene early. VAUGHAN: We know that aging is the most important risk factor for every disease that we deal with in adult human beings. And if we could slow down the pace of aging just a little bit, we can give people a few more healthy years, a few more years to enjoy their life, push back the onset of the heart disease or cancer or whatever it might be. And that's for everybody. That's not for the 1%. FADEL: OK, so I think my first question is now my last question. What did you learn personally, Allison, at the Longevity Lab? AUBREY: Well, I learned I need to be focused on building muscle, on building strength. And stress is something I need to work on, too, that may be working against longevity. VAUGHAN: We have the tools now to be able to answer that question - does stress drive an acceleration in your biological age? Maybe that's part of the reason for the discrepancy in life expectancy in different neighborhoods of Chicago, different kinds of stresses. We could bring people in and we could measure their biological age at baseline and then have them do a de-stressing protocol - meditation, yoga - as a way to slow aging. But let's do the measures. AUBREY: Eventually, Dr. Vaughan says, with all of the research going on into healthy aging, he's optimistic that there will be breakthroughs to kind of move us towards preventing or delaying the onset of many age-related diseases. FADEL: OK. Well, I'm looking forward to more of your reporting. NPR's Allison Aubrey. Thanks, Allison. AUBREY: Thank you, Leila. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94347","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"11:26:00-04:00","title":"Greetings from an Indian Railways coach, with spectacular views from Mumbai to Goa","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Diaa Hadid, a contributor to NPR’s 'Far-Flung Postcards' series, shares her experience of traveling from Mumbai to Goa via the 12051 Jan Shatabdi Express train, specifically in a Vistadome coach with panoramic windows.

Andrew Cuomo faced off in the first New York City mayoral debate of the general election, the generational battle within the Democratic Party was on full display. Cuomo was long a member of Democratic royalty, leading New York as governor for nearly 11 years after serving in the Clinton administration.  His late father, Gov. Mario Cuomo, was a Democratic Party icon.  Again and again, Cuomo hammered the idea that his deep resume makes him uniquely qualified to lead America's biggest city. \"This is no job for on-the-job training,\" Cuomo said during the Oct. 16 exchange, painting Mamdani as a political novice with left-leaning ideas outside the mainstream. \"He never has had a job. On his resume it said he interned for his mother. This is not a job for a first-timer.\" But Cuomo is running in this race as an independent after Mamdani, who turned 34 last weekend, trounced him during the Democratic Party primary. Mamdani was an unknown outside his state Assembly district until this year, but has led consistently in the general election by double-digit margins,  according to polls . \"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani said during the debate. \"And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That barb pointed to the downside of Cuomo's long track record in office: It comes with some gritty political baggage, including a sexual misconduct scandal that led Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021.  Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing. But Andres Bernal, a political analyst who lectures at the City University of New York, thinks many young voters look at Cuomo's history of controversy and are reminded of the Democratic Party establishment that has left them disillusioned.   \"It's a revolving door with a lot of corporate America, a lot of funders and lobbyists,\" he said. Bernal says Mamdani overcame Cuomo's attacks over his relatively thin resume by offering big progressive ideas, like freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service, that appeal to many young voters.   \"Be ambitious and look for fundamental changes that I think inspire a lot of people and I think are associated with Mamdani's youth,\" Bernal said. It seems to be working. The latest  poll by AARP and Gotham Polling  shows over half of Mamdani's support comes from young New Yorkers, under age 50. For Cuomo, meanwhile, 76% of his support is over age 50.  But it's not only serious policy issues that set these men apart. It's also lived experience and style. When asked during the debate whether they've bought marijuana in New York City's legal cannabis shops, Mamdani laughed and said yes.  Cuomo offered a terse no.  Their starkly different tones have played out in social media, where Cuomo offered conventional campaign ads, often attacking Mamdani. Mamdani's campaign, meanwhile, posts upbeat, often funny and hopeful videos that regularly go viral.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Zohran Mamdani is right now the epitome of what you're going to see every other candidate trying to do,\" said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx.  Polanco is critical of many of Mamdani's left-leaning policy ideas. But he says Mamdani's use of social media to reach young voters is a game changer, allowing him to overcome his relative lack of experience. \"He has rewritten the book. I love his style; he's a happy warrior,\" he said. During last week's debate, Cuomo said his campaign's social media messaging has gotten better since he lost the Democratic primary, but he acknowledged playing catch-up.  \"I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now,\" he said.   While Cuomo and Mamdani have sparred, often bitterly, across this generational party divide, the Republican in the race, Curtis Sliwa, has suggested they're closer on policy issues than their campaign rhetoric suggests. \"We have the architect and the apprentice,\" Sliwa said during the debate. Early voting is now underway. If Mamdani holds onto his lead through Election Day on Nov. 4, he will represent one more big generational change, serving as the first Muslim mayor in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel. Cuomo has attacked Mamdani repeatedly for criticizing Israel, but that hasn't appeared to slow Mamdani's momentum. Mamdani has picked up some  key endorsements from  Jewish leaders  in the city and a  New York Times-Siena poll last month  found most young voters in New York City sympathize more with the Palestinians than with Israel over the war in Gaza. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-10-21-2025-29925b9671834bba6e24adb5f2e35b51","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-25","timeOfPublication":"20:45:00Z","title":"Community Unites to Clean and Protect River Valley Ecosystems","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Green Earth Initiative, in collaboration with the River Valley Community, organized a major environmental clean-up and sustainability event on October 24, 2023.

Vance noted  flareups of violence in recent days  but said the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that began on Oct. 10 is going “better than I expected.” The Trump administration’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, added that “we are exceeding where we thought we would be at this time.” They visited a new center in Israel for civilian and military cooperation as questions remain over the long-term plan for peace, including when and how an international security force will deploy to Gaza and who will govern the territory after the war.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Vance tried to downplay any idea that his visit — his first as vice president — was urgently arranged to keep the ceasefire in place. He said he feels “confident that we’re going to be in a place where this peace lasts,” but warned that if Hamas doesn’t cooperate, it will be “obliterated.”  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     This is a locator map of Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

Since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, the remains of 15 hostages have been returned to Israel. Another 13 still need to be recovered in Gaza and handed over. On his visit to Israel Tuesday, Vance urged a “little bit of patience” amid Israeli frustration with Hamas’ pace of returning the hostages. “Some of these hostages are buried under thousands of pounds of rubble. Some of the hostages, nobody even knows where they are,” Vance said. Israel is releasing 15 Palestinian bodies for the remains of each dead hostage, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It said Tuesday that Israel had so far transferred 165 bodies since earlier this month.

Residents said prices for essential goods soared on Sunday after militants killed two Israeli soldiers and Israel responded with strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians. Israel also threatened to halt humanitarian aid. At a market in the central city of Deir al-Balah, a 25-kilogram (55-pound) package of flour was selling for more than $70 on Sunday, up from about $12 shortly after the ceasefire. By Tuesday, the price was around $30. Mohamed al-Faqawi, a Khan Younis resident, accused merchants of taking advantage of the perilous security situation. “They are exploiting us,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n On Monday, Hamas said its security forces raided shops across Gaza, closing some and forcing merchants to lower prices. Hamas also has allowed aid trucks to move safely and halted  looting of  deliveries. Nahed Sheheiber, head of Gaza’s private truckers’ union, said there was no stealing aid since the ceasefire started. But other significant challenges remain as Gaza’s  financial system is in tatters . With nearly every bank branch and ATM inoperable, people pay exorbitant commissions to a network of cash brokers to get money for daily expenses. On Tuesday, dozens of people in Deir al-Balah spent hours in line at the Bank of Palestine hoping to access their money but were turned away. “Without having the bank open and without money, it does not matter that the prices (in the market) have dropped,” said Kamilia Al-Ajez. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Israeli soldiers move on top of a tank along the Israeli-Gaza border as seen from southern Israel, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025.

Dr. Muneer al-Boursh, the health ministry’s general director, said on social media late Monday that some had evidence of being bound with ropes and metal shackles, and had deep wounds and crushed limbs. It was not immediately clear if any of the bodies had been prisoners; they are returned without identification or details on how they died. The bodies could include Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody or bodies taken out of Gaza by Israeli troops during the war. The Israel Prisons Service denied that prisoners had been mistreated, saying it had followed legal procedures and provided medical care and “adequate living conditions.” Israeli hostages released from Gaza have also reported metal shackles and harsh conditions, including frequent beatings and starvation. In the 2023 attack on Israel that started the war, Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people as hostages. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Lidman from Tel Aviv.

With open enrollment set to begin on November 1, 2025, tens of millions of Americans face potential premium increases of up to $2,000 per month—making coverage unaffordable for those earning around $63,000 annually. Jeffries opposes Republican proposals, including a one-year extension of subsidies, arguing they prioritize billionaire tax breaks and Medicaid cuts over working-class health care stability. He criticizes Republican legislative efforts, such as those by Rep. Mike Lawler and Sen. Ron Johnson, for being politically motivated and harmful to public health access.

Most of the federal government remains shut down after Senate Republicans and Democrats again failed to pass a spending bill Monday that would reopen the government. Democrats, who have put forward their own spending resolution, remain steadfast that Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies used by more than 20 million people to afford monthly health premiums should be extended. With the credits expiring at the end of the year and ACA open enrollment beginning Nov. 1, many buying insurance through their state's marketplace  are likely to see their monthly costs soar . In an interview with  Morning Edition , Jeffries said he believes \"it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.\" Some Republicans have proposed a one-year extension of the ACA subsidies, which Jeffries has opposed. In  a separate interview with  Morning Edition , GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said Democrats knew the subsidies would expire and dared Jeffries to sign onto the one-year extension if he was \"serious\" about it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, Jeffries said that \"If billionaires can be provided tax breaks on a permanent basis in ways that will explode the deficit all across the country and result in people losing their health insurance … it seems to us that Republicans should come to the table to provide a greater degree of certainty as it relates to health care that's being provided to working class Americans,\" referring to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Jeffries discussed how the shutdown is playing out and why Democrats remain adamant on their position. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Interview highlights Michel Martin:  Last night, the Senate failed for the 11th time to pass a measure that would extend current funding until the end of the year, effectively reopen the government. Republicans insist they'll negotiate on health care once the government reopens. Remind us again about why that position is unacceptable to the Democrats. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries:  Well, we've made clear that we want to reopen the government. We want to find a bipartisan path forward toward a spending agreement that actually makes life better for the American people. But we also need to decisively resolve the Republican health care crisis that is crushing people all across the country, particularly as it relates to the need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Open enrollment starts on Nov. 1. That's less than two weeks from now. And tens of millions of Americans are receiving notices as we speak, indicating that their health insurance premiums, co-pays and deductibles are about to skyrocket double, triple — or in some cases, quadruple — at levels that will be unaffordable, which is why these issues taken together need to be addressed at this moment without further delay. Martin:  So as you just pointed out, Nov. 1 is a crucial date because that's when most states will start to send out notices spelling out the cost of coverage, without the subsidies, those huge price hikes that you just mentioned that you're trying to protect buyers from, will have already happened. If we get to that point and there is still no deal, what then? Jeffries:  Well, the open enrollment period, which begins on Nov. 1, will last until the early to mid part of December. The pressure is going to continue to mount on the Congress to take decisive action during that period of time, as people all across America realize that things are about to get extremely costly in states like Georgia, Virginia and Maryland. We now have visibility into the fact that costs may increase on a monthly basis by approximately $2,000 per month. That means that health insurance premiums could actually increase to over $24,000 a year. That's unaffordable. The average income of someone who receives an Affordable Care Act tax credit is around $63,000 a year. And so clearly, these type of premium increases for people to get access to a doctor when they need them are unsustainable. And so over the next few weeks, it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And by the way, health insurance costs are going to increase for people who receive assistance through the tax credits on the Affordable Care Act, as well as people who receive their health insurance from their employer as well. Editor's note: About 90% of ACA premium tax credit recipients have annual incomes at or below $63,000,  according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Martin:  So yesterday you said that you'd oppose GOP legislation to pay military service members. That's something that President Trump already says he's going to do. And then this bill would also pay essential federal workers. You say you oppose this because you call it a political ploy. Notwithstanding the fact that you argue that this would give the president discretion to decide who would get paid and who wouldn't get paid. And you feel that that's not right. There still are a lot of workers in those groups who would face real hardship without pay. What do you say to them? Jeffries:  I support the military being paid. We, in fact, on the Democratic side of the House, have introduced legislation to ensure that that happens. In terms of the legislation that Sen. Ron Johnson [R-Wisc.] apparently was putting forward or may plan to put forward in the Senate, it gives President Trump wide discretion to decide who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, what happens in terms of furloughed workers who apparently will not be addressed in this legislation. And he's already threatened not to pay furloughed workers, even though that's contrary to federal law that he himself signed in 2019. This has been a lawless administration from day one of this presidency and allowing them to have further discretion as to how they may proceed, particularly when they have targeted hard working federal civil servants from the very beginning of this term in extraordinary ways is not an appropriate step forward. It's piecemeal, it's not comprehensive. And we need to reopen the government in its entirety. And we're ready to do that as Democrats. We just need partners on the other side of the aisle in terms of a willingness to proceed in good faith. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   We've been speaking with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle since the government shutdown began 21 days ago. Today, we are joined by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. He represents a district in New York. Good morning, Leader. Thanks so much for joining us. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Good morning. Great to be on. MARTIN: So last night, the Senate failed for the 11th time to pass a measure that would extend current funding until the end of the year, effectively reopen the government. Republicans insist they'll negotiate on health care once the government reopens. Would you, as briefly as you can, remind us again about why that position is unacceptable to the Democrats? JEFFRIES: Well, we've made clear that we want to reopen the government. We want to find a bipartisan path forward toward a spending agreement that actually makes life better for the American people. But we also need to decisively resolve the Republican health care crisis that is crushing people all across the country, particularly as it relates to the need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Open enrollment starts on November 1. That's less than two weeks from now. And tens of millions of Americans are receiving notices as we speak indicating that their health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles are about to skyrocket, double, triple or, in some cases, quadruple at levels that will be unaffordable, which is why these issues, taken together, need to be addressed at this moment without further delay. MARTIN: So as you just pointed out, November 1 is a crucial date 'cause that's when most states will start to send out notices spelling out the cost of coverage without the subsidies. Those huge price hikes that you just mentioned that you're trying to protect buyers from will have already happened. If we get to that point and there is still no deal, what then? JEFFRIES: Well, the open enrollment period, which begins on November 1, will last until the early to mid part of December. And so the pressure's going to continue to mount on the Congress to take decisive action during that period of time as people all across America realize that things are about to get extremely costly. In states like Georgia, Virginia and Maryland, we now have visibility into the fact that costs may increase on a monthly basis by approximately $2,000 per month. That means that health insurance premiums could actually increase to over $24,000 a year. That's unaffordable. The average income of someone who receives an Affordable Care Act tax credit is around $63,000 a year. And so, clearly, these type of premium increases for people to get access to a doctor when they need them are unsustainable. And so over the next few weeks, it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And by the way, Michel, health insurance costs are going to increase for people who receive assistance through the tax credits on the Affordable Care Act, as well as people who receive their health insurance from their employer as well. MARTIN: Why is that? JEFFRIES: Well, because the - there's one system. And to the extent that you begin to remove people from health insurance in numbers that would be contemplated - more than 20 million, perhaps - that's the number of Americans who... MARTIN: Well, the argument being - the argument here being that people... JEFFRIES: Yes. MARTIN: ...Will drop out because it's unaffordable, right? Is that the argument here? JEFFRIES: That's - well, people will drop out because it's unaffordable. And as a result, the costs are going to increase on everybody else. MARTIN: So last week, I spoke with Republican Congressman Mike Lawler. He's a member of the New York delegation, one of your colleagues. He confronted you earlier this month in the Capitol, and this is what he had to say. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) MIKE LAWLER: If you want to solve an issue like the Obamacare subsidies that Democrats put in place for four years and were slated to expire at the end of this year - they knew that they were slated to expire. They passed the bill. And so I've already signed on to legislation to extend the subsidies by a year, and that was part of my point to Hakeem Jeffries. If you're serious about this, if this is the issue you claim it is, then why won't you sign on to this bill with me? MARTIN: What do you say to that? What's wrong with extending the subsidies for a year to give you more time to negotiate? JEFFRIES: Well, what we've made clear is that we need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits at a level that will provide certainty to the American people, who are already struggling with the high cost of living in this country, living paycheck to paycheck, can't thrive, can barely survive. Now, Mike Lawler and his Republican colleagues earlier this year did all that they could to pass the one big, ugly bill, which included the largest cut to Medicaid in American history. Fourteen million people are at risk of losing their health insurance coverage throughout the country, including in rural America. Hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health clinics are about to close across the country, and we're already seeing that happen in some states. And all of this was done so that Republicans could provide massive tax breaks that they made permanent for their billionaire donors. If billionaires can be provided tax breaks on a permanent basis in ways that, you know, will explode the deficit all across the country and result in people losing their health insurance because, in part, it was paid for by a trillion-dollar cut to Medicaid, it seems to us that Republicans should come to the table to provide a greater degree of certainty as it relates to health care that's being provided to working-class Americans. MARTIN: So yesterday, you said that you'd oppose GOP legislation to pay military service members. That's something President Trump already says he's going to do. And then this bill would also pay essential federal workers. You say you oppose this because you call it a political ploy. Notwithstanding the fact that you argue that this would give the president discretion to decide who would get paid and who wouldn't get paid and you feel that that's not right, there still are a lot of workers in those groups who would face real hardship without pay. How - what do you say to them? JEFFRIES: Well, it's a very important question. In terms - I support the military being paid. And we, in fact, on the Democratic side of the House had introduced legislation to ensure that that happens. In terms of the legislation that Ron Johnson apparently was putting forward or may plan to put forward in the Senate, it gives President Trump wide discretion to decide who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, what happens in terms of furloughed workers, who apparently will not be addressed in this legislation. And he's already threatened not to pay furloughed workers, even though that's contrary to federal law that he himself signed in 2019. This has been a lawless administration from Day 1 of this presidency. And allowing them to have further discretion as to how they may proceed, particularly when they have targeted hardworking federal civil servants from the very beginning of this term in extraordinary ways, is not an appropriate step forward. It's piecemeal. It's not comprehensive. And we need to reopen the government in its entirety, and we're ready to do that as Democrats. We just need partners on the other side of the aisle in terms of a willingness to proceed in good faith. MARTIN: That is Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York. He's the House minority leader. Leader Jeffries, I do hope you'll come back and talk more about this as this situation continues. Thank you so much for joining us today. JEFFRIES: Thank you.

In a new book,  Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines , published Oct. 21, Jean-Pierre says that the party's internal dysfunction and disloyalty had helped pave the way for its 2024 defeat. Speaking with  Morning Edition  host Michel Martin, she reflected on her time in the administration and described why she decided to step away from the party she once represented. Here are five takeaways from the conversation. 1. She says the debate revealed political vulnerability — not cognitive decline Jean-Pierre opened her book with her account of the June 2024 presidential debate, the night questions about former President Joe Biden's health and acuity intensified. \"I had not seen the president because he had been in debate prep,\" she said. \"So the first time I actually heard him speak was while he was debating. So when I heard his voice, I thought to myself, uh oh. He was hoarse. He kind of looked like he was sick.\" She said she immediately recognized how the optics might play publicly. \"Everything that I've been pushing back on — his age, is he fit — like automatically anytime he would sneeze or have a runny nose or something would happen, that would be where the questions would go.\" Still, she maintained she had seen no reason to doubt the president's ability to serve. \"I stand by that. I stand by that 110%.\" 2. She blames, in part, Democratic disunity for Trump's return Jean-Pierre argued that Democrats' inability to rally around Biden cost them politically. \"Joe Biden, objectively, had a very successful four years,\" she said. \"And here we are on the cusp of an election of a lifetime that we all need to get behind our person, and we couldn't do it. Republicans are able to do it … and we weren't able to do it.\" She cited figures such as Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney who, she said, signaled their doubts about the president. \"All of it,\" she said, \"contributed to a perception of disunity.\" 3. She says criticism of her as press secretary reflected deeper bias Jean-Pierre recalled the scrutiny she faced at the podium, including claims she was \"too wooden\" or lacked policy depth. \"Well, look, in the moment, I was quiet,\" she said. \"What I can do is state facts, which is that no one has ever looked like me that has been at that podium.\" She said she understood that \"as a Black woman, things are just different for people who look like me.\" 4. She says Democrats had failed Black women — even as they relied on them In a chapter titled \"Sisterhood,\" Jean-Pierre described the loyalty of Black women voters within the party. \"I feel like, if you look at Black women and how they come out and vote no matter what, because they understand what's at stake ... we get forgotten,\" she said. She said she had appreciated the Biden-Harris administration's effort to elevate those voices: \"They felt seen when they saw me at the podium, behind that lectern, whether it was women of color, Black women, queer community, LGBTQ community, immigrant — they felt seen, and that mattered to me.\" 5. She says becoming an independent was about accountability, not defection Jean-Pierre said her decision to identify as an independent was meant to start a conversation about the direction of American politics. \"Look, for me, I'm not telling people, Hey, you go become an independent,\" she said. \"There is a growing number of people who see themselves as independents, including young people. We have to question, why is that?\" She also said Democrats had failed to anticipate what would follow their loss. Jean-Pierre said she hoped the book would encourage engagement rather than cynicism. \"There's an opportunity to reimagine what politics can be, to reimagine what America can be. That means you can't stay quiet, because silence is complicit.\" The radio version of this interview was produced by Barry Gordemer and edited by Adriana Gallardo. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   For almost three years, Karine Jean-Pierre served as White House press secretary, meaning she was the face and voice of the Biden-Harris administration during daily White House briefings and trips around the world. In a new book, Jean-Pierre argues that Democrats knew what was coming ahead of their defeat in the 2024 elections and not only didn't do enough to stop it, but also helped it along by being disloyal, shambolic and insufficiently committed to its stated values. This led her to ask herself if this was still the party for her. Her answer? No. Jean-Pierre says she no longer identifies as a Democrat. The title of her new book and her new political stance is \"Independent.\" And she's with us now to tell us more about it. Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks so much for joining us. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you so much for having me, Michel. MARTIN: You open the book with your experience behind the scenes of the June 2024 presidential debate, a date that's, you know, seared into a lot of people's memories. And it was there that questions around then President Biden's kind of health and mental acuity really seemed to take off. So tell us a little bit about what you saw behind the scenes. JEAN-PIERRE: So I had not seen the president because he had been in debate prep, and it was on the political side. I was not involved in the campaign in any way. So the first time I actually heard him speak was while he was debating. So when I heard his voice, I thought to myself, uh-oh. He was hoarse. He kind of looked like he was sick. So I thought to myself, something is up. And so what I started thinking from that moment was, oh, goodness. This is what is going to be used for everything that I've been pushing back on, his age - is he fit? Like, automatically, anytime he would sneeze or have a runny nose or something would happen, that would be where the questions would go. MARTIN: Let me just be clear here. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: Because you are very clear in the book that you saw no reason to question the former president's mental acuity, his fitness for the job. You stand by that. JEAN-PIERRE: I stand by that 110%. MARTIN: I do want to say that you realize that a lot of people just don't believe that. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, all I can tell you is what I saw with my own eyes and what I experienced myself. MARTIN: To that end, your beef is not with journalists asking questions. JEAN-PIERRE: No, my beef is not with journalists, no. MARTIN: The core of the book is about the Democratic Party and what you experienced at the White House. You write about what you call bickering and backbiting. So say more about why... JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: ...You say that that backbiting is what opened the door for you to think about other alternatives. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. So Joe Biden objectively had a very successful four years. And here we are on the cusp of a election of a lifetime that we all need to get behind our person, and we couldn't do it. Republicans are able to do it. They were able to get behind their guy, however flawed their guy is. And they say, yep, this is our guy. With all the flaws and everything, this is our guy. And we weren't able to do it. MARTIN: By that you mean, like, for example, the former speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, sort of letting it be known that she was concerned. JEAN-PIERRE: Yes. MARTIN: Or George Clooney and his piece in The New York Times. JEAN-PIERRE: All of it, all of it. MARTIN: Is that what you're talking about? JEAN-PIERRE: All of it. And I talk about that in the book. MARTIN: One other thing you write about, which I really found was interesting, is, like, the snippety sniping directed at you. Apparently, there are people who felt you weren't very good at your job. They said you were too wooden at briefings, that you didn't really understand policy. How do you understand those critiques now that you have some distance from it, or do you? JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, in the moment, I was quiet. I didn't defend myself in the moment because I was focused on a job that I was honored and privileged to have had, which is the White House press secretary, because the president believed that I can do this. What I can do is state facts, which is no one has ever looked like me that has been at that podium standing behind that lectern. And when we are first, you are critiqued and looked at differently because people already don't think you belong there in that position. And, you know, look, I had a job that was coveted. MARTIN: Interesting. JEAN-PIERRE: And the people who wanted my job didn't think I deserved the job for whatever reasons, right? And so I understood as a Black woman that things are just different for people who look like me. MARTIN: You write at length about how you feel the Democratic Party has particularly failed Black women. JEAN-PIERRE: So I have a chapter on, it's called Sisterhood. It's kind of a love letter to Black women. And I feel like if you look at Black women and how they come out and vote no matter what, because they understand what's at stake, 92% for Kamala Harris. Black women understand, look, there's a crisis here. Not only is it going to affect me and my family and the community that I love, but it's going to affect everyone. And we feel like it is our duty to try to save and try to really speak out. And we get forgotten. And one of the things that I respected from the Biden-Harris administration is we didn't forget them. And you see that in how we made sure Black women's voices were everywhere within the administration. I do believe, and I want to be very clear about this, that I meant a lot to people because of the communities that I represented. They felt seen when they saw me at the podium behind that lectern. Whether it was women of color, Black women, queer community, LGBTQ community, immigrant, they felt seen. And that mattered to me. And I wrote this book because I truly believe in what I'm saying, and I want to start a conversation. I'm not looking for a fight with Democrats or Republicans. I'm looking to - well, I'm looking to have a conversation. MARTIN: OK. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. MARTIN: So let's have that conversation. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. MARTIN: What does identifying as an independent solve the problem that you have identified? JEAN-PIERRE: Right. Look, for me, I'm not telling people, hey, you go become an independent. That's not my role. There is a growing number of people who see themselves as independents, including young people. We have to question, why is that? There is a fundamental problem here. For me, it is I want to show, how is this person going to fight for my vote? Rubber-stamping Trump's appointees, let me tell you, that is not the way that that should've gone. We knew what was about to happen, Project 2025. Anti-DEI was, like, one of the first things. We knew. Immigrants being attacked, we knew this was going to happen. And so I feel like we should've been better. MARTIN: So you said you wanted to start a conversation. The book is just out. What are you hearing from people? JEAN-PIERRE: I hope people are inspired to continue to either be in the fight or get into the fight. There's an opportunity to reimagine what politics can be, to reimagine what America can be. That means you can't stay quiet because silence is complicit. MARTIN: Karine Jean-Pierre is the author of \"Independent: A Look Inside A Broken White House, Outside The Party Lines.\" Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks so much for talking with us. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you, Michel. I appreciate it. Thank you for the opportunity.\\ \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94444","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:04:00-04:00","title":"Spanish League Cancels Plans for Barcelona to Play Regular-Season Match in Miami","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"La Liga, Spain's top soccer league, has canceled plans for a regular-season match between Barcelona and Villarreal to be played in Miami in December 2025.

The Associated Press \n        \n           Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 1:04 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         MADRID — The Spanish soccer league said Tuesday that plans for Barcelona to play a regular-season game against Villarreal outside Miami in December have been called off, a decision that comes following increased opposition to the match domestically. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The league said the decision was made after conversations with the promoter of the planned Dec. 20 match and cited the \"uncertainty that has arisen in Spain over the past few weeks.\" Game promoter Relevent said it informed La Liga of the need to \"postpone the planned match\" because \"there is insufficient time to properly execute an event of this scale.\" It added that \"it would also be irresponsible to begin selling tickets without a confirmed match in place.\" The league had finally succeeded in getting approval from soccer bodies such as UEFA and the Spanish federation to stage its first regular-season game abroad. But opposition by players, some clubs and fans had grown recently in Spain. The Spanish league \"deeply regrets that this project, which represented a historic and unparalleled opportunity for the international expansion of Spanish soccer, will not be able to move forward.\" The league said \"holding an official match outside our borders would have been a decisive step in the global growth of the competition, strengthening the international presence of clubs, the positioning of players, and the visibility of Spanish soccer in a strategic market such as the United States.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It said \"the project fully complied with all federative regulations and did not affect the integrity of the competition, as confirmed by the competent institutions responsible for ensuring compliance, which opposed it for other reasons.\" But the criticism against the game had grown recently, with players protesting during the weekend league games by standing still for a few seconds after kickoff. Earlier Tuesday, Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois criticized Spanish league president Javier Tebas and complained about the league's decision to censor the protests by the players. The television feed of games switched before kickoff to an exterior view of the stadiums and only showed part of the fields from distance. Madrid has been one of the clubs most loudly protesting against the game, saying it would alter the fairness of the competition. Villarreal was officially the home team for the match that was set to be played at Hard Rock Stadium. \"Teams should play home and away,\" Courtois said. \"It's not the same to play against a team at home and away. It's hard to play on the road in the Spanish league. Playing on the road at Villarreal's field is very tough. Every team has to play at home and away unless there is a major reason for that not to happen.\" Barcelona and Villarreal were on board with playing the game abroad. Villarreal fans would be able to travel to the match free of charge, and those who chose not to attend would receive a hefty discount on their season ticket. Barcelona said it respected the decision but regretted \"the missed opportunity to expand the competition's image in a strategic market with the capacity for growth and resource generation for the benefit of all.\" \"The club appreciates the support and unconditional affection it has received from our fans in the United States and deeply regrets that they are unable to attend the official match in the country,\" Barcelona said in a statement. La Liga said the game was important for the league \"in an increasingly competitive global landscape, where leagues such as the Premier League or competitions like the UEFA Champions League continue to expand their reach and ability to generate revenue.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Initiatives like this are essential to ensure the sustainability and growth of Spanish soccer,\" the league said. \"Renouncing such opportunities hinders the generation of new income, limits clubs' capacity to invest and compete, and reduces the international projection of the entire Spanish soccer ecosystem.\" The league said it \"will continue, as always, to work to bring Spanish soccer to every corner of the world, promoting an open, modern and competitive vision that benefits clubs, players, and fans alike.\" La Liga has a long-term partnership with sports and entertainment group Relevent Sports, which is part of Stephen Ross' portfolio of companies that includes Hard Rock Stadium, the Miami Dolphins, Formula One's Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Open tennis tournament. Plans for the La Liga game in Miami were renewed after FIFA withdrew from a legal action brought by Relevent in a Manhattan court. Weeks later, FIFA said it would review its rules and created a working group that includes UEFA lawyers. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5570842","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-04:00","title":"New Museum of Christian & Gospel Music Honors a Diversity of Music with a Message","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The newly opened Museum of Christian & Gospel Music in Nashville, Tennessee, is the first in the U.S. dedicated to showcasing the full breadth of Christian and gospel music.

   By Jewly Hight \n        \n           Sunday, October 19, 2025 • 8:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Sunday \n        \n      \n\n         On a Friday morning in early October, musicians, industry executives and politicians packed into the open-air café at the brand new  Museum of Christian & Gospel Music  — the first museum in the U.S. designed to celebrate the breadth of Christian music. They spilled onto the downtown Nashville sidewalk, mere blocks away from historic churches and country stars' raucous tourist bars. It was a ceremony many years in the making. There is an institution devoted to  Black gospel  in St. Louis, one for  white Southern gospel  in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., and the Gospel Music Association (GMA) has been inducting originators from both those traditions, along with Christian pop pioneers, into its Hall of Fame since 1972. But for the entirety of those 50-plus years, the hall's been without a physical location. Past efforts to build one failed. But Jackie Patillo, the first woman and person of color to lead the GMA, pushed to create a comprehensive home for these musical histories once and for all. \"The word 'gospel' music really encompasses a message with lots of different sounds, so it's been awesome to see how we've gone from the hymns to choruses to rap music and the contemporary Christian music industry,\" said Patillo. The museum now houses the GMA's Gospel Music Hall of Fame, and because its exhibits are designed to weave these varied musical lineages into one story, no one genre gets its own section. Instead, performers are organized according to either chronology or commonalities. One display describes all sorts of family bands, while another spotlights musicians who've embraced pastoring roles and pastors who've become recognized as musicians. All that glitters is not gold The museum has just 11,000 square feet, so its executive director and team of curators had to be selective about its contents. But they didn't default to simply featuring the biggest-selling singers. Even though Christian and gospel music have long operated as industries, they measure success differently from the rest of popular music: spiritual impact, a more ephemeral accomplishment, is touted just as much as commercial stats. And the artifacts on display are meant to reflect those priorities. \"We have one little area we're trying to put all the gold records in,\" explained Steve Gilreath, the museum's executive director. \"You don't see them everywhere you go …it's just not about that with this industry.\" The first item visitors encounter upon entering is a trophy,  given to Bill Gaither  when he received the songwriter of the year honor at the very first Dove Awards ceremony in 1969, celebrating excellence in Christian music. Gaither is a noted composer of  Southern gospel standards  that proclaim faith in a saving God, and take sentimental comfort in it. Popularized by his vocal groups, many of his songs have even made it into church hymnals. An American soundtrack The museum highlights iconic singers, composers and choir directors in the culturally and musically distinct African American gospel lineage, too. That tradition supplied American music with its templates for catching the spirit and giving voice to profound lament and righteous conviction, and its canon  served as the soundtrack  of the Civil Rights Movement. \"Gospel music, from the Negro spiritual to now, has always been a [symbol] of hope,\" said  Derek Minor, a museum honoree and gospel-schooled hip-hop artist . \"There was always an idea that God was coming back to liberate. The OG gospel artists, I don't think they were just trying to write great songs. They were trying to inspire people that were at their lowest,\" said Minor. He has his own way of carrying on that tradition. On his 2018 album  The Trap ,  he brought gospel uplift to the present-day struggle to break cycles of poverty, violence and incarceration, a perspective that was met with surprise — people didn't expect that a Christian artist would depict those realities in his lyrics. \"There's a liberation that needs to happen in [this] moment as well,\" insisted Minor. \"And that's what I wanna contribute to.\" Religious/secular crossover The idea of crafting devotional versions of secular styles was around long before Minor began rhyming. The museum has a particular focus on a period in the '70s and '80s when a whole new genre began to flourish: Christian contemporary music (CCM). One of the largest artifacts in that section is a hulking, vintage studio console. Its inclusion came as a surprise to Brown Bannister, an engineer and producer who used it to help flesh out the sound of contemporary Christian pop. \"When I saw this in here, my heart just stopped,\" he recalled. It reminded him of the seminal soft-rocking albums he  shaped for Amy Grant  and other Christian singer-songwriters, many of whom — like Bannister himself — have since been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The sonic textures he achieved with session players evolved with popular music trends, but one particular emphasis set the CCM approach apart. \"To me, Christian music — it's not about the music, it's about the lyric. That's what differentiates,\" said Bannister. \"So you're making sure that you're serving the artists and serving the lyrics of their song and trying not to get in the way of the message. You're trying to enhance it.\" That mindset was new to Rachael Lampa, who signed her first Christian record deal in 2000 at the age of 14. Lampa is featured in an exhibit on artists who released their debut albums as teenage girls. She gravitated toward  power ballads  and  rhythmic dance tracks  that were in step with the era, but learned that having a Christian platform as a young woman meant that she was expected to be an ideal role model. (She says she once received criticism for simply wearing a tank top.) \"It's people trying to express themselves and express their experience,\" said Lampa. \"But also be a teenager, getting to know who they are in the first place and then who God is and how to talk about that, how to sing about that.\" Walking the halls of the new museum summoned moving memories for Lampa, and if it does the same for other visitors, GMA President Patillo ensured that space is set aside for their reflections. \"We're gonna give people an opportunity in a little testimonial booth where they can share how a song has impacted their lives,\" Patillo explained. \"This music is about changing us, it's about nourishing us, it's feeding our soul and our spirit. And we get to tell those stories here.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         DON GONYEA, HOST:   Gospel has always been a big part of American music. Heard in houses of worship and in homes, at concerts and on the radio. Now it's being celebrated and honored at the new Museum  of Christian and Gospel Music. From Nashville Public Radio, Jewly Hight has the story. BOBBY JONES: Now, I believe everybody knows this song. You ready? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: You bet. JONES: (Singing) Oh, happy day. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #1: (Singing) Oh, happy day. JEWLY HIGHT, BYLINE: Just blocks away from downtown Nashville's venerable churches and raucous tourist bars, Gospel legend Dr. Bobby Jones led a group of musicians, industry execs and politicians in song. They'd all gathered for the museum's ribbon-cutting ceremony. JACKIE PATILLO: People automatically assume that there is a place that celebrates Christian gospel music somewhere in America, and there isn't. HIGHT: That's Jackie Patillo, president of the Gospel Music Association. There are separate institutions devoted to Black gospel and white Southern gospel. But Patillo, the first woman of color to lead the Gospel Music Association, set out to build a more comprehensive home for Christian music. PATILLO: The word gospel music really encompasses a message with lots of different sounds. So it's been awesome to see how we've gone from the hymns to choruses to rap music and the contemporary Christian music industry. HIGHT: Steve Gilreath, the museum's executive director, helped weave those distinct lineages into one story. STEVE GILREATH: We didn't want people to come in and say, where's the Southern gospel section? - and go right to one spot and then leave. HIGHT: So he and his team grouped performers according to what they share in common. Gilreath says what's consolidated in the 11,000 square-foot museum, on the other hand, are markers of commercial success. GILREATH: We have one little area we're trying to put all the gold records in. You don't see them everywhere you go that sold millions, millions, millions. It's just not about that with this industry. HIGHT: But the first artifact visitors encounter is a trophy, the songwriter of the year honor given to Bill Gaither at the first Dove Awards ceremony in 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: The winner is Mr. Bill Gaither. (APPLAUSE) HIGHT: Gaither is known for composing Southern gospel standards that proclaim faith in a saving God and take sentimental comfort in it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BECAUSE HE LIVES\") BILL GAITHER: (Singing) Because He lives, I can face tomorrow. HIGHT: The museum also highlights pivotal singers, composers and choir directors of gospel music. That culturally and musically distinct tradition influenced the feel of so much American music and soundtracked the Civil Rights Movement. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I DON'T FEEL NOWAYS TIRED\") JAMES CLEVELAND: (Singing) I've come too far... UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #2: Yes. CLEVELAND: ...(Singing) From where I started from. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #2: Yes. DEREK MINOR: Gospel music from the Negro spiritual till now has always been a semblance of hope. HIGHT: Derek Minor should know. His mom had him singing those songs in the church choir until he insisted on rapping instead. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GOD BLESS THE TRAP (FEAT TONY TILLMAN & THI'SL)\") MINOR: ...(Rapping) Droptop Mustang. Now you run around, Headless Horseman scene... There was always an idea that God was coming back to liberate. The OG gospel artists, I don't think they were just trying to write great songs. They were trying to inspire people that were at their lowest. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GOD BLESS THE TRAP (FEAT TONY TILLMAN & THI'SL)\") MINOR: (Rapping) They won't talk 'bout how we can't get jobs and all we got is dope. HIGHT: Just across the hall, Minor's featured in an exhibit on Christian hip-hop. MINOR: I remember when I wrote my album \"The Trap,\" people were like, a Christian artist is writing an album about the trap? But I'm like, that is where we at. There's a liberation that needs to happen in that moment as well. HIGHT: The museum dwells in a period in the '70s and '80s when Christian versions of all sorts of secular styles began to catch on. One of the largest artifacts is a rectangular hunk of vintage recording gear under glass in the rear gallery. It came as a surprise to Brown Bannister, the engineer and producer who used it to help flesh out the sound of contemporary Christian pop. BROWN BANNISTER: When I saw this in here, my heart just stopped. This was the first five years of my career, was on this console. We did the B.J. Thomas thing. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITHOUT A DOUBT\") B J THOMAS: (Singing) Without a doubt, I finally found out. Without a doubt. BANNISTER: I produced Amy Grant's first album. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WALKING IN THE LIGHT\") AMY GRANT: (Singing) Me and Jesus did some heavy talkin' last night. BANNISTER: We did The Imperials'. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MORE EACH DAY\") THE IMPERIALS: (Singing) I had no love to call my own. HIGHT: Bannister shaped seminal soft rocking albums for Amy Grant and other Christian singer/songwriters with a specific goal. BANNISTER: To me, Christian music - it's not about the music. It's about the lyric. That's what differentiates. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THY WORD\") GRANT: (Singing) Thy word is a lamp unto my feet... BANNISTER: You're making sure that you're serving the artist and serving the lyrics of their song and trying not to get in the way of the message, you know, trying to enhance it.

by AI' is here. Some software engineers are skeptical \n         By Huo Jingnan \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 9:17 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Tech CEOs are making ambitious claims about AI's coding capabilities. In March, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei  said  \"we'll be there in three to six months — where AI is writing 90% of the code.\" Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg  predicted  in April that for one project \"in the next year probably … maybe half the development is going to be done by AI.\" Executives of  Amazon ,  Google  and  Microsoft  have also highlighted large language models' (LLMs') abilities to generate code. AI tools have changed how coding works for some developers and there are now  fewer  of the most junior software engineers. But despite the dramatic rhetoric, AI in software engineering might not mean a new age of automation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       After months of sitting on the sidelines, software engineer Colton Voege finally tried out AI tools for his work. He remembered watching a podcast where leaders of tech startup incubator Y Combinator, which helped Voege launch a  company , touted AI's \"incredible productivity.\" \"It kind of confirmed what I already felt about it, in that it's really good at shortcutting certain things,\" Voege said. \"[AI] is great for writing little tools that you'll use once and then throw away.\" But he hasn't seen evidence of long-term boosts to his efficiency. Interviews show that many software engineers, though not all, share Voege's experience. Some tell stories of untangling AI-generated code their colleagues have handed them, others talk about the pressure to make up work that purports to use AI to make higher-ups happy. Yes, AI can write code ... but still needs people In an interview with NPR, Boris Cherny, head of Anthropic's Claude Code unit, said \"most code is written by Claude Code,\" but declined to provide a percentage. \"We're still working on the science to make sure we can give a really precise number.\" Cherny was also clear that no matter how much AI is actually used, \"Every line of code should be reviewed by an engineer.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said this includes code generated by what Anthropic called \"agents.\" Agents are a component of AI tools that have the ability to test and rewrite code without human intervention. The function, hailed as much more autonomous than previous tools, was first introduced by Claude Code and was celebrated   by many in the industry as a pathway to automation. But agents don't always work. \"When these tools are at their best, they'll auto resolve a lot of issues. ... When they're at their worst, they will go into like death spirals,\" said Voege, describing situations where the tools, far from resolving the issue at hand, get stuck in a testing loop. \"I'm like, oh no, you're way off.\" Cherny did not shy away from describing Claude like a somewhat high functioning person. \"I think a good mental model [is that] it's like an expert programmer that's sitting next to you,\" he said. While he said it can serve as a \"thought partner\" in some cases, \"in the end, it's a human that's doing the work.\" Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who was invited to preview OpenAI's latest model, said it's plausible that AI could write a high percentage of code. However, Willison said, \"I think they'll still need the same or even more humans involved in that process.\" That's because AI cannot think through higher-level problem solving like engineers do. \"Our job is not to type code into a computer. Our job is to deliver systems that solve problems.\" Willison said. For Willison, who is known in the software world for tinkering with new tools and developing open-source ones, the productivity bump from using AI depends on choosing appropriate uses and having relevant expertise. \"I am comfortable saying that for certain tasks, [for] programmers who are experienced programmers — those who can work without AI — with AI, they can get two to five times [the] productivity boost, sometimes more, depending on the specific task.\" Willison later wrote in his blog that the teams that benefit the most appear to adopt best practices in software development and collaboration. But that's not always what happens in real life. People are using AI regardless of whether it's needed, which sometimes results in more work for their colleagues. Researchers coined the term \" workslop \" to describe this. \"A very high level engineer at the company was kind of very gung ho about AI coding and thought he could kind of get this very complicated project done very, very quickly on his own and tried running some AI tools,\" said one engineer at Amazon who is not authorized to speak publicly. \"[It] produced this just kind of messy blob of code that didn't work and nobody understood it. And the thing I'm working on now is just trying to actually do it kind of the old way.\" All this might explain why studies show mixed results when it comes to AI's impact. According to  a study  by AI evaluation nonprofit  METR , experienced open-source software engineers who used LLMs ended up taking 19% longer to complete their tasks compared to peers who did not — contrary to the engineers' own expectations. In a national  survey  in Denmark, software engineers self-reported to have saved 6.5% of their time with AI. It was the highest of the 11 professions, which averaged out to 2.5%. \"I'd definitely take 3% any day. It's like annual productivity growth in a typical occupation,\" said Anders Humlum, co-author of the Denmark study. \"It's not nothing, but I would call it modest relative to the experiments.\" Engineers agree that AI shines more where accuracy matters less. \"Knocking out a quick illustrated prototype would take me an hour [before] and now it takes me five minutes because I could just tell Claude to bash something [together],\" said Willison. \"The fact that it's going to make mistakes and stuff doesn't really matter too much.\" AI has helped cut back on some repetitive coding tasks at work, said Thomas Ptacek, a software developer at the cloud infrastructure company, fly.io. \"Because I've written [a piece of code] many times before … I can also look at that code very quickly and get a sense of whether it's crazy or not.\" Little room for disagreement The Amazon software engineer said management encouraged staff to use AI in all parts of their work, even when there wasn't a case for using it. \"It is very much a solution in search of problems much of the time,\" the engineer said. The engineer said that all this is fostering a sense that there is little room for disagreement. \"You have to use it more and it has to make you more efficient. If you're not, then you're doing something incorrectly.\" That said, the engineer also said the rhetoric's tangible effects on work and promotion vary across the organization. Amazon isn't the only tech company that appears to make assumptions about AI's effects on code. In a memo  first reported by 404 Media and Wired , a Meta executive called for his department to achieve \"5X productivity\" in software as well as a broad set of other functions using AI. \"The more we push ourselves, the more we'll unlock,\" he wrote in the memo. Two engineers  were fired  from an AI startup in San Francisco for not using an AI coding tool enough,  The Information  reported. Both the Amazon software engineer and Voege said they aren't the only engineers skeptical of AI in their workplace. A recent Google  survey  of software engineers across different countries and industries showed that while use of AI is near universal and improves aspects of software development, about half of respondents \"somewhat\" trusted AI's response, and 30% chose \"a little\" or \"not at all.\" Many are also worried about employers replacing junior coders with AI, effectively cutting off the long-term talent supply that's needed to supervise the machines in the years to come. Others raise concerns about the massive amount of electricity and content made by humans that the largest models consume, even as dramatic capability improvements have begun to seem elusive. In a statement to NPR, Amazon spokesperson Tom Parnell said its in-house AI tools \"help engineers move faster, ship more secure code, and spend less time on busywork\" and that through surveys \"engineers tell us these tools help them save time and feel more productive.\" He also said that the company does not mandate AI use, and cannot share what percentage of its software engineers regularly use large language model tools, but it believes \"these tools can help developers work more efficiently.\" Voege has since left his job and is now again thinking about starting his own business. He was floored by how much his old funder Y Combinator has gone from supporting different kinds of technologies to focusing solely on AI. He looked at the organization's latest request for startups. \"It's just AI, AI, AI, five out of five.\" \n         \n         Correction \n         Oct. 21st, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story misstated the name of Anders Humlum as Anders Hulum.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/capitol-riot-jeffries-death-threat-ad3fefcd3a6c7dc6340e14eb7b954936","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:59:48+00:00","title":"Man Pardoned After Storming Capitol Charged with Threatening to Kill Hakeem Jeffries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Christopher P.

Christopher P. Moynihan is accused of sending a text message on Friday noting that Jeffries, a New York Democrat, would be making a speech in New York City this week. “I cannot allow this terrorist to live,” Moynihan wrote, according to a report by a state police investigator. Moynihan also wrote that Jeffries “must be eliminated” and texted, “I will kill him for the future,” the police report says. Moynihan, of Clinton, New York, is charged with a felony count of making a terroristic threat.

He entered the Senate chamber, rifled through a notebook on a senator’s desk and joined other rioters in shouting and chanting at the Senate dais,  prosecutors said . “Moynihan did not leave the Senate Chamber until he was forced out by police,” they wrote. In 2022, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper convicted Moynihan of a felony for obstructing the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s victory over Trump in  the 2020 presidential election . Moynihan also pleaded guilty to five other riot-related counts. ___ Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at  https://apnews.com/hub/hakeem-jeffries ."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/koreas-ballistic-missile-d15e268cf071780b623a1dbac670f417","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"23:36:22+00:00","title":"North Korea Conducts First Ballistic Missile Test in Five Months Ahead of U.S. Diplomatic Summit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korea conducted its first ballistic missile test in five months, launching multiple short-range missiles from near Pyongyang toward the northeast, with no sea landings reported.

expected to meet in South Korea.  South Korea’s military said it detected multiple short-range ballistic missiles that were launched from an area south of Pyongyang and flew about 350 kilometers (220 miles) toward the northeast. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t release more specific flight details but said the missiles didn’t land in the sea.  The Joint Chiefs added that the South’s military remains ready to repel any provocations by North Korea based on its solid military alliance with the United States.  Japan’s new Prime Minister  Sanae Takaichi  told reporters that Tokyo was closely communicating with Washington and Seoul, including by sharing real-time missile warning data.

But last month, Kim suggested he could  return to talks  if the U.S. drops its demand for North Korea’s denuclearization, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy. Earlier this month, Kim displayed  a new intercontinental ballistic missile  at a military parade attended by Chinese, Russian and other top officials. The parade highlighted Kim’s growing diplomatic footing and his relentless drive to build a reliable arsenal of nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies.  North Korea’s state media said the Oct. 10 parade featured the Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, which it described as the country’s “most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system.” Observers said the new ICBM is designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to defeat U.S. missile defenses and that North Korea could test-launch it in coming months.  ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581255","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:59:00-04:00","title":"5 things to know about Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s first female prime minister, emerges as a symbol of both progress and controversy.

Japan's parliament elected Takaichi on Tuesday, several weeks after she was  chosen to lead  the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has spent much of the last seven decades in power. The LDP is seen as shifting further to the right: It was only able to elect Takaichi by forming an alliance with a right-wing populist party, after losing its longtime coalition partner earlier this month. Takaichi, 64, is \"one of the most conservative people in Japan's conservative LDP,\" explains Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She has advocated for tougher immigration restrictions and embraced hawkish policies on China. She has drawn comparisons to the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for whom she has frequently expressed her admiration and often wears blue suits in tribute. But she also played drums in a band in college, cites Deep Purple and Iron Maiden as some of her favorite bands, once  belted a rock anthem  on national TV and appears to maintain a strong affinity  for motorcycles  and  cars . \"Those are part of the character that is promoted by her, that [she is] more than just the strong Iron Lady, but also somebody who can have some fun,\" Hall says. Here's what else to know about Japan's new leader. 1. She isn't from a political family Takaichi was born and raised in the central Japanese prefecture of Nara. Her dad worked for an automotive firm, while her mom worked for the local police department. \"Unlike most or many of the politicians in her party who became prime ministers, she came from rather modest means,\" Hall says. \"But she did study very hard when she was young, and she passed the entrance exams for some very elite private universities in Japan.\" But he said Takaichi's parents refused to pay for her tuition to an elite university, preferring that she attend a two-year college to save money and live closer to home. She ended up attending Kobe University, a prestigious national university, paying her own way through part-time jobs and making the six-hour round-trip commute from her parents' house. In 1987, Takaichi moved to the U.S. to work as a congressional fellow in the office of  Rep. Pat Schroeder , a Democrat from Colorado — despite her own conservative leanings, Hall notes. After returning to Japan, she was able to market herself as an expert in international politics and secure a job as a television presenter. \"And from there, she segued away from being a TV personality into a politician, which is a common path in Japan,\" Hall says. \"If you're famous on TV, you have a pretty good chance of winning elections.\" 2. She's spent decades in politics  Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993, representing her hometown of Nara as an independent. She joined the LDP three years later and went on to serve in a number of key government positions, including minister of economic security. Notably, she served as the minister of international communications — which is responsible for telecommunications policy and broadcast media regulations — under the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, from 2014 to 2017 and again from 2019 to 2020. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"She served in that, I think, longer than any other politician has ever served, because the Abe administration was a very long administration and he valued her competency,\" Hall says. Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 2006 to 2007 and 2012 to 2020, before his  assassination in 2022 . He was known for his efforts to revitalize Japan's economy — nicknamed \"Abenomics\" — and rebuild its role on the global stage. Takaichi \"definitely depicts herself as the successor to Abe's conservative legacy,\" Hall says, noting that she did get his endorsement in the party's 2021 leadership election. \"I'm not sure how close friends they were, but they definitely were on the same page ideologically when it came to issues like China and the revisionist view of World War II that many of the ultra-conservatives in Japan have,\" he said. 3. Her views have caused controversy Takaichi subscribes to modern monetary theory, \"which says that you can engage in deficit spending on important things like defense and other parts of the budget,\" Hall says. While she is not as traditionally fiscally conservative as others in her party, he says, she is extremely conservative on social issues. For instance, she wants to create programs to promote having children and doesn't think women should be allowed to keep their maiden names after marriage (even though she has used hers in professional and public life). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She also has what Hall describes as hardline views on Japan's WWII history. In remarks over the years, she has downplayed Japan's aggression during the war and criticized the  war crimes trials  that the Allies held afterward to convict Japan's wartime leaders. Takaichi has been known to regularly visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, though she has recently refrained from doing so to avoid political and diplomatic backlash. Yasukuni is a controversial Shinto shrine that honors the spirits of Japan's war dead, including some convicted war criminals from World War II. Takaichi has also courted controversy with her disdain for immigrants and even tourists, a  rapidly growing industry  in Japan. While campaigning, she cited unconfirmed reports of tourists  kicking sacred deer in Nara Park , part of a larger criticism of tourism that many saw as xenophobic. \"It also ties into a general dislike of foreign people and also immigrants who live in the country,\" Hall says. She has advocated for an  anti-espionage law , suggesting that Chinese residents of Japan could be potential spies for China's government. During her campaign, she  called for restrictions  on non-Japanese people buying property in Japan and a crackdown on illegal immigration. \"People who are very anti-immigration are sort of smiling on her becoming prime minister, expecting that she will do something about it,\" Hall says, adding he thinks that is unlikely because of pressure from Japanese businesses who rely on immigration in the face of  significant labor shortages . 4. She's not necessarily a feminist  Takaichi holds a notable place in the history books as the first female prime minister of a country where women only held  about 10% of seats  in parliament as of 2024. Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in terms of gender equality — the lowest of any Group of Seven nation — according to the World Economic Forum (WEF)'s 2025  Global Gender Gap Report . However, Takaichi appears unlikely to prioritize issues of gender equality. She has long advocated for traditional gender roles, opposes same-sex marriage and supports male-only succession to the Japanese throne. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is not going to be a period when women's equality or other gender issues are aggressively advanced,\" Hall says. \"But there is, I guess, some benefit to having a woman as the leader of your country, to show … young women that in the future they could become prime minister, too.\" Takaichi has spoken about women's rights, specifically  advocating for the expansion  of hospital services for women's health and opening up about her own  struggles with menopause  symptoms. Takaichi has also spoken about her struggles to conceive; She has no biological children, but is a stepmother to three kids — and grandmother to four — from her husband's previous marriage. (She is married to former member of parliament and fellow LDP member  Taku Yamamoto , who legally took her last name, a relative rarity in Japan.) Takaichi had promised on the campaign trail to increase the number of women in her cabinet to \" Nordic levels ,\" or  closer to 50% . But in the hours after taking office, she  appointed only two . Hall says Takaichi has had to be more conservative than her male colleagues in order to take the helm of the party.

Democrat  Graham Platner  said Wednesday that a tattoo on his chest has been covered to no longer reflect an image widely recognized as a Nazi symbol. The first-time political candidate said he got the skull and crossbones tattoo in 2007, when he was in his 20s and in the Marine Corps. It happened during a night of drinking while he was on leave in Croatia, he said, adding he was unaware until recently that the image has been associated with Nazi police.  Platner, in an Associated Press interview, said that while his campaign initially said he would remove the tattoo, he chose to cover it up with another tattoo due to the limited options where he lives in rural Maine. “Going to a tattoo removal place is going to take a while,” he said. “I wanted this thing off my body.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The initial tattoo image resembled a specific symbol of Hitler’s paramilitary Schutzstaffel, or SS, which was responsible for the systematic murders of millions of Jews and others in Europe during World War II. Platner didn’t offer details about the new tattoo, but offered to send the AP a photo later Wednesday. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Maine Democrat Platner, on defense over tattoo, takes page from Trump playbook to keep up Senate bid \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             5 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Maine Democrat running to unseat Susan Collins to stay in race after discovery of Reddit postings \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             3 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Maine Gov.

He has resisted calls to  drop out of the race  and has the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has described Platner as a stronger candidate for the seat than Mills. Another primary rival, Jordan Wood, a onetime chief of staff to former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., said Wednesday that Platner should drop out because “Democrats need to be able to condemn Trump’s actions with moral clarity” and Platner “no longer can.” Platner said he was not ashamed to confront his past comments and actions because it reflects the lessons he needed to take to get where he is today. “I don’t look at this as a liability,” he told the AP. “I look at this as is a life that I have lived, a journey that has been difficult, that has been full of struggle, that has also gotten me to where I am today. And I’m very proud of who I am.” Platner planned a town hall Wednesday in Ogunquit, Maine. ___ Kruesi reported from Providence, Rhode Island."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-fbi-justice-department-177d42d89b97385132a927686d788d11","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"22:49:14+00:00","title":"Trump Claims Federal Government Owes Him $230 Million in Damages from Past Investigations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump claims the federal government owes him approximately $230 million in damages from Justice Department investigations into the 2022 FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago property and the Russia-related 2016 campaign probe.

money” for  prior Justice Department investigations into his actions  and insisted he would have the ultimate say on any payout because any decision will “have to go across my desk.” Trump’s comments to reporters at the White House came in response to questions about a New York Times story that said he had filed administrative claims before being reelected seeking roughly $230 million in damages  related to the FBI’s 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago property  for classified documents and for a  separate investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump said Tuesday he did not know the dollar figures involved and suggested he had not spoken to officials about it. But, he added, “All I know is that, they would owe me a lot of money.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Though the Justice Department has a protocol for reviewing such claims, Trump asserted, “It’s interesting, ‘cause I’m the one that makes the decision, right?”  “That decision would have to go across my desk,” he added.

One of the administrative claims, filed in August 2024 and reviewed by The Associated Press, seeks compensatory and punitive damages over the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate and the resulting case alleging he hoarded classified documents and thwarted government efforts to retrieve them.  His lawyer who filed the claim alleged the case was a “malicious prosecution” carried out by the Biden administration to hurt Trump’s bid to reclaim the White House, forcing Trump to spend tens of millions of dollars in his defense.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n That investigation produced criminal charges that Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith abandoned last November because of department policy against the indictment of a sitting president.

This policy shift, attributed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Secretary Steve Feinberg, reflects a broader effort to centralize control over messaging and prevent unauthorized engagements that could undermine legislative objectives.

In an Oct. 15 memo, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his deputy, Steve Feinberg, ordered Pentagon officials — including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — to obtain permission from the department’s main legislative affairs office before they have any communication with Capitol Hill. The memo was issued the same day the vast majority of  Pentagon reporters exited the building  rather than agree to the Defense Department’s new restrictions on their work, and it appears to be part of a broader effort by Hegseth to exert tighter control over what the department communicates to the outside world. According to the memo, a copy of which was authenticated by a Pentagon official, “unauthorized engagements with Congress by (Pentagon) personnel acting in their official capacity, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine Department-wide priorities critical to achieving our legislative objectives.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Sean Parnell, the top Pentagon spokesman, called the move a “pragmatic step” that’s part of an effort “to improve accuracy and responsiveness in communicating with the Congress to facilitate increased transparency.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Pentagon adds exemptions to requirement for all troops to get the flu shot \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             2 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Previously, individual agencies and military branches within the Pentagon were able to manage their own communications with Congress.

competition with Google as more internet users rely on artificial intelligence to answer their questions. Making its popular AI chatbot a gateway to online searches could allow OpenAI, the world’s most valuable startup, to pull in more internet traffic and the revenue made from digital advertising. It could also further cut off the lifeblood of online publishers if ChatGPT so effectively feeds people summarized information that they stop exploring the internet and clicking on traditional web links.

Chrome’s immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat. But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market. Microsoft ended up abandoning Explorer and introducing its Edge browser, which operates similarly to Chrome and holds a distant third place in market share behind Apple’s Safari. Perplexity, another smaller AI startup, rolled out its own Comet browser earlier this year. It also expressed interest in buying Chrome and eventually submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for the browser that hit a dead end when Mehta decided against a Google breakup. Altman said he expects a chatbot interface to replace a traditional browser’s URL bar as the center of how he hopes people will use the internet in the future. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Tabs were great, but we haven’t seen a lot of browser innovation since then,” he said on a video presentation aired Tuesday. A premium feature of the ChatGPT Atlas browser is an “agent mode” that accesses the laptop and effectively clicks around the internet on the person’s behalf, armed with a users’ browser history and what they are seeking to learn and explaining its process as it searches. “It’s using the internet for you,” Altman said. Harrington, the Forrester analyst, says another way of thinking about that is it’s “taking personality away from you.” “Your profile will be personally attuned to you based on all the information sucked up about you. OK, scary,” Harrington said. “But is it really you, really what you’re thinking, or what that engine decides it’s going to do? ... And will it add in preferred solutions based on ads?”  About 60% of Americans  overall — and 74% of those under 30 — use AI to find information at least some of the time, making online searches one of the most popular uses of AI technology, according to findings from an  Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research  poll taken over the summer. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Google since last year has automatically  provided AI-generated responses  that attempt to answer a person’s search query, appearing at the top of results. Reliance on AI chatbots to summarize information they collect online has raised a number of concerns, including the technology’s propensity to confidently spout false information, a problem known as hallucination. The way that chatbots trained on online content spout new writings has been particularly troubling to the news industry, leading The New York Times and other outlets to sue OpenAI for copyright infringement and others, including The Associated Press, to sign licensing deals. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A study of four top AI assistants including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini released Wednesday showed nearly half their responses were flawed and fell short of the standards of “high-quality” journalism. The research from the European Broadcasting Union, a group of public broadcasters in 56 countries, compiled the results of more than 3,000 responses to news-related questions to help ascertain quality responses and identify problems to fix. —— Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten contributed to this story."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"22:00:00Z","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article covers a range of global events, from AI-related misinformation concerns and investigations by French police, to violent attacks in Israel, political claims by Vance about rising violence, and security issues at the Louvre.

(AP) — Progressive groups looking to reconnect with Latino voters are emphasizing economic hardship and highlighting President  Donald Trump’s  mass deportation agenda in an effort to regain support in places where the Republican leader  made inroads . The $1.4 million digital ad and field campaign is led by a Democratic donor fund backed by a progressive network called Way to Win, which launched after Trump’s 2016 White House win. The Valiente Action Fund effort is tailored to connect with voters in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina and Texas by convincing them that some of Trump’s economic promises are falling short while his immigration tactics go  too far . Tory Gavito, a Democratic strategist and president of Way to Win, says the groups are trying to pivot to talk to Latinos “in their full experience” about housing and the cost of living without abandoning the case against Trump’s hard-line approach to immigration in his second term as president, including  the use of helicopters and chemical agents  in Chicago. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The Chicago stuff should be more than a canary in the coal mine,” Gavito said. “This administration is using extreme enforcement measures to distract from the fact that housing is still just too damn expensive, our rent is still too expensive.” \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 The next major film studios could be in Nevada if some unions have their way \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n         \n             4 MIN READ \n         \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Regulations called for stricter rules on Nevada’s battery sector.

Gavito says the Trump campaign succeeded at crafting a message around the “scarcity of resources” and blaming immigrants for taking jobs. Some voters were persuaded, she said, because they want “access to a thriving economy.” \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n There are already signs that Trump’s immigration crackdown  could impact the U.S. labor market . A July report by the Brookings Institution and the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute found that the loss of foreign workers will mean monthly U.S. job growth could be near zero or negative in the next few years. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The fight to gain Latino support Nationally, Hispanic voters shifted significantly toward Trump in the last election, though a majority still backed Democrat Kamala Harris: 43% of Hispanic voters nationally voted for Trump, up from 35% in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost. Hispanic voters in Texas and Florida shifted by a similarly large margin toward Trump. There were slight shifts toward him in New Jersey, New York and Arizona and no significant shifts in Nevada or Georgia. Democratic operatives and strategists have been  advising candidates to focus on voters’ pocketbooks  to reverse the trend. The progressive groups’ field operation involves partnering with local groups to knock on doors to do what they call “deep canvassing” — looking to have longer conversations about voters’ concerns and gather support to launch specific ballot initiatives. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Effort underway in New Jersey In New Jersey, one of only two states with  a governor’s race  this year, ads started to roll out earlier this month, not specific to the governor’s race but criticizing Trump, who has endorsed GOP candidate Jack Ciattarelli.  The digital ads show images of Latinos while a narrator says that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is going after people who “look like him, like her, like us,” echoing racial-profiling concerns by human rights groups.  A Supreme Court decision  last month cleared the way for more robust immigration operations, lifting  a restraining order  that had banned arrests based on any mix of four factors: race and ethnicity; language; location; and occupation. In another ad, narrators talk about the cost of food and electric bills rising as images of billionaires Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are shown. One of the ads shares the story of how an immigrant advocacy group, Make the Road Action New Jersey, passed a ballot initiative capping rents in the Hispanic-majority city of Passaic, which leaned heavily Democratic in 2016 but backed Trump in 2024. The ad says the rest of New Jersey is still seeing rent costs rise, blaming Trump and GOP lawmakers who oppose rent caps. “We do serve as a bellwether to what is sort of a hot take on what voters feel,” said Nedy Morsy, director of Make the Road Action New Jersey, who said messages are being tested with an eye toward next year’s midterm elections. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Latino outreach in other states In Nevada, the effort is targeting Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo as he seeks reelection in what is expected to be  a highly competitive race  in the battleground state, which Trump carried in 2024. The director of Make the Road Action Nevada, Leo Murrieta, takes Lombardo to task for actions he has taken on the economy, including a veto of legislation that would have added tenant protections. “We have to do everything we can to let our gente knows who out there has our backs and who is there stabbing us in the back,” Murrieta said, using the Spanish word for people."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-governors-race-doj-election-fraud-80d58631b61d5b44ba04dc5cf8288bc5","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"22:13:52+00:00","title":"U.S. Justice Department Reviews Request for Election Monitors in New Jersey County","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing a request from the New Jersey Republican State Committee to deploy federal election monitors to oversee mail ballot processing in Passaic County, a historically Democratic area that flipped to support Donald Trump in 2024.

The New Jersey Republican State Committee told Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, in a letter that federal intervention is necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in Passaic County.  State officials disputed that characterization and called any federal intervention “highly inappropriate.” The suburban county has been a Democratic stronghold.

While voter fraud does occur, it is rare and  there are safeguards  in place to prevent it. But Passaic County drew Trump’s attention in 2020 as a case study in what could happen in an election conducted mostly by mail. A judge  ordered a new election  for a city council seat in Paterson — the largest city in Passaic County — after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud. The Passaic County Board of Elections decided not to count 800 ballots cast in the race after the U.S. Postal Service’s law enforcement arm said hundreds of mail-in ballots were located in a mailbox in Paterson, along with more found in nearby Haledon. In 2024, Trump became the first Republican presidential nominee to win Passaic County in more than 30 years. He carried the heavily  Latino city of Passaic  and significantly increased his support in Paterson, the state’s third-largest city, which is majority Latino and has a large Muslim community. That performance was part of Trump dramatically improving his statewide performance in New Jersey. In 2020, he lost the state by nearly 16 percentage points to Demcorat Joe Biden. Trump narrowed that margin to 6 percentage points last year in his matchup against Democrat Kamala Harris.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Trump has for years questioned mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that Biden’s national victory in 2020 was rigged. Trump has suggested that mail balloting is riddled with fraud, despite analyses that show no widespread fraud in U.S. elections. Earlier this year,  Trump pledged  to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has  no power to do  under the U.S. Constitution."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/sununu-senate-new-hampshire-e806398a52e3878c5df164507c8e0cda","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:40:06+00:00","title":"John Sununu Announces Senate Run in New Hampshire to Reclaim Lost Seat","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John E.

(AP) — New Hampshire Republican John E. Sununu announced a campaign for U.S. Senate on Wednesday, hoping to reclaim a seat he lost nearly two decades ago and boosting the GOP’s chances of regaining a foothold in a region overwhelmingly represented by Democrats. Sununu, 61, is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated by U.S.  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , a Democrat who ousted him in 2008. His decision sets up a primary featuring two former senators:  Republican Scott Brown , who represented Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and losing to Shaheen in 2014, has been running since June. “Maybe you’re surprised to hear that I’m running for the Senate again.

Sununu said Congress has become “loud, dysfunctional, even angry” in his time away, but he said he hopes to return “to help calm the waters,” while focusing on the economy, veterans, health care costs and Social Security. Pappas’ campaign countered that he is the one who has been fighting to lower costs for working families, seniors and small businesses while Sununu has spent years “cashing in and making millions selling out to corporations and working for special interests.” “Chris Pappas will stand up to corporate special interests and take on anyone to do what is best for New Hampshire, and that’s why Granite Staters will elect him to the U.S. Senate next November,” campaign manager Rachel Petri said in a statement. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Though Sununu has long been out of office, his name recognition remains high because of his family’s political prominence. His father, John H. Sununu, is a former governor and former White House chief of staff. One of his brothers,  Chris Sununu , served four terms as governor and flirted with a Senate campaign of his own in 2021.

week.\n\nThe National Civil Protection Coordination (CNPC) chief, Laura Velazquez Alzua, speaking during President Claudia Sheinbaum’s daily news briefing on Monday, said another 65 people were still missing.\n\nThe state of Veracruz on the country’s southeastern coastline has confirmed 29 deaths, followed by 21 in Hidalgo, 13 in Puebla and one in Queretaro, Alzua said.\n\nForty-three people are also reported missing in Hidalgo, along with 18 in Veracruz and four in Puebla.\n\nThousands of military troops have been deployed to offer assistance across the five affected states, and governors are also working together to coordinate support, Sheinbaum said.\n\nEarly estimates show that about 100,000 houses have been affected, she added, with some near rivers having “practically disappeared”.\n\nFacing questions about Mexico’s alert system, Sheinbaum said there were no meteorological signs “that could have indicated to us that the rain was going to be of this magnitude”.\n\nMeteorologists have said the rains occurred thanks to the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Rainstorm Raymond, which caused rivers to rapidly rise, leading to flooding and landslides.\n\nThe heaviest rainfall was reported on Wednesday in Veracruz’s city of Cerro Azul and Puebla’s Cuetzalan del Progreso, which saw 280mm and 286mm of rain, respectively, Alzua said.\n\nThe Mexican Army, Air Force and National Guard have jointly implemented response efforts, distributing food and clean water, sometimes by air, to locations otherwise made inaccessible by landslides and road closures.\n\nNearly 400 repair workers have restored more than 80 percent of the electricity supply across the five states, where about 263,000 users lost power, electricity officials said during the

World Weather Attribution and United States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change.\n\nThe report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/five-dead-two-missing-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-soaks-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"07:40:23+00:00","title":"Five dead, two missing as Tropical Storm Fengshen soaks Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Fengshen caused severe flooding and landslides across multiple provinces in the Philippines, resulting in at least five deaths and two people missing.

While the framework, which would impose a $380 per metric tonne penalty on excess CO2 emissions, had previously been approved by 63 member states in April, the vote to delay it came after a backlash triggered by Trump’s public statements. Key supporters like China, the EU, and Britain maintained backing, while Russia and Saudi Arabia opposed it. Argentina and Singapore, former supporters, shifted to delay. The decision marks a setback for global climate action, with critics like UN Secretary-General Guterres and the International Chamber of Shipping calling it a missed opportunity. The framework aims to cut shipping emissions by 20% by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050, as climate change already affects maritime safety through extreme weather and shifting ocean currents. Alternatives such as ammonia, methanol, and specialized sails are being explored to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.","keyTakeAways":["The International Maritime Organization (IMO) delayed formal

torpedoes international deal to reduce shipping emissions\n\nMembers of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.\n\n“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” the chamber’s Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.\n\nDisappointed, but still very much Committed!  https://t.co/7P192kAvCx\n\n— Thomas A. Kazakos (@ThomasKazakos)  October 17, 2025\n\nRalph Regenvanu, the minister for climate change for Vanuatu, said the decision to delay the vote by 12 months was “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.\n\n“But we know that we have  international law  on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet,” Regenvanu added.\n\nLeading up to Friday’s decision, China, the European Union, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO had reaffirmed their support.\n\nCountries that opposed the measures included  Russia  and Saudi Arabia.\n\nA Russian delegate described the proceedings as “chaos” as he addressed the plenary on Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.\n\nArgentina and Singapore, two countries that had previously voted in support of the framework in April, were among those that voted to postpone introducing it this week.\n\nIf it had been formally adopted this week, the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would have been the first global carbon-pricing system, charging ships a penalty of $380 per metric tonne on every extra tonne of CO2-equivalent they emit while rewarding vessels that reduce their emissions by using alternatives.\n\nThe framework plan is intended to help the IMO reach its target of cutting net emissions from international shipping by 20 percent by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050.\n\nClimate change is already beginning to affect shipping and the safety of seafarers, including by changing  ocean currents  and causing more frequent and  severe storms .\n\nProposals to reduce reliance on dirtier bunker fuel in the shipping industry include using ammonia and methanol, as well as fitting cargo ships with special sails."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-10","timeOfPublication":"11:47:27+00:00","title":"China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has tightened its export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions, and restricted access to specialized refining equipment.

metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/bus-collision-on-highway-near-ugandas-capital-kampala-kills-63-people","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:30:44+00:00","title":"Collision on highway in Uganda kills 46 people","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A major road collision on the Kampala-Gulu Highway in Uganda, near Kiryandongo, resulted in at least 46 fatalities after two buses attempting to overtake a truck and car collided head-on.

death toll.\n\n“In the process, both buses met head-on during the overtaking manoeuvres,” the Uganda Police Force said in a statement on X.\n\nThe police added that “as investigations continue, we strongly urge all motorists to exercise maximum caution on the roads, especially avoiding dangerous and careless overtaking, which remains one of the leading causes of crashes in the country”.\n\nIn a later statement, police said they had initially overestimated the number of victims during early rescue efforts.\n\n“At the time of the crash, several victims were found unconscious, and some may have been mistakenly included in the initial fatality count,” it said.\n\nThe Kampala-Gulu Highway is one of Uganda’s busiest as it connects the capital with the biggest town in northern Uganda.\n\nThe death toll in the latest crash is uncommonly high, said Irene Nakasiita, a Red Cross spokesperson who described victims left bleeding with broken limbs.\n\nShe said the images from the scene were too gruesome to share, adding that “the magnitude of this incident is so big”.\n\nIn Uganda, 5,144 people were killed in road crashes in 2024, according to police figures. That number rose from 4,806 in 2023 and 4,534 in 2022."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/is-jd-vance-right-in-blaming-left-for-political-violence-in-the-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:44:36+00:00","title":"Is JD Vance right in blaming left for political violence in the US?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk in September 2025, Vice President JD Vance and President Donald Trump blamed the left for rising political violence, citing a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) that reported a temporary increase in left-wing attacks in the first six months of 2025.

2025-10-22T12:44:36+00:00\n\nTitle: Is JD Vance right in blaming left for political violence in the US?\n\nFollowing the September assassination of conservative influencer  Charlie Kirk , United States President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have shaped their political agenda by blaming the left for political violence.\n\n“Political violence, it’s just a statistical fact that it’s a bigger problem on the left,” Vance said while guest-hosting The Charlie Kirk Show podcast on October 15 in the aftermath of Kirk’s killing. About a minute later, he added, “Right now that violent impulse is a bigger problem on the left than the right.”\n\nA Vance spokesperson did not answer our questions. When referring to  left-wing  violence, a White House spokesperson recently pointed to a September 28 Axios article about a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a nonprofit policy research organisation.\n\nDemocrats, calling your political opponents Nazis has consequences.\n\nStudy: Left-wing terrorism climbs to 30-year high https://t.co/30NvIj9nzC\n\n— Abigail Jackson (@ATJackson47)  September 28, 2025\n\nThe study found that “2025 marks the first time in more than 30 years that left-wing terrorist attacks outnumber those from the violent far right”. The study also showed that for the 30 years before 2025,  right-wing  attacks had outpaced left-wing violence.\n\n“The rise in left-wing attacks merits increased attention, but the fall in right-wing attacks is probably temporary, and it too requires a government response,” the authors wrote in the study.\n\nVance’s statement oversimplified political violence and drew from part of one study of a six-month period. The federal government has no single, official definition of “political violence”, and ascribing ideologies such as the left wing and the right wing is sometimes complicated. There is no agreed upon number of left- or right-wing politically violent attacks.\n\nResearch before 2025 largely points to higher levels of right-wing violence over longer periods of time.\n\nTrump has used the administration’s statements about rising left-wing violence to label antifa as a domestic “terrorist threat”, and administration officials also said they will investigate what they call left-wing groups that fund violence.\n\nAlthough political violence is a small subset of violent crime in the US, it “has a disproportionate impact because even rare incidents can amplify fear, influence policy and deepen societal polarisation”, sociology professors at the University of Dayton, Arthur Jipson and Paul J Becker, wrote in September after Kirk’s assassination.\n\nIn an email interview with PolitiFact, Becker said the report in question “indicates there MAY be a shift occurring from the Right being more violent but 5 vs 1 incidents in 6 months isn’t enough to completely erase years of data and reports from multiple sources showing the opposite or to dictate new policies”.\n\nThe CSIS, a national security and defence think tank, published a September report examining 750 “terrorist” attacks and plots in the US between 1994 and July 4, 2025.\n\nThe report defined “terrorism” as the use or threat of violence “with the intent to achieve political goals by creating a broad psychological impact”.\n\nThe authors wrote that it is difficult to pinpoint some perpetrators’ ideologies, which in some cases are more of what former FBI Director Christopher Wray called a “salad bar of ideologies”. For example,  Thomas Crooks , who allegedly attempted to assassinate Trump in 2024, searched the internet more than 60 times for Trump and then-President Joe Biden in the month before the attack.\n\nThe full CSIS report gave a more complete picture of politically motivated violence:\n\nStudies have not uniformly agreed on some attackers’ ideological classifications. The libertarian Cato Institute categorised the person charged in the shooting deaths of two Israeli embassy staffers in May 2025 as “left-wing”, while the CSIS study described the motivation as “ethnonationalist”. Ethnonationalism is a political ideology based on heritage, such as ethnic identity, which can create clashes with other groups. The Cato study counted only deaths, while the CSIS analysis was not limited to deaths.\n\n“While Vance’s statement has a factual anchor for that limited timespan, it selectively emphasises one short-term slice rather than the broader trend,” Jipson, of the University of Dayton, told PolitiFact. “In that sense, it can be misleading: It may give the impression that left-wing violence is generally now more dangerous or prevalent, which is not borne out by the longer view of the data.”\n\nThe Cato analysis, published after Kirk’s death, said 3,597 people were killed in politically motivated US “terrorist” attacks from January 1, 1975, through September 10, 2025.\n\nCato found right-wing attacks were more common than left-wing violence. This research has been highlighted by some House Democrats.\n\nWrong again, JD. The data is clear: for decades, right-wing extremism has been the greater threat. https://t.co/TkxBZ08Xjg   https://t.co/PCWv4EuP4H\n\n— House Homeland Security Committee Democrats (@HomelandDems)  October 15, 2025\n\nCato wrote that during that period, “terrorists” inspired by what it called “Islamist ideology” were responsible for 87 percent of people killed in attacks on US soil, while right-wing attackers accounted for 11 percent and left-wing “terrorists” accounted for about 2 percent. Excluding the September 11, 2001 attacks showed right-wing attackers were responsible for a majority of deaths. Measuring homicides since 2020 also showed a larger number by the right than the left.\n\nVance said, “Political violence, it’s just a statistical fact that it’s a bigger problem on the left.”\n\nHe did not point to a source, but a White House spokesperson separately cited an article about a study that examined political violence from 1994 to July 4, 2025. It found that, in the first six months of 2025, left-wing attacks outnumbered those by the right. It is based on a small number of incidents: four attacks and one disrupted plot.\n\nThe study also showed that for 30 years before 2025, right-wing attacks had outpaced left-wing attacks.\n\nThe study detailed that the left wing “remains much lower than historical levels of violence carried out by right-wing and jihadist attackers”. Research before 2025 largely points to higher levels of right-wing violence over longer periods of time.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth because left-wing violence rose in the first six months of 2025. However, it ignores that right-wing violence was higher for a much longer period of time.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n\nChief correspondent Louis Jacobson contributed to this fact-check."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/icj-says-israel-must-allow-aid-into-blockaded-gaza-provide-basic-needs","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"16:18:43+00:00","title":"ICJ says Israel must allow aid into blockaded Gaza, provide ‘basic needs’","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that Israel must allow unrestricted humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and ensure the basic survival needs of the population are met, citing its status as an occupying power under international law.

must allow aid into blockaded Gaza, provide ‘basic needs’\n\nThe United Nations court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has said Israel has an obligation to ensure the “basic needs” of the population in Gaza are met.\n\nThe panel of 11 judges said on Wednesday that Israel is forced to support the relief efforts provided by the United Nations in the bombarded Gaza Strip and its entities.\n\nIt includes UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which Israel has banned from operating in Israel after accusing some of its staff of taking part in the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack.\n\nAs part of its findings, the ICJ said Israel has failed to show evidence that UNRWA also worked for Hamas as it claimed.\n\n“The court finds that Israel has not substantiated its allegations that a significant part of UNRWA’s employees are ‘members of Hamas … or other terrorist factions’,” said ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa.\n\nAdvisory opinions of the ICJ, also known as the world court, carry legal and political weight, but they are not binding, and the court has no enforcement power.\n\nIn April, lawyers for the United Nations and Palestinian representatives at the ICJ accused Israel of breaking international law by refusing to let aid into Gaza between March and May.\n\nSince then, some humanitarian aid has been allowed in, but UN officials say the relief is nowhere near what is needed to ease a humanitarian disaster and an Israeli-induced famine in parts of the enclave.\n\nThe 20-point ceasefire plan mediated by the US earlier this month allows for 600 trucks of aid a day into Gaza. Israel has previously accused Hamas – without providing evidence – of stealing food delivered into the enclave, which the group strongly denies.\n\nIsrael has claimed the aid restriction, still in place despite provisions in the ceasefire stipulating that aid must enter Gaza at scale, was to put pressure on the group.\n\nIsrael’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, slammed the ICJ’s advisory opinion as “shameful”, claiming UN institutions are “breeding grounds for terrorists”.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the proceedings, but it did submit its legal position in writing. In April, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the hearings as a “circus” and said the court was being politicised.\n\nIwasawa said the court “rejects the argument that the request abuses and weaponises the international judicial process”.\n\nOn the eve of the ICJ ruling, Abeer Etefa, Middle East spokesperson for the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), said 530 of the organisation’s trucks had crossed into Gaza since the ceasefire.\n\nThose trucks had delivered more than 6,700 tonnes of food, which she said was “enough for close to half a million people for two weeks”.\n\nEtefa said about 750 tonnes a day were now coming through, which, although more than before the ceasefire, remains well below WFP’s target of about 2,000 tonnes daily.\n\nThe ICJ said that Israel, as an occupying power, was under an obligation “to ensure the basic needs of the local population, including the supplies essential for their survival”.\n\nAt the same time, Israel was “also under a negative obligation not to impede the provision of these supplies”, the court said.\n\nThe court also recalled the obligation under international law not to use starvation as a method of warfare.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from The Hague, said the advisory opinion is still seen as “very important” because the ICJ is the primary legal body of the UN.\n\n“Even if Israel ignores it, as it’s done time and time again, all the UN countries are obliged to follow up on this court’s advice,” Vaessen said. “Even if Israel is ignoring it now, it will hang over the head of Israel from this moment on.”\n\nThe UN General Assembly had asked the ICJ to clarify Israel’s obligations, as an occupying power, towards the UN and other bodies, “including to ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival” of Palestinians.\n\nICJ judges heard a week of evidence in April from dozens of nations and organisations, much of which revolved around the status of UNRWA.\n\nThe ICJ at the time noted that UNRWA “cannot be replaced on short notice without a proper transition plan”.\n\nPalestinian official Ammar Hijazi told the ICJ judges during the April hearings that Israel was blocking aid as a “weapon of war” and triggering starvation in Gaza.\n\nWednesday’s case was separate from the others Israel faces under international law over its assault in Gaza.\n\nIn July 2024, the ICJ issued another advisory opinion stating that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territory was “unlawful” and must end as soon as possible.\n\nICJ judges are also weighing accusations, brought by South Africa, that Israel has broken the 1948 UN Genocide Convention with its actions in Gaza."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/20/un-pushes-for-worldwide-disaster-alerts-as-extreme-weather-spirals","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:35:15+00:00","title":"UN pushes for worldwide disaster alerts as extreme weather ‘spirals’","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has called for urgent global improvements in early-warning systems for extreme weather, as climate change intensifies weather events.

2025-10-20T12:35:15+00:00\n\nTitle: UN pushes for worldwide disaster alerts as extreme weather ‘spirals’\n\nNearly half of all countries lack early-warning systems for extreme weather events, leaving millions – especially those in developing nations – vulnerable.\n\nAs it released a new report on Monday, the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) called for gaps in global monitoring and forecasting networks to be plugged. Timely alerts are crucial to saving lives as extreme weather events multiply due to climate change, it warned.\n\n“Many millions of people lack protection against dangerous weather, which is inflicting an increasing toll on economic assets and vital infrastructure,” said a statement by the WMO, noting that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without early-warning systems.\n\nThe organisation said weather, water and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people in the past 50 years. It added that 90 percent of those deaths occurred in developing countries.\n\n“Impacts are spiralling as weather becomes more extreme,” it said.\n\nThe WMO acknowledged that there has been “huge progress” in climate monitoring over the last decade. The number of countries using some form of multi-hazard early warning systems has jumped from 52 to at least 108.\n\nHowever, it continued, an assessment of 62 countries showed half of them possess only basic capacity and 16 percent have less than basic capacity.\n\n“The situation is worst in fragile, conflict and violence-affected contexts,” the organisation said.\n\nNevertheless, the WMO is seeing progress in Africa, with more countries having functioning websites and issuing standardised alerts.\n\n“Early warning means early action. Our goal is to not only warn the world; it is to empower it,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a speech as the UN institution opened its annual conference in Geneva on Monday.\n\nThe world has been rocked by numerous weather-related disasters in 2025. Huge  flooding has rocked countries including Pakistan ,  Nigeria  and  South Korea . Wildfires have devastated large areas in  southern Europe , as well as  the US .\n\nThe head of Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, told delegates at the conference that no country or region was spared from the effects of climate change and extreme weather.\n\nShe pointed to the example of how the regular monitoring of a mountain glacier allowed scientists to warn about its imminent collapse in May 2025, allowing for the evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten.\n\n“Permafrost melt will inevitably lead to more glacier collapses and rockfalls,” making early warning systems vital, she said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/21/what-caused-amazons-aws-outage-and-why-did-so-many-major-apps-go-offline","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"02:23:04+00:00","title":"What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An AWS outage that began at 07:11 GMT on October 20, 2025, due to a human error in a technical update to DynamoDB’s API in Virginia, caused a cascading failure of 113 services.

Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/pariss-louvre-museum-reopens-after-102m-jewel-heist","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:36:55+00:00","title":"Paris’s Louvre Museum reopens after $102m jewel heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre Museum in Paris reopened three days after a high-profile heist in which thieves stole an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) worth of jewels, including a historically significant emerald-and-diamond necklace from Napoleon I’s wife and a diadem from Empress Eugenie.

UN relief agency UNRWA resume full Gaza operations?\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued an  advisory opinion  saying that Israel must support United Nations relief efforts in Gaza, including those conducted by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), regarding Israel’s legal responsibilities towards UN agencies and other international organisations operating in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nThe court found that Israel’s allegations against UNRWA – including that it had been complicit in the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel – were unsubstantiated.\n\n“The court finds that Israel has not substantiated its allegations that a significant part of UNRWA’s employees are ‘members of Hamas … or other terrorist factions’,” said ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa.\n\nThe court also said that Israel, as the occupying power, had to ensure that the “basic needs” of the Palestinian population of Gaza were met, “including the supplies essential for survival”, such as food, water, shelter, fuel, and medicine.\n\nA number of countries had halted funding for UNRWA after Israel’s accusations, jeopardising one of Gaza’s most desperately needed lifelines.\n\nIsrael was also able to use the accusation to effectively ban the agency from the enclave – as well as the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem – in January of this year, forcing Gaza’s population to rely even further upon Israel for the food, aid and resources needed to sustain life.\n\nIsrael has severely restricted the entry of aid into Gaza, leading to a famine that now affects children, the sick and the vulnerable in the enclave.\n\nBefore Israel banned it from bringing in aid into Gaza,  UNRWA  was Gaza’s main provider of humanitarian and social services. It supported about 1.4 million Palestinian refugees, operating schools serving some 300,000 children, health clinics offering primary care and vaccinations, and large-scale food and cash assistance programmes.\n\nUNRWA also helped coordinate shelter and relief efforts, run community and mental health initiatives and, under the face of Israeli blockade, served as a de facto public service provider.\n\nThe UN agency has however said that it is able to carry on operating in Gaza and elsewhere, although it is heavily restricted.\n\nThat is not clear.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by UNRWA’s Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini in the wake of what he called the ICJ’s “unambiguous“ ruling, Israel “is under an obligation to agree to and facilitate relief schemes provided by the United Nations and its entities, in particular UNRWA”.\n\nBut the decision issued by the ICJ is an advisory opinion, and the world court has no power to enforce it.\n\nIn a statement put out on social media, Israel’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, claimed that Israel categorically rejected the ICJ’s opinion.\n\nIn addition to repeating Israel’s prior accusations against UNRWA without adding any corroborating evidence, Marmorstein went on to claim that Israel “fully upholds its obligations under International Law. Israel fully rejects the politicization of International Law, which seeks to produce political outcomes and impose measures intended to harm the State of Israel”.\n\nNot according to many.\n\nAs well as its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory, global legal authorities have repeatedly accused Israel of entirely disregarding international law. In addition to widespread accusations of  torture , arbitrary execution, collective punishment and using food as a weapon of war, both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant are subject to international warrants on charges of war crimes.\n\nNone of these include the charge of genocide currently being considered by the ICJ and since affirmed by numerous organisations, including Amnesty International and the International Association of Genocide Scholars.\n\nIt is not.\n\nTwo investigations in 2024 –  one led by France’s former Foreign Minister  Catherine Colonna in April and another by the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS)  in August  – both failed to find evidence fully supporting Israel’s claims, although the latter did acknowledge that some individual employees may have been involved.\n\nFollowing Israel’s claims, major donors, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and the European Union (EU) all halted or suspended funds for the UN agency.\n\nThe majority, including Canada, Sweden, Australia and the EU, all resumed funding after Israel was unable to provide evidence to support its claim.\n\nWe may never know.\n\nIsrael has killed more than 68,000 people directly since its war on Gaza began two years ago. Countless more have died of hunger or secondary illnesses that could have been prevented with adequate aid.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), described how families in Gaza continue to endure famine, “overwhelming” injuries, a collapsed healthcare system, and disease outbreaks accelerated by Israel’s destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/syria-arrests-former-officer-in-charge-of-notorious-sednaya-prison","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:56:00+00:00","title":"Syria arrests ex-military official in charge of notorious Sednaya prison","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Syrian authorities have arrested Major General Akram Salloum al-Abdullah, a former military official who served as Commander of the Military Police from 2014 to 2015, for allegedly carrying out executions and torture of political prisoners at the notorious Sednaya prison.

2025-10-22T18:29:20+00:00\n\nTitle: US conducts eighth strike on alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Pacific\n\nThe United States has conducted an eighth military strike on a vessel alleged to be carrying illicit drugs across international waters.\n\nBut for the first time, the boat in question was not in the Caribbean Sea but instead in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the strike on social media Wednesday, saying it took place a day prior.\n\n“Yesterday, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth  wrote .\n\n“There were two narco-terrorists aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters. Both terrorists were killed.”\n\nA video accompanying Hegseth’s post shows a missile striking a small blue boat clipping across the water, which subsequently erupts in flames.\n\nThe latest strike opens a new front in President Donald Trump’s growing military campaign against Latin American cartels, fuelling questions about the limits and legality of his actions.\n\nStill, the Trump administration has justified the deadly bombing campaign as necessary to protect US citizens from illicit drugs.\n\nIt has sought to frame drug traffickers as enemy combatants, a theme Hegseth reprised in Wednesday’s statement, where he compared the boat’s occupants to the armed group al-Qaeda.\n\n“Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people. There will be no refuge or forgiveness—only justice,” Hegseth wrote.\n\nBut critics have pointed out that the attacks are likely to have violated US and international law, which generally prohibits extrajudicial killings outside of combat.\n\nLabelling someone a “terrorist” is also not sufficient to justify an attack on a non-state actor.\n\n“There’s a world of difference between these (alleged) unspecified narcos and al Qaeda,” Brian Finucane, a researcher with the International Crisis Group nonprofit, posted on social media.\n\n“No armed attack on U.S. like 9/11. No armed conflict. Just the U.S. government engaged in lawless premeditated killing.”\n\nCBS News was the first to report the air strike on Wednesday, citing anonymous US officials. Tuesday’s attack brings the confirmed death toll from Trump’s bombing campaign to 34, according to government statements.\n\nThe air strikes began on September 2, when Trump  announced  on his social media account that he had ordered “a kinetic strike” that morning on a small boat travelling through international waters.\n\nEleven people — whom Trump identified as “terrorists” — were killed in the attack. Their identities were not disclosed, nor was any evidence provided about their destination or cargo.\n\n“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,” Trump said, accusing the boat’s passengers, without proof, of being linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nMore attacks followed. On September 15, another strike occurred in the Caribbean, killing three people. Then a third strike took place on September 19, also killing three.\n\nThe bombing campaign spilled over into the following month. On October 3, Hegseth announced a new strike had claimed the lives of four people. Six more people were killed on October 14.\n\nThe seventh known strike, however, was a departure from the Trump administration’s routine for announcing attacks.\n\nGenerally, Trump and his associates had been among the first to reveal the attacks, sharing them on social media paired with grainy aerial footage.\n\nBut on October 16, US media broke the news that a strike had taken place — and that there were two survivors, a first. The Trump administration confirmed the attack a day later.\n\nThe survivors were quickly repatriated to their home countries, Ecuador and Colombia. Ecuador has since released its survivor, saying there was no evidence he was involved in a crime.\n\nBut Trump doubled down, describing the men as riding in what he  called  “a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE”. Two additional people, he confirmed, were killed in the attack.\n\nA  seventh strike  came shortly thereafter, on October 17. This time, however, the three people killed on the boat were identified as members of the National Liberation Army (ELN), a Colombian rebel group.\n\nPrevious ships had been largely tied to Venezuela, whose president, Nicolas Maduro, has long had an adversarial relationship with Trump.\n\nBoth Venezuela and the US have increased their military presence along the Caribbean since the attacks began.\n\nThe string of attacks is the culmination of months in which Trump suggested he was willing to take aggressive action to stem the flow of illicit drugs.\n\nHe has also tied his campaign against drug trafficking to the Maduro administration, blaming the Venezuelan leader for masterminding efforts by the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nThere is, however, no proof that Maduro is involved with Tren de Aragua or its illicit drug trade.\n\nRather, in May, a declassified memo revealed that the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence found no evidence that Maduro is directing the gang, appearing to contradict Trump.\n\nStill, Trump has used the alleged ties between Maduro and Tren de Aragua to justify his use of wartime laws, including the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nThe US, Trump has repeatedly argued, faces an “invasion” of Latin American criminals, though courts have largely rejected that rationale.\n\nNonetheless, Trump’s apparent willingness to take military action abroad has stirred concerns throughout Latin America.\n\nUpon taking office on January 20, Trump issued an executive order calling on his officials to label drug cartels “foreign terrorist organisations”, a designation traditionally used to label foreign actors who seek to destabilise the US.\n\nThen, in August, Trump reportedly signed a secret order calling on the US armed forces to begin using military force against the cartels.\n\nNews of that order led Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to quell concerns about a possible strike on her country’s soil. “The United States is not going to come to Mexico with their military,” she told reporters that month.\n\nStill, Trump has leaned into the possibility that he may pursue land-based operations.\n\n“A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea,” he told reporters in the Oval Office this month. “But we’re going to stop them by land also.”\n\nHe also confirmed that he  had authorised  the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to begin covert operations in Venezuela.\n\nA  memo  Trump reportedly sent to Congress justified the recent slate of attacks by asserting the alleged drug traffickers were “unlawful combatants” in an “non-international armed conflict”.\n\nThe repeated strikes on nautical vessels, however, have raised questions about the motives and efficacy of the attacks.\n\nThe US government itself has acknowledged that most illicit drugs arrive in the US by land, particularly at ports of entry along the border with Mexico.\n\nThe lack of information about the boat strikes has also fuelled speculation about the identities of those aboard and whether they were involved in any illicit activity at all.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, one family has asserted that their loved one, a fisherman, was killed in one of the missile strikes. In Colombia, President Gustavo Petro likewise has claimed that a citizen, Alejandro Carranza, was among the dead.\n\n“Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to drug trafficking and his daily activity was fishing,” Petro  wrote  on social media this month.\n\nHe demanded an explanation from the US government and accused it of violating international law. “US government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters.”\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of three United Nations experts called for a halt to the bombings, describing them as a breach of the UN Charter.\n\n“The use of lethal force in international waters without proper legal basis violates the international law of the sea and amounts to extrajudicial execution,” the UN experts wrote.\n\n“The long history of external interventions in Latin America must not be repeated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/israels-parliament-advances-bill-to-annex-occupied-west-bank","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"16:23:34+00:00","title":"Israel’s parliament advances bill to annex occupied West Bank","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel’s parliament has passed a preliminary vote on a bill to impose Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, a move widely interpreted as annexation and a violation of international law.

annex occupied West Bank\n\nIsrael’s parliament has voted to give preliminary approval to a bill to impose Israeli sovereignty on the occupied West Bank, in a move tantamount to annexation of the Palestinian territory, which would be a blatant violation of international law.\n\nDespite opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party, lawmakers in the 120-seat Knesset voted 25-24 on Tuesday to advance the bill, in the first of four votes needed to pass it into law.\n\nA Knesset statement said the bill was approved in a preliminary reading “to apply the sovereignty of the State of Israel to the territories of Judea and Samaria (West Bank)”. It will now go to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee for further deliberations.\n\nThe vote, which came a month after US President Donald Trump stated he  would not allow Israel  to annex the occupied West Bank, was held during a visit by US Vice President JD Vance to Israel to shore up the ceasefire agreement in Gaza.\n\nIn a statement, Likud called the votes “another provocation by the opposition aimed at damaging our relations with the United States”.\n\n“True sovereignty will be achieved not through a showy law for the record, but through proper work on the ground,” the statement said.\n\nAnnexing the occupied West Bank would effectively end the possibility of implementing a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, as outlined in UN resolutions.\n\nSome members in Netanyahu’s coalition – from National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s Jewish Power party and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s Religious Zionism faction – voted in favour of the bill.\n\n“The people have spoken,” Smotrich said in a post on X.\n\n“The time has come to apply full sovereignty over all the territories of Judea and Samaria – the inheritance of our forefathers – and to promote peace agreements in exchange for peace with our neighbours, from a position of strength,” he said, using Biblical terms for the West Bank.\n\nThe bill was put forward by Avi Maoz, the leader of the far-right Noam Party, which does not belong to the governing coalition.\n\nMost Likud lawmakers abstained or failed to show up for the vote, but one member – Yuli Edelstein – defied Netanyahu and cast the decisive vote in favour of the bill.\n\n“At this very moment, Israeli sovereignty throughout our homeland is the order of the day,” he said in a post on X.\n\nA second bill by an opposition party proposing the annexation of the  Maale Adumim settlement  was also passed.\n\nIn August, Israel approved a major settlement project between Maale Adumim and Jerusalem in an area of the occupied West Bank that the international community has warned would destroy the viability of a future Palestinian state.\n\nThe votes drew swift condemnation from the Palestinian Foreign Ministry ,  Hamas, Qatar and Jordan.\n\nIn a statement, the ministry condemned the vote, saying it “strongly rejects the Knesset’s attempts to annex Palestinian land”.\n\n“The occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, constitute a single geographic unit over which Israel has no sovereignty,” it said.\n\nHamas said in a statement that the bills reflected “the ugly face of the colonial occupation”.\n\n“We affirm that the occupation’s frantic attempts to annex West Bank lands are invalid and illegitimate,” the group said.\n\nQatar’s Foreign Affairs Ministry condemned the move in the “strongest terms”, calling the votes a “blatant violation of the historical rights of the Palestinian people and a challenge to international law”.\n\nStatement | Qatar condemns in the strongest terms the Knesset’s approval of two laws aimed at imposing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank and a settlement #MOFAQatar   pic.twitter.com/zpEQwVwLiU\n\n— Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Qatar (@MofaQatar_EN)  October 22, 2025\n\nJordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates also condemned the Knesset votes.\n\n“This is considered a blatant violation of international law, an undermining of the two-state solution, and an infringement on the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of their independent, sovereign state based on the June 4, 1967 borders, with occupied Jerusalem as its capital,” said the statement on X.\n\nMore than 700,000 Israelis live in illegal settlements on Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nAll of Israel’s settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law.\n\nThe United Nations principal court in 2024 said that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, and its settlements there are illegal, and should be withdrawn as soon as possible.\n\nMembers of Netanyahu’s coalition have been calling for years for Israel to formally annex parts of the occupied West Bank, and Netanyahu’s government had been mulling annexation as a response to a string of its Western allies recognising a Palestinian state in September.\n\nBut it had appeared to back off the plans after Trump made clear such a move would be unacceptable.\n\nIsraeli political analyst Ori Goldberg described the vote as part of the Knesset’s “mainly performative” pushback to Netanyahu over the Gaza ceasefire deal, amid complaints it had been forced on Israel by the US and Middle East powers.\n\n“The Knesset today passed the preliminary stage of a bill calling for … imposing Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, which is technically supposed to resemble annexation. But that’s a rhetorical gesture,” he said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, which established ties with Israel under the so-called Abraham Accords brokered by Trump in his first term in office, last month warned that it considered the annexation of the West Bank a red line."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"2210-10-22","timeOfPublication":"22:00:00Z","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article highlights a range of global developments in science, technology, and policy: from concerns over AI-fueled misinformation and deepfake audio fraud, to geopolitical tensions involving Russia and Lithuania, and strategic US-China tech competition.

London, calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all the detained healthcare workers currently held in appalling conditions in Israel.\n\nThe protest comes just days after an Israeli court extended Abu Safia’s arbitrary detention for another six months under the widely condemned Unlawful Combatants Law.\n\nA further five healthcare workers have died or been killed while in Israeli detention, and five more are missing, their whereabouts unknown. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, at least 1,722 healthcare workers have been killed in Israeli strikes in the past two years.\n\nAccording to HWW, most healthcare workers were abducted by the Israeli military from their hospitals or ambulances while they were on duty. Testimonies collected by HWW and other organisations catalogue the torture and abuse that Palestinians endure in Israeli detention.\n\nDr Rebecca Inglis, an intensive care doctor and co-founder of Gaza Medic Voices, says: “Israel’s continued detention of nearly one hundred healthcare workers is in clear contravention of International Humanitarian Law. We are gravely concerned for their welfare given the extensive evidence that Palestinian detainees are being tortured while in Israeli detention.”\n\nAbu Safia , the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza, was arrested by Israeli forces on December 27, 2024, after troops raided the hospital, which at the time was one of the last functioning medical facilities in the region.\n\nAmnesty International says that the hospital director has been held without charge or trial under an Israeli security law.\n\nDespite relentless bombardment and the tragic death of his own son in an Israeli air strike, Abu Safia remained on duty, caring for patients and leading his team through unimaginable conditions.\n\nSince his detention, credible reports have emerged of torture, physical abuse and degrading treatment, including suffering significant weight loss and the denial of adequate medical care, hygiene and timely access to legal counsel – in clear violation of international law.\n\nAt least 94 percent of hospitals in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, with many no longer operational. In addition to this, skilled doctors and healthcare workers have been killed, and paired with the detention of healthcare workers – most of whom were detained while working within hospitals and healthcare facilities – it has added to the immense pressure on Gaza’s vulnerable health system.\n\nBetween October 7, 2023, to October 20, 2025, HWW documented a total of 431 cases of detained Palestinian healthcare workers.\n\nAs of October 20, 2025:\n\nHWW has said it has not yet received an update from the families of 22 detained healthcare workers, who are not included in the “confirmed detained” or “confirmed released” figures.\n\nThe healthcare professionals still detained by Israel have spent an average of 511 days in detention, with some held captive since the early weeks of the war.\n\nOf the 95 being held, 80 are from Gaza, while the remaining 15 are from the occupied West Bank.\n\nFrom Gaza alone, 31 nurses have been detained, followed by 17 physicians, 15 hospital support and management staff, 14 paramedics, two pharmacists and one medical technician. Twenty-five held senior positions, 50 occupied mid-level positions, while five were junior healthcare workers. All except one are male.\n\nMost of the healthcare workers lived in North Gaza, with 36 of the prisoners from there, followed by 24 from Khan Younis, 18 from Gaza City and 3 from Rafah.\n\nThe table below lists more information about the 95 healthcare workers still held captive by Israel."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/why-planned-trump-putin-talks-collapsed-and-what-it-means-for-ukraine","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:07:56+00:00","title":"Why planned Trump-Putin talks collapsed, and what it means for Ukraine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Planned in-person talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, collapsed after Trump proposed a ceasefire along the current front lines in Ukraine's Donbas region, suggesting no territorial changes at that time.

talks collapsed, and what it means for Ukraine\n\nPlans for  an in-person meeting  between United States President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in the next two weeks in Budapest, Hungary,  fell apart  on Tuesday, after Trump proposed “freezing” the Russia-Ukraine war with a ceasefire along the current front lines.\n\nApparently signalling that no meeting would take place anytime soon, Trump told the media at the White House on Tuesday: “I don’t want to have a wasted meeting. I don’t want to have a waste of time, so I’ll see what happens.”\n\nThe latest derailing of peace talks to bring an end to Russia’s 42-month-long war on Ukraine comes just two months after Trump and Putin met at a hastily arranged  summit in Alaska  in August this year that also did not yield any results.\n\nThe largest and deadliest war in Europe since World War II has killed tens of thousands of people on both sides.\n\nSo, why have plans for talks collapsed yet again, and what will it take for Russia to end the war?\n\nDuring his presidential campaign last year, Trump  boasted  that it would take him just “24 hours” to end the  war between Russia and Ukraine . More than a year later – and 10 months into his second term as US president – he is now growing increasingly frustrated about the lack of progress.\n\nPutin has called for the complete disarmament of Ukraine and for Russia to keep any territory it has seized during the war if it is to agree to a ceasefire. Ukraine has baulked at the notion of ceding land, and Trump has been unable to make any headway between the two positions.\n\nLate on Sunday, Trump called on Russia to, instead, “freeze” the war along current battle lines, adding that the two sides could aim to resolve the “details” over territory at future talks.\n\n“What I say is they should stop right now at the battle lines, go home, stop killing people and be done,” the US president said.\n\nThe current front line runs through the Donbas region, an industrial hub which has endured most of the fighting. On the region’s future, Trump said: “Let it be cut the way it is. It’s cut up right now – I think 78 percent of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is right now. They can negotiate something later on down the line.”\n\nYes. A statement signed by European leaders, including Zelenskyy, on Tuesday said they “strongly” supported Trump’s proposal to stop the fighting immediately, and that “the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations”.\n\nThe leaders accused the Russian president of stalling the peace process. “Russia’s stalling tactics have shown time and time again that Ukraine is the only party serious about peace,” the statement said. “We can all see that Putin continues to choose violence and destruction.”\n\nThe leaders also pledged to “ramp up the pressure on Russia’s economy and its defence industry, until Putin is ready to make peace”.\n\nOn Monday, before plans for a Trump-Putin meeting collapsed, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made clear that the Russian leader would not acquiesce to the latest proposal to “freeze” the war. He said “the consistency of Russia’s position doesn’t change”, referring to its insistence on hardline demands to end its war, including a complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the eastern regions that Moscow has laid claim to.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Reuters news agency reported that Russia had also sent a private communique to the US “over the weekend”, demanding control of all of Ukraine’s Donbas region – not just the parts it has already seized.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also spoke with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio by telephone on Tuesday, and later told reporters in Moscow that he had conveyed that Moscow “has not changed its position compared to the understandings that were reached during the Alaska summit”.\n\nLavrov reiterated Putin’s Alaska summit position, noting that Russia would agree to end the war only after eliminating the “primary causes” of the conflict – meaning the disarming of Ukraine and the ceding of territory lost to Russia during the war.\n\nThat is unacceptable to Kyiv.\n\nYes. Trump has  repeatedly shifted his position  while attempting to mediate a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nWhile the previous US administration, under President Joe Biden, expressed unflinching support for Ukraine, the Trump administration took a hard line with Zelenskyy during a  meeting at the Oval Office  in Washington, DC, in February this year. During a fiery exchange, Trump and Vice President JD Vance admonished Zelenskyy for not expressing enough gratitude to the US for the help it has already provided.\n\nIn March, Trump threatened sweeping secondary tariffs and sanctions against Moscow – and repeated this threat in August. But when he later met Putin in Alaska in August, he appeared to be pressuring Zelenskyy to accept a deal, even as the Kremlin demanded that Ukraine cede territories and keep away from NATO.\n\n“There’ll be some land swapping going on,” Trump told reporters, insisting that both sides would need to cede territories.\n\nSwitching tack yet again the following month, Trump appeared to again back the Ukrainian president, when he stated that Kyiv could win back its territories – or “maybe even go further than that”.\n\nMostly, more uncertainty. The collapse of the planned summit means that, for now, there is no end to the Russia-Ukraine war in sight.\n\nLast week, Zelenskyy was again at the White House, as he pressed his demand for the supply of US Tomahawk missiles, hoping it would equip Kyiv to hit targets deep inside Russian territory. He did not secure that agreement.\n\nTrump had expressed openness to the idea previously; however, he backtracked from that possibility during the meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday.\n\nZelenskyy has also been pressing the White House to increase military support generally, but Trump has previously signalled that Ukraine’s European allies in NATO should be the ones to take a more proactive role."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/where-might-the-stolen-louvre-jewels-end-up-will-the-robbers-be-caught","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"14:12:04+00:00","title":"Where might the stolen Louvre jewels end up; will the robbers be caught?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre Museum in Paris, France, was robbed on October 19, 2025, with thieves stealing eight Napoleonic-era jewellery items, including the crown of Empress Eugenie, which was later recovered.

robbers be caught?\n\nThe Louvre Museum in Paris, France, reopened to the public on Wednesday after a jewellery heist prompted a three-day closure.\n\nDuring the robbery, a band of thieves  broke into  the French capital’s iconic museum and stole eight items of jewellery containing precious jewels from the Napoleonic era on October 19. The robbers are still at large, and the jewels have not been found.\n\nHere is what we know so far about where the jewellery could be, whether it can be traced, and whether the robbers will be found.\n\nAt 9:30am (07:30 GMT), a group of robbers used a  truck-mounted ladder  to reach the gilded Galerie d’Apollon (Apollo’s Gallery) on the second floor of the museum before taking an angle grinder to a window to access the French crown jewels. The heist took place around half an hour after the museum opened to the public.\n\nThe  stolen articles  were:\n\nThe robbers also stole a ninth item, the crown of Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III. But it was recovered nearby, thought to have been dropped by the thieves, according to the French Ministry of the Interior.\n\nThe haul of  jewels  is worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102m), Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau told RTL radio on Tuesday.\n\n“It is important to remember that this damage is an economic damage, but it is nothing compared to the historical damage caused by this theft,” Beccuau said.\n\nThis is  not the first  time the Louvre has been robbed. However, previous robberies have mostly involved the theft of paintings – for example, the Mona Lisa, which was stolen in 1911 – rather than jewels.\n\n“A jewellery theft is a very different thing to consider because of the high intrinsic value of the object stolen,” American art historian Noah Charney told Al Jazeera on Tuesday.\n\n“A painting doesn’t have a high intrinsic value because it’s usually made of panel and pigment, and canvas and nothing more. Whereas jewellery has a high intrinsic value because if you break down what was stolen and sell the components, the value is still significant,” Charney explained.\n\nThe jewels are most likely still in France, Dutch art historian Arthur Brand told Al Jazeera.\n\nThey could be sold on the black market, but this would reduce their value because of the high risk associated with being in possession of them.\n\n“They are very ‘hot’ and the price on the black market will be way below the regular market,” Brand said, estimating that the black-market prices would be between 10 and 30 percent of their value. This means the $102m jewels could sell at between $10.2m and $30.6m on the black market.\n\nCharney said the thieves will not need to go to the black market at all if the jewels are recut significantly and no longer identifiable. However, re-cutting gems also reduces their value. If a thief tries to re-cut an antique diamond to a modern shape, they may lose some of the diamond’s size and value.\n\nCorinne Chartrelle, a former officer with the French Police’s unit for cultural property trafficking, told Reuters that the stolen jewels could ultimately be sold in major diamond markets such as Antwerp in Belgium, where some buyers may not care about their origins.\n\nAlternatively, “they might try to sell the jewels in countries like India, Israel or Dubai,” said Brand.\n\n“The thieves will get caught for sure. Recovering the jewels is 50 percent – depends on the time it will take to arrest the thieves,” Brand said.\n\nPublic prosecutors have tasked the BRB (Brigade de Repression du Banditisme – or the Banditry Repression Brigade), a specialised Paris police unit experienced in handling high-profile thefts, with investigating the heist.\n\nFormer police officer Pascal Szkudlara, who previously worked in the BRB, told Reuters that the unit is experienced in such cases, and handled the 2016 Paris theft of media personality Kim Kardashian’s engagement ring, worth $4m. Szkudlara said he was “100 percent” confident that the thieves would eventually be caught.\n\nPolice are expected to review surveillance camera footage going back weeks in an attempt to identify suspicious people in and around the premises.\n\nHowever, time is limited because if the jewels are recut, they will never be returned to their original form, even if the thieves are caught.\n\nThe Louvre robbery comes amid a recent spate of jewellery thefts from other museums in Europe. Recent incidents include:\n\nOn September 30, a 24-year-old Chinese woman was arrested in Barcelona after stealing six gold nuggets from the Museum of Natural History in Paris. The gold nuggets were worth about 1.5 million euros ($1.74m).\n\nThe woman was arrested while trying to dispose of melted gold – it is unclear who may have melted it. The museum’s alarms and security system had been disabled in a cyberattack, but it is also unclear whether the thieves were the ones behind the cyberattack or whether the theft was opportunistic.\n\nIn late January, thieves stole four artefacts including three gold bracelets and a gold helmet that was estimated to be around 2,500 years old from the Drents Museum in Assen, northeast Netherlands.\n\nThe artefacts were part of an exhibit on the Dacians, an ancient society that once inhabited the land that is now Romania.\n\nIn late July, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service (PPS) announced that the investigation into the heist had concluded and three suspects had been identified. The suspects have been arrested and formally indicted, Dutch media reported. Their latest hearing was on October 16 at a court in Assen.\n\nThe PPS did not give information about where the stolen items are located. In an update on May 9, it said it believed they had not been melted down and that the main suspects still had possession of them. “There is currently no information about whether there was an external client behind the theft,” the PPS said.\n\nOn May 7, a gold torc and gold bracelet, dating back to the Bronze Age, were stolen from the Ely Museum, Cambridgeshire, in the United Kingdom.\n\nLater that month, independent charity Crimestoppers offered a 5,000-pound ($6,671) reward for information leading to the conviction of the thieves. There have not been updates on whether the thieves have been caught or the stolen items recovered.\n\nThieves stole 483 ancient gold coins from the Celtic and Roman Museum in Manching, Bavaria. An official estimated that the coins were worth $1.7m, the New York Times reported at the time.\n\nIn July this year, three men were convicted of the theft and sentenced to prison for up to 11 years. Most of the stolen coins remain unrecovered, however. Investigators did find lumps of gold on one suspect during his arrest, which indicated that some or all of the coins might have been melted down."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/14/why-has-dutch-government-taken-control-of-china-owned-chipmaker-nexperia","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-14","timeOfPublication":"13:37:55+00:00","title":"Why has Dutch government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dutch government has taken effective control of the semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech, under the Goods Availability Act due to serious managerial shortcomings attributed to former CEO Zhang Xuezheng.

government taken control of China-owned chipmaker Nexperia?\n\nThe Dutch government has intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/why-us-soya-bean-farmers-are-upset-with-trumps-20bn-argentina-bailout","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:56:56+00:00","title":"Why US soya bean farmers are upset with Trump’s $20bn Argentina bailout","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US government has provided a $20 billion currency swap facility to Argentina to stabilize its economy, a move that has sparked significant criticism from US soybean producers and political figures.

US soya bean farmers are upset with Trump’s $20bn Argentina bailout\n\nCritics of President Donald Trump have zeroed in on a hefty financial aid package for Argentina that comes as Argentinian soya bean farmers have taken market share from United States producers.\n\n“The frustration is overwhelming,” American Soybean Association president Caleb Ragland said on September 24.\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley from Iowa summed up the concerns in an X post: “Why would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers’ biggest market???”\n\nWhy would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers’ biggest market??? We shld use leverage at every turn to help hurting farm economy Family farmers shld be top of mind in negotiations by representatives of USA\n\n— Chuck Grassley (@ChuckGrassley)  September 25, 2025\n\nOn October 19, a reporter asked Trump why he decided to aid Argentina despite concerns among US soya producers.\n\n“Argentina is fighting for its life,” Trump answered. “Young lady, you don’t know anything about it. … They have no money. They have no anything.”\n\nUS aid to Argentina didn’t directly harm US soya producers – they have been hurt by a separate Trump policy, his  trade war  with China. But the timing of the aid and the soya bean export troubles pose a problem of optics for the White House.\n\nAt the same time, Trump is taking heat from Democrats over the scale of the financial aid package in relation to the cost of expiring subsidies that make the cost of Affordable Care Act marketplace plans more affordable. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Adam Schiff of California are among those who have made this argument.\n\nHere’s a guide to what’s going on.\n\nArgentina’s far-right President Javier Milei’s alliance with Trump is key to this story.\n\nMilei, who was inaugurated in December 2023, won the presidency on a platform of slashing government spending as well as other libertarian ideas, a political ideology that emphasises individual liberty and advocates for a limited government.\n\nMilei, whom Trump has called his “favourite president”, presented a chainsaw, a symbol of his aggressive spending cuts, to then-Trump ally Elon Musk at March’s Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nAmid high inflation back home, however, Milei has faced challenges. The Argentinian currency, the peso, is weak, meaning it takes more pesos to buy foreign goods. This has worsened Argentinians’ economic standing and posed a political challenge to Milei.\n\nAhead of key legislative elections in Argentina, the Trump administration offered a $20bn rescue package, known as a currency swap facility, to help stabilise the peso. This is an agreement between two central banks to exchange debt under set terms. The agreement was officially signed on October 20.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent framed the  $20bn  in assistance as support for an ally in need. If Miliei loses the legislative elections, he won’t be able to continue his so-called “chainsaw economics” that have seen drastic cuts in social and welfare spending.\n\n“It’s hope for the future,” Bessent told reporters on October 14. “I think that with the bridge the US is giving them and with the strong policies, that Argentina can be great again.”\n\nCritics say this could involve buying Argentinian bonds at above-market prices, with a risk of monetary losses for the US.\n\n“Buenos Aires’ path back to economic stability requires more than a balanced budget,” wrote Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n“The country’s economy has historically suffered from a shortage of foreign exchange. Its export base is small and commodity heavy. Its external debts are relatively large, and its foreign exchange reserves are low.”\n\nUS Senator Ruben Gallego in an X post on October 15 said that “Trump is DOUBLING his bailout for Argentina. Meanwhile your health care premiums are about to DOUBLE.”\n\n🚨Trump is DOUBLING his bailout for Argentina. Meanwhile your health care premiums are about to DOUBLE.\n\n$40 BILLION to help Trump’s elite friends. $0 to lower costs for American families.  https://t.co/Q6rLeWV6gz\n\n— Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego)  October 15, 2025\n\nA doubling of the Argentina  assistance  hasn’t happened yet, but officials are considering it.\n\nBessent said on October 15 that he was looking for ways to increase US assistance to Argentina by another $20bn, “adjacent” to the initial $20bn. The additional $20bn could come from the private sector rather than taxpayers, he said.\n\nSeparately, at least one subset of Americans – those who receive enhanced subsidies for health insurance purchased on Affordable Care Act marketplaces – could see their health premiums double.\n\nIf Congress and Trump do not extend certain subsidies before they expire at the end of this year, enrollees will have to pay 114 percent more out of pocket on average for their marketplace coverage, according to analyses by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare think tank.\n\nChina  is typically the United States’s largest purchaser of soya beans, importing large amounts from October through March. But US farmers have long worried about heightened competition from South America — and Trump’s high-tariff trade policy “amplifies the issues,” said Chad Hart, an Iowa State University economist who specialises in agriculture.\n\nAfter Trump levied tariffs on China earlier this year, China chose not to purchase US soya beans, sourcing them instead from Argentina and Brazil.\n\n“The South American soybean crop was good this year and is expected to grow next year,” said Todd Hubbs, an Oklahoma State University assistant professor of crop marketing. The soybean crops from Argentina and Brazil are “large enough to meet Chinese needs in the short-term,” Hart said.\n\nMilei temporarily removed export tariffs on many agricultural goods in order to increase the amount of foreign currency flowing into Argentina and offset the peso’s weakness. With that added incentive, China bought approximately 7 million tonnes of soya beans almost immediately, Hubbs said.\n\nSo while the US and China were already at odds over soya when Trump offered assistance to Argentina, it couldn’t have come at a worse time from the perspective of US soya producers. To them, the aid to Argentina seemed to reward a rival country that was taking their business.\n\nTrump promised US aid to farmers hurt by his tariff policies, but that aid has been stalled by the government shutdown.\n\nSenator Brian Schatz connected the scale of the Argentina package to the cost of a key Democratic goal from the ongoing government shutdown: extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced subsidies.\n\n“For the cost of the Argentina bailout we could cover the ACA tax credits for a year,” Schatz posted on October 14 on X.\n\nCounting the initial $20bn in assistance to Argentina, and not the second tranche, Schatz is in the ballpark. The Congressional Budget Office, Congress’s nonpartisan number-crunching arm, projected that for fiscal year 2026, the credits in question would total $24.6bn.\n\nWhile the two expenditures are similar in size, it’s worth noting that the funds to support Argentina couldn’t be shifted to pay for healthcare credits.

neighbourhood, you often hear a familiar refrain: “Mamdani, Mamdani, Mamdani”.\n\nHome to a fast-growing West African community - including many new-immigrant Muslims - Morrisania is among many areas where identity issues of race converge with the needs of the working class ahead of New York’s November 4 mayoral election.\n\nMany in this community are counting on 34-year-old candidate Zohran Mamdani to win.\n\nAfter all, a victory for Mamdani over  former Governor Andrew Cuomo  would mark a series of historic firsts for New York City - its first Muslim mayor, the first born in Africa, and the first person of South Asian descent to lead the largest city in the United States.\n\nIt is a fact that has sparked hope - and grim reminders of entrenched Islamophobia and xenophobia - across the diverse Muslim communities interwoven into the fabric of the city.\n\nBut for Aicha Donza, a shop owner in Morrisania, the Bronx, where annual incomes are half the city's average, it is the avowed Democratic Socialist's message of affordability - ambitious pledges for free buses, rent freezes on certain buildings, and universal childcare, paid for, in part, by increasing taxes on the wealthy - that has won her support.\n\n“He says he’s going to make things easier,” Donza told Al Jazeera, showing off the wares in her store: plantain powder from Ghana; Liberian palm oil imported from the country where she was born; traditional Islamic garb imported from Turkiye, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\n“The rent is so high, every day people come into the store, they say the prices are too high,” she said. “And free buses, if he can manage that, that would make a huge difference”.\n\nOutside of the nearby Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx, following afternoon prayers, Essa Tunkala, 60, ruminated over what the election could mean for the neighbourhood, a melting pot of both working-class trades - parking attendants, cab drivers, and store workers - and West African diaspora.\n\n“It’s almost like you’re in West Africa,” Tunkala grinned, listing residents from Senegal, Liberia, Ghana, Togo, and Mali, to name a few.\n\nHe pointed to several  serious questions  that continue to hang over Mamdani’s run: How will he actualise his vision? Will he be able to rise above the relatively limited ability of the mayoral position to build the kind of coalition with state officials and lawmakers needed to realise his marquee pledges?\n\n“But we need fresh ideas to create opportunities,” said Tunkala, who is originally from the Gambia and sells sporting goods from a table on the street. “This is a new generation with new ideas for development, that’s why I support him.”\n\nAhmed Jejote, a 55-year-old cab driver from Sierra Leone, echoed the sentiment.\n\n“We’ve experienced Eric Adams,” he said, referring to the corruption-plagued current city mayor, who  dropped  out of the race in September. “We’ve seen Cuomo.”\n\n“Mamdani is just starting out, and he wants to go forward,” he said. “So it’s not really about religion for me”.\n\nBlocks away, 46-year-old Mariam Saleh stood over steaming trays of food at Kumasi Restaurant: banku, a fermented mixture of maize and cassava; suya, a spiced meat skewer; kwenkwen, a type of jollof rice.\n\nShe was less circumspect about the historic nature of Mamdani’s run.\n\n“That he is Muslim, for us, is huge progress,” the 46-year-old, who is originally from Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s huge progress for the Muslim community in America, not just in New York.”\n\nSurging to a surprise victory in the June primary, Mamdani represents a kaleidoscope of the diversity that defines the city of more than 8.4 million, where an estimated 800 languages are spoken. Up to one million Muslims live in New York City, estimated to be a quarter of all Muslims in the US.\n\nMamdani is socially progressive, with a history of grassroots activism and staunchly pro-Palestine views. While they do not define his campaign, he has embraced his ties to his birthplace, Uganda, and his identity as a Muslim son of parents of Indian Gujarati and Punjabi descent.\n\nFor Asad Dandia, an urban historian, Mamdani’s success to date is a culmination of 400 years of Muslim history in the city, stretching back to the enslaved Africans brought to New York, about 30 percent of whom were Muslim.\n\nMuslim political power has been both inhibited and energised by waves of discrimination, including in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks and more recently, the genocide in Gaza.\n\nDandia was among the New Yorkers surveilled in the wake of September 11, when the New York Police Department (NYPD) and federal government reportedly spied on at least 250 mosques within a 160km (100-mile) radius of the city, as well as an unknown number of individuals. He launched a successful lawsuit in 2013 after he was targeted by a confidential informant.\n\nMamdani, who Dandia befriended last year, has also spoken about a classmate at his Bronx high school who was “pressured to become an informant”.\n\n“I honestly think some of us have forgotten how truly bad it was,” Dandia reflected, adding that US President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory further charged political action.\n\n“So the last 25 years, since 9/11, have really moulded the community into becoming this formidable force. And I think nothing demonstrates that better than this mayoral election cycle,” the 32-year-old added.\n\n“It's crazy that the same police department that surveilled me and [Mamdani’s community] and the rest of the Muslim community is now going to be under his command.”\n\nDandia’s home neighbourhood in Brighton Beach, where the outer edge of Brooklyn meets the Atlantic Ocean, is a study in the fickle nature of politics for communities that feel left behind.\n\nThe area hosts a Pakistani enclave served by four mosques, as well as a quickly growing Uzbek Muslim population. On Fridays, the city sometimes closes a portion of one of the main streets to accommodate the overflow from prayer.\n\nVoters here swung towards Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but went for the Democratic Socialist Mamdani over his opponents in June’s Democratic primary.\n\nErum Hanif, who heads a community centre launched after the neighbourhood was devastated by Hurricane Sandy, said the idiosyncratic shift indicates, in part, “that the current system is not working out”.\n\n“Many working-class New Yorkers are earning on a day-to-day basis - Uber drivers, grocery store workers, healthcare workers and the working professional, and they are struggling to afford to live. That made them shift towards Mamdani,” the 42-year-old said.\n\nAt a daycare for the elderly run by Hanif’s group - APNA Brooklyn Community Center, which as an organisation does not endorse any candidate - the aunties said they were all in for Mamdani.\n\nAmina Malik, from Lahore, Pakistan, said a top concern is the high price of rent and childcare, both issues that impact elderly residents in an outsized way.\n\n“A lot of seniors like me are struggling to get into rent-stabilised buildings and apartments,” she said in Urdu. “Families cannot afford childcare - Mamdani is going to work on that.”\n\nPerveen Zia, 66, who is also from Lahore, saw in Mamdani the type of representation she had not witnessed before in City Hall - someone who “understands our language and culture” and will ensure services are administered “equitably”.\n\n“Zohran is like my son,” she said.\n\nAbout 18km (12 miles) away, in the Queens neighbourhood of South Richmond Hill, the minarets of Masjid Al Abidin rise above the roti shops and garland-laden bridal stores selling saris and shalwar kameez in “Little Guyana”.\n\nThe area is a microcosm of the overlapping identities of the city’s vast patchwork of neighbourhoods, displaying Guyana’s mix of Indo-Caribbean and South Asian culture: a South American society where Christianity, Islam and Hinduism plait.\n\n“In this neighbourhood, everyone lives like they’re cousins,” said Annie Nazir, 46, who works in childcare and moved to the US from Georgetown, Guyana five years ago.\n\nBut the masjid or mosque also underscores the challenges facing the local population. Construction on the towering structure began in 2012, but has sputtered amid various stresses, including the economic toll of the COVID pandemic. The project relies almost solely on community donations, those familiar said.\n\nBecause of that, congregants currently pray in a nearby two-storey townhouse, with the women’s section located in a similar building across the street.\n\n“As working-class people, a lot of people think it’s time for a change,” Nazir, who attends the mosque, told Al Jazeera. She is a volunteer chapter leader for DRUM Beats, a political committee representing South Asian and Indo-Caribbean workers that is hoping to turn out the vote for Mamdani.\n\nThe upstart politician has maintained a commanding lead in the polls since the primary, but that has narrowed since current Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race in September.\n\nCuomo, meanwhile, has sought to make inroads in some of the communities that buoyed Mamdani.\n\nDuring a primary debate in June, the former governor struggled to name a single mosque he had visited during his 10 years in office. After losing the primary, Cuomo made his first visit of the campaign to a mosque in September, since visiting at least four in the Bronx and Queens.\n\nAt least one Muslim religious leader, Imam Qazi Qayyoom based in Jackson Heights, Queens, has endorsed Cuomo.\n\nMamdani jabbed Cuomo’s newfound approach during a debate on October 16.\n\n“It took me,” he said, “to get you to even see those parts of the city.”\n\nThe line of attack has resonated with some in the Guyanese community, who noted Mamdani visited Masjid Al Abidin back in May ahead of the primary. Other ties to the community predate the election.\n\nAs an assemblyman, Mamdani advocated for Prakash Churaman, a Guyanese immigrant who has maintained he was coerced into giving a false murder confession. He joined taxi workers in a 15-day hunger strike in 2021.\n\nClint Ally, who spoke to Al Jazeera following evening prayers at the masjid, said he hopes Mamdani’s community-oriented style - which has included eschewing corporate donations for small donors - resonates.\n\n“He could go down in history as the first Muslim mayor, but this is a very diverse city,” the 49-year-old said.\n\n“We need someone who understands everybody.”\n\nSitting in his office on 5th Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 71-year-old Zein Rimawi's eyes tear up as he watches a video of Palestinian prisoners being released as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.\n\nMamdani’s outspoken support for Palestinian rights and condemnation of the genocide in Gaza has been particularly resonant in the local community, dubbed “Little Palestine”, where cafes bear names like “Al Aqsa Bakery” and “Nablus Sweets”.\n\nRimawi said he has known Mamdani for about eight years, stretching back to when the then-20-something worked on a campaign in support of Khader El-Yateem, a Palestinian-American Lutheran pastor who launched an unsuccessful bid for New York City Council in 2017.\n\n“I always say to young people: run for any seat. If you win, we win,” he said. “If you lose, we win.”\n\n“Because for a Muslim to run for a seat by itself, it's not easy, but it matters,” he said. “So it’s a win-win situation.”\n\nBut Rimawi also saw Mamdani’s success - at least so far -  as the product of a widening wealth gap in the city, an issue particularly relevant in a neighbourhood like Bay Ridge, once a working-class stronghold where housing prices have skyrocketed in recent years.\n\n“When I got married in 1988, one week’s salary would cover the average rent. Now it costs most of your salary for a month,” said Rimawi, who is originally from the occupied West Bank. “The middle class here in New York is disappearing. If it keeps going like this, soon we’ll only have two classes: The rich and the poor.”\n\nNext door, Essa Masoud, 46, runs the Balady Market, selling products from across the Levant.\n\nThe Palestinian American, who was born and raised in Bay Ridge, was not surprised to see the Islamophobic tropes pushed by the far right in the wake of Mamdani’s June victory.\n\nTrump has threatened to revoke Mamdani’s citizenship. Cuomo has called him a “terrorist sympathiser\".\n\nMasoud saw those attacks as a carefully calibrated “political tool”.\n\n“It’s an effort to change the understanding of the general public, to make people fear that is not the person they should vote for,” he said.\n\nMasoud added that as a business owner and landlord, he does carry reservations about Mamdani’s policies, including his support for rent freezes and for a $30 hourly minimum wage in the city.\n\nHe’s not opposed to Mamdani’s vision, but hopes there “will be balance” if he is elected.\n\nDown the block, Marwa Janini, 34, heads the Arab American Association of New York, which does not endorse any candidate.\n\nFor her, the last two years have been defined by two words: pain and pride.\n\nPain over the atrocities in Gaza and an Islamophobic backlash fuelled in part by the Trump administration. Pride over the success of Mamdani and the message he carries.\n\n“As Muslim New Yorkers, our identities are not fixed; they’re fluid,” she said. “But for someone who grew up in post September 11 New York, with all the fear that created, this is huge.”\n\n“It is a big win for a visibly Muslim woman like myself,” she said, adding that her organisation had been targeted with hate messaging over the last two years, including a death threat pushed under the door.\n\nShe hoped Mamdani’s victory could help to dispel some of those prejudices, especially if he shows he will be “mayor for all New Yorkers”.\n\n“To be in a city where we are possibly - inshallah - going to have a Muslim mayor,” she said, “it is a big deal.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36+00:00","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/how-indigenous-knowledge-is-aiding-pakistans-fight-against-climate-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"05:27:09+00:00","title":"How Indigenous knowledge is aiding Pakistan’s fight against climate change","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In northern Pakistan’s mountainous regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Indigenous knowledge systems—such as observing animal behavior, sudden rainfall, or using gunfire and signal fires—are still being effectively used by local shepherds like Wasiyat Khan and Mohammad Hussain to predict and respond to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).

change\n\nSkardu, Pakistan  – When Wasiyat Khan was woken up by a loud explosion in the middle of the night, he thought “the mountains had burst” and a landslide was on its way.\n\nAccompanied by his family, Wasiyat, a shepherd from Roshan valley of Ghizer, in northern Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, had taken his livestock to elevated land for grazing on a sojourn during the warmer months.\n\nSoon enough, as the family sought immediate safety, he realised the explosion was the sound of a glacier bursting. As their temporary accommodation was being swept away by the floodwaters, Wasiyat thought of the villages which lay in the water’s path.\n\nAt more than 3,000 metres in the darkness of the night, outside help was impossible to get. He immediately jumped across boulders and reached a designated spot where he could get mobile phone signals and alerted the villagers, who numbered about 300.\n\n“Within 30 minutes, we got a call back saying the villagers had evacuated safely and no lives were lost,” Wasiyat told local media. “While they were safe, we were left with nothing, not even a matchstick to keep us warm near the glaciers. It was very cold and we were suffering.\n\n“When we were rescued hours later and taken back to the village, we found out that all our houses and land were covered by mud, but no lives were lost.”\n\nThe glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a common occurrence in northern Pakistan, home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers. As global warming worsens, the effect of more glaciers melting is “likely to be significant” this year, Pakistan’s disaster management authority, NDMA, had said in March.\n\nIn its latest assessment, the NDMA says snowfall across Pakistan in the coming months is projected to be less than average, particularly in areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, reducing overall snow accumulation. A reduced snow cover, it fears, would accelerate glacier retreat by exposing ice earlier in the season, making high-altitude regions more vulnerable to GLOFs.\n\nTo prevent such occurrences, the government mainly relies on its early warning systems (EWS), which help in reducing loss of life and injury, economic losses, protecting critical infrastructure, and enhancing climate resilience.\n\nAn EWS functions through an interconnected process made up of sensors and gauges that collect real-time data monitored by meteorologists and experts to not only warn of a current hazard, but also predict a disaster. Dozens of EWS sites across the most climate-vulnerable valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are currently transmitting real-time data to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nBut residents in northern Pakistan say they are more reliant on Indigenous human knowledge instead of the EWS technology.\n\nMohammad Hussain, a shepherd in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu Valley, told Al Jazeera about an incident when he was inside his stone hut during the summer. After nearly an hour of rainfall, he witnessed strong lightning followed by an unusual roaring sound.\n\nAs he stepped out of the hut to gather his cattle, he saw a powerful flash flood, carrying enormous boulders and uprooting large trees. Acting quickly, he alerted the villagers, which ensured safe evacuation before the floodwaters reached.\n\nHe recounted stories shared by his grandfather, who said people relied on large signal fires, gunfire or specific sound patterns to alert others. Natural signs such as sudden heavy rainfall, cloud formations, unusual animal behaviour, and distinct roaring sounds are still being used to predict flash floods in the absence of the EWS.\n\nIn one incident, he attempted to light a fire to alert villagers below, but, due to daylight and heavy rain, it was ineffective. He then fired his gun three times, a pre-agreed signal indicating danger. Villagers who heard the gunfire raised alarms through the mosque’s loudspeaker, initiating a rapid evacuation.\n\nAlthough there were significant economic losses, there were no casualties, demonstrating the effectiveness of this “human EWS”.\n\nPakistan ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable nations, even though it contributes less than 1 percent of global emissions. The World Bank said in 2023 that the mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change.\n\nThe country’s climate change minister, Musadiq Malik,  recently told Al Jazeera  that “when these [glacial] floods hit, they cause immense mortality, morbidity and widespread displacement,” adding that “it’s a harsh reality we face.” Pakistan faced nearly 90 such floods between 2019 and 2022.\n\nDespite spending millions on EWS and its implementation, there has been widespread lack of trust placed in it by a number of communities, due to frequent reports of malfunctioning of equipment and lack of follow-ups by the concerned agencies.\n\nA report in Pakistan’s Friday Times in June this year said “despite launching the $37m GLOF-II project in 2017, with new gauges, sirens, and local training, no real-time link connects human sensors in villages to official rescue teams.”\n\nThe report warned that “technology alone won’t save lives if SOPs sit buried, rescue checklists gather dust, and trust is missing on the ground.”\n\nSome villagers Al Jazeera spoke to in Gilgit-Baltistan echoed that sentiment, speaking of their lack of trust in the equipment, questioning its effectiveness, and sharing concerns that these systems have not worked. They also slammed officials for falsely taking credit for the system’s effectiveness in saving lives.\n\n“Residents say the EWS in Gilgit-Baltistan have been installed without taking the local authorities and communities into confidence, which was the reason they could not play an effective role,” Zaki Abbas, an Islamabad-based journalist who writes on climate change, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Last year, I was told by a local activist that up to 20 systems had been installed at various spots, but they had not been operational for different reasons. This controversy surrounding this issue had also echoed in the GB legislative assembly, with the opposition leaders in the region most recently demanding an investigation into the failure of these systems. However, no such probe was ordered.\n\n“Their ineffectiveness can be gauged by the fact that warnings about GLOFs have come from people, most recently a shepherd whose timely call saved an entire village, instead of these systems on which billions of rupees have been spent.”\n\nAddressing the challenges remains a task for the government and partners involved in the implementation of EWS. The UNDP said in February this year that “limited financial resources, technical capacity, data gaps and uncertainties, communication barriers, weak institutional capacities, and complex and evolving climate risks” are just some of the issues facing EWS globally.\n\nWhen Wasiyat and two other shepherds from Ghizer were given $28,000 each in August by Pakistan’s prime minister as rewards for saving hundreds of lives, they were told that “this act of courage and responsibility will be written in golden words.”\n\nAs unpredictable rains, snow patterns and melting glaciers continue to affect Pakistan, especially the northern areas, it seems residents are more likely to rely on these “heroes” in the absence of widespread EWS and the community’s trust in them.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d6e2wv884o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:02:15.807+00:00","title":"Louvre failed to spot jewel thieves early enough, says museum boss","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre museum in Paris failed to detect a gang of four thieves who broke in during the first hour of operations on Sunday, stealing €88 million worth of French crown jewels, including a prized diamond and emerald necklace from Napoleon and a crown belonging to Empress Eugenie.

She told senators she had been raising concerns about the state of the Louvre for some time.\n\n\"I am wounded as chair and director that the warnings I was raising, as a whistle-blower, in a sense, have come to pass last Sunday.\n\n\"We've had a terrible failure at the Louvre. I've taken responsibility for it,\" she said.\n\nInterior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France's Europe1 radio on Wednesday that he had \"every confidence\" the thieves would be caught.\n\nProsecutors have said their theory is that the robbers were under orders for a criminal organisation."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxrqpl9elno","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:05:17.433+00:00","title":"Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner apologises for tattoo that resembles Nazi symbol","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Graham Platner, a Democratic Senate candidate in Maine, has apologized and removed a tattoo resembling a Nazi symbol—the Totenkopf—after public backlash.

41-year-old Marine Corps combat veteran and oyster farmer, said he only realised the skull-and-crossbones tattoo resembled Nazi imagery after hearing from \"reporters and DC insiders\".\n\nThe tattoo was visible in a video posted on social media showing Platner dancing in his underwear at his brother's wedding.\n\n\"I absolutely would not have gone through life having this on my chest if I knew that – and to insinuate that I did is disgusting,\" Platner said in a statement to the BBC. \"I already had the tattoo covered with a new design.\"\n\nThe tattoo appears to resemble the Totenkopf - German for \"death's head\". The skull-and-crossbones symbol was used by Nazi forces during World War Two, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nPlatner's former political director, Genevieve McDonald, who resigned from his campaign last week, called the tattoo antisemitic.\n\n\"Maybe he didn't know it when he got it, but he got it years ago and he should have had it covered up because he knows damn well what it means,\" she said, according to US media reports.\n\nPlatner, who is running in a crowded Democratic primary to be his party's nominee for the  Senate seat held by Republican Susan Collins, said he got the tattoo in Croatia with his fellow Marines in 2007.\n\nHe said they picked the image off the parlour wall while drinking.\n\n\"We chose a terrifying looking skull and crossbones off the wall because we were marines and skulls and crossbones are pretty standard military thing,\" he said.\n\nPlatner's campaign team said that military doctors had examined his tattoos and there were never any issues,  as the Army does not allow people with tattoos with hate symbols to serve.\n\nThe controversy comes amid renewed scrutiny of his social media history.\n\nSeveral of Platner's posts on Reddit he made years ago resurfaced last week, including remarks he made downplaying sexual assault in the military and describing himself as a communist.\n\nPlatner, who has emphasised his background as a veteran and small business owner, apologised in a video, saying he made the comments after returning from war and suffering from depression.\n\n\"It left me feeling very disillusioned, very alienated, and very isolated,\" he said. \"And I think, like a lot of people, I went on the internet to post stupid things and get in fights and find some form of community.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, one of Platner's most prominent supporters, defended him on Tuesday, saying the tattoo was chosen while he was inebriated.\n\n\"He's not the only one in America who has gone through a dark period,\" Sanders said. \"People go through that, he has apologized for the stupid remarks, the hurtful remarks that he made, and I'm confident that he's going to run a great campaign and that he's going to win.\""},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/6/ai-now-sounds-more-like-us-should-we-be-concerned","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-06","timeOfPublication":"14:46:58+00:00","title":"AI now sounds more like us – should we be concerned?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A growing number of AI-generated voice scams have emerged, with fraudsters using deepfake technology to impersonate public figures like Italy’s Defence Minister Guido Crosetto.

The speaker, who sounded just like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, had a special request: Please send money to help us free kidnapped Italian journalists in the Middle East.\n\nBut it was not Crosetto at the end of the line. He learned about the call only when several of the targeted businessmen contacted him about it. It eventually transpired that fraudsters had used artificial intelligence (AI) to fake Crosetto’s voice.\n\nAdvances in AI technology mean it is now possible to generate ultrarealistic voiceovers and soundbites. Indeed, new research has found that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices. In this explainer, we unpack what the implications of this could be.\n\nSeveral Italian entrepreneurs and businessmen received calls at the start of February, one month after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had secured the release of Italian journalist  Cecilia Sala , who had been imprisoned in Iran.\n\nIn the calls, the  “deepfake”  voice of Crosetto asked the businessmen to wire approximately 1 million euros ($1.17m) to an overseas bank account, the details of which were provided during the call or in other calls purporting to be from members of Crosetto’s staff.\n\nOn February 6, Crosetto posted on X, saying he had received a call on February 4 from “a friend, a prominent entrepreneur”. That friend asked Crosetto if his office had called to ask for his mobile number. Crosetto said it had not. “I tell him it was absurd, as I already had it, and that it was impossible,” he wrote in his X post.\n\nCrosetto added that he was later contacted by another businessman who had made a large bank transfer following a call from a “General” who provided bank account information.\n\n“He calls me and tells me that he was contacted by me and then by a General, and that he had made a very large bank transfer to an account provided by the ‘General’. I tell him it’s a scam and inform the carabinieri [Italian police], who go to his house and take his complaint.”\n\nSimilar calls from fake Ministry of Defence officials were also made to other entrepreneurs, asking for personal information and money.\n\nWhile he has reported all this to the police, Crosetto added: “I prefer to make the facts public so that no one runs the risk of falling into the trap.”\n\nSome of Italy’s most prominent business figures, including late fashion designer Giorgio Armani and Prada cofounder Patrizio Bertelli, were targeted in the scam. But, according to the authorities, only Massimo Moratti, the former owner of Inter Milan football club, actually sent the requested money. The police were able to trace and freeze the money from the wire transfer he made.\n\nMoratti has since filed a legal complaint with the city’s prosecutor’s office. He told Italian media: “I filed the complaint, of course, but I’d prefer not to talk about it and see how the investigation goes .  It all seemed real. They were good. It could happen to anyone.”\n\nAI voice generators typically use “deep learning” algorithms, through which the AI program studies large data sets of real human voices and “learns” pitch, enunciation, intonation and other elements of a voice.\n\nThe AI program is trained using several audio clips of the same person and is “taught” to mimic that specific person’s voice, accent and style of speaking. The generated voice or audio is also called an AI-generated voice clone.\n\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) programs, which instruct it to understand, interpret and generate human language, AI can even learn to understand tonal features of a voice, such as sarcasm or curiosity.\n\nThese programs can convert text to phonetic components and then generate a synthetic voice clip that sounds like a real human.\n\n“Broadly speaking, we can train an AI model with thousands and thousands of hours of recordings of human voice, so the model can learn what human voices in general sound like,” Nadine Lavan, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That is then for model from which you can create AI-generated voices, either by just asking the model to go and generate a voice that has no real human counterpart or by giving the model an example of a voice and telling it to clone that voice, to create an AI-generated version of that specific voice or a deepfake,” Lavan, who is one of the coauthors of the recent research on AI voice, said.\n\nThe term  “deepfake”  was coined in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, director of machine learning at Apple Special Projects Group. It combines “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to highly realistic AI images, videos or audio, all generated through deep learning.\n\nResearch conducted by a team at Queen Mary University of London and published by the science journal PLOS One on September 24 concluded that AI-generated voices do sound like real human voices to people listening to them.\n\nIn order to conduct the research, the team generated 40 samples of AI voices – both using real people’s voices and creating entirely new voices – using a tool called ElevenLabs. The researchers also collected 40 recording samples of people’s actual voices. All 80 of these clips were edited and cleaned for quality.\n\nThe research team used male and female voices with British, American, Australian and Indian accents in the samples. ElevenLabs offers an “African” accent as well, but the researchers found that the accent label was “too general for our purposes”.\n\nThe team recruited 50 participants aged 18-65 in the United Kingdom for the tests. They were asked to listen to the recordings to try to distinguish between the AI voices and the real human voices. They were also asked which voices sounded more trustworthy.\n\nThe study found that while the “new” voices generated entirely by AI were less convincing to the participants, the deepfakes or voice clones were rated about equally realistic as the real human voices.\n\nForty-one percent of AI-generated voices and 58 percent of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices.\n\nAdditionally, the participants were more likely to rate British-accented voices as real or human compared with those with American accents, suggesting that the AI voices are extremely sophisticated.\n\nMore worrying, the participants tended to rate the AI-generated voices as more trustworthy than the real human voices. This contrasts with previous research, which usually found AI voices less trustworthy, signalling, again, that AI has become particularly sophisticated at generating fake voices.\n\n“One likely explanation for why state-of-the-art AI voice generation has become much more sophisticated recently might be that the models are now trained on vast, high-quality training data sets,” Lavan said.\n\n“That just means that the models get much more information about how voices work, such that it can build up a more detailed picture,” Lavan said. She explained that AI can create more realistic voices by mimicking different accents, intonation, speaking patterns, even breathing sounds and speech errors.\n\nWhile AI-generated audio that sounds very “human” can be useful for industries such as advertising and film editing, it can be misused in scams and to generate fake news.\n\nScams similar to the one that targeted the Italian businessmen are already on the rise. In the United States, there have been reports of people receiving calls featuring deepfake voices of their relatives saying they are in trouble and requesting money.\n\nBetween January and June this year, people all over the world have lost more than $547.2m to deepfake scams, according to data by the California-based AI company Resemble AI. Showing an upward trend, the figure rose from about $200m in the first quarter to $347m in the second.\n\n“If it only takes a few minutes [or even a few seconds] of recording of a voice to clone it in a reasonably convincing manner, one obvious concern for highly realistic AI-generated voices is identity theft,” Lavan said.\n\nHowever, Lavan added that there are positive ways AI-generated voices are being used.\n\n“Beyond risks, though, one of the most promising and compassionate applications of AI-generated voice technology is its potential to restore voices for individuals who can no longer speak, or who have limited control over their physical voice,” Lavan said.\n\n“Today, users can choose to recreate their original voice, if that’s what they prefer, or design a completely new voice that reflects their identity and personal taste.”\n\nAlarmingly, yes. AI programs can be used to generate deepfake videos of real people. This, combined with AI-generated audio, means video clips of people doing and saying things they have not done can be faked very convincingly.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish which videos on the internet are real and which are fake.\n\nDeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media, estimates that about eight million deepfakes will have been created and shared online by the end of this year – a huge increase from the 500,000 that were shared online in 2023.\n\nBesides the phone call fraud and fake news, AI deepfakes have been used to create sexual content about real people. Most worryingly, Resemble AI’s report, which was released in July, found that advances in AI have resulted in the industrialised production of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which has overwhelmed law enforcement globally.\n\nIn May this year, US President Donald Trump  signed a bill  making it a federal crime to publish intimate images of a person without their consent. This includes AI-generated deepfakes. Last month, the Australian government also announced that it would ban an application used to create deepfake nude images."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/13/trumps-100-tariff-threat-history-of-us-trade-measures-against-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-13","timeOfPublication":"14:52:29Z","title":"Trump’s 100% tariff threat: History of US trade measures against China","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article details the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, sparked by China’s export controls on rare earth metals and technological equipment in response to US trade restrictions.

the United States of “double standards” after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew4kqg09j8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:07:13.011+00:00","title":"Why Beyond Meat shares have surged 1,000% in four days","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Beyond Meat shares surged 1,000% in four days due to a combination of online investor enthusiasm, a Reddit-driven meme stock trend, and a strategic distribution deal with Walmart.

burgers is shaky. But traders sure seem to have developed a taste for its stock.\n\nShares in the company have soared about 1,000% over four days - a stunning rally for a company that had seen its share price all but wiped out since it debuted on the stock exchange six years ago.\n\nThe business has been struggling with sluggish sales - and has not posted a quarterly profit in more than five years - as shoppers turn away from its meat alternatives.\n\nThe surge has reignited debate whether the activity, propelled in part by online enthusiasm among everyday investors, is a sign of an overly frothy stock market.\n\nMomentum started to build last week, when a Reddit user helped fuel a wave of purchases, drawing comparisons to other rallies of so-called meme stocks such as  GameStop  and  AMC .\n\nThe gains continued after Roundhill Investments on Monday added the company to the bucket of companies owned by its meme stock ETF, or exchange-traded fund. The move appeared to spark a so-called short squeeze: as the stock price surged, the many investors betting against the company were forced to buy shares to cover their losses.\n\nThe company also announced a distribution deal with Walmart on Tuesday, further boosting its shares.\n\n\"This company was essentially being thought of as going out of business not that long ago,\" said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide.\n\n\"Getting a positive catalyst like the Walmart deal, which could be transformational with the rebound of demand and getting products in the hands of consumers - that is absolutely the trigger,\" he added, referring to the stock surge since last Friday.\n\nBut Mr Hackett cautioned that the Walmart deal to expand distribution \"doesn't necessarily fix all the issues\".\n\n\"You're really trading on emotions and technicals, versus fundamentals,\" Mr Hackett said.\n\nThe company remains on shaky ground. Its share price, at just over $4 on Wednesday afternoon trading in New York, remains well below its all-time high of more than $230 in 2019.\n\nThe Beyond Meat meme stock surge comes against a  backdrop of jitters  about an overvalued stock market.\n\nAt the forefront are concerns about a possible bubble emerging in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Those worries have intensified as analysts struggle to see how the vast sums of money the biggest players are throwing at one another all fit together.\n\nJP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon  echoed the concerns  this month. He told the BBC he was \"far more worried than others\" about a serious market correction, which he said could come in the next six months to two years.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has also noted possible market manipulation tied to meme stocks, warning of the risks to everyday investors.\n\nSome have responded with calls for tighter rules around short selling and social media-fuelled trading.

I don't like it,\" he added. \"These corporations all want something from the government.\"\n\nA dinner for potential donors held at the White House on 15 October included senior executives from prominent US companies including Blackstone, OpenAI, Microsoft, Coinbase, Palantir, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Amazon and Google.\n\nAlso present was Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets NFL team, and Shari and Edward Glazer, who, together with their siblings, own both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Manchester United.\n\nA pledge form seen by CBS News, the BBC's US partner, suggested that donors could be eligible for \"recognition\" for their contributions. While plans are still being finalised, that recognition could potentially take the form of names etched into the structure.\n\nThe White House had originally said that the gigantic structure would have a seated capacity of 650 people. This week, Trump said that it will be able to hold 999.\n\nOnly one contributor has so far been revealed.\n\nCourt documents show that YouTube will pay $22m towards the project as part of a settlement with Trump regarding a lawsuit over the suspension of his account following the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol.\n\nBut it is unclear how many of the rest of those in attendance may have pledged to donate, or how much. An official list has yet to be published, though White House officials say they plan to reveal the one.\n\nDocuments obtained by CBS indicate the donations will be handled by the Trust for the National Mall, a non-profit that works with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House.\n\nAt the event for potential donors, Trump said many of the attendees had been \"really, really generous\" and said that some had asked whether $25m was an appropriate donation.\n\n\"I said: I will take it,\" Trump remarked.\n\nThe White House has insisted there was nothing inappropriate about soliciting donations and that the ballroom will be used by future administrations. The renovation will not cost US taxpayers a cent, it has said.\n\nMartin Mongiello, a former White House executive chef and Camp David general manager who has worked under seven administrations, told the BBC that the money paid to the ballroom \"will eventually pay for itself and save costs\".\n\nThe tents sometimes set outside for events - which he described as \"elbow to elbow\" and \"embarrassing\", often cost $1m or more, not including other ancillary costs associated with having large-scale events.\n\nBut Mr Painter suggested it could be considered a \"pay-to-play scheme\", which has dogged previous White House administrations of both political parties.\n\nIn the 1990s, for example, then-President Bill Clinton came under scrutiny for allegedly selling overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom in exchange for campaign contributions.\n\nMore recently, Trump sought corporate sponsors for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll in April, which some said could amount to companies vying for the president's attention.\n\nTrump and administration officials have said that the new ballroom was a necessary renovation given the lack of large existing facilities to hold state dinners and other events. The White House often uses a tent on the South Lawn to fete foreign leaders and a larger guest list for a state dinner.\n\nBut the scale of the new ballroom, Mr Painter added, poses an \"enormous temptation\" to use the facility for political fundraising that was not the case before, even if presidents from both parties have invited supporters to events.\n\n\"The limited space [now] means that not everyone gets a White House invitation,\" he said. \"In my view, that's a good thing... The [current] size limits the 'pay to play' game, at least on White House premises.\"\n\nProving any wrongdoing, however, is unlikely.\n\n\"You can't prove a quid pro quo,\" Mr Painter said. \"But I think the Trump administration is pushing the envelope here.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmx1kpgr2do","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:09:00.575+00:00","title":"No charges over Trump-Epstein projection on to Windsor Castle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK in September 2025, images of Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected onto Windsor Castle, leading to the arrest of four men on suspicion of malicious communications and public nuisance.

bitter twang in the glasses at British breakfast tables. Only five years ago, a typical supermarket own-label carton of orange juice could be bought for 76p for 1 litre. It now costs £1.79.\n\nThat's a rise of 134% since 2020, and it's up 29% just in the past year.\n\nIn cafes and restaurants it's a similar story - with £3.50 to £4 now a standard price point for a glass of basic OJ.\n\nOne colleague was outraged to be sent a bill for £9 for a glass of hangover-busting orange juice and lemonade at an unassuming little restaurant in Kent. Asked why so much, she was told that the orange juice - albeit freshly squeezed - accounted for £5.30 of the price.\n\nYet as costs have surged, the taste is changing too, with certain manufacturers substituting oranges for mandarins to cut costs.\n\nThe public is, if you like, being freshly squeezed.\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons for this: disease among crops, extreme weather, over-reliance on supply from a single nation, new rules for packaging and complexities around trade wars and Brexit.\n\nAll of this is compounded by grocery price inflation which, after hitting 17.5% in 2023, came down (to around 5.7% in August) but is rising once again.\n\nPlus new figures for overall inflation released today put it at 3.8% - marking the 12th month in a row it is above the Bank of England’s 2% target.\n\nIt is a perfect storm.\n\nYet the problem is not isolated to orange juice - track the prices of all sorts of other groceries in supermarket aisles and you'll see a similar pattern. And so understanding what has happened to orange juice offers a glimpse into how our overall grocery bills suddenly seem so expensive.\n\nIt all prompts the question: is this storm a passing one, or are prices set to remain stubbornly high - and should we brace for them staying that way permanently?\n\nWhere else to start but in the orange groves of Florida where the industrialisation of OJ began as an initiative of the US Army during World War Two.\n\nThe US government was seeking a source of transportable Vitamin C for troops that didn't taste like turpentine.\n\nOrange juice is nearly 90% water. So gently evaporating the water off the juice and freezing the concentrate allowed for transportability of a much-better-tasting product when water was later re-added.\n\nWW2 ended before the troops got to try it, but it ended up being commercialised by what became the American soft drink giant, Minute Maid.\n\nIt was popularised by Bing Crosby, who, as a significant shareholder, would sing in ads and radio show jingles about frozen orange juice being \"better for your health\".\n\nWestern consumption of orange juice surged.\n\nFlash forward to today and an estimated 2.5 billion gallons of orange juice are drunk each year - with about a tenth of that in the UK, where the market is still growing.\n\nAt an industrial unit in the Essex town of Basildon, green steel drums of frozen orange concentrate arrive from Brazil, overseen by Maxim McDonald.\n\nHis firm Gerald McDonald and Co is named after his great-grandfather, a pioneer who was importing orange concentrate as far back as the 1940s from what was then British-mandate Palestine.\n\nToday it produces juices and blends them, then sells them to supermarkets and restaurant suppliers.\n\nBut prices reached extraordinary heights in global markets, rising from $1(75p) to $1.50 (£1.12) per lb over the last decade, to a record $5.30 per lb by the end of last year.\n\nThis followed five years of poor crops, owing to severe drought and a disease called citrus greening (caused by bacteria spread by insects). Brazil had its worst crop since 1988. In some parts of its citrus belt, two thirds of orange trees are affected.\n\n\"Around September of last year the price shot up to crazy levels,\" Maxim tells me. \"At the worst time I was being offered $7 a kilo.\n\n\"For such a major commodity to go from $2 to $7 is insane, but it took a while to filter through to consumers.\"\n\nUntil 2023 the rise in orange juice prices was disguised among food inflation in general, explains Philip Coverdale, an industry expert at consultancy firm GlobalData.\n\nProducers have tried to look beyond South America but it's not easy - the supply of oranges has been sewn up by Brazil, even more so than, say, the Saudis have cornered the market for crude oil.\n\nMorocco, Egypt and South Africa grow oranges too but their supplies are more limited. Spain also grows them, but Valencia and Seville oranges are mostly exported as fruit, rather than concentrate. (Plus Spain too suffered from weather-related production slumps, including the floods in Valencia last October.)\n\nEven within Brazil the market is concentrated in the hands of huge industrialised conglomerates.\n\nIn a truly competitive market the price would settle again - but it hasn't, nor does the industry expect it to. This is a phenomenon that is common to many other ordinary groceries too whose prices have risen.\n\nFlorida is the other traditional exporter of oranges, but output from the Sunshine State over the past year has been the lowest since the Great Depression, amid a high number of hurricanes and long-term problems caused by citrus greening.\n\nOne problem with greening is that it reduces sugar content, making oranges less sweet.\n\n\"Not many are buying Florida oranges any more unless it is a requirement to label the juice 'Florida Orange',\" says Maxim McDonald.\n\n\"It's very difficult to get oranges out of Florida [because of the shortages] and it's too expensive.\"\n\nOne of the leading suppliers to Tropicana sold off some of its land earlier this year to build homes.\n\nTropicana itself, the marquee US brand for orange juice, had to restructure its debts this year. Pepsi has also sold most of its stake in it.\n\nOne of Tropicana's recent product innovations in the US has been to launch an \"essentials\" brand of orange juice \"blends\" - combining orange, apple and pear juice - at a lower price.\n\nSimilar trends can be seen on British shelves. Orange is being mixed with mango, mandarins and clementine juice. Mango purée is especially cheap right now, driven by a good harvest in India. Mandarin concentrate, meanwhile, is cheaper than its orange equivalent because there is less demand for it.\n\nThese developments save money, but also maintain the traditional sweetness of the taste.\n\nThen there is the added impact of the recent spike in trade tensions with the US since President Trump introduced new tariffs.\n\nOranges, it transpires, have been at the centre of it.\n\nUS exports of orange juice to Canada have slumped to a 20-year low after Canada put counter-tariffs on US exports. The former PM Justin Trudeau warned that Canadians might have to \"forgo Florida orange juice\".\n\nThe Trump administration has also settled on a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil, which will feed into US supermarket prices.\n\nIn 2024, the UK eliminated tariffs on some imports produced from fruit grown outside Britain. But tariffs on certain sweeter, cheaper varieties and blends were not part of this.\n\nAnd while the tariff cuts might have helped, they were vastly outweighed by the increase in the underlying price.\n\nThen there are new regulations around packaging, further adding to the pressures.\n\nThe rules, known as Extended Producer Responsibility, are aimed at improving recycling rates, with a weight-based fee. All juice producers will be impacted, especially those still using glass bottles.\n\nIn August a Bank of England report said that high food price inflation is driven partly - and among other things - by these regulations.\n\nIn Brazil, the orange harvest has recovered somewhat - this is the greatest hope for a return to normal prices. Yet it coincides with sinking demand: global consumption of orange juice is now down 30% from a peak two decades ago.\n\nThough this may be partly down to the high prices, in certain parts of the world there has also been a shift in perception about the sugar content and health benefits or otherwise of fruit juice.\n\n\"When young children are not regularly given juice from an early age, they are less likely to be regular juice drinkers in later years,\" suggests Philip Coverdale at GlobalData.\n\nDemand is increasing in countries with growing middle classes, such as China, South Africa, and India. But elsewhere other more exotic fruit juices such as mango, pear and pomegranate are growing in popularity.\n\nUltimately, however, orange juice is a staple that supermarkets have long been used to selling at low prices. And the price spikes to £2 a carton could, with for example better weather, simply reverse.\n\n\"The volatility in the harvest appears to have reduced,\" says Giles Hurley, UK CEO of Aldi, \"Our buying team are doing everything they can to ensure that that saving is passed on to consumers.\"\n\nOthers in the supply chain are less convinced, given that much of the frozen concentrate was bought at last year's high prices. Plus, the stranglehold of the small number of giant producers who control the market remains.\n\nAs for the citrus greening, some major commercial producers, including Coca-Cola, which owns Minute Maid and Innocent, have contributed to a project to Save the Orange, using artificial intelligence to find a way to combat it.\n\nIt's a long-term project - and even if fruitful, it may be some time before the effect - if at all - filters through to grocery bills.\n\nBut the story of orange prices does also show how an upward price shock gets transmitted around the world far more quickly than a downward one.\n\nOranges are not the only food that has seen a price spike, of course. The price of beef and veal is up almost 25% in a year. Butter is up almost 19%, and chocolate and coffee 15% and milk over 12%, all according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis all suggests that, more generally, there may be something else at play. And that for all the food and drink spikes, the consumer was actually protected from the worst of it for a period - and now it is pay back time.\n\n\"It might be the retailers didn't full pass through the cost increase in the first place and therefore it's a way of recouping some of the margin they would otherwise have got,\" says Steve McCorriston, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Exeter.\n\nUltimately, though, trying to unpick the precise reason for why our food and drink costs what it does is very difficult - other factors that influence price can go undetected.\n\n\"What we don't know much about is how these supply chains tend to work in practice. It's difficult to uncover relationships between retailers and manufacturers or farmers and the use of contracts.\"\n\nThere is also a broader question that goes well beyond orange juice: do consumers in the UK need to simply accept the fact that as a densely populated small country with limited agriculture, a changing climate means the UK will be increasingly exposed to food price shocks?\n\nA 2024 government report on food security noted: \"The UK continues to be highly dependent on imports to meet consumer demand for fruit, vegetables and seafood...\n\n\"Many of the countries the UK imports these foods from are subject to their own climate-related challenges and sustainability risks.\"\n\nAnd so it could be that this is only the start of a wild ride on what we pay for our food and drink.\n\nTop image credits: Daniel Grizelj/ Tetra Images/ Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Four haircare myths get the chop\n\nWe all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands.\n\nIn an industry worth £5.8bn in the UK , there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics.\n\nThe truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right.\n\nTrichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair.\n\nEver shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair?\n\nWell luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair.\n\n\"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in.\n\nShe does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin.\n\nIf you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution.\n\nProudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it.\n\nWalker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair.\n\n\"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\"\n\nShe says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution.\n\nProudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue.\n\n\"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\"\n\nYou may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all.\n\nBut Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\"\n\nWalker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too.\n\nNot washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\".\n\nProudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.\n\nLaura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it.\n\nFinding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower.\n\nProudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes.\n\nThe problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out.\n\n\"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says.\n\n\"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\"\n\nUltimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.\n\nSign up here  to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17pqxzl0yzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"19:32:10.028+00:00","title":"ICJ says Israel must allow UN aid deliveries to Gaza to meet basic needs","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The International Court of Justice has issued an advisory opinion affirming that Israel, as an occupying power, has a legal obligation under international humanitarian law to allow unrestricted humanitarian aid—including food, water, medical supplies, and shelter—to reach the Palestinian population in Gaza.

meet basic needs\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has said Israel has a legal obligation to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip by the UN and its entities to ensure the basic needs of Palestinian civilians there are met.\n\nAn advisory opinion from the UN's top court  also said Israel had not substantiated its allegations that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) lacked neutrality or that a significant number of its staff were members of Hamas or other armed groups.\n\nThe UN's chief said he hoped Israel would abide by the \"very important decision\".\n\nBut Israel rejected the ICJ's opinion as \"political\" and insisted it would not co-operate with Unrwa, which it has banned.\n\nThe opinion is non-binding, but it carries significant moral and diplomatic weight.\n\nIn December, the UN General Assembly asked the ICJ for an opinion on Israel's obligations, as an occupying power and a member of the UN, towards UN agencies and other international organisations operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\n\nIt came after the Israeli parliament passed laws banning any activity by Unrwa on Israeli territory and contact with Israeli officials.\n\nThe ICJ was asked to also cover in its opinion Israel's duty to allow the unhindered delivery of essential supplies to Palestinian civilians.\n\nIsrael tightened its blockade on Gaza after the start of its war with Hamas two years ago and has since restricted - and at times completely stopped - the entry of food and other aid for the 2.1 million population.\n\nBefore this month's ceasefire deal took effect, UN-backed global experts had warned that more than 640,000 people were facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity and that there was an \"entirely man-made\" famine in Gaza City.\n\nIsrael rejected the famine declaration, insisting it was allowing in sufficient food.\n\nThe ICJ's President Yuji Iwasawa read out its advisory opinion at The Hague on Wednesday.\n\nHe said the panel of 11 international judges agreed that Israel, as an occupying power, was required to fulfil its obligations under international humanitarian law.\n\nThe first obligation was to \"ensure that the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory has the essential supplies of daily life, including food, water, clothing, bedding, shelter, fuel, medical supplies and services\", according to the judge.\n\nThe second was to \"agree to and facilitate by all means at its disposal relief schemes on behalf of the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory so long as that population is inadequately supplied, as has been the case in the Gaza Strip\".\n\nThe other obligations listed included respecting the prohibitions on forcible transfer from an occupied territory and on the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\n\nJudge Iwasawa said the panel were also of the opinion that Israel had \"an obligation to co-operate in good faith with the United Nations by providing every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, including [Unrwa]\".\n\nIsrael was also obliged to ensure \"full respect for the privileges and immunities accorded to the United Nations\" and its officials, as well as for the \"inviolability of the premises of the United Nations... and for the immunity of the property and assets of the organisation from any form of interference\", he added.\n\nWhen asked about the advisory opinion in Geneva, UN Secretary General António Guterres said: \"This is a very important decision. And I hope that Israel will abide by it.\"\n\nHe added that the advisory opinion came at a moment in which the UN was doing everything it could to boost aid deliveries to Gaza and deal with the \"tragic situation\" there.\n\nIsrael's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the advisory opinion, describing it as \"entirely predictable from the outset regarding Unrwa\".\n\n\"This is yet another political attempt to impose political measures against Israel under the guise of 'international law',\" it added.\n\nThe ministry also said Israel was fully upholding its obligations under international law and that it would \"not co-operate with an organisation that is infested with terror activities\".\n\nUnrwa - the largest humanitarian organisation in Gaza, with 12,000 Palestinian staff based there - has repeatedly denied Israel's allegation that it is deeply infiltrated by Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries.\n\nIsrael has said that Unrwa staff took part in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken to Gaza as hostages, and claimed that the agency still employs more than 1,400 \"Hamas operatives\".\n\nThe UN said last year that it had fired nine of Unrwa's staff in Gaza after investigators found evidence that they might have been involved in the 7 October attack. Another 10 staff were cleared because of insufficient evidence.\n\nJudge Iwasawa said the information the ICJ received was \"not sufficient to establish Unrwa's lack of neutrality\", and that Israel had \"not substantiated its allegations that a significant part of Unrwa employees 'are members of Hamas... or other terrorist factions'\".\n\nSince the Israeli laws banning Unrwa took effect in January, the agency says its Palestinian staff have continued providing assistance and education, health and other services to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\n\nHowever, the agency says Israel has banned it from bringing aid into Gaza and stopped issuing visas to Unrwa's international staff.\n\nUnrwa says at least 309 of its staff and 72 people supporting the agency's activities have been killed since the start of the war in Gaza. The territory's Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli attacks during the conflict have killed at least 68,229 people in total.\n\nUnrwa's acting Gaza director, Sam Rose, told the BBC that the agency welcomed the advisory opinion because it \"underscores the obligations of Israel under international law\".\n\n\"The ruling of today says that Israel's laws against Unrwa have gone against those obligations, as have its actions on the ground,\" he said.\n\nThe Palestinian foreign ministry said the advisory opinion made \"very clear that Israel must cease these illegal policies and that states have an obligation to bring Israel into compliance with its obligations in this regard\".\n\n\"Israel must immediately lift the unlawful ban on Unrwa and allow all other international organisations invited by Palestine to operate freely and safely,\" it added."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz3vv62pgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:22:17.097+00:00","title":"Mosquitoes found in Iceland for first time after record heat","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"For the first time, mosquitoes of the species Culiseta annulata have been found in Iceland, a country historically known as one of the world’s last mosquito-free zones due to its cold climate.

Iceland for first time after record heat\n\nMosquitoes have been found in Iceland for the first time after the country experienced record-breaking heat this spring.\n\nInsect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason encountered the mosquitoes over several nights last week while using wine-soaked ropes to observe moths, local media reported.\n\nMr Hjaltason found two female mosquitoes and one male which were later confirmed to be Culiseta annulata, one of few species that can successfully survive winter.\n\nIceland was one of only two mosquito-free havens in the world prior to the discovery, partly due to its cold climate. The only other recorded mosquito-free zone is Antarctica.\n\nThe mosquitoes were found in Kjós, a glacial valley to the South West of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik.\n\nMr Hjaltason shared the news of his discovery on a Facebook page for local wildlife alongside pictures of the insects, describing \"a strange fly on a red wine ribbon\", according to Icelandic media.\n\n\"I could tell right away that this was something I had never seen before\" he said in the post, which was screenshotted and shared by Iceland's Morgunblaðið news site, adding \"the last fortress seems to have fallen.\"\n\nMr Hjaltason sent the insects to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History to be identified, where entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson confirmed his suspicions.\n\nThe species are common across parts of Europe and North Africa but it it isn't clear how they reached Iceland, Alfreðsson told CNN.\n\nIceland's cold climate and lack of stagnant water in which the insects can breed are key contributors to the country's former lack of mosquitoes, the World Population Review said.\n\nBut this year, the country broke multiple records for its high temperatures.\n\nTypically, Iceland rarely experiences highs of more than 20C (68F) in May, and when it does those heatwaves will last for no more than two to three days, its Met Office notes.

2025-10-21T23:57:52.031+00:00\n\nTitle: Why Trump made breakthrough in Gaza but can’t with Putin over Ukraine\n\nReports of an impending US-Russia leadership summit have been greatly exaggerated, it seems.\n\nJust days after US President Donald Trump said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest - \"within two weeks or so\" - the summit has been suspended indefinitely.\n\nA preliminary get-together by the two nations' top diplomats has been cancelled, too.\n\n\"I don't want to have a wasted meeting,\" President Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. \"I don't want to have a waste of time, so I'll see what happens.\"\n\nThe on-again, off-again summit is just the latest twist in Trump's efforts to broker an end to war in Ukraine – a subject of renewed focus for the US president after he arranged a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.\n\nWhile making remarks in Egypt last week to celebrate that ceasefire agreement, Trump turned to Steve Witkoff, his lead diplomatic negotiator, with a new request.\n\n\"We have to get Russia done,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the circumstances that aligned to make a Gaza breakthrough possible for Witkoff and his team may be difficult to replicate in a Ukraine war that has been raging for nearing four years.\n\nAccording to Witkoff, the key to unlocking a deal was Israel's decision to attack Hamas negotiators in Qatar. It was a move that infuriated America's Arab allies but gave Trump leverage to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into making a deal.\n\nTrump benefited from a long record of siding with Israel dating back to his first term in office, including his decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, to change America's position on the legality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, more recently, his support for Israel's military campaign against Iran.\n\nThe US president, in fact, is more popular among Israelis than Netanyahu – a position that gave him unique influence over the Israeli leader.\n\nAdd in Trump's political and economic ties to key Arab players in the region, and he had a wealth of diplomatic muscle to force an agreement.\n\nIn the Ukraine war, by contrast, Trump has much less leverage. Over the past nine months, he has swung between attempts to strong-arm Putin and then Zelensky, all with little seeming effect.\n\nTrump has threatened to impose new sanctions on Russian energy exports and to provide Ukraine with new long-range weapons. But he has also recognised that doing so could disrupt the global economy and further escalate the war.\n\nMeanwhile, the president has publicly berated Zelensky, temporarily cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine and suspending arms shipments to the country - only to then back off in the face of concerned European allies who warn a Ukrainian collapse could destabilise the entire region.\n\nTrump loves to tout his ability to sit down and hammer out deals, but his face-to-face meetings with both Putin and Zelensky haven't seemed to move the war any closer to a resolution.\n\nPutin may actually be using Trump's desire for a deal – and belief in in-person deal-making - as a means of influencing him.\n\nIn July, Putin agreed to a summit in Alaska just as it appeared likely that Trump would sign off on congressional sanctions package backed by Senate Republicans. That legislation was subsequently put on hold.\n\nLast week, as reports spread that the White House was seriously contemplating shipping Tomahawk cruise missiles and Patriot anti-air batteries to Kyiv, the Russian leader called Trump who then touted the possible summit in Budapest.\n\nThe next day, Trump hosted Zelensky at the White House,  but left empty-handed after a reportedly tense meeting .\n\nTrump insisted that he was not being played by Putin.\n\n\"You know, I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,\" he said.\n\nBut the Ukrainian leader later made note of the sequence of events.\n\n\"As soon as the issue of long-range mobility became a little further away for us – for Ukraine – Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,\" he said.\n\nSo, in a matter of days, Trump has bounced from entertaining the prospect of sending missiles to Ukraine to planning a Budapest summit with Putin and privately pressuring Zelensky to cede all of Donbas – including territory Russia has been unable to conquer.\n\nHe has finally settled on calling for a ceasefire along current battle lines – something Russia has refused to accept.\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, Trump promised that he could end the Ukraine war in a matter of hours. He has since abandoned that pledge, saying that ending the war is proving harder than he expected.\n\nIt has been a rare acknowledgement of the limits of his power – and the difficulty of finding a framework for peace when neither side wants, or can afford to, give up the fight."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzy3z8lm4o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"18:36:41.999+00:00","title":"American missionary reportedly kidnapped in Niger","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An American missionary was kidnapped near the presidential palace in Niamey, Niger, on October 22, 2025, by unidentified gunmen.

decision to demolish part of the White House East Wing to build a ballroom, calling the construction \"music to my ears\", despite mounting criticism of the project.\n\nSpeaking to senators from his Republican Party at the White House on Tuesday, Trump also said: \"You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction in the back... When I hear that sound, it reminds me of money.\"\n\nTrump, a former property developer, is spending $250m (£186m) on a new, 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) ballroom to host parties, state visits and other events.\n\nBut since work began on Monday, a number of critics have spoken out - among them his one-time rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the leader of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Washington non-profit organisation that protects historic US sites, wrote a letter to White House officials saying she was \"deeply concerned\" by the project.\n\nThe letter said the size of the new construction would \"overwhelm the White House itself... and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings\".\n\nThe trust asked Trump to pause demolition work, arguing that the White House was a national historic landmark and that officials needed to hold a public review process of the plan for the ballroom.\n\nAnother group, the Society of Architectural Historians, also said it had \"great concerns\" about the project, similarly calling for a review process because of the size of the planned construction.\n\nThe White House has hit back at its critics, writing in a news release that \"unhinged leftists\" were \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House - a bold, necessary addition\".\n\nTrump officials have also insisted that the renovation will not cost US taxpayers any money, and that there is nothing inappropriate about soliciting private donations to help pay for it, as Trump has been doing.\n\nMany Democrats have also lambasted the renovation, including Clinton, who ran against Trump for the US presidency in 2016.\n\nAddressing her followers on X, she wrote that the White House was not Trump's house. \"It's your house. And he's destroying it.\"\n\nSince it was built in the late 1700s, the White House has undergone a number of renovations and restorations. In 1948, then-President Harry Truman gutted the inside of the White House as it was at risk of collapsing, adding a balcony to the exterior.\n\nOver the years, presidents have added swimming pools, bowling alleys and other touches - though critics have highlighted that Trump's additions appear to be the biggest alterations to the White House exterior in decades.\n\nWhite House officials have said the project does not require sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, an agency that oversees construction and renovations to government buildings in Washington and is chaired by a Trump aid.\n\nBut a former chair of the commission, L Preston Bryant Jr, told the Associated Press that previous administrations have worked closely with the agency on big construction projects, starting with an \"early consultation\" before the renovation began."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2w3d2jjw0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"02:45:30.297+00:00","title":"Author Philip Pullman calls on government to act over 'wicked' AI scraping","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sir Philip Pullman, author of the acclaimed Lyra Silvertongue series and the Book of Dust trilogy, has urged the UK government to reform copyright laws to stop AI companies from scraping writers' books without compensation.

government to change copyright laws on \"scraping\", where writers' books are used to train artificial intelligence (AI) software to understand and generate human language.\n\nWriters whose work has been scraped don't get compensation or recognition, something authors including  Kate Mosse and Richard Osman have criticised , saying it could destroy growth in creative fields and amount to \"theft\".\n\nSir Philip, author of the hugely popular novels about Lyra Silvertongue, the heroine of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust trilogies, thinks writers should be compensated.\n\n\"They can do what they like with my work if they pay me for it,\" he told the BBC's culture editor Katie Razzall. \"But stealing people's work... and then passing it off as something else... That's immoral but unfortunately not illegal.\"\n\nLast December  a consultation on the UK's legal framework for copyright around the AI sector  and creative industries was launched, attracting 11,500 responses.\n\nThe government has set up expert working groups on AI and copyright. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has been contacted for a response to Sir Philip's comments.\n\nSir Philip said: \"As far as I know everybody's work has been stolen, scraped like a trawler... at the bottom of the sea. Prawns, oysters, starfishes, mermaids, whatever. You name it, it's all killed.\n\n\"It's a wicked system and I'm profoundly against it.\"\n\nSir Philip says he wants the government to act now, change the law and fight back.\n\n\"Of course they should change it at once,\" he said. \"Don't you steal anybody else's work.\"\n\nSir Philip's latest novel, The Rose Field, completes the second trilogy about Lyra. The first five books have so far sold 49 million copies globally.\n\nLyra lives in a universe parallel to our own, where people have a daemon - a companion spirit in animal form.\n\nEarly on she uncovers a conspiracy using kidnapped children, and uses a truth-telling device called an alethiometer.\n\n\"She's always curious and inquisitive,\" he says. \"I think it's a very important quality. We should praise people who are curious. We should encourage it in children.\"\n\nThe books see her grow from an 11-year-old girl into a woman in her early 20s, with her world ruled by the Magisterium, a shadowy religious and political organisation.\n\nIn The Rose Field, the Magisterium is waging war on imagination, which it calls a false, seductive and dangerous doctrine.\n\nFormer English teacher Sir Philip, 78, goes on to describe what he sees as real-life enemies of imagination.\n\nHe highlights \"the education policy of the government, which insists on learning things off by heart, sitting in rows and walking silently down corridors\", along with learning about the grammar of language \"before you can use it\", calling this \"nonsense\".\n\nThe writer, who is clearly a fan of using the imagination, as evidenced in his writing, calls it \"a form of perception\".\n\nHe explains that his final book in the trilogy is about the the realm of the \"Rose Field, in which things exist that you can only see with your imagination\".\n\n\"They're there but you can't see them if you don't imagine them, for example, ghosts, wishes, hopes, memories...\n\n\"Things you can't necessarily weigh, measure or analyse chemically, but which are there nonetheless, such as love, fear, hope. That's what Lyra has discovered in the course of this book.\"\n\nHe's also an outspoken critic of organised religion.\n\n\"The arguments I have are with people in power who use religion to make other people do things... religion gives them a sense of extra certainty when they do that because they believe that they're fulfilling the will of God,\" he says.\n\nDespite writing about other worlds, realms and creatures, he insists he is not a fantasy writer, unlike JRR Tolkien, the author of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books.\n\n\"I don't think there's any comparison at all between me and Tolkien. He was a writer of fantasy, and I'm not writer of fantasy.\"\n\nDespite his books containing magical objects, talking animals and mythical griffins, he insists he is \"writing about the real world through a little filter\".\n\nHe adds that after saying farewell to Lyra and all the other characters in his books, he will \"miss them a little bit\".\n\nBut for his millions of fans, there is a glimmer of hope.\n\nThis might not be the end of Lyra's story.\n\n\"I can't say that,\" he says. \"It might happen.\"\n\nHe is now writing a memoir about his \"unusual childhood\" and a picture of the world he grew up in.\n\nHis final thought is about the daemons in his books, and he muses over what animal form his own might take.\n\n\"I think she'd be a corvid,\" he says. \"I love ravens. They're not very well loved. I don't care.\n\n\"Their flying is extraordinary, their aerobatics turning upside down and zooming so close to the ground.\n\n\"They're wonderful birds to watch, they're very clever.\n\n\"And In some mythologies, the raven is the storyteller.\"\n\nThe Rose Field: The Book of Dust Volume Three will be published on 23 October, including the audiobook, which is read by actor Michael Sheen."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjpe0193geo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"16:42:38.939+00:00","title":"Ukrainian children killed in Russian strikes, hours after Trump-Putin talks shelved","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a wave of intense Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, including a deadly strike on a kindergarten in Kharkiv and residential areas in Kyiv, at least seven people were killed and dozens injured.

least seven people have been killed including two children during intense Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, officials say.\n\nA kindergarten was hit in Ukraine's second biggest city Kharkiv and there was widespread damage in Kyiv. Children were among the 27 people wounded.\n\nHours earlier, US President Donald Trump said his plans for an imminent summit in Budapest with Russia's Vladimir Putin had been shelved as he did not want a \"wasted meeting\".\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks proved Moscow had not come under enough pressure for its continued war.\n\nThe Kremlin has rejected calls for a ceasefire along the current front lines made both by Trump and European leaders.\n\nHowever, Russian officials said on Wednesday that preparation for a Trump-Putin summit was continuing, disputing the US president's assessment that it had been put on hold.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a date had yet to be agreed upon and careful preparation was needed.\n\nHe said a summit was \"the mutual desire of both presidents\" and most of the \"gossip and rumours\" surrounding it were untrue.\n\nRead more:   Ukraine hits Russian chemical plant with UK-made missiles\n\nUkraine's president arrived in Norway on Wednesday at the start of a European trip, days after talks with Trump in Washington last Friday,  when he failed to persuade the US president to provide long-range Tomahawk missiles .\n\nZelensky told reporters in Oslo that Trump's proposal to freeze the front line was a \"good compromise, but I'm not sure that Putin will support it and I said it to the president\".\n\nThe Ukrainian leader has directly linked the shelving of the planned Trump-Putin summit to his request for US Tomahawks: \"As soon as the issue of long-range missiles became a little further away for us, for Ukraine, then almost automatically Russia became less interested in diplomacy.\"\n\nFollowing a meeting on Wednesday, Zelensky and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson signed a letter of intent that could see Sweden supply 100 to 150 domestically produced Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\nThe jets are expected to be delivered over a 10-15 year timeline, with the first sent to Ukraine \"within three years\", Kristersson added.\n\nRussia's drone and missile bombardment came shortly after Ukraine's military said it had attacked a Russian chemical plant in the Bryansk border region late on Tuesday with UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles.\n\nCalling the strike \"a successful hit\" that penetrated the Russian air defence system, military officials said the Bryansk plant \"produces gunpowder, explosives and rocket fuel components used in ammunition and missiles employed by the enemy to shell the territory of Ukraine\".\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and its attacks on the Ukrainian capital overnight were the first such strikes for almost two weeks.\n\nA couple in their 60s were killed when a drone hit their high-rise building in the city, and four people were killed in the wider Kyiv region.\n\nAmong the victims were a 36-year-old woman, a six-month-old baby and a girl, aged 12, when a Russian strike set fire to their house in the village of Pohreby, just to the north of the capital. A man in a nearby village later died of his injuries.\n\nMykola Laroshynskyi lives next door to the house that was hit and said he saw the drone come \"like a bird and that was it\".\n\n\"A split second later there was an explosion, \" he told the BBC.\n\n\"I saw flames rising and immediately ran there. I shouted to see if there was anyone alive and no one responded. The house was already on fire.\"\n\nAnother neighbour, Vasyl Radchenko, said the \"explosion was so powerful\" that his wife \"needed psychological support\".\n\nOfficials in Kharkiv said later that a 40-year-old man was killed and seven other people were hurt in a drone strike on a kindergarten. Children were among the six people wounded, and dozens more were evacuated, they added.\n\nUkraine's air force said Russia had sent 405 drones and 28 missiles, 15 of which were ballistic.\n\nThe capital was under a ballistic missile warning for most of the night, and echoed to the sound of explosions. By morning rescue teams fought fires in residential buildings.\n\nAcross Ukraine, Russian attacks once again targeted energy infrastructure and emergency power outages were imposed in several areas.\n\nOne MP in Kyiv, Inna Sovsun, told the BBC's Newsday programme that the air raids had lasted throughout the night and were definitely an attack on the power supply: \"for the majority like myself it means we don't have electricity and we don't have water.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmxj102039o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"15:16:58.190+00:00","title":"Chess federation investigating Kramnik's campaign against Naroditsky","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"FIDE is investigating public accusations by former world champion Vladimir Kramnik that US grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky cheated online, following Naroditsky's unexpected death at age 29.

economically damaging cyber event in UK history, according to researchers.\n\nExperts at the Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC) have analysed the continuing fallout from the hack, which halted the car giant's production on 1 September for five weeks and caused widespread delays across JLR's supply chain.\n\nAccording to the CMC, 5,000 businesses have been affected in total and a full recovery will not be reached until January 2026.\n\nJLR declined to comment on the research but said it is bringing portions of manufacturing back online in a phased approach.\n\nThe CMC is an independent, non-profit organisation that analyses and categorises cyber events, which impact the UK financially.\n\nIt has classified the JLR incident as a  Category 3 event , which is significant. Category 5 is the most severe.\n\nCiaran Martin, chair of the CMC's technical committee said: \"With a cost of nearly £2bn, this incident looks to have been by some distance, the single most financially damaging cyber event ever to hit the UK.\n\n\"That should make us all pause and think. Every organisation needs to identify the networks that matter to them, and how to protect them better, and then plan for how they'd cope if the network gets disrupted.\"\n\nThis is the second report published by the CMC, which uses publicly available information, surveys and interviews with industry experts and victims to make its assessments.\n\nAlthough the National Cyber Security Centre also  categorises cyber attacks  depending on how severe they are, it does not publish its findings.\n\nThe hack began in late August causing an IT shutdown and a halt in global manufacturing operations, including its major UK plants at Solihull, Halewood, and Wolverhampton.\n\nDealer systems were intermittently unavailable, and suppliers faced cancelled or delayed orders, with uncertainty about future supply.\n\nThe CMC estimated the damage to be in the range of £1.6bn and £2.1bn but predicted the most likely cost will be £1.9bn.\n\nMore than half of the cost will be shouldered by JLR itself including loss of earnings and the cost of recovery.\n\nThe rest is estimated to be incurred by the 5,000 firms in JLR's supply chain, as well as the local economy including hospitality and other services.\n\nBut CMC researchers admit their estimates are based on assumptions about the hack as JLR has not said publicly what type of cyber attack it's dealing with.\n\nA data theft and extortion attack is far easier to recover from, for example, than a ransomware attack which scrambles a victim's computer network.\n\nA wiper attack that infects computer networks and destroys data with no hope of reversal is even more serious.\n\nShortly after the hack was revealed on JLR, a group of hackers thought to be young, English-speaking and linked to previous high profile hacks  claimed to be behind it . But this has not been confirmed.\n\nThe CMC also says it has not factored in any potential ransom payment that JLR might have paid to hackers which could be in the tens of millions.\n\nPreviously the CMC categorised the wave of retail hacks against M&S, the Co-op and Harrods in the spring as a Category 2 event.\n\nIt estimated those cyber attacks would cost between £270m and £440m, which was lower than the £506m cited by M&S and the Co-op.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

speaking to women who are taking testosterone — specifically, in very high doses — and you start to notice that they sound messianic. They’re often talking fast and intensely; they’re amped up; they’re describing what they clearly consider a miracle drug; and they have no intention of lowering their dose, despite the unknown risks or some problems with facial hair. After all, how can they worry about facial hair when they feel so alive? It’s nothing they can’t take care of with a quick waxing, which they now have the energy to do at the end of the day — right after they prepare a high-protein dinner for their family and before they put the finishing touches on their spreadsheets, close their laptops and light a few mood candles for the sex that they know will be great, maybe even better than the sex they had last night, even though they’re a day older.\n\n“It’s changed my marriage,” Jessica Medina, a 41-year-old marketing consultant in Orange County, Calif., told me. With four kids in the house, and sex happening six times a week (up from “How about never?” pre-testosterone), she had to put a lock on the bedroom door. She and her husband had attended a “marriage growth” group at church for years, but it took testosterone for their relationship to be, as she put it, “100 times closer.” She was a little less emotional, a little less sentimental than she used to be, but she didn’t have time for that kind of thing, anyway. “It’s more like: Get stuff done, handle business, work out,” she said. “In order to do all that and still have time for our kids and their sports, there’s no time to whine about how hard it is.”\n\nCatherine Lin, a single mother who ran a bicoastal fashion media company, went on testosterone in her early 40s to raise her energy. She got the boost she wanted, started lifting heavier weights, decided to pursue a degree in holistic nutrition and enjoyed an unexpected side effect: She started having orgasms for the first time in years.\n\nBoth Medina and Lin are taking an amount of testosterone that’s brought their levels higher than what women produce naturally at any point in their lifetimes. The way they and many women on these high doses talk about their relationships sometimes has the ring of romantasy: fantastic tales of sexual rejuvenation and newfound intimacy. One woman in her 50s told me that after years of revulsion at so much as the thought of her husband’s breath, she now looked forward to having sex with him almost every night; even in the middle of sex, she said, she was thinking about the next time they could have sex. Another woman told me she’d had more orgasms in the past two years on testosterone than in the entirety of her previous life; a third said that after years of “wanting to rip someone’s face off” if her husband so much as touched her, she now actively pursued sex with him — if anything, she now worried, she wanted it more often than he did.\n\nJust as estrogen is a crucial hormone for men, testosterone is an important hormone for women, instrumental in the development of bones, muscles and sexual function. Testosterone peaks in women in their late teens and early 20s, then declines over time, so that by age 60, their levels have fallen by about half. (Men start out in young adulthood with 10 times the testosterone of women, and their levels diminish much less steeply over time.) With less available testosterone, women may have fewer erotic thoughts and less motivation to pursue sexual pleasure; some of the mechanisms that make sex feel good can falter, such as the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes the muscles around the clitoris and allows for greater blood flow.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The study by King's College London and the University of Oxford is the first to produce a ranking so the effects of medicines can be easily compared.\n\nThe team analysed 151 studies of 30 drugs commonly used in depression, involving more than 58,500 patients.\n\nNot everybody develops side effects but, on average, the results  published in the Lancet medical journal  showed:\n\n\"Clearly no two antidepressants are built the same,\" said Dr Atheeshaan Arumuham, from King's College London.\n\nThose differences can stack up in ways that become clinically important, including an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.\n\nIt means even people with the same diagnosis could be better suited to different antidepressants depending on their own preferences and other health conditions.\n\nDr Toby Pillinger told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The majority of the studies we looked at were relatively short. We're looking at eight weeks' duration and still within that duration we were seeing large changes in physical health parameters which we would argue have clinical relevance.\n\n\"The last thing I want is for this story to be scaring people,\" he added.\n\n\"I want to see this as empowering individuals to take the initiative and to engage  in shared decision-making with their practitioner.\"\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, Sarah, 32, John, 44, and Jane, 56, have all received the same depression diagnosis and have been recommended antidepressants.\n\nBut they each want to avoid different side effects.\n\nFor Sarah, the priority is avoiding weight gain, while John already has high blood pressure and Jane has raised cholesterol.\n\nDr Pillinger, who worked through the examples for the BBC, says each would be recommended a different medicine.\n\nDr Toby Pillinger says:  Sarah should have an antidepressant that avoids weight gain, such as agomelatine, sertraline or venlafaxine rather than amitriptyline or mirtazapine which are more likely to increase weight.\n\nDr Toby Pillinger says:  John should avoid drugs such as venlafaxine, amitriptyline or nortriptyline which raise blood pressure, and would be better suited to citalopram, escitalopram and paroxetine.\n\nDr Toby Pillinger says:  For Jane, some antidepressants are linked to higher cholesterol, including venlafaxine, duloxetine and paroxetine, so she might steer clear of those. Citalopram or escitalopram are more neutral on cholesterol and could suit her better.\n\nIt is too simplistic to say there are good and bad antidepressants, the researchers say. Even though amitriptyline increases weight, heart rate and blood pressure it also helps with pain and struggling to sleep.\n\nOverall, the most prescribed class of antidepressants - SSRIs such as paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline - tended to have fewer physical side effects.\n\nFluoxetine - an SSRI that is also called Prozac - was linked to a drop in weight and higher blood pressure, in the study.\n\nProf Andrea Cipriani from the University of Oxford said it was \"impossible\" to say how many of the millions of people being prescribed antidepressants should be on a different drug.\n\nHowever, he said there had been a push for \"generic, cheap medications\" that meant 85% of antidepressant prescriptions in the UK were for just three drugs: the SSRIs citalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine.\n\nHe said implementing the findings of this report would see \"the 85% reduce dramatically\" with \"more people accessing better treatments\".\n\nThe researchers are developing  a free online tool  to help doctors and patients choose the right drug.\n\nHowever, that would still require a significant change in culture within the NHS.\n\nThe study also only analysed what happened eight weeks after starting treatment. Dr Pillinger said \"complimentary data\" meant they expected the short-term changes \"will persist\" but this still needs to be properly tested.\n\nDr Prasad Nishtala, from the University of Bath which was not involved in the study, said the findings were \"novel and valuable\".\n\nHe said: \"In a real-world setting, where patients often receive antidepressants for months or years, the cumulative risks are likely to be higher, particularly among those with chronic depression.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrj1znp0pyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"17:12:07.035+00:00","title":"Why has the US government shut down and what does it mean?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US government has been in a prolonged shutdown for over three weeks, stemming from a legislative deadlock between Republican and Democratic lawmakers over a budget.

Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress no closer to ending their standoff over a budget.\n\nIt means that many, but not all, US government services are   temporarily suspended, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay.\n\nAlthough budget confrontations are common in US politics, this spending fight is especially tense because President Donald Trump began drastically reducing the size of the national government as soon as he returned office, and has said he wants to use the current impasse to make further cuts.\n\nThe Trump administration has already moved to lay off about 4,000 workers as the shutdown continues, though that was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. The White House is appealing against the ruling.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats could not agree to pass a bill funding government services past 1 October, when the federal budget expired.\n\nUnder the US system, Congress must agree on a spending plan to send to the President to sign into law.\n\nThe Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress. But in the Senate - or upper chamber - they are short of the 60 votes needed to pass the spending bill, which gives opposition Democrats some negotiating power.\n\nDemocrats want the bill to include an extension of expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans and a reversal of Trump's cuts to Medicaid, a government healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income people.\n\nDemocrats also oppose spending cuts to government health agencies.\n\nA stopgap bill designed to avoid the shutdown was passed in the House, or lower chamber, but did not clear the Senate.\n\nAnd so, at 00:01 EDT on 1 October (04:01 GMT), the US government   had its first shutdown for nearly seven years.\n\nReopening the government depends on whether the two parties in the Senate can find a compromise that Trump will sign.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, has said both sides are \"dug in\" and over the past three weeks votes to reopen the government have failed 11 times in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans say they want to negotiate the health insurance subsidies separately and only pass what they call a \"clean resolution\".  The Trump administration has been unwilling to offer substantive concessions and believes the Democrats will bear the brunt of the public's blame.\n\nOn the other side, Democrats believe their efforts to secure cheaper healthcare are popular and they are not backing down even to fund the government temporarily. There is pressure on congressional leaders to hold firm from the party's left wing, which believes they folded too quickly during the budget dispute last March, and to use one of the few political levers they have.\n\nNot all aspects of government   stop during a shutdown. Services   deemed essential continue as normal, but most staff are not paid until the government reopens.\n\nBorder protection and law enforcement staff, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and in-hospital medical care workers are expected to operate as usual. However  thousands of flights have been cancelled or delayed  because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are also expected to work without pay.\n\nThousands of government employees deemed non-essential have been furloughed - temporarily put on unpaid leave. That has affected ongoing research projects at agencies lke the National Insitutes of Health.  Contractors who are not directly employed by the government are missing out on work, too.\n\nUS troops were on track to miss their first paycheck last week until the Trump administration identified funds to pay them. House Speaker Mike Johnson has warned this is a \"temporary fix\" and troops could miss future paychecks.\n\nMoney for Snap (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), commonly known as \"food stamps\", has run out. The states, which run Snap, are warning that the 41 million people enrolled in the program will stop receiving aid starting 1 November, unless the shutdown ends or Congress intervenes.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare cheques are still being distributed, although benefit verification and card issuance work may stop.\n\nServices like federally-funded pre-school and institutions like the Smithsonian museums have been reduced or closed.\n\nSome major national parks and monuments across the country have closed, including Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay Area and the interior of the Washington Monument.\n\nDuring the previous shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019, parks were kept open with no staff, which led to vandalism and looting at a number of historical sites.\n\nMail is still being delivered and post offices are open because the US Postal Service does not depend on Congress for funding.\n\nMost American schools are state-funded, but the federal government is responsible for billions of dollars in grants and student loans, which could effectively come to a halt.\n\nHowever, because the grants are typically awarded during the summer, schools are expected to be largely unaffected during this shutdown, according to the education secretary.\n\nMembers of Congress are still being paid, a convention that has been criticised by some politicians.\n\nIn the past, lengthy government shutdowns were seen as politically dangerous to lawmakers and the current occupant of the White House, as they disrupted voters' everyday lives.\n\nHowever this time, the White House appears more than happy to shutter large parts of the US government for an extended period. And Trump has threatened to break with the past practice of returning government operations to normal, bringing spending back to previous levels, and paying workers retroactively for the shutdown.\n\nSince January, his administration has already slashed government spending and sacked many federal workers, testing the boundaries of presidential power. Now he is seeking to permanently fire \"non-essential\" workers during the shutdown.\n\n\"We'll be laying off a lot of people,\"  Trump said on 30 September , the day before the shutdown began.\n\nThe administration has also warned that furloughed \"non-essential\" workers  may not receive their unpaid salary after the shutdown finishes .\n\nOn 7 October, Trump told reporters that back pay \"depends on who we're talking about\" and that some workers \"don't deserve to be taken care of\".\n\nMany lawmakers insist this is wrong, including the top Democrat in the US House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, who said: \"The law is clear - every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay, period.\"\n\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically limited and temporary - similar to the disruption caused by a hurricane or major storm.\n\nBut it still represents a drag. Approvals for loans and permits are delayed, as are reviews of potential stock listings.\n\nBy one estimate, $800m in new federal contracts are not being awarded each day. Unlike government employees, contractors do not receive back pay once the shutdown ends, and many of the companies are small businessses without other big clients to carry them through.\n\nOverall, analysts estimate this shutdown will knock roughly 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off economic growth for each week that it continues - about $15bn (£11.2bn) a week.\n\nBut those losses threaten to become more substantial - and harder to make up - the longer the shutdown lasts.  The key holiday months of November and December are fast approaching and analysts are worried a shutdown will hurt shopping and spending.\n\nThere are also new possible economic factors in this shutdown, as Trump moves to fire workers or deny them backpay and cancels federally funded projects - all of which could extend or deepen any hit to the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspension of key releases of economic data, like the monthly jobs report, has added to uncertainty. Without basic information about how the country is faring, policymakers could are at risk of committing grave errors.\n\nShutdowns over budgets are a unique aspect of US politics.\n\nThey have become quite common over the past 50 years - with three taking place during Trump's first presidential term.\n\nThe last shutdown, which began in late December 2018, lasted 35 days - the longest in history.\n\nIt was brought about by disagreements over funding a wall on the Mexico border.\n\nIt finally ended in part because large numbers of air traffic controllers, who had been working for a month without pay, began calling in sick, as has started to happen during the current shutdown.\n\nAt the time, flight disruption quickly spread, and the shutdown came to an end shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  estimated that the 2018-2019 shutdown reduced economic output  by about $11bn, including $3bn that it never regained.\n\nBut shutdowns pre-date Trump.\n\nThe second longest to date was 21 days, under Democrat President Bill Clinton in 1995. His fellow Democrat Barack Obama had a 16-day shutdown during his time in the White House, and Republican Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his presidency in the 1980s - though all were relatively brief.\n\nDo you have questions about the US government shutdown?

Superintelligence Labs\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T10:31:58-04:00\n\nMeta on Wednesday said that it plans to cut approximately 600 jobs in its artificial intelligence division, according to a memo sent to employees that was relayed to The New York Times, as the company seeks to keep pace with competitors in the furious contest over the technology.\n\nThe layoffs will be in Meta’s so-called Superintelligence Labs, which is the umbrella name for the company’s A.I. efforts. The division has a few thousand employees, though the exact number of workers was unclear.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, has been on a hiring spree to stack his company with top A.I. researchers, including a new chief A.I. officer, Alexandr Wang, earlier this year. The cuts on Wednesday do not affect these newest hires, who have been empowered to develop “superintelligence,” or artificial intelligence that exceeds the human brain.\n\nInstead, the job cuts are aimed at cleaning up the organizational bloat that resulted from three years of building up Meta’s A.I. efforts too quickly, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The layoffs aim to help Meta develop A.I. products more quickly, they said.\n\n“By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Mr. Wang wrote in the memo circulated to employees.\n\nThe cuts, which were earlier reported by Axios, come at an intensely competitive time for Meta, which has spent the past three years dealing with the rapid onset of A.I. After ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, OpenAI, Google and Microsoft began hiring furiously to build the next generation of A.I. chatbots and other products.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, struggled to keep up with the pack. After early success developing its open-source A.I. model, called Llama, its progress stagnated. The company went on a fresh hiring spree and made strategic errors, leading to product development issues over the past 18 months.\n\nAfter a rocky first half of this year, Mr. Zuckerberg moved to restart the A.I. efforts. In June, he invested $14.3 billion in ScaleAI, an artificial intelligence start-up that was co-founded by Mr. Wang. Mr. Zuckerberg then brought ScaleAI’s top talent to Meta’s Superintelligence Labs, including Mr. Wang.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg has since also spent billions recruiting top researchers from other A.I. labs and companies, including OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. Meta has dangled pay packages to some that number well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nIn August, Mr. Zuckerberg split Meta Superintelligence into four groups. One is called FAIR, which is focused on A.I. research; a second is working on superintelligence; another on products; and a fourth on infrastructure, such as data centers and other A.I. hardware.\n\nThe planned cuts will affect employees at FAIR, the product division and infrastructure group, according to Mr. Wang’s memo. Employees who are laid off were set to receive emails by 10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, and the company plans to try to find other positions internally for those affected.\n\nNo cuts will be made to TBD, the team building superintelligence and managing Meta’s large language models, which drive chatbots and other A.I. products, the people with knowledge of the situation said. The company is still hiring A.I. researchers in the TBD unit, which is managed by Mr. Wang, the people said.\n\nMeta executives have emphasized that the cuts do not mean they are retrenching on A.I. efforts, and that superintelligence remains among Mr. Zuckerberg’s top priorities for the company.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/value-of-higher-education-attainment-rates-graduation.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:11-04:00","title":"Colleges Face a Reckoning: Is a Degree Really Necessary?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores a growing national debate over whether college is still necessary in the modern economy, using Wyoming as a case study.

apart offered starkly different paths.\n\nA nonprofit group’s billboard promoted a way to earn money for college. The other, from Walmart, dangled pay exceeding $30 an hour.\n\nThe dueling choices underscored a fundamental tension for the nation’s teenagers and adults alike, one that has become vivid in the Trump era: Is college something all Americans need?\n\nFor decades, it was close to an article of faith among education leaders, scholars and politicians, regardless of political ideology, that most people should go to college. But in many places, most jobs do not require college degrees, and doubts over the value of higher education have metastasized as student debt has soared and the ranks of dropouts have grown.\n\nCollege has become a sharp dividing line in American life, and the disconnect between higher education’s promises and its sometimes-frustrating reality has helped fuel a conservative movement to upend academia. Over the last decade, though, nearly every state tried to get more people to earn a certificate or a degree after high school.\n\nWyoming, which has just one public university, was among the states that bought into the campaign to push more of its residents toward higher education. Like most others, it made headway, but far less than it had hoped. And an uncomfortable question still lurks after seven years of trying to entice more students, even for people like Joe Schaffer, the Laramie County Community College president who both championed the state’s ambition and warned of the siren song of Walmart’s wages.\n\n“How do we make education much more relevant to the student?”\n\nSeven years ago, Dr. Schaffer’s campus was where Wyoming’s governor came to sign an executive order to try to marshal the state toward completing more higher education.\n\nThe share of college graduates who are considered “long-term” unemployed has risen recently. But as Wyoming began its quest, researchers were projecting that most of the country’s workers would soon need more than a high school diploma. And while Wyoming had among the highest shares of people who had finished high school, less than half of the state’s working adults had any meaningful education beyond that.\n\nThat had worked just fine in a place where not even 40 percent of jobs demanded education after high school. But the economy hinged on the boom-or-bust cycles of energy, and young people were fleeing the nation’s least-populated state for metropolises like Denver and Salt Lake City.\n\nState leaders, hoping to attract industries that required more educated workers, envisioned an unusually unified approach that would encourage high school students to get degrees and also target adults. Officials calculated that if a quarter of the state’s working adults earned a post-high school credential for the first time, the rate of Wyomingites with one would rocket past 60 percent, from about 46 percent.\n\nSchools and policies would also need to change to cater to students who didn’t fit the traditional mold.\n\n“One of the biggest problems we have in education is inflexibility,” said Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican who took office about a year after Wyoming started its push. “We tend to know what we know, by God, and we just need to do it harder and stronger.”\n\nThe American right had been elevating voices that accused higher education of being hubs of liberal ideology and unnecessary for personal success.\n\nBut the governor argued that education could still be valuable — if it were more responsive and didn’t bog down students with high costs and a maze of requirements.\n\nIt is a theory with wide traction. In 2009, a philanthropic group, the Lumina Foundation, announced a goal for 60 percent of Americans to obtain some credential past high school by 2025, up from 38 percent. The foundation’s philosophy and largess helped fuel a stampede of state campaigns.\n\nWyoming set a goal of 67 percent by 2025, among the nation’s highest targets.\n\nLumina’s efforts started when Americans appeared optimistic about higher education. Between 1998 and 2008, enrollment increased by more than 30 percent.\n\nBut more than a third of students seeking a bachelor’s degree still were not finishing within six years. Community college completion rates were far worse. When Dr. Schaffer arrived in Cheyenne in 2012, for example, his school’s graduation rate was 14 percent.\n\nAs the number of people who dropped out of college surged over time to more than 40 million, doubts about higher education were also swelling. Recent polling by Gallup found that the share of people who view college as “not too important” has increased sixfold since 2010, to 24 percent.\n\n“What you hear in universities, all the time, for years, is, ‘We just have to tell our story better,’” Ed Seidel, the University of Wyoming’s president, said. “But I think we really have to look ourselves in the mirror and say, ‘We need a better story.’”\n\nStill, officials nationwide plowed ahead. They sometimes confronted stubborn skepticism. It often had little to do with the debates over diversity programs, “woke” policies and academic freedom that dominate the current political battle over higher education.\n\nInstead, many found that students who had dropped out had no interest in returning. Some feared costs. Some fretted over failing again. Many simply found themselves content in jobs that did not require additional education.\n\nJamie Merisotis, Lumina’s president and chief executive, said states still made notable progress. Roughly 55 percent of adults in the United States now hold an educational credential beyond a high school diploma.\n\nBut for most states, the moonshot goals remained elusive.\n\nDaryl Woody finished eight years in the Air Force and six more as a housing maintenance contractor at the base in the Cheyenne area. But married with four children, Mr. Woody worried about being economically left behind.\n\nHe went to Laramie County Community College, figuring he could learn how to become a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning technician. After all, “I’ve been turning wrenches for so long that it comes natural,” he said not long after this semester started.\n\nThen an academic adviser spoke with Mr. Woody about his interests and steered him toward the college’s cybersecurity programs instead. The school helped him chart his courses, talked through temptations of jobs in the oil fields or warehouses and mapped his potential long-term earnings.\n\n“The advice that I’ve been getting from all of the instructors has always been, ‘Do not let the good job take you from your education,’” he said. Without the guidance, he said, “I would have jumped on top of any number of those opportunities.”\n\nHe is on track to finish an associate degree next spring.\n\nHigher education leaders and policymakers point to modest progress — Wyoming’s percentage of people with some credential past high school now stands at 53 percent — and lessons learned. Financial aid matters enormously. So do factors like the ability to transfer credits from one school to another and job-friendly scheduling to accommodate working adults.\n\nAmanda Sorrell, a 30-year-old single mother who is studying business and accounting at the community college in Cheyenne, is part of a new scholarship program the state began for people at least 24 years old.\n\n“That scholarship is really what’s helping me stay afloat,” said Ms. Sorrell, who takes online courses while juggling a market research job.\n\nEncouraged by her advisers, she ultimately plans to pursue a bachelor’s degree. Laramie County’s graduation rate has risen more than 20 percentage points since Dr. Schaffer arrived.\n\nBut Wyoming, like other states that fell short of their goals, has also been working in recent years to tailor academic programs to society’s demands, reasoning that some students stay away because too little of the curriculum is relevant to their ambitions or interests.\n\nWestern Wyoming Community College started a substation technician program, the state’s first. Within the last decade, the University of Wyoming developed a major tied to tourism, one of the state’s biggest industries, along with a program in ranch management and agricultural leadership. Dr. Seidel, the university president, said schools should still make room for the liberal arts, but that higher education should have “a hard think” about what it offers.\n\nDuring a politically volatile moment, and as colleges look for any students they can find, schools may have little choice.\n\nIn a recent speech, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, laid out talking points for the Trump administration’s ongoing attack on the nation’s universities.\n\n“Attending these schools, for many students, feels like a burden. Or a waste. An obsolete and expensive credential,” she said, adding, “Don’t they realize? The alternatives to college are warming up in the dugout ready to replace the four-year diploma. This is not a time for dithering.”\n\nDr. Schaffer, of Laramie County Community College, acknowledges the nation’s higher education model needs to be reset, as difficult as it may be. The answer, he thinks, might in fact be less, or at least more targeted, higher education.\n\n“I don’t know that we’re going to find that next silver bullet,” he said. “So maybe it just takes a continued momentum and you keep whittling away, whittling away.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/technology/googles-quantum-computer-leap.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"11:00:08-04:00","title":"Google’s Quantum Computer Makes a Big Technical Leap","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Google’s quantum computer has made a major technical leap by successfully running a new algorithm, 'Quantum Echoes,' that operates 13,000 times faster than classical supercomputers for tasks like drug discovery and materials science.

Devoret was one of three physicists who won this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics for a series of experiments they conducted more than four decades ago.\n\nAs a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, in the mid-1980s, Dr. Devoret helped show that the strange and powerful properties of quantum mechanics — the physics of the subatomic realm — could also be observed in electrical circuits large enough to be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThat discovery, which paved the way for cellphones and fiber-optic cables, may have greater implications in the coming years as researchers build quantum computers that could be vastly more powerful than today’s computing systems. That could lead to the discovery of new medicines and vaccines, as well as cracking the encryption techniques that guard the world’s secrets.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Devoret and his colleagues at a Google lab near Santa Barbara, Calif., said their quantum computer had successfully run a new algorithm capable of accelerating advances in drug discovery, the design of new building materials and other fields.\n\nLeveraging the counterintuitive powers of quantum mechanics, Google’s machine ran this algorithm 13,000 times as fast as a top supercomputer executing similar code in the realm of classical physics, according to a paper written by the Google researchers in the scientific journal Nature.\n\n“In the future when we have bigger quantum computers, we will be able to run calculations that would be impossible with classical algorithms,” said Dr. Devoret, who joined Google in 2023.\n\nQuantum computing is still an experimental technology. But Google’s new algorithm, Quantum Echoes, shows that scientists are rapidly improving techniques that could allow quantum computers to crack scientific problems no traditional computing device ever could.\n\n“It’s a meaningful technological advance,” said Prineha Narang, a professor of physical sciences and electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. “We have heard a lot about hardware advances in the field, and for a while, I worried that the algorithms would not keep up. But they have shown that this is not the case.”\n\nGoogle’s quantum research is competing with other tech giants like Microsoft and IBM, myriad start-ups, universities and rapidly advancing efforts in China. The Chinese government has committed more than $15.2 billion to quantum research.\n\nInside a classical computer like a laptop or a smartphone, silicon chips store numbers as “bits” of information. Each bit holds either a 1 or a 0. The chips then perform calculations by manipulating these bits — adding them, multiplying them and so on.\n\nA quantum computer, by contrast, performs calculations in ways that defy common sense.\n\nAccording to the laws of quantum mechanics — the physics of very small things — a single object can behave like two separate objects at the same time. By exploiting this strange phenomenon, scientists can build quantum bits, or “qubits,” that hold a combination of 1 and 0 at the same time.\n\nThis means that as the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.\n\nWith two other researchers at Berkeley in the mid-1980s, John M. Martinis and John Clarke, Dr. Devoret showed that the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics were not limited to subatomic particles. They also appeared in electrical circuits that could be used to build computer chips.\n\n“We showed for the first time that you could build atoms out of electrical circuits,” Dr. Devoret said.\n\nThe discovery laid the foundation for the “superconducting qubits” that Google, IBM and many other companies use to power their quantum computers. This involves cooling certain metals to extremely low temperatures so they exhibit the same strange behavior as subatomic particles.\n\nToday’s quantum computers still make too many mistakes. But thanks to recent advances in error correction — a way of reducing mistakes — many scientists now believe the technology can live up to its promise by around the end of the decade.\n\nGoogle announced last year that it had built a quantum computer that needed less than five minutes to perform a particularly complex mathematical calculation in a test designed to gauge the progress of the technology. One of the world’s most powerful non-quantum supercomputers would not have been able to complete it in 10 septillion years, a length of time that exceeds the age of the known universe by billions of trillions of years.\n\nThis moment of “quantum supremacy” showed that the technology was beginning to push beyond the powers of classical computers. But the calculation performed by Google’s machine, based on a chip called Willow, had no practical use.\n\nGoogle and its many rivals are still working toward the moment when a quantum computer can surpass what is possible with a classical computer as it performs important tasks in fields like chemistry and artificial intelligence.\n\n“For the promise of quantum computers to be unlocked, we need to produce a new drug that we only know about because of quantum computers,” Dr. Narang of U.C.L.A. said. “Then you can say that all the investment was worthwhile.”\n\nGoogle’s new algorithm is a step in that direction. In another paper published on Wednesday on the research site arXiv, the company showed that its algorithm could help improve what is called nuclear magnetic resonance, or N.M.R., which is a technique used to understand the structure of tiny molecules and how they interact with one another.\n\nN.M.R. is a vital part of effort to develop new medicines for fighting disease and new materials for building everything from cars to buildings. It can help understand Alzheimer’s disease or drive the creation of entirely new metals, said Ashok Ajoy, an assistant professor of chemistry at Berkeley who specializes in N.M.R. and worked with Google’s researchers on the new paper.\n\n“This illustrates the power of a quantum computer,” he said. “It is still early days. But the prospects are exciting.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/business/general-motors-ai-self-driving.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"11:00:25-04:00","title":"G.M.

Previews Talking Cars, Cheaper Batteries and Other New Tech\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T11:00:25-04:00\n\nGeneral Motors on Wednesday unveiled new technology features that include an artificial intelligence assistant that people can talk to while they drive, a lower-cost battery and self-driving software that will allow drivers of some cars to take their eyes off the road in some circumstances.\n\nThe announcements, at an event in New York attended by Mary T. Barra, the G.M. chief executive, seemed designed to show that the company is a technology leader on a par with Tesla and Chinese rivals like BYD.\n\n“Together, these innovations signify a fundamental shift in G.M.’s evolution,” the company said in a statement.\n\nIn the United States, the G.M. brands Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC are second only to Tesla in electric vehicle sales. Chinese carmakers are effectively banned from the United States by high tariffs. But in Asia and Latin America, G.M. is losing sales to companies like BYD and Geely.\n\nIncluding vehicles powered by gasoline or diesel, G.M. sold about twice as many vehicles worldwide in the third quarter as Tesla did. But Tesla, which is run by Elon Musk, has a stock market value more than 20 times as large as G.M.’s, reflecting investors’ belief that the smaller carmaker is at the forefront of new technologies like autonomous driving.\n\nBeginning next year, G.M. said, it will be offer Gemini, Google’s A.I. system, in both electric and gasoline vehicles. Drivers and passengers will be able to ask Gemini for restaurant recommendations, directions and information from the owner’s manual for the car.\n\nIn 2028, G.M. said, it will introduce a more advanced version of its driver-assistance software, called Super Cruise, that will allow drivers to take their eyes off the road when they are on many highways. Currently, systems offered by G.M. and other manufacturers require drivers to watch where the car is going and be prepared to intervene if the software makes a mistake. Initially, the new system will be available only on divided highways, but G.M. said that later versions would also work on city streets\n\nThe electric version of the Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicle will be the first model to get the new eyes-off technology, G.M. said.\n\nTo accommodate the new features, vehicles will be equipped with a more powerful computer system that will enable faster software updates and more capacity to handle the demands of artificial intelligence, G.M. said.\n\nThe company also said that, beginning in 2028, it would mass-produce batteries that used more manganese and less nickel and cobalt for use in electric vehicles. Manganese is significantly cheaper than the other two metals. Recent advances in so-called lithium manganese rich technology, or LMR, will allow batteries to store as much energy as more typical batteries that contain a lot of expensive nickel and cobalt, G.M. said.\n\nThe company said that it expected to be the first carmaker to offer the technology, which will cut the cost of manufacturing an electric vehicle by thousands of dollars. But Chinese companies are also working on it, G.M. executives acknowledged.\n\nAutomakers are under pressure to cut the cost of batteries to compete with Chinese manufacturers, and to maintain electric vehicle sales after the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress eliminated tax credits that had reduced the cost of such cars by up to $7,500.\n\nBatteries are the most expensive component in electric vehicles and the main reason E.V.s cost significantly more than comparable vehicles powered by gasoline.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/trump-election-deniers-voting-security.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:07-04:00","title":"Trump Empowers Election Deniers, Still Fixated on 2020 Grievances","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration has appointed prominent election denialists, including Heather Honey and Marci McCarthy, to key federal roles in election oversight, raising concerns about the integrity of democratic processes.

Empowers Election Deniers, Still Fixated on 2020 Grievances\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T05:00:47-04:00\n\nElection officials from nearly all 50 states gathered on a call last month with the Homeland Security Department’s point person on “election integrity,” eager to hear how the woman filling a newly created Trump administration position might help safeguard the vote ahead of next year’s midterms.\n\nBut many of them left alarmed.\n\nRather than offering assurances that the federal government’s election protection programs would continue uninterrupted, the new official, Heather Honey, instead used portions of the meeting to echo rhetoric that has infused the right-wing election activist movement that emerged since President Trump falsely claimed that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, according to five people with knowledge of the call.\n\nMs. Honey, a leader in that movement until her appointment in August as deputy assistant secretary for election integrity, complained that her department’s cybersecurity experts tasked with combating misinformation about elections had “strayed from their mission.”\n\nThe remark echoed a widespread view on the right that the agency had sought to silence supporters of Mr. Trump’s fraud claims. Ms. Honey also repeatedly mentioned a report often cited by election conspiracists to support their claims that voting machines were rigged to favor Democrats, according to the people familiar with the call.\n\nThe ascent of Ms. Honey reflects how Mr. Trump and his allies, despite a clear victory last year, remain consumed with the belief that the 2020 election was stolen — and how the president is using the powers of the government to upend an electoral system that he insists helped Joseph R. Biden Jr. take the White House.\n\nIn the past few months, Mr. Trump has elevated multiple proponents of his fraud claims into high-level administration jobs. Now, as government insiders, these activists could wield their newfound power to discredit future results or rekindle old claims to argue for a federal intrusion into locally administered voting systems.\n\nOn a call with right-wing activists in March, before her appointment to the Homeland Security Department, Ms. Honey suggested that the new administration could declare a “national emergency” and justify dictating new rules to state and local governments. She said this could be based on an “actual investigation” of the 2020 election if it showed there had been a “manipulation” of the vote.\n\n“And therefore, we have some additional powers that don’t exist right now,” she said in March, according to a recording reviewed by The New York Times from someone who joined the call, “and therefore, we can take these other steps without Congress and we can mandate that states do things and so on.”\n\nShe added, “I don’t know if that’s really feasible and if the people around the president would let him test that theory.”\n\nThe idea of reinvestigating the 2020 election gained steam recently with the White House’s decision to hire Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who has been tasked with examining the 2020 vote and other election matters, according to a White House official. The hiring of Mr. Olsen, who has worked closely for years with the pillow entrepreneur Mike Lindell to promote stolen-election theories, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnother activist, Marci McCarthy, who spread debunked claims about voting machines in Georgia when she was the chairwoman of the DeKalb County Republican Party, was named in May to be the director of public affairs at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which is housed at the Homeland Security Department.\n\nMs. McCarthy’s appointment comes as nearly all of the election experts at CISA have been placed on administrative leave or reassigned this year amid a large-scale downsizing of the agency, which had played a leading role in deterring attacks on elections systems and combating disinformation about voting.\n\nThe changes are unfolding as Mr. Trump takes steps to try to create more structural advantages for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterms, including pressuring G.O.P.-led states to redraw congressional district lines to maximize the party’s chances of keeping control of the House of Representatives.\n\nNow elections officials who have spent years trying to debunk false claims that the voting systems were tilted against Mr. Trump are assessing how to work with some of the most fervent proponents of those claims.\n\n“These people are not coming with an objective frame of mind to say let’s look at the facts and see where that takes us,” said Matt Crane, a former Republican elections official who is the executive director of the Colorado Clerks Association and served until earlier this year as a consultant for CISA. “They have their destination in mind and cherry-pick facts to help stand up their crazy theories, so there’s nothing objective about it.”\n\nMs. Honey and Ms. McCarthy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn response to questions from The Times, the Homeland Security Department declined to give specifics about the department’s election work. A homeland security spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement that CISA’s “mission is ensuring state and local election officials are cognizant of and utilize the most capable and timely threat intelligence, expertise, resources they need to defend against risks, and identify critical infrastructure security needs to maintain electoral functions.” She also said that the agency’s new hires “go through a rigorous vetting process.”\n\nCleta Mitchell, the Republican lawyer who helped Mr. Trump challenge the 2020 results and worked with Ms. Honey and Ms. McCarthy through the activist group she founded, the Election Integrity Network, praised the homeland security appointments.\n\n“These are the very kind of election integrity leaders every American can be proud to have at D.H.S.,” Ms. Mitchell said.\n\nThe moves by Mr. Trump to elevate election activists could portend escalating legal battles over how much power his administration wields over balloting across the country.\n\nAlready this year, courts have affirmed that the president has no legal authority over elections, which have long been the domain of state and local governments. Judges have largely blocked an executive order that Mr. Trump issued in March requiring, among other changes, documentary proof of citizenship to vote.\n\nBut the Trump administration has taken other aggressive steps to assert more sway over elections.\n\nThe Justice Department, for instance, is compiling the largest set of national voter roll data it has ever collected, an effort to try to prove unsubstantiated claims that large numbers of undocumented immigrants have voted illegally, The Times previously reported.\n\nAnd in a separate effort that also collects similar details, the Homeland Security Department has been soliciting election officials to upload voter information in bulk through a program it developed that checks immigration status, according to documents released in a recent lawsuit and other documents viewed by The Times. State election officials have long rebuffed attempts by the department to access state voter rolls, warning that sharing this data could expose sensitive information like Social Security numbers, or be used to gain an uneven political advantage.\n\nMs. Honey has traced the roots of her election skepticism to the aftermath of the 2020 election, in the wake of a widespread legal and public relations effort by Mr. Trump and his allies to push the false notion that he was the victor and to discredit results that showed otherwise.\n\nThere is no indication that Ms. Honey, a registered Republican, had been active in politics before 2020. She had worked as a private investigator for companies, hunting for stolen and counterfeit goods and scouring the social media accounts of potential employees, according to a person with knowledge of her background.\n\nShe has said that after casting a ballot in Lebanon, Pa., where she lives, she began researching the state election department’s website and saw numbers that she felt did not make sense. Eventually she hit on what she claimed was an apparent discrepancy between the number of voters recorded in one tracking system and the official tally of votes cast.\n\nThe claim has been repeatedly disputed by election officials who said she was misinterpreting and misusing a state database that tracks registered voters and whether or not they voted in previous elections.\n\nNonetheless, Ms. Honey shared her claim with Trump allies in her state. And soon Mr. Trump was repeating it.\n\n“So in Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters,” he said in his speech from the Ellipse on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before his supporters stormed the Capitol. “And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it’s a total fraud.”\n\nWhen Mr. Trump finally returned to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, his court challenges defeated, Ms. Honey was just getting started.\n\nIn 2022, she was a leading witness in an election challenge brought by Kari Lake, the losing candidate for Arizona governor. Mr. Olsen, the lawyer recently hired by the White House, served as one of Ms. Lake’s attorneys in the case.\n\nMs. Honey claimed that one county’s election procedures could have allowed false ballots to be counted, but under questioning she acknowledged that she had no evidence that this had occurred on a large scale.\n\nA judge found that her claim “would not come close to clear and convincing evidence that the election outcome was affected.”\n\nBy that point, Ms. Honey had become influential within the Election Integrity Network, the large coalition of pro-Trump election activists headed by Ms. Mitchell. She went on to run the network’s Pennsylvania group.\n\nIn 2023, Ms. Honey’s company was paid $121,284 from Ms. Mitchell’s organization for consulting work, according to I.R.S. records.\n\nMs. McCarthy, meanwhile, was an active contributor to the Election Integrity Network’s Leadership Council, according to a portion of her website that has since been deleted. She worked to place far-right activists on the local election board in DeKalb County, and was instrumental in forcing out a member of the Georgia State Election Board who voted against a rule to end mail voting in the state.\n\nMr. Trump’s victory in 2024 created a wave of momentum for the Election Integrity Network, as its members sought to capitalize on the new administration’s posture toward elections. The first step was to draft a list of demands that sought to provide something of a blueprint for the federal government.\n\nThe document, titled “US Citizens Elections Bill of Rights,” called for new restrictions on mail ballots and early voting, and included provisions that would make it easier to get people removed from voting rolls and challenge the certification of election results.\n\nThe efforts mirrored elements of Mr. Trump’s executive order on elections and a bill passed by the House but stalled in the Senate, known as the SAVE Act, which would require all voters in federal elections to show proof of citizenship.\n\nMs. Honey, Ms. Mitchell and other members of the Election Integrity Network watched from the public gallery in April as the House passed the elections bill, and then posted on social media a photo of the group posing afterward on the balcony off Speaker Mike Johnson’s office.\n\nThe meeting last month between Ms. Honey and election officials from all 50 states came as many election officials had begun to wonder whether the federal government would continue to be a reliable partner.\n\nAfter hearing about the Trump administration’s cuts to the cybersecurity agency, including the loss of around 25 staff members who had worked on election issues at the local and national levels, many were looking forward to hearing what the Homeland Security Department — and Ms. Honey — planned to focus on.\n\nBut the call, which lasted roughly an hour, left officials both confused and anxious about some of Ms. Honey’s responses, according to five people familiar with the call.\n\nWhen asked what her role entailed, these people said, Ms. Honey did not offer specifics. She said that she would also serve in an advisory capacity to CISA, but also added no further details.\n\nIn addition to questioning CISA’s adherence to its cybersecurity mission, Ms. Honey made unspecified claims of censorship at the agency, a common complaint among right-wing election activists that struck a number of officials on the call as misguided.\n\nShe said that the department would be working on issuing “best practices” for election machines, and made multiple references to a report that has been wrongly interpreted by right-wing activists as part of their claims that election machines had been hacked and could not be trusted.\n\nState election officials asked Ms. Honey about restoring funding for information centers that were previously run by CISA and were a critical element of election security. Ms. Honey said that they would not be returning, and that states should plan to use “fusion centers,” which are hubs for collaboration across intelligence and state, local and federal law enforcement, for election matters.\n\nThis caused some concern among election officials, who wondered how the fusion centers, which are often tasked with coordinating responses for major events like the Super Bowl, would have the bandwidth to help ensure election security, according to the people with knowledge of the call.\n\nMs. Honey’s direct involvement in the Election Integrity Network stopped after her appointment, but she participated in a national leadership call for the group a few weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the call. She apologized that she could no longer work closely with her former colleagues.\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs and Tyler Pager contributed reporting. Susan C.

Hours earlier, President Trump said he was putting off a planned meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to avoid a “wasted” effort toward ending the war.\n\nMr. Trump had said late last week that he would meet soon with Mr. Putin in Hungary to continue peace talks. But on Tuesday, after discussions between American and Russian officials, the White House said no summit meeting was planned “in the immediate future.”\n\nThe Trump administration announced the delay after Russian officials made clear that they would not budge from their maximalist demands to halt their invasion of Ukraine, again rejecting a proposal for a cease-fire that freezes the current front lines.\n\nOn Wednesday, video footage posted by officials on social media showed emergency workers carrying toddlers from a burning kindergarten in the northeastern city of Kharkiv. The strike on the kindergarten killed one person and wounded several others, officials said.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that the overnight assaults showed that “Russia clearly doesn’t feel enough pressure to stop prolonging the war.”\n\nThe Russian barrage prompted nationwide power restrictions for industrial consumers and emergency blackouts for civilians in several regions, including the capital, Kyiv. The strikes followed a pattern in which Russia has unleashed major attacks on Ukraine after significant moments in diplomacy with the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Zelensky reiterated on Tuesday that Ukraine needed more long-range weapons to give it leverage to pressure Moscow to stop its invasion. The Ukrainian leader met with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday but emerged from those contentious talks without a deal he was seeking to buy American long-range missiles.\n\nWhile publicly supporting Mr. Trump’s efforts at peacemaking, Ukrainian officials have consistently said that Moscow will halt its attacks only if Kyiv can retaliate sufficiently.\n\nUkrainian analysts said they were hopeful that Mr. Trump was beginning to recognize Mr. Putin’s tactic of stringing the Americans along by agreeing to high-profile meetings that produce little in the way of results. Russian officials welcomed the proposal for a summit in Budapest after Mr. Trump held a call with Mr. Putin on Thursday, a day before his meeting with Mr. Zelensky.\n\n“Trump realized that this meeting would be a catastrophe, and he would gain nothing but shame,” said Mykhailo Samus, director of the independent New Geopolitics Research Network in Kyiv. “But the question is, what is next? Will Putin be able to get him to such a meeting again?”\n\n“It is important for President Trump to understand that a Nobel Peace Prize is possible only by pressuring Putin, not by shouting at Zelensky,” Mr. Samus added.\n\nMr. Trump has shown remarkable deference to Mr. Putin. The American president has not followed through on his threats to punish Russia for refusing to end the war. And amid warnings from the Kremlin, he has so far not provided American Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv.\n\nBut seemingly emboldened by his role in securing a cease-fire in Gaza, and ever focused on his publicly stated desire to win a Nobel, Mr. Trump has pushed to restart a peace process for Ukraine that had stalled after his meeting with Mr. Putin in Alaska this summer.\n\nWhile Mr. Zelensky emerged from his talks last week with Mr. Trump without new weapons, he did secure continued U.S. support for Kyiv’s position when it comes to territory. Moscow has signaled that it is holding out for Ukraine to surrender the parts of the eastern Donetsk region still under Ukrainian control, a nonstarter for Kyiv.\n\nMr. Zelensky will meet on Thursday with European leaders in Denmark to seek additional support from European nations, which have become the primary backers of Kyiv’s war effort since Mr. Trump ended direct American aid. European leaders have joined with Ukraine in calling for an immediate cease-fire at the current battle lines.\n\nSince the spring of this year, said Mr. Samus, the analyst, Russia has entered talks with one primary goal: to delay any cease-fire and to block the United States from providing long-range weapons to Ukraine.\n\nWhile Mr. Putin has largely succeeded so far, the postponed meeting in Budapest showed that the Russian president may be losing his ability to rely on the same tactic again and again, Mr. Samus said.\n\nMr. Zelensky also called out the Russian tactic.\n\n“Russia continues to do everything it can to weasel out of diplomacy,” he said on Tuesday. “As soon as the issue of long-range capabilities for us, for Ukraine, became less immediate, Russia’s interest in diplomacy faded almost automatically.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/trump-black-chicago.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"15:06:55-04:00","title":"Trump Said Black Chicagoans Wanted His ‘Blitz.’ Many Disagree.","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump claimed to be responding to demands from Black Chicagoans, particularly through a group known as 'Chicago Flips Red,' to intervene in the city’s violent crime.

Chicago, he claimed his actions were motivated by the crime-afflicted Black Chicagoans who had been begging him to intervene.\n\nMany were skeptical of his claim at the outset, and six weeks into his “Operation Midway Blitz,” people in neighborhoods most affected by violent crime have concluded the president is not focused on protecting them. Instead, they worry that the military-style federal operations used to crack down on immigrants will be used against them.\n\nThe masked federal agents who have swept through leafy North Side neighborhoods and sprawling, working-class sections of Southwest Chicago have made it clear their targets are immigrants. The American gangs that have bedeviled largely Black neighborhoods on the South and West Sides have gone largely untouched.\n\n“It’s just a ploy to put people away against their rights, and without due process,” Xavier Lyons, 57, a patron at Lem’s Bar-B-Q, a Black-owned institution on the South Side, said of the federal sweep.\n\nStill, for Black Chicagoans, federal operations have drastically reshaped life, with people fearing detention or having loved ones taken away without due process, said Che “Rhymefest” Smith, a rapper who represents parts of the South Side on the Chicago Board of Education. U.S. citizens were in fact detained during a military-style raid on an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood.\n\n“This level of attack is unsustainable for Chicagoans,” he said.\n\nChicago’s demographics are unique for such a large city. Its white, Hispanic and Black populations are at rough parity, each making up nearly a third of the city. Since Midway Blitz began, Chicago’s Latino population has been the main and most visible target.\n\nIts white residents have shown up for daily protests at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in suburban Broadview and been part of the citizen swarms that have popped up with whistles, screams and cameras during federal actions.\n\nIts Black population has complicated views. The federal push came after years of tension between mostly Latino migrants and Black residents in low-income areas, strained by the huge influx of newcomers.\n\nIn 2022, after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, sent busloads of mostly Venezuelan migrants to Chicago, the effect was arguably felt most acutely on the South Side. Migrants were placed in shuttered schools in Black communities, where residents had previously fought to keep the schools open.\n\nMore than $600 million went to provide emergency shelter and other services, according to a local news investigation. Black residents showed up to City Council meetings, voicing frustration about the strain on public resources, job competition, or effects on neighborhood demographics. They argued that for years their pleas for more resources were ignored, and now they were being overlooked in favor of newcomers.\n\nMr. Trump appeared to hope he could take advantage of those divisions.\n\n“You have a force of Black women, Black women,” the president told reporters in late August as he promised to intervene in Chicago. “They want Trump to come in.”\n\nThe “beautiful Black women” who had caught Mr. Trump’s eye — members of a group called Chicago Flips Red — did cheer him on and still do.\n\n“For the past, I would say at least five years, we’ve been asking the City Council and our local officials to amend the sanctuary laws because it was costing us money,” said P Rae Easley, a conservative activist who is running for Congress as a Republican. “We are subsidizing any and everybody who can get here from the third world through our sanctuary policies.”\n\nSome in the Black business community also hoped the crackdown would reduce crime.\n\n“In the city of Chicago, you have to worry about sitting by the window when you’re at home in certain neighborhoods,” said Dr. Cornel Darden, chairman of the Greater Chicagoland Black Chamber of Commerce.\n\nBut that is not how Midway Blitz has played out. Agents of ICE and the Border Patrol have popped up in largely white areas of the North Side and suburbs. Melees have broken out in working-class Hispanic areas. But the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates — Austin, North Lawndale and others — have largely been bypassed.\n\nAt first, many Black Chicagoans shrugged. “Oh, those are just the Latins, or those are just the Venezuelans,” Black Chicago thought, according to Mr. Smith.\n\n“But,” he continued, “what’s interesting is, the more ICE kidnaps people at random off the street, the more of a whisper that voice became.”\n\nAbigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said operations in Chicago had “arrested illegal pedophiles, murderers and other criminals who were roaming free.” But she implied federal efforts have been impeded by Democratic opposition, singling out Illinois’ governor, JB Pritzker.\n\n“JB Pritzker has attacked the president, rejected his help and lied about the administration’s efforts,” she said. “Residents who want more help addressing crime should ask Pritzker why he supports criminals.”\n\nInterviews with residents on the South Side indicated that some Black Chicagoans may have a growing sense of solidarity with immigrant communities, including African and Caribbean migrants who they say are being quietly snatched up in ways that mirror their own experiences with racial profiling and policing.\n\nTo be sure, even with crime rates falling in Chicago, violent crime is still a scourge in many Black parts of the city. Greater Grand Crossing, Lem’s Bar-B-Q’s neighborhood, had 24 homicides last year, one of the highest totals in the city, according to data compiled by a local news outlet.\n\n“Chicago is a hellhole right now,” the president said from the Oval Office last month.\n\nMs. Easley, who is running for Congress, said the federal surge was deterring violent crime and that Black people shouldn’t be worried.\n\n“ICE did not come to Chicago to kick in doors and kidnap Negroes,” she said.\n\nBut into its second month, Midway Blitz may in fact be losing support among some Black Chicagoans. Llewellyn Dixon was standing in line at Lem’s when he delivered this message to the president: “You’re treating us as if we’re not citizens.”\n\n“Not human,” his wife, Nannette Dixon, interjected. “And we don’t know what’s best for our own community.”\n\nSome Black business owners also have complicated feelings about the crackdown and the disruption caused by the raids.\n\n“Anytime in business where you have dramatic change, then there’s uncertainty, and that’s not good for business,” said Mr. Darden, who also owns a local publication called The Chicagoland Journal.\n\nSome Greater Chicagoland Black Chamber of Commerce members had benefited from the migrant influx, including landlords who charged higher rents after receiving housing subsidies.\n\nNow, Mr. Darden said, business owners call him constantly, worried about their bottom lines. “They just want to make money,” he said.\n\nMany immigrants, regardless of status, are not showing up for work, another stress on Black businesses. Mr. Darden spoke of a restaurant owner expecting 35 employees to staff a busy Friday night.\n\n“But you show up at 5 p.m. that Friday night and you’re down 10 employees, or you’re down five employees for whatever reason, whether they were fearful or they were dealing with some of their family members who were having issues with ICE, or they were having issues with ICE themselves,” he said.\n\n“It appears that only Black and brown individuals are the ones that are being rounded up,” Mr. Darden added.\n\nIn a city where Black residents have a long, difficult history with the police, Trump administration assurances that agents are targeting “the worst of the worst” are not finding receptive ears. In 1969, Chicago police officers, in coordination with federal agents, gunned down Fred Hampton, a leader of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers. For decades, a former Chicago police commander, Jon Burge, ran secret “black sites” where Black men were tortured.\n\nIn 2014, the killing of the 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by a Chicago police officer who shot him 16 times as he was walking away set off days of protest.\n\nDistrust runs deep. L.A. Jones, a 64-year-old South Side resident, brought up Fred Hampton’s killing when he asked, “It’s OK to go into his house and kill him?”\n\n“Now, tell me what has changed?” he said. “Laquan McDonald was shot and killed. Nothing’s changing.”\n\nThe videos produced by the Department of Homeland Security of federal raids in Chicago are meant as a “show” to both intimidate and entertain, Mr. Jones said, noting, “People like seeing this stuff.”\n\nAvery Simms, 33, who lives near the South Shore building that was raided last month by federal agents in helicopters and military-style vehicles, said migrants were a net positive. “I know people may feel different because a lot of them did not like them coming over here,” she said, “but I didn’t see a problem with it.”\n\nShe is concerned about what the immigration raids could portend for Black residents.\n\n“I think a lot of people are scared,” she said. “It could be my mom, it could be me, it could be my dad, my sister, who knows?”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/climate/alaska-solar-farm-food.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"21:15:12-04:00","title":"This Solar Farm in Alaska Provides Something Extra: Free Food","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A large solar farm in Houston, Alaska, built in 2023, is pioneering agrivoltaics by growing food between its solar panels, with rows spaced 50 feet apart to allow for both energy production and agriculture.

Mr. Mamdani says, “It’s pretty phonetic honestly.”\n\nBy Emma G. Fitzsimmons, Benjamin Oreskes, Eden Weingart and Aliza Aufrichtig\n\nIt was more than an hour into last week’s critical three-way debate for mayor of New York City, and somehow, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had yet to say the name of the race’s front-runner.\n\nHe called him “the assemblyman” and a miniature version of former Mayor Bill de Blasio. But he shied away from saying a name that he had repeatedly butchered on the campaign trail.\n\nAndrew Cuomo during a Democratic primary debate in June.\n\nHis pronunciation was so notably off that, during a Democratic primary debate in June, the assemblyman himself, Zohran Mamdani, called him out on it.\n\nFor various reasons, legitimate and perhaps otherwise, Mr. Mamdani’s first and last name have become the subject of rather adventurous, even creative, displays of linguistic fumbling.\n\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, struggled with his name at the first debate of the general election last week, calling him Zor-han.\n\nLetitia James, the New York state attorney general and a key political ally, botched his name at a major campaign rally in Washington Heights this month, enthusiastically shouting “Mandami” as he came onstage.\n\nFor Mr. Mamdani, having his name botched is not new. He said in an interview that mispronunciations were common growing up as an immigrant in Manhattan.\n\n“It happened quite a lot,” he said. “But frankly, I don’t begrudge anyone who tries and gets it wrong. The effort means everything to me.”\n\nAsked about any mnemonic tricks he recommends to help people pronounce it, Mr. Mamdani laughed.\n\nMr. Mamdani, who is running to become the city’s first Muslim mayor, said that some people like Mr. Cuomo were intentionally mispronouncing his name or refusing to make an effort to say it correctly.\n\n“Those who go out of their way to mispronounce it — that’s not a mistake, that’s a message,” he said.\n\nHis supporters have embraced the issue as a rallying cry against Mr. Cuomo, turning the audio clip of Mr. Mamdani correcting him into a viral song online. Mr. Mamdani also said that his mother has started to sign emails with “Momdani” — a nod to her pride in being his mother that might also help with the pronunciation.\n\nMr. de Blasio, the former mayor, is another Mamdani ally who admitted that he had stumbled over his name.\n\n“I think I’m in the ballpark now, but it did take me a while,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding: “I think it’s just to the American English ear, the construct is a little counterintuitive. It takes some practice to get the cadence of it right.”\n\nMr. Sliwa said in an interview that he was trying to do better: “It’ll take time. It’s not intentional.”\n\nMr. Sliwa, whose last name is pronounced SLEE-WUH, said he understood Mr. Mamdani’s pain.\n\n“Out of 46 years that I’ve been the guy who founded the Guardian Angels, I’d say about 33 years of that time, my name was constantly mispronounced,” he said. “I don’t take offense to it.”\n\nPresident Trump’s failed efforts to say Mr. Mamdani’s name might be viewed less benevolently, since the president has repeatedly attacked the candidate and threatened to arrest him.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump speaking to reporters on Air Force One this week.\n\nHis press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, used an even more outlandish pronunciation, merging parts of his first and last name.\n\nWhile some pronunciation mistakes might be deliberate, several linguistics experts told The New York Times that both Mr. Mamdani’s first and last name feature letter arrangements and vowel sounds that are not common in English, and it was not a surprise that some people struggled with them.\n\n“Languages differ from one another as to what sequences of sounds are frequent, or even possible to pronounce, and they also differ as to what spellings or letters are associated with what pronunciations,” said Gillian Gallagher, a professor of linguistics at New York University.\n\nThere are hundreds more words in English with the sequence “nd” than with “md,” Ms. Gallagher said, adding that these clusters of consonants can lead to speech processes that result in mistakes. One, known as assimilation, involves morphing the second “M” in Mr. Mamdani’s last name into an “N,” making it sound like Mandani.\n\nAnother, known as substitution, leads speakers to replace the “N” in Mamdani with another “M.”\n\nWhoopi Goldberg, the television host, on “The View.”\n\nThose patterns of speech can be difficult to avoid.\n\n“Mamdani has an ‘M’ next to a ‘D’, and that’s hard for English speakers,” said Professor Laurel MacKenzie, a co-director of the NYU Sociolinguistics Lab.\n\n“Our tongues are just not used to making that specific sequence of sounds.”\n\nThe softer “Ahn” sound in both Mr. Mamdani’s first and last name can also be challenging. Frequently, “Zohran” has been pronounced with a screeching “Zohr-ANNE.” That miscue is the result of vowels being pronounced differently in Americanized English, said Suzanne van der Feest, an associate research professor at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York.\n\nCarl Heastie, speaker of the New York State Assembly, at an event where he endorsed Mr. Mamdani.\n\n“That is somebody who speaks mainly English and is just making it into American English vowels,” Ms. van der Feest said.\n\n“It’s an example of how spelling is interfering with how someone’s name is pronounced.”\n\nJohn Samuelsen, the international president of the Transport Workers Union, said his pronunciation of Mr. Mamdani’s first name feels like a “very common outer-borough way of pronouncing Zohran.” He also noted that he avoids saying Mr. Mamdani’s last name, because “I’m afraid I’m going to mess it up.”\n\nMr. Mamdani said he once visited a mosque in Manhattan for Friday prayers during the campaign and asked the group to raise their hand if they had ever heard someone consistently mispronounce their name. Most people in the room raised their hands.\n\n“It’s something countless immigrants have experienced,” he said. “When people mock or intentionally distort someone’s name, it’s a way of saying someone doesn’t belong here.”\n\nMr. Mamdani said he took pride in his name. His mother picked his first name, which means “the first star in the sky.” His father picked his middle name, Kwame, to honor Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana, who fought for independence.\n\n“Andrew Cuomo never struggles with names like John Catsimatidis,” Mr. Mamdani said in reference to the Greek billionaire grocer. “But somehow Mamdani is too difficult. It’s an issue of prejudice.”\n\nOthers have expressed frustration over Mr. Cuomo’s errors, including the journalist Anand Giridharadas, who corrected Mr. Cuomo on MSNBC this week: “This is a very big, diverse city you want to lead. We should get the names right.”\n\nAndrew Cuomo in a video posted to his campaign’s TikTok account.\n\nRich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said that the former governor’s name was often botched, too. Indeed, Como, like the Italian lake, is a common mispronunciation for Cuomo, which is pronounced KWO-MO.\n\n“It’s unintentional and he should get over it — people mangle ‘Cuomo’ all the time and you don’t hear us whine about it,” Mr. Azzopardi said.\n\nMs. MacKenzie and others were quick to note, though, that pronouncing difficult names correctly is not an insurmountable challenge. Practice and a concerted effort to ask people how they pronounce their names helps. That’s particularly the case in New York City, with such a rich array of immigrant communities from across the world.\n\n“We all learned how to say ‘Daenerys Targaryen’ when we were all into ‘Game of Thrones,’” Ms. MacKenzie said.\n\n“We can learn hard names. We can do it. We can figure out how the spellings map to the sounds. We can all get there. We just have to practice.”\n\nVideo Credits: Andrew Cuomo, via YouTube; WNBC-TV and WNJU-TV, via YouTube; NBC, via YouTube; Zohran Mamdani via YouTube; CNN, Forbes via YouTube; The White House, via YouTube; “The View,” via YouTube; WABC, via YouTube; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, via YouTube;  Andrew Cuomo, via TikTok.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/world/europe/ukraine-gripen-fighter-jets-sweden-saab.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"14:30:06-04:00","title":"What Are Gripen Fighter Jets and Why Does Ukraine Want Them?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sweden has agreed to a letter of intent to sell up to 150 Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine, a move seen as a significant boost to Ukraine’s aerial defense and combat capabilities.

Them?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T14:30:06-04:00\n\nSweden signed a letter of intent on Wednesday to sell up to 150 Swedish-produced Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine, a development that President Volodymyr Zelensky characterized as a potentially critical addition to Kyiv’s war effort.\n\nSince Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine has lobbied the White House and its European allies to supply it with powerful fighter jets to protect Ukrainian skies. But the jets have been slow to come, and the fleet Kyiv now has, which includes both F-16s and French Mirage jets, is relatively small.\n\nIf the Gripen deal is completed, the first jets could be delivered within the next three years, according to Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden. Experts believe that the versatile Gripen jets may offer Ukraine some combat advantages over the long-sought F-16.\n\nHere is a look at the jets and why Ukraine wants them.\n\nFirst flown in 1988, the Gripen is a lightweight, multi-role combat aircraft. Its capabilities range from air defense to ground attacks to long-range strikes. The jet is produced by the Swedish aerospace company Saab.\n\nThe Gripen carries much the same type of weaponry as the F-16, and both are supersonic aircraft.\n\nThe Gripen jets might be more suitable than F-16s for Ukraine’s war needs, experts say, because they are designed to be supported by a small number of troops who are not necessarily highly trained engineers. The jets allow for the quick loading of missiles without a lot of ground infrastructure.\n\n“The Gripen family was designed from the outset to operate in austere, off-base locations — it’s in the DNA of the jet,” said Gareth Jennings, an aviation specialist at Janes, a defense intelligence publication. “The F-16 and other jets can do that, but it takes a lot more care, a lot more attention to detail, and it’s harder to do.”\n\nFor Ukraine, a country with large open spaces, the Gripen has the advantage of being designed to deal with so-called highway operations, in which planes take off and land on public roads, Mr. Jennings added. The Gripen jets are also designed to be quickly refueled in tough, cold conditions.\n\nAccording to a report by the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, some models of the Gripen have electronic warfare systems optimized for countering Russian fighters and radars.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/movies/scream-1996-watch-party.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:02:00-04:00","title":"Halloween Movie Watch Party: Let’s All ‘Scream’","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article promotes a community watch party for Wes Craven’s 1996 horror film 'Scream,' inviting readers to watch or rewatch the movie before October 26, 2025.

Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Maine, apologized for having gotten a tattoo years ago that resembles a Nazi symbol and said he would have it removed.\n\nMr. Platner, who is running for the seat held by Senator Susan Collins since 1997, said in a video podcast interview aired Tuesday that he got the skull and crossbones tattoo, which is widely recognized as a Nazi symbol, while drunk 18 years ago and was unaware of its extremist association.\n\nMr. Platner, a Marine veteran and oyster farmer, has also come under scrutiny for a series of posts he made years ago on Reddit that played down sexual assault in the military and criticized the police and white Americans living in rural areas.\n\nMr. Platner acknowledged the tattoo in an episode of the podcast Pod Save America that aired on Tuesday. The podcast played a video clip from a decade ago in which Mr. Platner dances shirtless, with the tattoo visible, at a bar while lip-syncing to a Miley Cyrus song at his brother’s wedding. A host of the podcast, Tommy Vietor, said that some of Mr. Platner’s “political opponents” had been telling reporters that he had a tattoo “with Nazi affiliation.”\n\nMr. Platner said on the podcast, which is hosted by former Obama aides, that he got the tattoo in 2007 in Split, Croatia, and that he and other Marines had chosen a “terrifying-looking skull and crossbones off the wall” and that “skulls and crossbones are a pretty standard military thing.”\n\n“I am not a secret Nazi,” Mr. Platner said on the podcast, adding that he was a lifelong opponent of antisemitism and Nazism.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press late Tuesday, Mr. Platner said: “It was not until I started hearing from reporters and D.C. insiders that I realized this tattoo resembled a Nazi symbol. I absolutely would not have gone through life having this on my chest if I knew that — and to insinuate that I did is disgusting. I am already planning to get this removed.”\n\nHe said in the statement that he had never tried to hide the tattoo, including during a full physical examination he had when enlisting in the Army, and added that no one had told him that the image had Nazi links. A spokesman for Mr. Platner did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, decried what he called “the flirtation with Nazism” across the political spectrum in the United States.\n\n“If you’re running for office, seeking a potential appointment, or serving the public in any capacity, you should have no connection to or sympathy for Nazi ideology. Period,” Mr. Greenblatt wrote in a social media post, which included a headline about Mr. Platner’s tattoo.\n\nMr. Platner also addressed Reddit posts that he made between 2009 and 2021, which were reported by CNN and The Washington Post, saying that he was “utterly horrified by” some of his words from the past.\n\nAmong the posts that have drawn criticism was one from 2013 in which he responded to a thread asking users what questions they have for people of other races. Mr. Platner asked why Black people do not tip, something he said he observed while working as a bartender. On the podcast, Mr. Platner said he had been “legitimately asking the question,” because he thought there might be a cultural explanation.\n\n“It was certainly not meant as a malicious thing,” he said.\n\nIn another 2013 post, he appeared to play down challenges that service members face when trying to report sexual assault allegations. Mr. Platner said in the podcast that, when rereading his own comments, he saw “me not knowing what I’m talking about,” along with an expletive, and added that his views had changed.\n\nHe made other posts disparaging police officers and calling white Americans living in rural areas racist and stupid.\n\nHe said on the podcast that he had been “trying to get a rise out of people on the internet” and that those comments did not reflect his true opinions at the time.\n\nHe said that he wrote the posts during a dark time in his life and that he had struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder and alienation after his military service. Mr. Platner, who returned from his last tour in Afghanistan in 2018, noted that his posts stopped around 2021, when he said he was in a better place.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has endorsed Mr. Platner, told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Platner was an “excellent candidate” and that his endorsement stood.\n\nMr. Platner said: “The idea that a person cannot, like, evolve and grow from years ago is, I think, pretty laughable to the average human being. Especially in this day and age. Everybody has posted something stupid on the internet.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/opinion/no-kings-trump-declaration-independence.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:03:39-04:00","title":"No Kings Means No Kings.

No Wonder Trump Hates It.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T05:03:39-04:00\n\nOn Saturday, between 5 and 7 million people assembled on streets, sidewalks and town squares across the country — in “red” states and in “blue” — to protest against President Trump and his administration, in what may have been the largest single-day demonstration in American history. This came on the heels of a similar demonstration in June, which, despite its smaller size (approximately 2 to 5 million participants), was still one of the largest single days of protest ever recorded in this country.\n\nHere is what Trump, whose job it is to represent the whole people of the United States, had to say about the day.\n\n“It’s a joke,” he told reporters on Air Force One. “I looked at the people. They are not representative of this country. And I looked at all the brand-new signs I guess paid for by Soros and other radical left lunatics. We’re checking it out. The demonstrations were very small. And the people were whacked out.”\n\nThat same day, the president posted to his Truth Social account an A.I.-generated video in which he bombarded protesters with what appeared to be a flood of feces from a fighter aircraft he was flying while wearing a crown.\n\nNo, I am not making this up. It’s true.\n\nWhat isn’t true, on the other hand, is the president’s characterization of the protests. By all accounts, the protesters represented a cross-section of the broader public. The people themselves were peaceful, calm and disciplined.\n\nTrump’s calumny aside, it is useful to compare the president’s response in this moment to one of President Barack Obama’s early reactions to the much smaller Tea Party protests that took off during his first term in office.\n\n“I think that America has a noble tradition of being helpfully skeptical about government,” he said in 2010 during a news conference a few weeks before the midterm elections:\n\nAnd I think that’s a good thing. I think there’s also a noble tradition in the Republican and Democratic parties of saying that government should — should pay its way, that it shouldn’t get so big that we’re leaving debt to the next generation. All those things, I think, are healthy.\n\nObama then went on to ask the Tea Party movement to make specific demands — to say what they would have him do so that they could work, constructively, to find common ground.\n\nNow, you can attribute this yawning distance between the two men to their respective temperaments, which we do not need to elaborate on any further than we already have. But even after you account for personality, Trump stands out. Recall that even President Richard Nixon, infamous for his endless resentment toward — and acid contempt for — his political opponents, met with student protesters of the Vietnam War at the Lincoln Memorial to try to understand their perspective, not as adversaries but as fellow Americans.\n\nWhat we see in Trump is not just a difference of personality but one of political interpretation. Trump does not see himself leading the people of the United States, but his people — the denizens of MAGA America, defined by the colors on the 2024 presidential election map.\n\nIt would be one thing if this were just a preoccupation with the interests of his supporters. But Trump combines sectarian partisanship with genuine hatred for those Americans on the other side of the political divide. As he told the audience at a state-sanctioned memorial for Charlie Kirk last month, “I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them.”\n\nWhat he wants, instead, is to dominate them: to subjugate them to his will. To that end, he has refashioned the most coercive parts of the federal government into instruments designed to force his opponents — or as he sees them, his enemies — to bend the knee. And it is this, as much as anything else, that inspired millions of Americans to define their opposition to Trump in terms of royal power and royal prerogatives.\n\nTo return to the Saturday protests — and to put them in slightly different terms — roughly one in 50 Americans gathered under one slogan (“No Kings!”) to protest against the president’s authoritarian methods and monarchical aspirations. And while Trump’s allies may feign ignorance with regard to claims that he’s seeking arbitrary and unaccountable power — hiding behind an accusation of “Trump derangement syndrome” — it takes no time at all to write out a litany of offenses that threaten the republican foundations of American democracy.\n\nTo borrow language from one of the nation’s founding documents, Trump has “erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their Substance”; he has “kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our Legislatures”; he has “affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power”; he has cut “off our Trade with all Parts of the World” and imposed “Taxes on us without our Consent.” He has transported us “beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offences” and in deigning to spend tax dollars without congressional authorization — to pay soldiers in the midst of a shutdown, in a move reminiscent of Stuart absolutism — he has “invested” himself “with Power to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever.”\n\nAll this so that he might alter “fundamentally the Forms of our Governments,” and remake the United States in his image as a personalist autocracy.\n\nThe president’s opponents can see, quite clearly, that Trump wants authoritarian power so that he can crush their dissent. And Trump has been nothing but open about his desire to turn the federal state against blue America, punishing Democrats and Democratic voters for the crime of acting against him. “We’re under invasion from within, no different than a foreign enemy,” he said in remarks to the military’s top brass last month. “It’s a war from within.”\n\nHence the president’s use of the National Guard to occupy American cities and, as much as possible, to replace civil law with military order. Hence his use of federal law enforcement to harass and intimidate his political adversaries as well as universities and civil society organizations deemed liberal. Hence his impoundment of funds meant for Democratic-led states and his threats to defund Democratic-led cities like New York. And hence his promise to use the government shutdown to cut programs favored by Democrats.\n\n“We’re only cutting Democrat programs, I hate to tell you, but we are cutting Democrat programs,” Trump said during a cabinet meeting early in the standoff. “We will be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren’t popular with Republicans, frankly.”\n\nOne irony, here, is that in his zeal to punish Democrats for their opposition to his administration, Trump is harming millions of his own voters who live in states such as New York, Illinois and California. He seems unaware that there were more Trump voters in, for example, Los Angeles County than there were in the state of Oklahoma.\n\nBut this just gets to the basic folly of trying to govern for “your” people and force the rest of the public to submit to your will. Despite what might appear to be true in the maps we use to illustrate election results, it is not possible to divide the United States into “red” and “blue” teams. For as much as Americans are polarized around party affiliation, they do not actually exist in separate societies or civilizations. Wish as we might otherwise, we rise, and fall, together.\n\nIn which case the main effect of the president’s effort to dominate and punish his political enemies is to harm all Americans. And while some will soothe their material pain with the psychological wage of domination — of knowing that, whatever else happens, the libs were owned — most will simply suffer.\n\nThe proximate aim of the No Kings protests was to demonstrate — to the public as much as to politicians, business leaders and other prominent members of civil society — that the supposed “vibe shift” of the 2024 election was a mirage and that, far from being the avatar of some imagined authentic American, Trump is just a politician, and an unpopular one at that. But part of the power of mass protest is that even when orderly it is unpredictable; no one truly knows who is watching, who is changed, who is inspired.\n\nIn seizing the mantle of the country’s anti-royal heritage — that is, in seizing the rhetoric and imagery of the American Revolution and taking back the tea party from the Tea Partyers — Saturday’s protests may remind many more than those who waved a sign that we, as Americans, are honored participants in a shared project of self-government and that there is no election that could give any president the power to deprive us of our right to govern ourselves.\n\nTrump needs division to fuel his autocratic plans and make his royal dream a reality. For this reason, he is working as hard as possible to divide this country against itself. But if we can take any sign from the public’s escalating response to this madness, it is that Trump just may, in the end, remind Americans of the vital power of acting together in solidarity with each other.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

followed a simple formula: move to a big city, work hard, and buy a home. That model, once a reliable engine of progress in China, is breaking down after the collapse of the housing market in 2021, which set off an ongoing economic downturn.\n\nToday, many workers are opting out of the old system and finding new careers in China’s digital gig economy — and in the process, redefining what work looks like.\n\nThe New York Times profiled some of these workers: a mother helping people navigate China’s bureaucratic hospital system; a lifestyle influencer who drives from city to city scouting the most affordable places to live; and a former retail manager who quit her office job to become a licensed electrician.\n\nTheir stories reflect some of the larger forces reshaping China’s economy. Across the country, young people are struggling to find the kind of lucrative office jobs that were once common after college, and some are rejecting the pressure to pursue prosperity at all costs, and instead choosing to do as little as possible. Meanwhile, China’s population is growing older, and blue-collar jobs are becoming increasingly attractive.\n\nThese shifts are playing out in surprising ways because of the Chinese internet. With a smartphone and social media, workers across the country are tapping into online trends and investing in themselves, creating a new generation of digital entrepreneurs who are making money and building careers on their own terms.\n\nAs China’s aging population navigates a complex public hospital system, a new industry of gig workers is stepping in to help.\n\nFor many young Chinese, the relentless pressure to succeed has given way to a new philosophy: “lying flat,” or doing the bare minimum.\n\nAn all-female repair business is challenging gender norms and catering to a growing population of single Chinese women seeking safety and comfort at home.\n\nProduced by Isabelle Qian, Cinematography by Qilai Shen, Edited by Ben Laffin, Graphics by Aaron Byrd, Additional Editing by Mark Boyer, Production Manager Caterina Clerici, Senior Producer Hanaan Sarhan, Executive Producer Sameen Amin, Design and Development by Michael Beswetherick.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/pelosi-congress-scott-wiener.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:00:06-04:00","title":"Pelosi Hasn’t Announced Her 2026 Plans.

A Top Contender Is Tired of Waiting.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T08:00:06-04:00\n\nFor years, Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator, has eyed San Francisco’s main congressional seat after building significant clout on housing policy and L.G.B.T.Q. rights in California. But there was always a seemingly insurmountable roadblock, and her name was Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMr. Wiener, 55, had long vowed not to run for the seat until Ms. Pelosi announced her retirement. It was partly deferential, as the party establishment has frowned upon challenging a sitting member of Congress. And it was partly practical, as Ms. Pelosi has been revered in San Francisco, especially after she rose to the speakership.\n\nMs. Pelosi, 85, has not yet said whether she will run for a 21st term next year. But Mr. Wiener told The New York Times that he was done waiting, old promises be damned. On Wednesday, he will enter the race.\n\nIt was the clearest sign yet that younger generations of Democrats were prepared to buck convention as their party struggles to reinvent itself after losing control of Congress and the White House last year.\n\n“The world changes,” Mr. Wiener said in an interview at a cafe in the Castro District, the San Francisco gay neighborhood where he owns a small condo. “I made a decision that it makes sense for me to get into the race now because I’m passionate about San Francisco having the best possible representation.”\n\nThe talk in San Francisco has increased over the past year about whether Ms. Pelosi would retire after representing the city for nearly four decades.\n\nShe wields power, but quietly in the background more than before, as has been the case with California’s gerrymandering effort to counter Republicans this year. She remains healthy, but a fall last December on a marble staircase in Luxembourg forced her to get emergency hip replacement surgery. The longer she goes without announcing her 2026 plans, the more speculation rises.\n\nYet Ms. Pelosi remains a political icon in a city known for its powerhouse Democrats, from former Vice President Kamala Harris to Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nIan Krager, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, said she had no comment about her future plans and that she was fully focused on passing Proposition 50, the November state ballot measure that would redraw California’s congressional districts. He said Ms. Pelosi also had no comment about Mr. Wiener’s decision to enter the race.\n\nMr. Wiener praised Ms. Pelosi and declined to answer most questions about her. He would not say whether she was too old to serve effectively or whether he had told her personally that he would enter the race.\n\nBut he did not hold back when it came to Saikat Chakrabarti, a wealthy, progressive firebrand who filed to run for the seat in February. And Mr. Wiener justified his entrance as a matter of ensuring that the upstart would not become Ms. Pelosi’s successor.\n\nMr. Chakrabarti, 39, may be best known for having helped Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez leap from New York City bartender to congresswoman and serving as her first chief of staff. He has hundreds of millions of dollars in personal wealth after being the third employee at Stripe, a tech company that focuses on payment processing.\n\nMr. Wiener said it was clear that Mr. Chakrabarti had the campaign skills and money to be a threat. What he doesn’t have, Mr. Wiener said pointedly, is a deep understanding of San Francisco.\n\n“He has so little connection to San Francisco and really never did anything in San Francisco before he started running for Congress,” Mr. Wiener said. “He is trying to buy the seat.”\n\nMr. Chakrabarti countered on Tuesday that he had lived in the city since 2009 and was running to save democracy. He said the best way to beat back President Trump’s “authoritarian coup” was to prove that Democrats could address the cost-of-living crisis and win back the support of working people.\n\n“He’s right that, politically, I’ve done way more in Congress, but that is why I’m applying for a job in Congress,” Mr. Chakrabarti said.\n\nMs. Pelosi’s daughter, Christine Pelosi, has long been considered a possible successor. On Tuesday, the younger Ms. Pelosi texted a photo of herself from the Democratic National Committee’s women’s leadership forum in Washington. She wore a cream-colored scarf with the Bill of Rights sewn onto it.\n\n“I’m 100% devoted to passing Prop. 50,” she texted. “And being deluged with requests for my scarf.”\n\nEric Jaye, a longtime San Francisco political consultant, said Mr. Wiener’s decision made perfect sense.\n\nHe said that American voters were “very restive” and were interested in electing younger, more progressive candidates, such as Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner for New York City mayor. Mr. Chakrabarti could benefit from that tide, he said, so Mr. Wiener needed to jump into the race or risk losing his window forever.\n\n“He deferred and demurred a long, long time, and I think it got to the point where that was no longer politically sustainable,” Mr. Jaye said.\n\nMr. Wiener grew up in New Jersey and attended Duke University and Harvard Law School before moving to San Francisco in 1997. He said he was drawn to the city by the promise of living freely as a gay man, though he was also devastated by the deaths from AIDS that he saw all around him and how the federal government had done little about it.\n\nHe said discrimination against gay men back then had parallels today in Mr. Trump’s attacks on transgender people, drag queens, immigrants and others.\n\n“These are people who are just trying to live their lives and be who they are, and they’re being treated like human garbage,” he said. “We have a responsibility to stick up for them.”\n\nAfter serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Mr. Wiener was elected to the State Legislature in 2016. He has played a pivotal role in the advancement of bills to accelerate housing construction in California, including legislation enacted this year to allow tall apartment buildings near transit stops over the objections of local officials.\n\nIf Mr. Wiener wins his race, he would become the first gay person to represent San Francisco in federal elected office.\n\nAlmost anywhere else, Mr. Wiener would be considered liberal. But in San Francisco, some progressives have dismissed him as a corporate-friendly Democrat because his laserlike focus on building more housing has benefited developers.\n\nNationally, he has been called by Breitbart News “California’s most radical legislator” for writing laws that include making California a sanctuary state for transgender people and banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from wearing masks. He said he had regularly received death threats.\n\nHe has not shied away from scrapping with Fox News reporters and conservatives such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia. He sometimes posts images of himself in skimpy clothing from the Folsom Street Fair, an annual San Francisco festival that celebrates the kink and leather communities. He said he would not stop living authentically if he were elected to Congress.\n\n“I’m going to be me,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/business/louvre-robbery-jewelry-heist-insurance.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"14:11:31-04:00","title":"Why Weren’t the Jewels Stolen From the Louvre Insured?","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre Museum in Paris suffered a heist where crown jewels belonging to Empress Eugénie were stolen, valued at 88 million euros.

and necklaces encrusted with diamonds, sapphires and emeralds. But when thieves broke into the Louvre Museum in a brazen heist this past weekend, snatching crown jewels belonging to Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, what they looted was priceless: a part of France’s heritage that can never be replaced.\n\nEven so, the Louvre put a number on the haul, valuing the stolen jewels at an eye-popping 88 million euros, or a little over $100 million.\n\nBut the Louvre will not be compensated for the loss. None of the royal items, it turns out, were insured.\n\nWhen the burglars climbed a mechanical ladder to the second floor of the Louvre and broke into the Apollo Gallery where the royal jewels were displayed on Sunday, they essentially entered a government building housing treasures owned by the French state.\n\nMost French museums are insured, but the state acts as its own insurer for the biggest ones, including the Louvre. Private insurance was not taken out for the jewels, or for any of the Louvre’s permanent collections, said Nicolas Kaddeche, the technical director at Hiscox Assurances France, a leader in the museum insurance market.\n\nThe reason is that the premiums would be prohibitively expensive, more than the cost of investing in surveillance and maintaining a security staff, even for the Louvre, which has an in-house fire brigade.\n\nAs the world’s largest museum, the Louvre has a catalog that includes, of course, the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo and more than 35,000 works of art on display along eight miles of corridors, not to mention 500,000 additional pieces registered in its databases.\n\nInsuring such priceless works could cost billions in private insurance premiums annually. Even if the Louvre had decided to insure parts of the museum against, for example, the risk of fire, the sums would be enormous.\n\n“The Louvre represents a fairly exceptional accumulation of assets at a single address, which makes it much more complicated to insure than a smaller museum,” Mr. Kaddeche said. He added that the economics made it “more interesting for the government to take the risk and be its own insurer, which was also the case for Notre Dame.”\n\nEven though the Louvre has a history of security concerns, with tight budgets museums will always prioritize improving security measures over insurance.\n\nPeter Keller, the director-curator of the Musée de la Légion d’Honneur in Paris, said that if museums wanted to keep items safe, they could remove them from display, but that was only a short-term fix.\n\n“Everybody has to invest more,” he said. “Criminals are innovative, and we have to react and improve our security systems.”\n\nIn France, two issues are crucial when it comes to art insurance: who owns the works and where they are displayed.\n\nThe theft from the Louvre on Sunday involved pieces that the government had purchased for its national collections. That meant the crown jewels fell under the French heritage code, a national law that prohibits them from being sold, given away or transferred.\n\nThat, in turn, puts them outside the scope of traditional insurance contracts, said Irène Barnouin, the sales and technical director for art and private clients at WTW France, a brokerage firm.\n\nA similar situation exists in the United States, where the permanent collection at museums like the Smithsonian are owned by the government, which is considered the insurer of last resort. National treasures, like the Declaration of Independence, are considered priceless. Should catastrophe hit, Congress could make a special appropriation to help cover the loss.\n\nWhen any Louvre art is transported, specific insurance is required. Taking a painting or object out of its display and shipping it to another location is considered “structurally risky,” according to the French culture ministry.\n\nThe ministry had toyed with the idea of transporting the Mona Lisa to the Louvre’s sister museum in Lens, France, for three months in 2018. But when the insurance cost was estimated at nearly €35 million, the Mona Lisa stayed put in her bulletproof case.\n\nNational museums in France, as in the United States, also insure temporary exhibitions held on the premises.\n\nThe Louvre certainly lost out on the value of the crown jewels. They are irreplaceable as a symbol of French history, but the insurance money could have compensated for a replacement display, for example, or other art, Mr. Kaddeche said.\n\nBut even if the Louvre were to have recovered €88 million in insurance indemnities, “you could never have the same property,” Ms. Barnouin added, “because all the history that this property in fact carries with it is lost.”\n\nAlex Marshall contributed reporting from London.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/climate/50-states-fixes.html","dateOfPublication":"0000-01-01","timeOfPublication":"00:00:00.000Z","title":"","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article highlights a wide range of grassroots, community-driven, and innovative environmental initiatives across the United States.

2025-10-21T18:12:00-04:00\n\nKilian Jornet wanted to summit 72 of the tallest peaks in the contiguous United States. He gave himself a month to do it.\n\nMr. Jornet, 37, was just a few days into an ambitious odyssey, a self-designed project he had named “States of Elevation.” His goal was to link, by foot and by bike, the tallest peaks in the contiguous United States — a series of 70-plus publicly accessible mountains in Colorado, California and Washington known as the “14ers” because they are all 14,000 feet or higher (symbolized on the map as ). He estimated it would take him around a month.\n\nBut now, in early September, Mr. Jornet wondered whether he could continue.\n\nIt is not often that Mr. Jornet, one of the most accomplished endurance athletes on the planet, seems susceptible to human frailties. In 2017, he reached the summit of Mount Everest twice in one week, without support or supplemental oxygen. In 2023, he climbed the 177 tallest peaks in the Pyrenees in eight days. Last year, he needed just 19 days to tackle the 82 tallest peaks in the Alps.\n\nBut now, after a long flight from Norway, where he lives with his wife, Emelie Forsberg, a former skyrunning world champion, and their three young daughters, Mr. Jornet was jet-lagged and struggling to acclimate to the high altitude of the LA Freeway in Colorado, a mountainous traverse along the Continental Divide.\n\nFiguring out the correct gear was part of the puzzle when Kilian Jornet was planning his “States of Elevation” project.\n\nMaking matters worse, a steady rain left him feeling as if he were soaked through to his core.\n\n“I just felt exhausted,” Mr. Jornet recalled in a recent interview. “It felt impossible to do one more week, let alone another month. But then the body switched, and I went from fighting to adapting.”\n\nClimbing peak after peak in Colorado, he seemed to grow stronger as he moved west, through the Mojave Desert and into the Sierra Nevada, across Northern California and finally into the Cascades.\n\nA small support crew in a recreational vehicle met up with Mr. Jornet periodically while he was hiking, and followed more closely during his long bike rides. He also had a rotating cast of friends and fellow athletes who joined him for parts of the project.\n\nAnd, over the course of 31 days and 3,197 miles, he conquered a challenge in which, on any given day, he was completing a feat — or, in some cases, feats — that many climbers would consider a lifetime achievement in and of itself.\n\nA couple of days before Ryan Hall, the retired Olympic marathoner, was set to meet Mr. Jornet near Crested Butte, Colo., he checked the forecast. An avid climber, Mr. Hall was alarmed enough to send Mr. Jornet a text message asking if they really wanted to tackle the Elks Traverse in a snowstorm. Mr. Jornet was not concerned.\n\n“Yeah,” he replied via text, “we might get a little wet out there.”\n\nThe weather, though, turned out to be pleasant, and Mr. Jornet and Mr. Hall chatted throughout their 12 hours together — about their families, about training and nutrition, and even about “different levels of consciousness,” Mr. Hall said. At one point, Mr. Jornet, who is from Spain, described climbing as an out-of-body experience.\n\nMr. Jornet focuses on each step of the journey along the way, rather than talking about the enormity of the project.\n\nMr. Hall was surprised to learn that Mr. Jornet did not drink coffee. His explanation? He worries caffeine will make him push too hard and hinder his ability to recover. Mr. Hall said Mr. Jornet made no mention of feeling tired or hungry during their time together.\n\n“It was interesting to see how he managed his body and what he was putting it through,” Mr. Hall said, “and how, mentally, it wasn’t taking up any space.”\n\nMr. Hall also noticed that Mr. Jornet refrained from talking about the project. Instead, he seemed present. The only mountain that mattered was the mountain he was on. Mr. Jornet, Mr. Hall said, was “full of peace” — an impression that was reinforced when they reached Castle Peak, their fifth and final summit together. Not that Mr. Jornet was keeping track.\n\n“The peaks don’t really mean anything to me,” he told Mr. Hall. “The peaks are just an excuse to be out here.”\n\nDakota Jones, an elite trail and mountain runner, joined Mr. Jornet for his final two days of climbing in Colorado, which started with an ascent of Mount Sneffels and a 25-mile traverse through the early hours of the night.\n\nWhen Mr. Jornet awoke the next morning, he rode his bicycle several hours to the next trailhead. Mr. Jones followed Mr. Jornet’s crew in his Toyota Tacoma and prepared for the day by consuming a burrito, several doughnuts and lots of coffee.\n\n“He’s so far beyond what the rest of us can do,” Mr. Jones said of Mr. Jornet.\n\nAt around noon, they embarked on a nearly 14-hour run through the Weminuche Wilderness, a remote area of the San Juan National Forest. By the time they reached their final peak of the day, Mr. Jornet had run out of food.\n\n“He never said a word,” Mr. Jones said. “He just kept going. That’s Kilian.”\n\nMr. Jornet spent a total of 16 days in Colorado, where he made 56 summits while covering more than 1,200 miles.\n\nMr. Jornet’s climbing partners in Colorado struggled to keep up with him, even though he did not catch rides in his support vehicle, or ingest caffeine.\n\nUp close, there was nothing inherently sexy about Mr. Jornet’s quest. Day after day, hour after hour, minute after minute, he was simply putting one foot in front of the other, or pedaling one stroke at a time. Mr. Hall likened him to a “metronome,” his rhythmic movements never hurried or rushed.\n\nMr. Jones approached Mr. Jornet as if he were part of an anthropological study: What was he capable of doing next?\n\n“He has both the physiology to be great and the infinite discipline and focus to make the most of what he has,” Mr. Jones said. “And that’s a really rare combination.”\n\nAfter completing his climbs in Colorado, Mr. Jornet spent five days biking nearly 900 miles across the Mojave Desert.\n\nMr. Jornet’s discipline was clear when, after conquering Colorado, he spent five days biking nearly 900 miles across vast expanses of the Mojave Desert. He averaged about 14 hours a day in the saddle.\n\nHe was accompanied for portions of the trip by athletes like Chris Myers, a trail runner, and Gemma Arró Ribot, a former teammate on the Spanish ski mountaineer team. But Mr. Jornet also spent a great deal of time alone, and he battled boredom, fatigue and the heat by listening to music and audiobooks.\n\nMostly, though, he biked as a mode of transport, as a means to an end.\n\nOne of Mr. Jornet’s early challenges in California was Norman’s 13, a winding, 100-mile route that links all 13 of the 14,000-foot peaks in the Sierra Nevada. In search of some expertise, Mr. Jornet recruited Olivia Amber, a world-class trail runner who, about two weeks earlier, had done the route on her own.\n\nSome context: Ms. Amber, 30, described Norman’s 13 as a “dream project” that she had pieced together over several years. For even the most accomplished adventurers, the route is serious business. And when Ms. Amber completed it in 89 hours (which included four hours of sleep), she became the fourth person to ever do so — and the first woman.\n\nAnd then there was Mr. Jornet, fresh off hundreds of miles of bicycling through the desert, who intended to move through Norman’s 13 as just one part of a much larger project. It was difficult for Ms. Amber to comprehend.\n\n“He’s rewriting what’s possible in the mountains,” she said, “especially with endurance feats.”\n\nIn California, Mr. Jornet took on Norman’s 13, a route that covers 13 separate 14,000-foot peaks.\n\nOn Sept. 25, Ms. Amber was set to meet Mr. Jornet at the junction of the Taboose Pass Trail and the John Muir Trail, before their shared trek up Split Mountain. To reach him, she had to jog 12 miles while ascending 6,000 feet — and she had to do it in a hurry after receiving word that he was moving quickly.\n\n“I honestly thought he was going to beat me there,” she said. “It was crazy.”\n\nFrom the start, Ms. Amber could sense Mr. Jornet was egoless. He seemed genuinely grateful for her help. With rough weather approaching, he agreed when she suggested that he take a quick nap before leaving camp.\n\n“I wasn’t totally sure if he was committed to sleeping,” Ms. Amber recalled.\n\nEach section of Mr. Jornet’s journey would be considered a major accomplishment for most climbers.\n\nThey set out before dusk, and as they began to move through the night, heavy snow blanketed them. It was Ms. Amber’s sixth time up Split Mountain, and Mr. Jornet’s first. It hardly mattered.\n\n“He had this feel for where we were and for the terrain even though he had never been there before,” said Ms. Amber, who accompanied Mr. Jornet for 25 snow-filled miles. “I could just feel that energy from him — a confidence that came from a place of deep understanding of how to move in that kind of environment and in those conditions.”\n\nOf course, Mr. Jornet made it look easy, even when it was not. Later, after biking another 390 miles over two days into the Cascades of Northern California, he reached Mount Shasta — the 71st and penultimate peak of his project — where he was buffeted by an Arctic wind. He had to crawl the final 1,000 feet to the summit.\n\n“You need to laugh in those situations and find the way to pass through,” Mr. Jornet said.\n\nMount Shasta in California was Mr. Jornet’s 71st peak of the project.\n\nA few hours after summiting Mount Shasta, Mr. Jornet was on two wheels once again. He was joined by the triathlete Ian Murray for a 60-mile ride on crushed volcanic gravel before they slept just south of the Oregon border.\n\nMr. Jornet was by himself for the next two days as he rode 430 miles to the foot of Mount Rainier in Washington. The end was near.\n\nWhen he was planning the project, Mr. Jornet worried about being hit by a car or a truck while biking. “A lot of people were telling me it would be very dangerous,” he recalled.\n\nMr. Jornet rode through much of Oregon with the triathlete Ian Murray.\n\nHe and his team worked hard to locate the safest roads with the widest shoulders, and he found, to his surprise, that most drivers gave him ample space. He also was grateful for the company of his friends, new and old.\n\n“He clearly could have done every inch of this on his own and he would have been totally fine and totally happy,” Ms. Amber said. “But he had this deeper appreciation that people showed up for him and were willing to help him.”\n\nMr. Jornet wanted to share the experience with those who joined him for portions of it — and with the wider world. Mr. Hall, for example, laughed whenever Mr. Jornet broke out his selfie stick. It was important to Mr. Jornet that he and his team use social media — Mr. Jornet has nearly two million followers on Instagram — to convey the beauty of the natural world and the importance of protecting it.\n\nDuring his travels, Mr. Jornet saw moose, coyotes, goats, eagles, snakes and even a couple of bears from a distance. None bothered him, he said.\n\n“We would look at each other,” Mr. Jornet said, “and say: ‘Hey, guys! How are you doing?’ And just continue.”\n\nMr. Jornet started up Mount Rainier at dawn on Oct. 3, and it was a final test worthy of the project — a 29-mile haul up 14,320 vertical feet before he reached the summit. About 17 hours after he had set out that morning, he returned to the trailhead where his support team was waiting with celebratory slices of pizza and pickle juice shots.\n\nAfter 31 days and 72 summits, Mr. Jornet’s objectively absurd project was complete. He covered 629 miles on foot and biked an additional 2,568 miles, which outdistanced this year’s Tour de France by more than 400 miles. And he did all that while amassing 403,691 feet of elevation gain.\n\nMr. Jornet closed out the project with one final test: a 29-mile climb up Mount Rainier that involved 14,320 feet of elevation gain.\n\nThroughout the project, Mr. Jornet wore a smartwatch that tracked his heart rate, his mileage, his sleep totals (he averaged about six hours a night) and even something called his “recovery score,” which registered zero — yes, zero — for 17 consecutive days. (At one point, he broke his cellphone, and members of his team questioned whether he had done it on purpose.)\n\nMr. Jornet estimated that he had burned about 9,000 calories a day, but he managed not to lose any weight. One of his secret weapons: flasks of olive oil that he guzzled raw. By the end of his journey, he was looking forward to homegrown produce from his garden and thick slices of his wife’s sourdough bread.\n\nThe day after summiting Mount Rainier, Mr. Jornet awoke feeling disoriented. His first instinct, he said, was to reach for his bike: Didn’t he have more miles ahead of him? No, he realized, it was over. He slept more peacefully the next night.\n\nHis trek through the Alps last summer, while less physically demanding, had left him mentally drained because so many of the climbs were so challenging. His jaunt through the American West was a comparative breeze.\n\n“It was just fun,” he said. “It was nice to ride and to run and to see the things and just to enjoy those places. And I could have gone on. I was happy to finish and go home, but physically it felt like my body was ready to continue.”\n\nFor now, Mr. Jornet plans to take a break and spend time with his family.\n\n“But I know myself,” he said, “and I know in a couple of months that I will start to think of something else.”\n\n"}]}
