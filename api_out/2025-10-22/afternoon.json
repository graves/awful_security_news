lifeline to Argentina a ‘mission-critical’ function of Treasury during shutdown \n       \n  By Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Finalizing a $20 billion lifeline for Argentina using taxpayers’ funds during the government shutdown was an essential action for the agency, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  His remarks came in response to a letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, who wrote to Bessent a week prior requesting an explanation as to why the Treasury Department was working on the Argentinian lifeline during a shutdown of the federal government that has restrained resources.\n \n\n   \n  “We have been forced to prioritize mission-critical efforts necessary to the discharge of the President’s constitutional duties — including national security and global financial stability,” Bessent wrote to Warren, in a letter the senator shared exclusively with CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The $20 billion lifeline framework Bessent  announced earlier this month  is known as a “currency swap,” which gives Argentina’s central bank the ability to exchange pesos for US dollars with the Treasury. Doing so can help stabilize its financial markets by injecting more liquidity. Effectively, though, it’s a loan from the US government.\n \n\n   \n  The Argentine peso has significantly devalued against other currencies since President Javier Milei, a close ally of President Donald Trump, suffered major defeats in local elections, raising doubts that he’ll hold on to his legislative majority in midterm elections later this month. Trump said last week future efforts to boost the Argentine economy would be contingent on the election results.\n \n\n   \n  But on top of questions Trump has faced on the rationale for an economic rescue of the South American country, a looming concern is whether the efforts have been successful.\n \n\n   \n  While the Argentine peso initially rose following Bessent’s announcement, the currency set a fresh low earlier this week, suggesting more work could be needed to stabilize it.\n \n\n   \n  Warren also questioned Treasury’s plans to work with private-sector banks to generate a $20 billion loan to Argentina on top of the $20 billion rescue package from the government.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent, in his response, did not directly address her questions regarding private-sector involvement. The Treasury Department didn’t respond to CNN’s inquiry.\n \n\n   \n  Bessent has spent much of this week meeting with foreign finance ministers in Malaysia. Last week, Bessent said he’d be meeting with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia, as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have recently escalated.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/us/los-angeles-immigration-us-marshal-injured","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:43:00-04:00","title":"US Marshal and Undocumented Immigrant Injured in ICE Stop in Los Angeles","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A federal marshal and undocumented immigrant Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a popular TikTok streamer known as Richard LA, were injured during an ICE enforcement operation in South Los Angeles on October 22, 2025.

Copeland began her dance career in California as a 13-year-old (considered late, by ballet standards), eventually becoming a member in the ABT’s corps de ballet in 2001 at the age of 18.

The   New York-based ABT, founded in 1939, is considered one of the premier classical ballet companies in the US.\n \n\n   \n  “Misty Copeland’s influence reaches far beyond her extraordinary performances,” said Susan Jaffe, artistic director for the American Ballet Theatre, in a statement. “On stage, she broke barriers and redefined what it means to be a ballerina, inspiring generations with her artistry, strength, and grace. Off stage, she has used her voice to open doors and expand access to ballet and the arts. Her impact is still being defined, but there is no question it will be felt for decades to come.”\n \n\n   \n  On stage, she was “magnetic,” said Sarah L. Kaufman, Pulitzer Prize-winning dance critic and author of “Verb Your Enthusiasm.” Not only did Copeland have the classic ballerina dimensions — the hyper-extended legs, the flexibly arched feet, the long neck — she also had a “liveliness” to her movements. Audiences could see the passion and the warmth on her face, Kaufman said.\n \n\n   \n  That expressiveness became a distinct characteristic of Copeland’s, but as the ballet world has shifted to prize the more extreme technical qualities of the dance form,   such human personal expression   has become a lost art.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s very small, she’s petite, but onstage she just unfolds into this large scale presence,” Kaufman said. “She was the kind of dancer you could not take your eyes off of, long before she became a principal.”\n \n\n   \n    Breaking barriers in her art\n \n\n   \n  In an genre where uniformity is prized, Copeland — once called the  “Jackie Robinson of ballet”  — has spoken about the difficulties she faced as a Black woman in ballet. There were times she wasn’t cast in roles out of concerns she would ruin the piece’s aesthetic, or was told she should lighten her skin. For the first decade of her career, Copeland  told CNN last year , she was the only Black dancer   out of about 100 in the company.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve experienced difficulties being a Black woman when you stand out, especially in the corps de ballet when it’s supposed to look uniform, and everyone kind of in the same tones wearing pink tights, which represent the color of your skin,” Copeland said. “And that wasn’t always the case.”\n \n\n   \n  But Copeland’s rise through the ranks came at a critical time for Black ballerinas. The Dance Theatre of Harlem — one of the only ballet companies in the world whose mission is to specifically train and highlight ballerinas of color — went on hiatus due to financial difficulties from 2004 to 2012. Its closure left a gap in the ballet world, said Theresa Ruth Howard, founder of MobBallet, an organization dedicated to preserving Black ballet history. There weren’t many Black dancers at other companies; with the DTH’s hiatus, the number across the board dwindled.\n \n\n   \n  Simultaneously, Copeland was generating buzz as a soloist at ABT. She appeared in a music video with Prince in 2009, and joined the singer on tour in 2011. Later, in 2014, she went on to publish a best-selling memoir and guest judge on the competition show, “So You Think You Can Dance?” Once she was promoted to principal, her fame drove a surge of interest and ticket sales. Kaufman recalls, ahead of a performance of “Romeo and Juliet” at the Wolf Trap performing arts center in Virginia, traffic was “backed up to the exit ramp of   the Beltway” of Washington DC.\n \n\n   \n  Her ascension, particularly at a time when Black ballerinas were so sparse, Howard said, emphasized the larger conversation around the lack of diversity in the ballet world.\n \n\n   \n  “When we see this young, mixed-race woman climbing the ranks as a possibility, that is almost like a lightning rod,” Howard said. “She’s talented; people are excited about her. And so therefore it becomes the thing that draws the attention. She becomes this catalyst for her ascension, but also for a larger conversation.”\n \n\n   \n  For example, in a 2023  viral TikTok video , Copeland showed how, despite her fame, she had to color her pair of baby pink pointe shoes with a sponge and foundation so the shoes matched her skin tone. She later started a  petition  called, “Let’s Make a Pointe!” to push Apple to offer different skin shades for its pointe shoe emoji. The lack of diversity both in the emoji and in real life was a “constant reminder of the subtle ways dancers of color have not been included,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond racial diversity, Copeland also aims to make ballet more affordable and accessible through efforts like the Misty Copeland Foundation.\n \n\n   \n  The impact Copeland’s presence has had on the ballet world is seen, now, in the swelling number of Black ballerinas across the country. India Bradley, who was just promoted to a soloist at the New York City Ballet this month, is the first Black woman to earn that distinction in the company’s history.\n \n\n   \n  “(Copeland) has completely left a snail trail for us to glide down a lot easier than the women before her,” Bradley said.\n \n\n   \n  By becoming such a household name and making such a storm, Copeland opened the eyes of those leading big companies, Bradley said — forcing them to actually consider Black ballerinas in their companies.\n \n\n   \n  “People don’t think of Black women in a way where we are an option to be soloists and principals and higher ranks in these companies,” Bradley said. “I genuinely just — before Misty — don’t think that they thought of us in that way. And I think that she forced it to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  And yet there is still more work to be done. There has never been a Black woman principal dancer at Bradley’s New York City Ballet. At the ABT, Copeland remains the only Black woman among both principals and soloists. At the Paris Opera, there is only one Black ballerina in their highest rank.\n \n\n   \n  The hope is that eventually there are no more “firsts,” Bradley said; that young girls can dance without feeling that type of pressure, just like every other ballerina.\n \n\n   \n  Copeland’s farewell is as much a goodbye as it is a thank you.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us just love her,” Bradley said. “And she deserves every single flower that she’s getting.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/sununu-new-hampshire-gop-senate-campaign","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"09:04:00-04:00","title":"Former Sen.

John E. Sununu enters GOP primary race in New Hampshire for the seat he lost in 2008 \n       \n  Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:04 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  New Hampshire Republican John E. Sununu announced a campaign for US Senate on Wednesday, hoping to reclaim a seat he lost nearly two decades ago and boosting the GOP’s chances of regaining a foothold in a region overwhelmingly represented by Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu, 61, is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated by  US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , a Democrat who ousted him in 2008. His decision sets up a primary featuring two former senators: Republican Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and losing to Shaheen in 2014, has been running since June.\n \n\n   \n  “Maybe you’re surprised to hear that I’m running for the Senate again. I’m a bit surprised myself,” Sununu said in a video announcement. “Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now? Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.”\n \n\n   \n  National Republicans consider Sununu a strong candidate and one that allows them to go on the offensive as they look to hold their majority in the chamber next year.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage, are defending seats in Ohio, Maine and North Carolina against a slate of high-profile Democratic candidates. But Republicans are also on the offensive in places like Michigan, Georgia and now, increasingly, New Hampshire — and if they flip one of those seats it will likely put the chamber out of reach for Democrats until at least 2028.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu must first win the primary though, and his past opposition to President Donald Trump could be problematic. While Brown has aligned himself closely with Trump and served as his US ambassador to New Zealand, Sununu backed Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, writing an op-ed calling Trump a “loser.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump went on to win New Hampshire’s leadoff primary, but the state’s voters rejected him for a third time in the general election. And while Republicans control the Statehouse and governor’s office, Democrats have held all four of New Hampshire’s congressional seats since 2017.\n \n\n   \n  Sununu served three terms in the US House before being elected to the Senate at age 38. He was the chamber’s youngest member throughout his term, a fact he emphasized in a 2008 campaign ad that showed him sprinting up a steep mountain path.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s younger, faster, quicker,” a deep-voiced (and somewhat redundant) narrator intones. “Inexhaustible. Tireless. Energetic.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s now the same age Shaheen was when she defeated him and is 16 years older than US Rep. Chris Pappas, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Sununu said Congress has become “loud, dysfunctional, even angry” in his time away, but said he hopes to return “to help calm the waters,” while focusing on the economy, veterans, health care costs and Social Security.\n \n\n   \n  Pappas’ campaign countered that he is the one who has been fighting to lower costs for working families, seniors and small businesses while Sununu has spent years “cashing in and making millions selling out to corporations and working for special interests.”\n \n\n   \n  “Chris Pappas will stand up to corporate special interests and take on anyone to do what is best for New Hampshire, and that’s why Granite Staters will elect him to the US Senate next November,” campaign manager Rachel Petri said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Though Sununu has long been out of office, his name recognition remains high due to his family’s political prominence. His father, John H. Sununu, is a former governor and former White House chief of staff. One of his brothers,  Chris Sununu, served four terms as governor  and flirted with a Senate campaign of his own in 2021. He also shot down a bid this cycle, saying he had spoken to the White House but opted against it.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/economy/weight-loss-drugs-kff-employer-survey","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:10:00-04:00","title":"More and more workers are using weight loss drugs.

It’s costing their employers a fortune \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:10 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Weight loss drugs are proving to be super popular among many workers with job-based health insurance. But GLP-1 medications are busting their employers’ budgets, leading some firms to rethink their coverage.\n \n\n   \n  The share of very large firms covering these drugs for obesity soared to 43% this year, up from 28% last year, according to KFF’s latest annual  Employer Health Benefits Survey , which was released on Wednesday. These employers, who have more than 5,000 workers, are much more likely than their smaller counterparts to offer such a benefit.\n \n\n   \n  Among firms with between 200 and 999 staffers, only 16% provide coverage of drugs for weight loss this year, the same as last year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 drugs, which treat diabetes, obesity and certain other conditions, have been in great demand since they came on the market a few years ago because they help patients shed pounds. While employers typically cover the medications for diabetes, fewer of them do so for weight loss, in part because of the drugs’ high prices — which have also  limited Americans’ access  to them. The list price of Wegovy, for instance, is about $1,350 for a month’s supply, though discounts are available.\n \n\n   \n  Employers, however, recognize that covering the medications for weight loss is a valuable benefit to attract and retain talented staffers. Notably, even among firms that don’t do so, nearly half said the benefit is “very important” or “important” for employee satisfaction. More than 36 million people with job-based insurance have a body mass index that would medically qualify them for a GLP-1 drug.\n \n\n   \n  “Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” Gary Claxton, KFF senior vice president, said in a statement. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”\n \n\n   \n  Costs are higher than forecast because more workers are taking advantage of the benefit, KFF found. Nearly 60% of large firms said usage of the medications for weight loss is higher than they predicted, while two-thirds of such employers said the impact on their prescription drug spending was “significant.”\n \n\n   \n  One employer KFF surveyed found that it spent more on GLP-1 medications than any other drug this year, up from 32 nd  place last year.\n \n\n   \n  A large retailer told KFF, “Before we knew it, we spent half a million dollars and we’re projected to go up to $1.2 million the following year.”\n \n\n   \n  The high costs of GLP-1 drugs have long been a source of frustration for many Americans. President Donald Trump set off a kerfuffle last week when he said that the  medications  would soon be available for $150, prompting Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, to step in and say negotiations are ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  Many employers told KFF they were looking at reducing coverage of the drugs through steps such as limiting eligibility to those with higher body mass indexes or requiring workers to participate in weight management programs.\n \n\n   \n  “You have to have a coach, and then you can only stay on it for a certain amount of time before you have to get reevaluated,” one large manufacturer told KFF.\n \n\n   \n  Other firms told KFF they have decided to drop the benefit for weight loss.\n \n\n   \n  However, employers will likely have to reconsider their coverage again in coming years, especially as more workers demand coverage, and the drugs are approved for even more medical conditions. Plus, prices coming down.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re still writing the story of what GLP-1 coverage looks like in employer plans,” said Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF.\n \n\n   \n    Rising premiums\n \n\n   \n  GLP-1 drug costs – and prescription drug prices in general – are also contributing to a rise in premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Annual insurance coverage for a family hit $27,000, on average, this year, up 6% from 2024, according to KFF’s survey. Workers contribute $6,850 toward the cost, on average, while employers pick up the rest of the tab.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, individual coverage topped $9,300, on average, this year, up 5% – with employees shouldering $1,440 of the cost and employers paying the rest.\n \n\n   \n  Over the past five years, the growth in premiums has been largely in line with inflation and wage increases.\n \n\n   \n  But  coverage for 2026  could be much pricier, according to several benefits consulting firms. KFF also points to GLP-1 medications, hospital prices and tariffs as factors that could push up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers next year.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a quiet alarm bell going off,” Drew Altman, KFF’s CEO, said in a statement. “Employers have nothing new in their arsenal that can address most of the drivers of their cost increases, and that could well result in an increase in deductibles and other forms of employee cost sharing again, a strategy that neither employers nor employees like but companies resort to in a pinch to hold down premium increases.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/jeff-merkley-senate-floor-speech","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"09:06:00-04:00","title":"Democratic Senator Protests Trump’s ‘Grave Threats’ in Marathon Overnight Floor Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon delivered a 12+ hour marathon speech on the U.S. Senate floor to protest President Donald Trump’s actions, which he claims threaten democracy.

overnight floor speech \n       \n  By Rashard Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:06 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon has been speaking on the Senate floor for more than 12 hours after announcing he would protest what he called President Donald Trump’s “grave threats to democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  He began his remarks at 6:24 p.m. ET Tuesday and was still speaking as of Wednesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells. We’re in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution,” Merkley said in his opening remarks.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic senator pointed to the Trump administration’s previous  halting of research grants  for universities in its battle over campus oversight as well as the  recent indictments  of several of the president’s political opponents as well as his push to deploy National Guard troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots. Because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there’s a rebellion. And if there’s a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation,” Merkley said.\n \n\n   \n  Early on Wednesday, the senator condemned the tactics of federal law enforcement against protesters outside of an immigration detention facility in Portland, and in other cities that are seeing a surge of immigration enforcement.\n \n\n   \n  His comments on the situation in Oregon come after  an appeals court  on Monday cleared the way for Trump to deploy troops there after a previous, Trump-appointed federal judge blocked his first efforts to do so.\n \n\n   \n  “This is an extraordinarily dangerous moment,” Merkley added Wednesday morning. “An authoritarian president proceeding to attack free speech, attack free press, weaponize the Department of Justice, and use it against those who disagree with him, and then seeking the court’s permission to send the military into our cities to attack people who are peaceful(ly) protesting.”\n \n\n   \n  The senator’s remarks represent a symbolic show of Democratic resistance as the party has blocked Republican efforts to reopen the government 11 times, remaining in a standoff over health care subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown is expected to drag on Wednesday as the impasse enters a fourth week.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Democratic  Sen. Cory Booker  of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, warning against the harms he said the administration was inflicting on the American public. The effort broke the record for the longest floor speech in modern history of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  This was also not Merkley’s first time holding the Senate floor – he previously spoke for more than 15 hours in 2017  against Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court .\n \n\n   \n  In recent years, the chamber has seen a number of marathon speeches mounted by senators of both parties, including Sens. Chris  Murphy  on gun control in 2016;  Rand Paul  over National Security Agency surveillance programs in 2015; and  Ted Cruz  against the Affordable Care Act 2013.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Michael Williams contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/football-nfl-russell-wilson-sean-payton-criticism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:41:00-04:00","title":"New York Giants QB Russell Wilson labels former coach Sean Payton ‘classless’ after post-game comments","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following a 33-32 victory over the New York Giants, Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton praised rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, suggesting that the team's change in starting quarterback was a positive development.

CNN\n \n   \n  Giants  quarterback  Russell Wilson called his former head coach Sean Payton “classless” following comments he made after the Denver Broncos’  33-32 victory  over New York on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “Classless… but not surprised… Didn’t realize you’re still bounty hunting 15+ years later through the media,” Wilson  wrote on X  followed by some laughing emojis and the hashtag #LetsRide, a catchphrase he became known for during his time with the Broncos between 2022 and 2023.\n \n\n   \n  New York’s backup quarterback was perceived to be responding to comments made by Denver head coach Payton after the Broncos’ dramatic fourth quarter comeback to beat the Giants on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “They found a little spark with that quarterback,”  said Payton , referring to rookie passer Jaxson Dart who replaced Wilson as the Giants’ starter after the team began the season 0-3.\n \n\n   \n  “I was talking to John Mara not too long ago and I said: ‘We were hoping that that change would’ve happened long after our game,’” Payton added.\n \n\n   \n  Wilson responded by referring to the “Bountygate” scandal which involved Payton’s New Orleans Saints using a  bounty system  between the 2009 and 2011 seasons where players were paid bonuses for, among other things, hard hits and deliberately injuring opposing players.\n \n\n   \n  In 2012, Payton was suspended for one year without pay after the NFL found that he was aware of the bounty system and, though not directly involved with it, had done nothing to shut it down.\n \n\n   \n  The squabbling between Wilson and Payton reflects a lingering tension between the two which was born from their time in the Mile High City together.\n \n\n   \n  The Broncos went an underwhelming 11-19 in Wilson’s starts over two seasons, failing to make the playoffs in either of them.\n \n\n   \n  Despite throwing for over 3,000 yards with 26 touchdowns during the 2023 season, Wilson was benched after the first 15 games and eventually released in the offseason – with the Broncos taking on a reported  $85 million  in dead salary cap.\n \n\n   \n  The decision came amid an injury guarantee in the then 35-year-old’s contract that assured him $37 million if he could not pass a physical on the fifth day of the new league year in March 2024.\n \n\n   \n  By benching Wilson, Denver made sure that he couldn’t get injured and was consequently able to save money on his release.\n \n\n   \n   Speaking to reporters  at the time, Wilson said he was approached by the team after the Broncos’ Week 8 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs and told if he didn’t move back his injury guarantee in his contract that he’d be benched.\n \n\n   \n  “We beat the Chiefs. They came up to me at the beginning of the bye week – Monday or Tuesday – and told me that if I didn’t change my contract, my injury guarantee, that I’d be benched for the rest of the year … I was definitely disappointed about it,” said Wilson.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t going to take away injury guarantees,” he said. “This game is such a physical game. I’ve played for 12 years and that matters to me.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/europe/russia-air-attack-kyiv-ukraine-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"Deadly Russian air attacks force power cuts across Ukraine, as Trump-Putin summit shelved","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia launched a large-scale air attack on Ukraine, using drones, missiles, and fighter jets, targeting cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv, killing at least six people and injuring over 30.

Trump said later he didn’t want the summit to be “a waste of time,” despite the US president saying last week the two leaders would be meeting in Budapest, Hungary, “within two weeks or so, pretty quick.”\n \n\n   \n  Despite Trump’s comments on Tuesday, Moscow said the following day that preparations were continuing.\n \n\n   \n  “Preparations for the summit are ongoing.

Jesse Jackson Sr., a civil rights leader and political outsider, ran for president in two groundbreaking campaigns that changed American politics. A son of the segregated South who went from nothing to eventually becoming one of the most well-known public figures in America, Jackson’s outsider political campaigns challenged the Democratic Party to reform its nominating process, more equitably include women and non-white voters, and appeal to Americans on a platform of economic populism. \n \n\n   \n   In 1984, Jackson lost the nomination but started a movement he called the “Rainbow Coalition.” By 1988, Jackson was a force to be reckoned with. This time, he faced a crowded primary of established political hands. The race, led by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, was heated from the beginning. Jackson, a polarizing but outsized figure, was a magnet for media attention. In both 1984 and 1988, Jackson appealed to Black voters in the South, who formed a critical voting bloc in the Democratic primary. But this time, his appeal among white voters was growing as well. In March 1988, Jackson came from behind to win the Michigan Democratic caucuses and set off a panic in his party. For the first time, the party and Jackson himself, began contemplating: What would happen if he became the Democratic nominee for president? \n \n\n   \n   Below is an excerpt from Abby Phillip’s  new book , “A Dream Deferred,” which publishes on October 28.  \n \n\n   \n  Jesse Jackson convened half a dozen of his closest advisers in his Chicago home. For the first time, he was beginning to lay out what he would have to do to build an actual presidency if he were to become the nominee.\n \n\n   \n  There was plenty of fear, too. In his own mind, the gravity of the presidency — or the potential of it — descended on him all at once. This was the same man who wore a bulletproof jacket provided to him by the Secret Service as a matter of course during both his campaigns. But for the first time, he was discussing with his closest aides what they would do about cabinet positions and White House appointments.\n \n\n   \n  “He was seriously thinking for the first time, ‘Wait a second, this could be doable,’” recalled campaign manager Jerry Austin, a white Jewish man from New York  with a long history of political campaigns in the heartland.\n \n\n   \n  “By that time, we had some momentum, and the issues that we raised were resonating,” Jackson said. “Our issues were on time, issues about economic justice and shared economic security, a connection between family farms and urban workers, how blacks and whites had to relate together, and browns. So, it was in full gear. We used to call it ‘poor campaign, rich message.’ Our message was winning.”\n \n\n   \n  A similar realization had come to Democratic Party officials, who watched in shock as Jackson beat Dukakis 2–1 in a key industrial midwestern state. The Michigan victory also would, potentially briefly, leave Jackson with an outright delegate lead — a nightmare scenario for some in the party. “The party is up against an extraordinary endgame,” Democratic pollster Paul Maslin told The New York Times. “If this guy has more convention votes than anyone else, how can we not nominate him? But how can we nominate him?”\n \n\n   \n  Others were blunter, though unwilling to put their names on the record. They whispered about denying Jackson the nomination if he entered the convention with the most delegates. “I’m not saying that he can do that,” one anonymous party veteran told the Times. “But if he could, we would be in an impossible situation. We’d have the choice of turning our backs on Jesse, and alienating the Blacks, or nominating him and almost certainly losing in November.”\n \n\n   \n  The Dukakis campaign  was suddenly under the microscope. The Massachusetts governor had plenty going for him organizationally, but almost nothing that gripped the hearts of primary voters. “We must acknowledge the strength of Jackson’s message,” one of Dukakis’s supporters, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, said. On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers were skeptical about Dukakis the man and the uninspiring campaign he was running. Even if they wanted to “stop Jackson,” they were trapped. They were deathly afraid of being called racist for opposing a Black candidate but were convinced that if Jackson were the nominee, the Republicans would run away with the race in historic fashion.\n \n\n   \n    ‘They were buying into his campaign’\n \n\n   \n  The relationship between Jackson and Austin, his campaign manager, had been cordial but uneasy until this point. Unlike many people around Jackson, Austin was not a longtime loyalist. Yet the victory in Michigan seemed to act as a pressure valve releasing some of the distrust Jackson may have felt for Austin—at least temporarily.\n \n\n   \n  The campaign finally seemed to be getting its footing. With Austin’s arrival and a more sophisticated finance team being brought on, Jackson was well positioned to take advantage of the financial windfalls that came from his better-than-expected performance on Super Tuesday. He was continuing to run, by far, the leanest of the campaigns still in the field. But the sudden uptick in fundraising among smaller donations and larger checks caught the attention of his rivals. The campaign began using mail solicitations to fundraise. And with each campaign victory, raising money from wealthy donors became easier.\n \n\n   \n  On that front, Jackson was playing catch-up with the other, more establishment candidates in the race. But where none of them could touch his candidacy was with his small-dollar appeal. It was one of the great gifts Jackson had, taken straight from the pulpit. At rallies and campaign events in churches and high school gyms, the ask would start at a thousand dollars. Could anyone spare a thousand? Not one hand in the room went up—nor did Jackson expect that any would. The ask then went down to five hundred, then to fifty, then twenty and ten, until virtually every hand in the room was raised and people put what they had into the collection hat.\n \n\n   \n  “Afterward, I said to him, ‘Why do you start asking for a thousand? There’s nobody in this church with a thousand dollars,’” Austin recalled. “And he said, ‘When I get to “Who will give me something?” everybody would give me something.’”\n \n\n   \n  “They were buying into his campaign,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n    Tranquilizing the establishment\n \n\n   \n  It was past time for Jackson to begin to calm the nerves of the party establishment in Washington. With the help of former DNC chairman John C. White and Bert Lance, former budget director for President Jimmy Carter, the campaign gathered around thirty-five Democrats representing a cross section of fundraisers, party officials, and tastemakers in a ballroom at the Jefferson Hotel in DC. Jackson worked the room. The aim was to “raise the comfort level” of party officials. One attendee called it a “tranquilizer” for the Democratic Party chattering class.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of those kinds of people wind up making up public opinion in a very small subset,” said Ann Lewis. “This was about, at the most basic level, relieving people’s anxiety because I consistently thought Jesse had been so underestimated and not quite caricatured, but unfairly portrayed by the press. … And for people to see him as he really was, which was this smart, thoughtful guy and someone who really wanted the Democratic Party to succeed. They didn’t know that.”\n \n\n   \n  Jackson was buoyant as he went into Wisconsin ahead of its April 5 primary. The crowds seemed to validate the growing interest in his candidacy. He and his campaign were confident that he could appeal to the state’s college towns and urban communities. Jackson had high hopes for the state, where his rallies had been enthusiastically received even in white farming communities.\n \n\n   \n  They held a rally on the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Paul Wellstone, who would later become a progressive US senator from Minnesota, was Jackson’s state director there. A crowd nearly the size of the town’s population of 2,800 showed up in rural Amery, Wisconsin, to hear Jackson speak. As they gathered on the Blu-Fay dairy farm, there was almost as much appreciation for Jackson showing up there as for his message. “The truly impressive thing is here’s a Black man coming up to rural Wisconsin, to a community where all the Blacks could fill that barn, and there would still be a lot of room,” said Skip Shireman, a 61-year-old retired schoolteacher.\n \n\n   \n  There was interest, no doubt, in Jackson’s candidacy and message, but the campaign was ill-equipped to capture that curiosity and transform it into votes. There were memorable messages, to be sure — “We will choose farms over arms in this generation” — but Jackson was characteristically short on specifics. If anything, his candidacy was beginning to be a repository for disenchantment with the rest of the Democratic field. “The man has something to say,” said Bob Jahnke, an electric plant worker who came out to see Jackson. “We had (US Rep. Dick) Gephardt and Dukakis here last Saturday. Gephardt had somewhat of a message, but Dukakis didn’t say much.”\n \n\n   \n  In more moderate La Crosse, old party hands who had thrown their support behind Dukakis or Gore found discord in their own homes. “My mother is voting for Jesse Jackson, my sister is voting for Jesse Jackson,” a state representative who had thrown his hat in for Gore told a reporter. “I can’t even convince my own family to vote for Al Gore.”\n \n\n   \n  The energy around Jackson’s candidacy was unmistakable and set his opponents’ more traditional campaigns in stark relief. As the April 5 primary approached, Dukakis was feeling the pressure to better define himself and his candidacy in the minds of uninspired voters. “I have no interest in being known as the Great Communicator,” he said. “I want to be known as the Great Builder. I want to make the American dream come alive again.” \n \n\n   \n    Electability concerns win out\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s growing populist appeal was rising just as rapidly as the panic among establishment Democrats and the party faithful. A U.S. News & World Report poll put a Jackson-led presidential ticket far behind Vice President George H.W. Bush in a general election. Meanwhile, a Dukakis-led ticket with Jackson as vice president would narrowly beat Bush. The survey quantified persistent reservations among the electorate about Jackson’s candidacy. Those two forces came crashing together in spectacular fashion on Election Night in Wisconsin.\n \n\n   \n  Thanks to Michigan, the expectations were sky high for Jackson. Austin’s strategy banked on defying expectations by overperforming among white voters in a state where Jackson could not necessarily rely on a large Black vote for credibility. But the Michigan victory changed all that. It refocused attention in the media on the question of “electability” and set victory as the standard that Jackson had to meet.\n \n\n   \n  By Election Day, the tides had turned, and Dukakis pulled out a decisive victory.\n \n\n   \n  “We got creamed,” Austin said.\n \n\n   \n  Instead of securing an easy victory that his large, enthusiastic crowds suggested, Jackson finished second. In a poll around the primary, about a third of primary voters said management skills and the candidate’s experience were the main factors that determined their vote—and that group overwhelmingly supported Dukakis.\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin was “the end of the hope that you might actually have this miracle take place,” Borosage said. Dukakis’s message of “competence not charisma” worked. Jackson performed better with white voters, but any momentum he was hoping for after Michigan was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “In Wisconsin there were people who would have voted for Jesse but didn’t want him to be the nominee because they didn’t think he could win,” Austin said. “Dukakis was a safe haven.”\n \n\n   \n   Despite a groundswell of grassroots support for Jackson’s insurgent campaign, it was never matched by elected Democrats and party leaders. Jackson finished second to Dukakis in the 1988 primary but secured leverage at the Democratic National Convention. He used it to push through a series of changes to the Democratic Party’s platform and rules, including one that would become pivotal in another primary where a Black candidate, Barack Obama, sought the nomination against a more establishment figure. Jackson hoped that he would be considered seriously as running mate to Dukakis. The two men and their wives met at Dukakis’ Brookline, Massachusetts, home in the lead-up to the convention. But ultimately, Dukakis chose a white Southerner, Sen.  Lloyd Bentsen  of Texas. After a sharply negative general election campaign against Vice President George H.W. Bush, Dukakis lost in an electoral landslide. \n \n\n   \n   The headline on this story has been updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/car-payments-late-default-subprime","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:30","title":"A significant group of Americans are falling behind on their car payments - an economic warning sign","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A significant increase in car loan delinquency among subprime borrowers—those with credit scores below 670—is signaling a deepening economic crisis in the United States.

payments - an economic warning sign \n       \n  By Matt Egan, Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:46 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A key group of American borrowers is falling significantly behind on their car loans. It’s yet another sign that the US economy is forming some serious cracks, leaving the most vulnerable in financial distress.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage of subprime borrowers – those with credit scores below 670 – who are at least 60 days late on their car loans has doubled since 2021 to 6.43%, according to Fitch Ratings. That’s worse than during the past three recessions – during the Covid pandemic, the Great Recession or the dot-com bust.\n \n\n   \n  America’s current subprime delinquency rate is at the second-highest level since the early 1990s. The only time it was higher: this past January. Cars are being repossessed at the highest rate since the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a disturbing trend to economists: Car loans are typically the last payments that Americans are willing to miss. They’re too important to their lives: Cars are essential tools to get to work, drive families and access food.\n \n\n   \n    No room for error\n \n\n   \n   Record car prices  and  high interest rates , combined with other  inflationary pressures , have sent average auto payments to record levels and have put significant stress on car owners.\n \n\n   \n  Although the financial stress on subprime car borrowers has stabilized in 2025 after large increases in late payments and repossessions over the past two years, economists fear what might happen if the  labor market  grows considerably weaker and layoffs become more common.\n \n\n   \n  For subprime borrowers, the default rate – those whose cars have been or are about to be repossessed – which stood at nearly 10% in September, according to Cox Automotive data. That’s down from a year ago but above the long-term average.\n \n\n   \n  Those borrowers often have no choice but to default. They can’t sell their cars because they owe so much more than it is worth. They often have already missed payments on other obligations, such as mortgage payments or rent, as well as payments due on credit cards and student loans.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no room for error,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.\n \n\n   \n    Surging costs\n \n\n   \n  Just over half of new car leases and more than three-quarters of new car loans made in the second quarter had monthly payments of $500 or more, and 46% of used car loans have payments of $500 or above, according to Experian. For new car loans, more than 17% have payments of more than $1,000.\n \n\n   \n  Repair costs have also surged – at a time when many are holding onto their cars for longer to avoid splurging on a new one. Motor vehicle  repair costs surged 15%  year-over-year in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s the most in nearly two years. And repair costs increased 5% between July and August, the biggest monthly increase on record.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, car insurance rates have increased significantly since the pandemic. In August, car insurance rose by the smallest annual rate in three years – but that still amounted to a hefty near-5% jump, well above the overall inflation rate.\n \n\n   \n    Consumer pain\n \n\n   \n  The increased costs of owning and maintaining a car aren’t happening in a vacuum: They’re taking place after years of rising prices at the supermarket and across the economy. And two years ago, many  student loan payments  that were paused during the pandemic became due again. A year ago, delinquent student loan payments started counting against credit scores again, pushing some borrowers into lower credit ratings that could raise the rates they were charged on other loans, including car loans.\n \n\n   \n  Elevated subprime delinquency rates demonstrate how beneath the surface of blockbuster stock market returns and strong overall economic growth, many consumers are hurting.\n \n\n   \n  Tellingly, Americans with stronger credit scores don’t appear to be struggling to make car payments. The delinquency rate among prime borrowers has increased significantly but remains very low at less than 0.5%.\n \n\n   \n  “There are no alarm bells going off for prime borrowers,” said Rod Chadehumbe, chief asset backed securities strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  The wide gap between delinquency rates of prime and subprime borrowers is another reminder of the so called K-shaped economy: Many Americans who have money in the stock market and own increasingly valuable homes are doing well and spending aggressively, but many others, especially lower-income consumers, are struggling to stay afloat.\n \n\n   \n  A number of lenders who specialize in subprime car loans expect a growing percentage of their clients to default and have their car repossessed, said Pamela Foohey, a law professor at the University of Georgia and an expert in both auto finance and bankruptcies.\n \n\n   \n  The repo business has been quite active lately. Subprime lenders build GPS features into cars to make it easier for teams repossessing the vehicles to find them, she said. The lenders can even disable the ignition of the cars to prevent owners from driving them once they’ve defaulted on the loan.\n \n\n   \n  “The (repo) numbers indicate it’s probably close to the Great Recession in volume,” said George Badeen, who runs Midwest Recovery and Adjustment in Detroit, and is also president of one of his industry’s trade groups. “It’s a target-rich environment at the moment.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/tech/aws-internet-outage-ai-risks","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:04:00-04:00","title":"You thought Monday’s internet outage was bad?

was bad? Just wait \n       \n  Analysis by Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:04 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Monday’s Amazon Web Services outage — and the global disruption it caused — underscored just how reliant the internet has become on a small number of core infrastructure providers.\n \n\n   \n  The ramifications of such outages could only get worse if artificial intelligence becomes as central to work and daily life as tech giants suggest it will in the coming years.\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s outage briefly blocked some people from scheduling doctor’s appointments and accessing banking services. But what if an outage took down the AI tools that doctors were using to help diagnose patients, or that companies used to help facilitate financial transactions?\n \n\n   \n  It may be a hypothetical scenario today, but the tech industry is promising a rapid shift toward AI “agents” doing more work on behalf of humans in the near future – and that could make businesses, schools, hospitals and financial institutions even more reliant on cloud-based services. A global survey of nearly 1,500 firms  published by McKinsey & Company  in May found that 78% of respondents already use AI in at least one business function, up 55% from a year earlier.\n \n\n   \n  “If there’s an outage and you rely on AI to make your decisions and you can’t access it, that’s going to have an effect on performance,” said Tim DeStefano, associate research professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business.\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s outage had such a widespread impact because many companies rely on cloud providers for the backend functions that support their businesses, such as virtual server space, storage or developer tools. Typically, this set up is more affordable, flexible and secure for those customers, except when AWS experiences an outage. Then it’s effectively a single point of failure for a huge swath of the internet.\n \n\n   \n  To be fair, these services are remarkably sturdy considering the scale of their operations. But outages like Monday’s raise questions about   how crucial tech services could be made even more reliable.\n \n\n   \n  AWS serves millions of customers, from retailers and restaurants to financial services firms and government agencies; it holds around 37% of the cloud computing market, according to Gartner. Together with Microsoft and Google, the three companies service around 70% of the market.\n \n\n   \n  And the consolidation of the internet’s backbone is continuing in the age of AI. While there’s some grappling between the big three, Amazon, Microsoft and Google remain by far the prominent cloud computing providers for AI applications, according to   Emarketer senior analyst Jacob Bourne — and their futures depend at least in part on  serving AI demand .\n \n\n   \n  While websites and apps can still technically function using their companies’ own less powerful on-premises servers, “cloud computing represents a technological prerequisite for using AI,” DeStefano said. That’s because the computers needed to run AI tools are powerful and expensive, and on-site hardware isn’t as easy to modify as business needs change. It just makes more sense to rent that computer space and pay for it only as needed.\n \n\n   \n  And as AI becomes more widespread, data center outages could happen more frequently since AI models are so power-hungry, Bourne said. Major cloud providers, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, are spending billions on data centers to address this growing need.\n \n\n   \n  The risk of serious disruption from an outage rises considerably the more companies rely on AI agents to do critical tasks and automate the work of humans, a transition that’s already in progress despite  disagreement about just how far it will go .\n \n\n   \n  Tech companies are  relying on AI to do much of their coding;   big banks are hiring fewer workers as they lean more on AI;  even Amazon is looking at how AI-enabled robots could automate 75% of its warehouse operations, the New York Times  reported  Tuesday, citing leaked internal documents. (Amazon says the documents paint a misleading picture of its plans.)\n \n\n   \n  “This is the dream, but if something goes wrong and you don’t have that human intelligence that’s up to speed,” Bourne said, “then we’re really offloading all of these critical tasks to AI and putting a lot of trust in the technology.”\n \n\n   \n  But that threat isn’t inevitable: The shift to AI presents an opportunity to build more resilient internet architecture. Smaller cloud computing competitors like Oracle and CoreWeave are gaining market share with AI-specific offerings. And companies are increasingly relying on multiple cloud providers to create a backstop if one goes down.\n \n\n   \n  Major large language model makers, including Meta and OpenAI, are also investing billions to build their own data centers, which could reduce the strain on shared systems. The tech industry is also pushing to make some AI models smaller and more power-efficient, so they can run locally on smartphones and laptops rather than relying on the cloud so much.\n \n\n   \n  And AI could help find and fix security flaws to prevent outages like Monday’s — if companies invest in those capabilities as much as buzzy, popular tools like AI chatbots and video generation apps.\n \n\n   \n  “There is a pathway to make AI serve us in the best possible ways,” Bourne said. “It doesn’t necessarily seem like we’re on that pathway, though.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/tesla-earnings","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Tesla is expected to have had a great quarter.

What lies ahead is the problem.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts forecast that the company on Wednesday   will report adjusted earnings of about $1.9 billion, driven by  record sales  of nearly 500,000 cars during the quarter. But that falls short of the $2.5 billion Tesla earned a year ago, a sign of the headwinds the company faces.\n \n\n   \n  The company’s third quarter sales surged as Americans rushed to buy electric cars before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired on October 1. But American electric vehicle sales   are widely expected to plunge in the fourth quarter because people who would have normally bought later in the year purchased early to lock in the tax break.\n \n\n   \n  That credit loss could also affect EV demand among American buyers going forward. Tesla gets nearly half of its revenue from US customers.\n \n\n   \n    The loss of a key source of income\n \n\n   \n  But the removal of the EV tax credit is only part of Tesla’s problem. The Trump administration also eliminated what has been a key profit driver throughout the company’s history – the  sale of regulatory credits .\n \n\n   \n  In years past, the federal government set emissions limits on the total greenhouse gases that came out of all the cars a company sold in a given year. If a car company sold too many gas-guzzling pickups, as opposed to economical hatchbacks or cars with no emissions at all, it would have to buy “credits” from companies like Tesla.\n \n\n   \n  Those sales have brought in $11 billion for Tesla since 2019, including $439 million in the second quarter of that year alone.   Sometimes   credit sales were   the only thing keeping the company profitable at all – including in the first three months of this year.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration’s massive tax and spending bill passed by Congress in July eliminated the federal penalties for violating emissions rules, and thus the need for automakers to buy regulatory credits.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, investors will be watching how much the company’s regulatory credit sales fell in the latest quarter as well as any guidance for how it will handle a future without them.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla is also facing increased competition for EV sales globally, particularly from Chinese automakers. Those automakers not only dominate their own domestic market, but are also moving into Europe. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to overtake Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs this year, despite the fact that it does not sell any of its cars in the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla sales worldwide fell 13% during the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier both due to that increased competition as well as backlash to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s political activity.\n \n\n   \n  But Musk has said the future of the company’s success doesn’t ride on car sales but on self-driving technology and robotics.\n \n\n   \n  Tesla launched the company’s long-promised  robotaxi  offering with limited service in late June, with Musk promising much grander things to come. Investors and analysts will be listening closely to what he says about the state of those expansion plans during Wednesday’s earnings call.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s call will also be Musk’s first time talking to investors since the company unveiled a new proposed pay package for the CEO, which could award him stock worth  $1 trillion .

defeat  against the Toronto Blue Jays.\n \n\n   \n  The gut-wrenching loss ensures that the Mariners’ unwanted record as the only team in Major League Baseball never to appear at the Fall Classic remains very much intact.\n \n\n   \n  To see how much this moment pained Seattle and its players, look no further than MVP candidate  Cal Raleigh , who was reduced to tears at the end of the game.\n \n\n   \n  “I love every guy in this room, but ultimately, it’s not what we wanted,” Raleigh told reporters after the game. “I hate to use the word failure, but it’s a failure.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s what we expected: to get to the World Series and win a World Series. That’s what the bar is and the standard is – that’s what we want to hold ourselves accountable to – but it hurts.”\n \n\n   \n  Raleigh was far from alone in his pain. “We’ve put in so much work and effort through this whole year and it’s over,” said Seattle center fielder Julio Rodríguez. “That’s also part of the game too.”\n \n\n   \n  The disappointment is also felt strongly among the team’s supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re obviously very upset, that was a serious heartbreak,” Mariners fan and podcast host Ari  told  CNN affiliate KING 5 Seattle.\n \n\n   \n  Her podcast co-host Hayley, also a Seattle fan, added: “It’s crazy because, at the beginning of September, we weren’t even in the playoff running. So to go this far, I think it’s really hard right now. But for every fan, it showed what we could do.”\n \n\n   \n  On several occasions during this year’s American League Championship Series (ALCS), the signs looked so promising for the Mariners. They jumped into a 2-0 series lead, then went 3-2 up after victory in Game 5.\n \n\n   \n  And in the winner-takes-all game at Toronto’s Rodgers Centre, Seattle went 3-1 ahead when Raleigh launched his fifth home run of the postseason and fourth against the Blue Jays, putting his team in control of the contest at the top of the fifth.\n \n\n   \n  That, however, would be the high point of a miserable night for the Mariners. George Springer’s three-run homer saw Toronto move ahead in the seventh inning, and with that, Seattle’s hopes evaporated.\n \n\n   \n  Having never in their 49-season history been so close to appearing at the World Series, right now, it might feel like the Mariners have never been further away.\n \n\n   \n  In time, they will be able to reflect on the team’s successful year, reaching a first ALCS since 2001 with a thrilling, near-five-hour win over the Detroit Tigers.\n \n\n   \n  The 28-year-old Raleigh has been the heartbeat of this Seattle team, hitting an MLB-leading 60 home runs in the regular season, only the seventh player in history to reach that mark.\n \n\n   \n  He signed a reported six-year, $105 million contract extension back in March, while Rodríguez is also locked into a long-term contract through 2029.\n \n\n   \n  For the Mariners – just the fourth team to lead a best-of-seven series 2-0 in the postseason and not advance – the ambition of reaching a first-ever World Series is still there, even in the post-mortem of a brutal loss.\n \n\n   \n  “All of us now have had a taste of how close we can get and how good this team can be,” said manager Dan Wilson. “Once you get that, that’s what you’re shooting for the next year and I know that will continue to be the goal … to get to that final step.\n \n\n   \n  “This year, we were one game short.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-curtis-sliwa","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"The NYC mayoral debate’s key question: What will Curtis Sliwa say, or do, next?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee for New York City mayor, is facing intense pressure from key party figures, media outlets, and political opponents to withdraw from the race.

By David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A longtime fixture in New York City politics  known for his eccentricities  – from his love of cats to his brushes with the mob – now finds himself at the center of  one of the most consequential mayoral elections in decades .\n \n\n   \n  Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, is  facing escalating pressure  from key members of his party to drop out and clear the way for a one-on-one matchup between Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. President Donald Trump, a Queens native himself, has all but written Sliwa off.\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa insists he will not drop out. And in mocking Cuomo and the business interests backing him, Sliwa at times seems to echo Mamdani, the democratic socialist, with his sharp criticism of billionaires and elites.\n \n\n   \n  He’s displaying an iconoclastic streak familiar to longtime observers of Big Apple politics but new to people just tuning into the election. Heading into the second general election debate Wednesday at 7 p.m., Sliwa is likely to be at the center of the discussion even as he runs third in the polls.\n \n\n   \n  “I remember when many of the same powers that be were asking Donald Trump to drop out in his reelection bid and they wanted him to move aside for Ron DeSantis. How did that work out?” Sliwa told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  While calling Mamdani, 34, an “apprentice,” the 71-year-old Sliwa hit Cuomo with  the same gibe  Trump used for 2016 campaign rival Jeb Bush.\n \n\n   \n  “I would hope that Andrew Cuomo, instead of moaning and groaning that I should drop out, low-energy Cuomo needs to get out on the campaign trail,” Sliwa said.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo, for his part, called Sliwa a “shock jock” during an appearance on MSNBC on Monday and predicted that the Republican’s support would “collapse.”\n \n\n   \n  “With Curtis, he is a perpetual Republican candidate who’s on the ballot,” Cuomo said. “He’s getting a certain percentage right now, which is what’s keeping me below Mamdani.”\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, has alarmed some moderate Democrats with his  progressive ideas ,  past criticisms of police  and relative lack of experience. Some Jewish voters are concerned about his  criticisms of Israel  and question his commitment to fighting antisemitism.\n \n\n   \n  But the upstart progressive has been consolidating his support since the primary, opening a double-digit lead over Cuomo and Mamdani in public polling. He’s won the endorsements of several key Democrats, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and  met with Jewish groups  and  police officers  as he tries to shore up perceived weaknesses.\n \n\n   \n  Cuomo’s backers have watched with frustration and blame Sliwa for splintering the anti-Mamdani vote. The investor Bill Ackman, among the most vocal Cuomo proponents on social media,  claimed  that Mamdani “is actively working” to keep Sliwa in the race. Mamdani has mocked Ackman and dismissed that claim.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview with the journalist Nate Friedman released over the weekend, the GOP nominee asked Cuomo rhetorically, “Where are your votes?” He turned to the camera and told Ackman, “Stay in your lane.”\n \n\n   \n  But Sliwa has faced calls to drop out from closer to home, including his one-time boss at the New York radio station where he hosted a show before going on leave to run for mayor.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, I love Curtis; we’ve worked together a lot,” WABC owner John Catsimatidis said on the air Monday. “Curtis has to realize that he should love New York more than anything else, and it certainly looks like Curtis should pull out right now.”\n \n\n   \n  The New York Post editorial board published  an op-ed  Monday with the headline, “Swallow the bitter pill, Curtis Sliwa — quit the race to stop Zohran Mamdani.” The New York Daily News  wrote  the same day, “If Sliwa cares about NYC and not just himself, it’s time to drop out of the mayoral race.”\n \n\n   \n  Sliwa’s Republican supporters in the city, however, have signaled their intention to stand by the party’s nominee. On Tuesday ahead of the final debate, a collection of county Republican Party chairs – including Catsimatidis’ daughter Andrea, the Manhattan GOP chair – issued a joint statement affirming that “our party is united behind Curtis Sliwa.”\n \n\n   \n  Previous Republican mayor Rudy Giuliani has also maintained his support for Sliwa and hosted the candidate on his own show. “Curtis Sliwa has my complete and total endorsement,” he  said .\n \n\n   \n  “The undecided ones, if this is like any other political situation, are going to break the same way, or they’re not going to vote,” Giuliani said Monday. “Remember, it’s a poll. And it’s not just they’re unfair to Trump, they are, that’s given. They’re also very often completely useless.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/basketball-wnba-pay-adam-silver-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:43:00-04:00","title":"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Says WNBA Players Will Get 'Big' Pay Increase in New Collective Bargaining Agreement","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has announced that WNBA players will receive a 'big' pay increase under the league’s new collective bargaining agreement, highlighting a significant revenue disparity between the NBA (49% player share) and WNBA (9.3% share).

Here’s where the race stands so far \n       \n  By Dan Heching, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:30 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Where has 2025 gone? One way to mark the dizzying elapsing of time: The  Oscar  race is already coming into focus, now that we’re –  gulp  – three months out from nominations.\n \n\n   \n  The competition still has much time to take shape, but there are a few frontrunners emerging, starting with Paul Thomas Anderson’s recently released chaotic opus “One Battle After Another” – which has enjoyed the best word of mouth this year, notching an impressive critic score of 95 on both Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. (“One Battle After Another” is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n \n\n   \n  But not far behind are several other titles, including many yet to be released, like “Sentimental Value,” “Marty Supreme,” “Hamnet,” “Bugonia” and “Wicked: For Good,” to name a few.\n \n\n   \n  A preliminary breakdown of top categories follows:\n \n\n   \n    Best picture\n \n\n   \n  It’s been 15 years since the Academy opened up this race to more than the previously fixed number of five nominees – vacillating between eight and ten best picture contenders, and  settling consistently on ten  for the last few years. This year, that leaves the field open to quite a few possibilities. First, there’s “One Battle After Another,” whose director Anderson has frequently attracted Oscar love over the years and is seemingly a shoe-in for scoring a nomination for the night’s top honor. Ryan Coogler’s period-horror hit “Sinners” (also a Warner Bros. Pictures production) is also a solid contender, despite coming out in the summer months, which is a window often overlooked by Academy voters.\n \n\n   \n  At this juncture, other buzzy films generating a fair amount of Oscar buzz are the English-, Norwegian- and Swedish-language “Sentimental Value” (out on November 7) starring Stellan Skarsgård and Elle Fanning, “Hamnet” (out November 27) featuring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, and “Marty Supreme” (out on Christmas Day) with Timothée Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow. Let us also not overlook the Palme d’Or-winning  Iranian film “It was Just an Accident,”  out this month.\n \n\n   \n  In the “maybe…could be…you never know!” section, there’s summer actioner “F1,” Netflix’s “Jay Kelly” with George Clooney and  Guillermo del Toro-directed “Frankenstein.”  These are probably in the long-shot category, but hey, Hollywood loves a twist.\n \n\n   \n    Best actress\n \n\n   \n  The Academy certainly favors return nominees, but it also  can’t resist a new arrival . This year, look for newcomer Chase Infiniti – whose quietly incendiary performance is at the center of “One Battle After Another” – to be in the conversation. And although not a newbie on the scene, acclaimed Norwegian performer Renate Reinsve could have a place in the race for her work as the resentful daughter of an estranged director in “Sentimental Value,” which would mark her first Oscar nod.\n \n\n   \n  As for returning favorites, there’s Buckley, who was nominated for best supporting actress in 2022 for “The Lost Daughter,” and is all but sure to receive one again this year for her lead role in Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” playing a grief-stricken mother and wife to one William Shakespeare (Mescal). It would also be a major upset if Cynthia Erivo isn’t again recognized for her performance as Elphaba in the sequel “Wicked: For Good,” even though the film has yet to be screened for most anyone.\n \n\n   \n  Other possible contenders who are not new to the Oscar race include Amanda Seyfried in “The Testament of Ann Lee,” Julia Roberts in “After the Hunt,” “Bugonia’s” Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence for “Die My Love.”\n \n\n   \n    Best actor\n \n\n   \n  Let’s assume we’re reserving one chair for “One Battle’s” Leonardo DiCaprio – already an Oscar-winner for 2015’s “The Revenant.” That leaves us four slots to play with in the best actor race.\n \n\n   \n  Actually, make that three, because “Narcos” actor Wagner Moura, who is making waves for his work in the Brazilian film “The Secret Agent,” already won best actor at Cannes for the espionage thriller. In the film, he plays a technology expert in late-’70s Recife who discovers he’s being targeted by some unsavory characters. Notable: Only  16 best actor winners from the ritzy Cannes fest  have gone on to be nominated for an Academy Award.\n \n\n   \n  The three other spots could go several ways. Michael B. Jordan, who plays twins with very different fates in “Sinners,” and Chalamet, who would be returning for a second consecutive Oscar nomination (and his third in total), are strong options.\n \n\n   \n  On their heels, however, might be “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White, whose portrayal of Bruce Springsteen in “Deliver Me from Nowhere” has certainly  generated press  and some voter buzz. Other potential nominees include   Dwayne Johnson for “The Smashing Machine,” Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon” – in which  he plays Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart  – and Jesse Plemons for his turn as a wild conspiracy theorist in Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia.”\n \n\n   \n    Best supporting actress\n \n\n   \n  The best supporting actress race is a tough one to predict, since as usual, there’s just so much to choose from. Amy Madigan, known to most for ’80s films like “Uncle Buck” and “Field of Dreams,” turned out a bonkers performance in this summer’s breakout elevated horror hit “Weapons” (also from Warner Bros.) and has appeared on several lists as a favorite to be nominated here. It would mark her second Oscar nomination in this same category in exactly 40 years, after 1985’s “Twice in a Lifetime.”\n \n\n   \n  While horror doesn’t often get recognized by the Academy, the precedent has indeed been set – Ruth Gordon won Oscar gold in 1969 for playing a somewhat similar character in “Rosemary’s Baby,” and landmark genre films like “The Exorcist” and “Aliens” also received Academy recognition for the actresses who starred in those films.\n \n\n   \n  Outside of that, keep your eyes on Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall, who each shine in “One Battle After Another,” and Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas for their work in “Sentimental Value.”\n \n\n   \n  And it’s too early to count out Ariana Grande, who will again portray Glinda in the upcoming “Wicked: For Good,” especially if the movie ends up being great.\n \n\n   \n    Best supporting actor\n \n\n   \n  If Sean Penn gets a nomination for his mercenary-like villain Colonel Lockjaw in “One Battle,” he could very well end up joining an elite group of three-time Oscar winners that includes Meryl Streep, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jack Nicholson and Frances McDormand.\n \n\n   \n  But “Hamnet’s”   Mescal, a returning nominee following 2022’s “Aftersun,” also has a strong chance.   While several actors have gotten nominated for playing roles in films based on Shakespeare’s works, no one has been nominated for playing the man himself. (Yes, 1998’s “Shakespeare in Love” was showered with Academy love, but the Bard-playing actor Joseph Fiennes was not nominated.)\n \n\n   \n  Other potential contenders in this category could include Skarsgård for “Sentimental Value,” Adam Sandler for Netflix’s “Jay Kelly,” and Jeremy Strong – who was nominated last year for his chilling portrayal of Roy Cohn in “The Apprentice” – for “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere.”\n \n\n   \n  Oscar nominations will be unveiled on the morning of January 22, 2026. The 98th Academy Awards will be held on March 15.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/medicaid-work-requirement-apps","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"Officials show little proof that new tech will help Medicaid enrollees meet work rules","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the rollout of new work requirements for Medicaid enrollees under a policy enacted by President Donald Trump.

They have until the end of next year, and federal officials are giving those jurisdictions a total of $200 million to do so.\n \n\n   \n  The policy change is one of several to free up money for Trump’s priorities, such as increased border security and tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthy.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  For now, state officials, health policy researchers, and consumer advocates are watching the pilot program in Louisiana and another in Arizona.  Mehmet Oz , director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has touted those test-drives and said they will allow people to verify their incomes “within seven minutes.”\n \n\n   \n  “There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven’t been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now,” said Oz,  during a television appearance  in August.\n \n\n   \n  Brian Blase, the president of the conservative Paragon Health Institute and a key architect of Medicaid changes in the new law, has chimed in, saying during a  recent radio appearance  that with today’s artificial intelligence “people should be able to seamlessly enter how they are spending their time.”\n \n\n   \n  KFF Health News found scant evidence to support such claims. Federal and state officials have offered little insight into what new technology the two pilots have tested. They do say, however, that it connects directly with the websites of Medicaid enrollees’ payroll providers, rather than using artificial intelligence to draw conclusions about their activities.\n \n\n   \n  Oz said the Trump administration’s efforts started “as soon as the bill was signed” in July. But work on the pilot programs  began under the Biden administration .\n \n\n   \n  And Medicaid is a state-federal program: The federal government contributes most of the funds, but it is up to the states to administer them, not the federal government.\n \n\n   \n  “Oz can say, ‘Oh no, we’re going to fix this. We’re going to do this.’ Well, they don’t actually run the program,” said  Joan Alker , a health policy researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Children and Families.\n \n\n   \n  Officials have also offered few details about the pilots’ effectiveness in assisting enrollees in Medicaid or other public benefit programs.\n \n\n   \n  The shortage of information has some state officials and health policy researchers worried that the Trump administration lacks viable solutions to help states implement the work rules. As a result, they say, people with a legal right to Medicaid benefits could lose access to them.\n \n\n   \n  “What actually keeps me up at night is the fear that members that are eligible for Medicaid and are trying to get health care services would fall through the cracks and lose coverage,” said Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director.\n \n\n   \n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the  work rules will be the main reason  millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.\n \n\n   \n  Officials involved in the Louisiana and Arizona projects declined to answer many specific questions about their efforts, instead directing KFF Health News to federal officials.\n \n\n   \n  Spokespeople for Arizona’s Medicaid and Economic Security departments — Johnny Córdoba and Brett Bezio, respectively — did not share data on how many people participated in the state’s pilot test nor describe the outcome. They said the pilot had been used to verify eligibility only for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a smaller program than Medicaid.\n \n\n   \n  The  Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona , a nonprofit that helps people sign up for such SNAP benefits, hadn’t heard of the pilot program.\n \n\n   \n  State officials and health policy researchers said neither pilot program could confirm whether a person meets other qualifying activities — such as community service — or any of the numerous exemptions. The tools being tested can verify only income.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Oz’s agency, wrote in a statement that the digital tools officials aim to share with states “are largely under development.”\n \n\n   \n  One person  doing that development  is Michael Burstein, a software engineer who, until recently, worked at the U.S. Digital Service, which later became known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n \n\n   \n  As the U.S. Digital Service was turned into DOGE, Burstein and other staffers left and started a nonprofit called  Digital Public Works  to finish supporting the technology to make it easier for people to verify their incomes for Medicaid enrollment.\n \n\n   \n  But without permission from state officials, Burstein would not describe the tool in development, aside from saying that it’s mobile-first, can quickly verify income for a new or returning client, “and we’re pretty happy with it.”\n \n\n   \n  The state agencies that manage benefit programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP, are understaffed, and they use different eligibility systems,  many of which need updating , which makes improving them “a challenging task,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The $200 million in start-up costs the federal government has earmarked for systems to track work requirements equals  roughly four times what it cost  to administer Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program alone.\n \n\n   \n  That state, which has the nation’s only active work requirement program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, in September was granted a  temporary extension , despite a  recent report  from a federal watchdog saying it hadn’t received enough federal oversight. A  complicated sign-up process  has kept enrollment in the program far below Georgia’s own projections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tax and spending law allows states to ask for extra time — until the end of 2028 — to start enforcing the rules, but only with the approval of HHS Secretary Robert F.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Rates of one type of  breast cancer  — invasive lobular carcinoma — have been rising in the United States more than three times faster than those of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade, according to a new study.\n \n\n   \n  This elusive breast cancer that’s hard to spot in routine mammograms is behind more than 1 in 10 cases nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  The research, published in  Cancer ,  the journal of the American Cancer Society, analyzed national data from 2012 to 2021 and found that rates of invasive lobular carcinoma increased by about 2.8% each year, while rates of all other breast cancer rose by about 0.8% a year.\n \n\n   \n  What exactly is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? How is it diagnosed, and why can it be more difficult to find during screenings? Who is most at risk? What are the treatment options? And what should women know about reducing their risk of developing this and other types of breast cancer?\n \n\n   \n  To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? \n \n\n   \n   Dr. Leana Wen:  Invasive lobular carcinoma, also known as ILC or lobular breast cancer, is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast, called lobules, and then spreads into nearby tissue. These malignant tumors are often hormone receptor-positive, meaning the cancer cells grow in response to estrogen or progesterone.\n \n\n   \n  ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, after invasive ductal carcinoma, and accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses, according to the  National Cancer Institute . About 47,500 ILC cases are diagnosed in the US each year, and more women are diagnosed with it than with brain, kidney, liver, pancreatic or ovarian cancer.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: Why is ILC often more difficult to find with routine mammograms? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  This type of tumor tends to grow in a way that doesn’t change the breast’s structure as much as other cancers. Instead of forming a defined mass, the cancer cells spread through the tissue in thin strands that appear more like normal breast tissue on imaging. Because of this, mammograms may show only subtle changes, or sometimes none at all. Women may also be less likely to feel a distinct lump during a breast self-exam, which can delay detection.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What other imaging is used to diagnose ILC? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  A breast ultrasound can help spot areas of thickened tissue that don’t show up on a mammogram, and a breast MRI provides a more detailed view that can reveal cancers hidden in dense breast tissue.\n \n\n   \n  These tests aren’t routinely recommended for everyone. Mammography remains the standard screening tool for most women. But those at higher risk, including women with dense breasts and those with a strong family history of breast cancer or known genetic mutations, may be advised to have an ultrasound or MRI in addition to regular mammograms.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What does this study show in terms of the rise of cases and who is most at risk? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Researchers found that ILC has been increasing across every racial and ethnic group, but the steepest rise was seen among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, whose incidence grew by about 4.4% each year in the study period. Age is also a risk factor, as women 65 and older are more likely to be diagnosed with ILC than with invasive ductal carcinoma. About 70% of new ILC cases were diagnosed in women 60 and older; the median age of diagnosis is 66.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How do the study authors explain the rise especially in this type of breast cancer? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Several factors may be driving this greater increase. Because ILC is strongly linked to hormones, changes in hormone exposure over time could be part of the reason. Rising rates of obesity and alcohol use, along with changes in childbearing and menopause patterns, may also contribute to the steady increase.\n \n\n   \n  Improvement in diagnosis and greater awareness of ILC may be leading to more accurate identification. Some lobular cancers may have been misclassified as ductal cancers in the past, so part of the rise may reflect better recognition. In addition, more women are living longer after menopause, which can increase the likelihood of developing ILC compared with other types of breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: What are the treatment options for ILC? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Treatment is similar to that for  other breast cancers . Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation, is common, as is hormonal therapy, since most tumors grow in response to estrogen or progesterone. Chemotherapy may be used in some cases. For advanced disease, newer targeted drugs combined with hormonal therapy can help slow progression and improve outcomes. However, ILC may have greater resistance to treatment, especially in more advanced disease, and tends to carry a poorer prognosis once it has spread.\n \n\n   \n   CNN: How can women reduce their risk of developing ILC and other types of breast cancer? \n \n\n   \n   Wen:  Some risk factors can’t be changed, such as age or family history, but many  lifestyle choices  can make a difference. Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active all help lower the risk of breast cancer. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains supports overall health and may reduce inflammation linked to cancer.\n \n\n   \n  Regular screening and knowing what’s normal for your breasts are key for early detection. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors and decide together when you should begin screening and whether you need tests in addition to a mammogram.\n \n\n   \n  Finally, pay attention to changes in your breasts, such as thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, different colors or new areas of fullness, and seek medical evaluation as soon as something looks or feels different.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/melania-trump-ukrainian-children-putin","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-20:00","title":"Advocates welcome Melania Trump’s work to return Ukrainian children but worry about playing into Putin’s hands","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melania Trump has taken a personal and diplomatic approach to advocating for the return of Ukrainian children allegedly abducted by Russia during the war, engaging directly with Vladimir Putin through backchannel communications.

 \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While praising  first lady Melania Trump’s  work to return Ukrainian children from Russian captivity,  President Donald Trump  last week seemed to downplay the estimates of the number of children allegedly abducted since the war began.\n \n\n   \n  Seated across the table in the White House Cabinet Room, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not try to correct his counterpart, nor did he answer a reporter’s question about whether he appreciated the American first lady’s efforts. Instead, he turned, cocked his head and silently nodded.\n \n\n   \n  The moment underscored deep sensitivity around a complex issue that the first lady has sought to resolve through direct communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Melania Trump, who has made the well-being and safety of children a priority, advocacy on this issue appeared to be a natural fit and an opportunity to use her massive global platform to make a difference.\n \n\n   \n  But in the week after  she announced  the return of eight Ukrainian children to their families, some advocates who have lauded the children’s return also raised concern in conversations with CNN about the way the first lady got involved — and especially her passive-voice characterization of how the children ended up in Russia, fearing that it will only end up playing to Putin.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from the White House earlier this month, the first lady described “Ukrainian children residing in Russia” and said they’d been “displaced to the Russian Federation because of front-line fighting” — but did not talk about the war crime that many advocates see in Moscow’s alleged abduction of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone is moving very carefully, but everyone is clear on the point that the first lady’s office needs to hear: Thank you — but it is 35,000 kids, not seven or eight,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, whose Ukraine Conflict Observatory is operating on private donations through the end of the year after the Trump administration  cut its funding .\n \n\n   \n  “It is kids who were taken as a war crime and kids who are being militarized and were abducted by a state — not lost in the war. Language matters,” Raymond said.\n \n\n   \n  A  September report  from the Yale lab found children have been taken to at least 210 locations, including military bases, orphanages and camps, where they have been reeducated in alignment with pro-Russian narratives and in some cases trained for combat. Many of them have had their identities changed, making them increasingly difficult to track over time.\n \n\n   \n  The first lady’s language ignores the reality of the situation — and could play in Putin’s favor, some advocates for the children told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Bill Taylor, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, applauded Melania Trump’s personal involvement while also noting that Putin likely has ulterior motives.\n \n\n   \n  “Every returned child is wonderful for that family and that child, so that is good. But there are more than 19,000 of these, and I do think that Putin is cynically using this in an attempt to make the Trumps more sympathetic to him,” Taylor told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The estimates of how many children have been allegedly abducted vary, depending on the source and who’s being counted.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump, a day after a  two-hour phone call  with the Russian leader last week, offered his own take on the number. “Some people say it’s 20,000 and some people say it’s 300,” he said during his Friday meeting with Zelensky at the White House. “So, nobody really knows, but she felt very strongly about the children.”\n \n\n   \n  Taylor doesn’t doubt Melania Trump’s compassion for the Ukrainian children — but he does question the Russian leader’s.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the first lady is genuinely interested in getting the Ukrainian children home. But the fact is that Putin is not. He could return all of these kids and end the war tomorrow if he wanted,” Taylor said.\n \n\n   \n  Melania Trump’s efforts came amid mounting pressure from the Ukrainians, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers and evangelicals to get the Trump administration involved in returning the Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska, for example,  traveled to New York  last month with a pressing mission to raise awareness among the international community. Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, she warned that at the current rate, it would take 50 years to return the Ukrainian children.\n \n\n   \n  The American first lady, who employs a skeletal staff, kept the news of the eight children’s release to an extremely small circle of aides before revealing it publicly, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Some Ukrainians at the working level who have been focused on the issue were taken aback by the first lady’s involvement. They welcomed her efforts, but worried about Putin working with her only as part of an effort to downplay the enormity of the problem, two sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian official dismissed those concerns and said Volodymyr Zelensky was grateful for the US first lady’s intervention.\n \n\n   \n  In her initial announcement, Trump said she and Putin “have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children for the past three months.” She pointed to backchannel meetings and calls following a letter she wrote to the Russian leader, hand-delivered by her husband in  Alaska in August , that obliquely referenced the “darkness” around children impacted by war.\n \n\n   \n  On Capitol Hill, a group of key Senate Republicans and Democrats had been pushing for a  resolution  making the return of the abducted children a prerequisite for any negotiated peace agreement to end the war. But despite the first lady’s announcement, the White House has not yet stated a position on the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  While one Republican congressional aide said there is some skepticism regarding Melania Trump’s involvement, for now, there is no appetite on Capitol Hill to push the White House on the topic.\n \n\n   \n  “If there needs to be conversations with the White House on this, there will be, but I have no indication that Melania believes what Putin says,” the aide said, adding that there are some concerns about Putin using a direct line to the first lady to shift the narrative on the allegedly abducted children.\n \n\n   \n  Evangelical groups that have lobbied the White House and the first lady’s office on the issue praised Trump’s receptiveness and argued that the return of eight children was an important turning point.\n \n\n   \n  And Chelsea Sobolik, director of government relations at World Relief, an evangelical humanitarian organization, noted that the effort also marked a critical recognition from Russia.\n \n\n   \n  “Up until recently, Russia was denying this issue — or they were giving all these false narratives. So I think the fact that this is making waves at the top levels of our US government does mean there’s movement. I view this as a first step, not a last step. There’s so much more work that needs to be done,” Sobolik said.\n \n\n   \n  She signed onto a letter from a group of evangelical leaders thanking Trump — but also encouraging her to keep her foot on the gas.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to urge the Trump Administration to ensure that this remains a central issue and that all estimated 35,000 children are returned as a precondition to any peace talks,” they  wrote .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/simplified-investment-strategy-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:30:00Z","title":"The benefits of keeping your investing life simple","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article promotes a simple investing strategy known as KISS (Keep It Simple and Smart), arguing that most actively managed funds fail to outperform passive index funds over time—only 21% of active funds beat their passive counterparts over a 10-year period, and just 7.1% of large-cap blend funds outperformed index funds over 20 years.

By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:30 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Are you suffering from decision fatigue? Do you have better things to do than oversee a complex portfolio and keep up with the latest on Wall Street? Do you just want to do as little as possible when it comes to investing but still have the money you need to meet your goals?\n \n\n   \n  If so, good news: Your exhaustion and disinterest might make you a successful investor if you adopt a portfolio strategy we’ll call KISS (Keep It Simple and Smart).\n \n\n   \n    Beating the market is not the norm\n \n\n   \n  The key to the KISS strategy is to not waste effort trying to select the “best” of anything – stock funds, managers, complicated sector plays. And, instead, to feel confident you can do well enough for  your individual goals  by sticking with a few low-cost funds over time that track overall market performance.\n \n\n   \n  Why? Because, it turns out, “It’s extremely difficult to beat the market,” said Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, data from Morningstar suggest most actively managed funds don’t.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers compared their performance after fees to a composite of passively managed index funds and exchange-traded funds.\n \n\n   \n  “Just 21% of active strategies survived and beat their passive counterparts over the 10 years through June 2025,” they wrote in a  mid-year report  about Morningstar’s Active/Passive Barometer.\n \n\n   \n  As just one example of how actively managed funds may disappoint, Morningstar found that over 20 years, only 7.1% of large cap blend funds – which invest in both growth and value stocks and might compare their performance to the S&P 500 – performed better than index funds in the same category.\n \n\n   \n    Picking the right fund(s) for you\n \n\n   \n  If the bulk of your money is in a workplace retirement plan like a 401(k), chances are you will have the option to invest in a  target-date retirement fund .\n \n\n   \n  Such a fund allocates your money across other stock and bond funds – often index funds – to achieve an allocation that best suits your time horizon to retirement. So for someone who’s 40 they might be in a 2050 or 2055 target date fund.\n \n\n   \n  The fund’s allocation will grow more conservative (less in stocks, more in bonds) as you near your expected retirement year.\n \n\n   \n  “A target date fund can be a great option. It builds in portfolio diversification and an asset mix targeted to your age and retirement date,” Arnott said.\n \n\n   \n  If you don’t have a target date fund, or don’t like the one available in your plan, consider investing instead in three broad index funds and adjust how much you invest in each according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n \n\n   \n  “The average person probably will get better results with a target-date fund. But if you want a slightly more hands-on approach you could put together a basic portfolio of US and international stocks plus investment-grade bonds. Having exposure to those three asset classes is all you really need,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond retirement, for any investing you’re doing to meet intermediate-term goals with a five- to 10-year horizon, she suggests putting money into a high-quality intermediate-term bond index fund or a low-cost, actively managed one, since this is one arena in which actives have had a reasonably good track record against their benchmarks. Or you might also consider a low-cost, moderate-risk allocation fund of funds – which invests in both stocks and bonds.\n \n\n   \n    The psychological benefits\n \n\n   \n  Just as having fewer but better clothes in an organized closet can reduce your decision fatigue about what to wear, adopting a KISS strategy with just one or a few, low-cost funds can reduce the stress of managing your investments.\n \n\n   \n  With a simple, streamlined portfolio, you’ll know what you’re invested in.\n \n\n   \n  It will be easier to review – which you should do once a year to make sure the way your money is allocated still reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n \n\n   \n  And your portfolio will be easier to explain to a spouse or adult child, who may help you manage it if you become unable to do so alone, or who will eventually inherit it.\n \n\n   \n  “As I’ve gotten older and my financial situation has gotten more complicated, I’ve come to appreciate the value of simplicity more,” Arnott said. “There’s a lot of value in having a portfolio that is easier for someone to take over when you’re gone. Or if you’re an  older adult with a cognitive impairment .”\n \n\n   \n  And, perhaps most importantly, having a simpler portfolio may make it easier to assess whether you  need to save  more now. Because no matter how well your investments do, if you aren’t saving sufficiently, the best returns in the world won’t get you where you need to go.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/basketball-nba-okc-rockets-warriors-lakers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-20:00","title":"NBA Opening Night: OKC wins double-OT thriller against Rockets as they receive championship rings, Warriors topple Lakers","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 NBA season opened with two high-stakes games: the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrated their first championship since 2008 by raising a banner and receiving rings, and they narrowly defeated the Houston Rockets in a double-overtime thriller, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Chet Holmgren leading the charge.

Rockets as they receive championship rings, Warriors topple Lakers \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  NBA  is back for another intriguing season and it began in emphatic fashion on Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  On an evening which began with the celebration of the  Oklahoma City Thunder ’s title victory – with players receiving their championship rings and a banner being raised to the rafters of Paycom Center – fans were treated to two exciting games.\n \n\n   \n  First, the Thunder played a double-overtime thriller against the new-look  Houston Rockets , holding on to win 125-124 in an instant classic. And in California, the LeBron James-less Los Angeles Lakers lost their home opener 119-109 to the Golden State Warriors.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s everything you need to know about the two opening games of the 2025 NBA season.\n \n\n   \n    Thunder celebrate title victory, win double-OT classic\n \n\n   \n  Last season’s title victory was the culmination of years of hard work for the Thunder, whether it be through some savvy drafting or creative trades to acquire key pieces.\n \n\n   \n  Those moves all paid off in the form of a dominant regular season and a playoffs which saw Oklahoma City race past most of its opponents, eventually beating the Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals in seven games to secure the franchise’s first title since moving from Seattle in 2008.\n \n\n   \n  Before Tuesday’s home opener, the victorious Thunder players from last year were serenaded by their fans while receiving their championship rings from Thunder chairman Clay Bennett.\n \n\n   \n  Last season’s  NBA Most Valuable Player , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, was the last to get his ring, with fans chanting “M-V-P!” as he made his way onto the court.\n \n\n   \n  The players then posed for pictures with their new rings – designed by Jostens and which are set in 14-karat gold with more than 800 custom-cut, hand-set gemstones – while the championship banner was raised.\n \n\n   \n  “Seeing the banner up there was cool, knowing it’ll be up there forever,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after Tuesday’s game. “Special night.”\n \n\n   \n  After the celebrations were wrapped up, it was time to begin the defense of their crown. First up was the Rockets who, during the offseason, had asserted their own title aspirations by trading for former Thunder star Kevin Durant from the Phoenix Suns.\n \n\n   \n  Durant, 37,  reportedly signed  a two-year extension worth $90 million with the team on Sunday and the move to acquire the 15-time NBA All-Star hints that the franchise is all-in this season.\n \n\n   \n  The game at Paycom Center was a tight affair, with very little to separate the two teams. With 9.5 seconds of regulation time remaining and with the Rockets leading 103-102, Durant had two free throw attempts to potentially put his new team up by three. However, he missed the first and drained the second to give Houston a two-point lead, only for Gilgeous-Alexander to go up the other end and level the score to send it to OT.\n \n\n   \n  Durant almost had another disastrous moment at the end of the first overtime when, with 1.3 seconds left, he caught the ball and signaled for a timeout even though the Rockets didn’t have any left. This usually comes with a one-shot technical free throw for the opposing team but the  officials admitted afterwards  that they missed Durant’s signal and, with the score tied again, the game went to a second overtime.\n \n\n   \n  Ending an action-packed return to OKC for Durant, he played a part in the Thunder eventually securing the victory.\n \n\n   \n  With the Rockets up one, Durant fouled Gilgeous-Alexander with two seconds left, picking up his sixth personal foul and exiting the game. The reigning MVP then hit the two game-winning free throws.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, the new Houston star took responsibility for the defeat.\n \n\n   \n  “I missed the free throws, and I fouled somebody at the end,” Durant, who scored 23 points in 47 minutes, told reporters,  per ESPN . “I think those two plays are the reason we lost.”\n \n\n   \n  Alperen Şengün led the way for the Rockets with 39 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists, two steals and a block while the Thunder were powered by Gilgeous-Alexander’s 35 points and 28 from Chet Holmgren.\n \n\n   \n    Warriors topple Lakers missing LeBron James\n \n\n   \n  In Tuesday’s late game, it was an all-California match-up as the Warriors traveled to the City of Angels to face the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  LA played without superstar LeBron James, who watched from the bench having been  ruled out with sciatica  – an injury which is expected to sideline him until November. It was the first season opener James has missed in his 23 years in the NBA.\n \n\n   \n  In James’ absence, the Lakers were led by  Luka Dončić  who had a ridiculous game with 43 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and a block. Dončić was traded to LA midway through last season in a  blockbuster move .\n \n\n   \n  But it wasn’t enough as 31 points from Jimmy Butler and 23 from Steph Curry lifted the Warriors to a 119-109 victory.\n \n\n   \n  The two teams were evenly matched at 55-54 at halftime at Crypto.com Arena, but a 19-4 run to open the second half by Golden State led to a 17-point lead.\n \n\n   \n  Austin Reaves – who finished with 26 points and nine assists – did lead a fourth-quarter rally for LA, cutting the Warriors advantage to just six points, but that was as close as the Lakers got with Golden State able to hold on and clinch an impressive road victory.\n \n\n   \n  After the game, Dončić said there was no reason to panic for the Lakers.\n \n\n   \n  “I think there was a lot of positive things tonight, and obviously a lot of things we’ve got to work on,” the Slovenian told reporters. “But my confidence is fine.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/weather/melissa-simmers-in-the-caribbean-posing-a-serious-flood-threat-and-a-track-thats-hard-to-pin-down","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00Z","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa in Caribbean Poses Serious Flood Threat","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa is moving through the Caribbean Sea, threatening life-threatening flooding and mudslides in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica due to heavy rainfall.

      5:01 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tropical Storm Melissa is crawling through the Caribbean Sea, threatening to unleash life-threatening flooding and mudslides across parts of the Caribbean later this week. This year’s  Atlantic hurricane season  is not over yet, and Melissa has plenty of time and fuel ahead.\n \n\n   \n  The storm is expected to slow down and turn northwest toward Jamaica and Haiti’s southwestern peninsula as it strengthens into a hurricane by the end of the week. Heavy rain is already spreading north, with 5 to 10 inches forecast across southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic through Friday. That much rain over mountainous terrain in the area could trigger catastrophic flash flooding and landslides.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa was churning about 300 miles south of Haiti with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Wednesday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is moving over water that’s essentially rocket fuel for storms this late in the season and is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday. However, it’s still too early to pin down exactly where it will go and how strong it will become from there. If it becomes a hurricane, it would be the 2025 Atlantic season’s fifth so far and the first to spin up inside the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus. Puerto Rico is much more likely to experience some of the storm’s rain.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    Two possible outcomes, neither good\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios forecasters have been monitoring for days. The one looking most likely at this point could spell disaster for parts of Hispaniola and Jamaica; the other could eventually take Melissa close to Central America.\n \n\n   \n  Both involve Melissa first loitering out over the Caribbean Sea for multiple days this week, churning up seas and bringing nasty weather to islands within the storm’s reach.\n \n\n   \n  From there, Melissa could take a turn to the north by late week and potentially move close to Jamaica and western Haiti through the weekend, strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday morning. This is the scenario the hurricane center’s track for the system reflects.\n \n\n   \n  If Melissa taps into that energy, it could explode in strength – something that’s  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola. It’s still unclear exactly what parts of the Haiti, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could also deliver a considerable amount of rain to Puerto Rico in this scenario, with flash flooding and mudslides possible.\n \n\n   \n  Alternately, there’s still a chance that Melissa misses its window to take a northward turn and instead just creeps west over the Caribbean until it nears Central America – potentially Nicaragua or Honduras – next week. It could make landfall there or take a very late turn to the north and head for Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  The northern Caribbean would likely still receive a few days of wet and windy weather in this scenario, but rainfall totals would be lower, as would the flood risk, with Melissa moving steadily west.\n \n\n   \n    Is this a threat to the US?\n \n\n   \n  A direct hit on the mainland US is unlikely, but not entirely out of the question.

officials and Congress \n       \n  By Haley Britzky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Pentagon is barring nearly all Defense Department personnel, including military commanders, from talking to Congress or state lawmakers unless they have received prior approval from the agency’s office of legislative affairs, according to a memo signed this month by  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth  and obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Unauthorized engagements with Congress by [Defense Department] personnel acting in their official capacity, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine Department-wide priorities critical to achieving our legislative objectives,” says the memo, which was obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The directive applies to the civilian leaders of each military branch, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all combatant commanders and Defense Intelligence offices. The memo, dated October 15, does carve out an exception for the Pentagon Inspector General office, the agency’s internal watch dog.\n \n\n   \n  Breaking Defense  first reported  the details of the policy.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told CNN that the memo is “a pragmatic step to internally review the Department’s processes for communicating with Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  “The Department intends to improve accuracy and responsiveness in communicating with the Congress to facilitate increased transparency,” Parnell said. “This review is for processes internal to the Department and does not change how or from whom Congress receives information.”\n \n\n   \n  The memo is the latest in a series of steps by Hegseth to control information at the Pentagon and how the Pentagon communicates with those outside the agency. Hegseth,  whose tenure  has been beleaguered by leaks, has also moved to restrict engagement by Defense Department personnel with think tanks or other outside events and conferences. The memo was signed the same day that dozens of reporters  turned in their badges  rather than sign a document the Pentagon had produced that included restrictions on their work.\n \n\n   \n  A senior Pentagon official told CNN that the memo is consistent with longstanding Defense Department policy that has not been enforced in the past. A 2006-era directive states that all legislative activities “shall be centrally directed and carefully coordinated with the [assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs] prior to execution,” and that the assistant secretary would have “overall supervision” of legislative affairs for the department.\n \n\n   \n  And while the memo says explicitly that engagements must be coordinated or approved with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Legislative Affairs), the senior official said some engagements can also be approved by the military services’ legislative offices instead of pushing them all the way up to the Pentagon’s legislative affairs office.\n \n\n   \n  A defense official also said they understood the memo to be primarily geared towards senior officials who go to the Hill to speak with lawmakers and may not have previously coordinated with legislative affairs staff, not lower-level legislative affairs staff who will still be authorized to speak with their congressional counterparts.\n \n\n   \n  The memo says the Pentagon “relies on a collaborative and close partnership with Congress to achieve our legislative goals,” which requires “coordination of alignment of Department messaging.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously reported that Congress has had limited engagement with Hegseth to the frustration of lawmakers and staffers; a Senate aide told CNN there has been “significantly less” communication than what lawmakers expect.\n \n\n   \n  In some ways the memo is reminiscent of efforts by other administrations to control engagement with Congress, the Senate aide told CNN. For past administrations that has been in the form of a temporary pause in interactions or review.\n \n\n   \n  The aide said, the memo fits “a disturbing pattern of attempting to stifle communication with Congress and the public that is unique and characteristic to Pete Hegseth,” but that in practice it could be less restrictive than the language initially appears.\n \n\n   \n  “There is so much required and frankly beneficial interaction between Congress and the Department … There are very responsible and professional people who are doing their jobs and liaising with Congress, and 99% of it is business as usual,” the aide said. “I think this is a bad misunderstanding and frankly just another example of their paranoia to try to clamp down in this way.”\n \n\n   \n  The senior Pentagon official said the memo is not meant to be restrictive, but an effort to coordinate the Pentagon’s messaging to Congress to avoid mistakes like officials contradicting themselves to Congress.\n \n\n   \n  “When we go and we don’t coordinate our messaging, we run the risk of being in direct conflict with our budget request and our proposals on behalf of the Department,” the official said.\n \n\n   \n  There has also been frustration with officials who are not in legislative affairs responding to questions from lawmakers or staffers on Capitol Hill, who are “answering on behalf of the Department and they’re not coordinating their messaging,” the senior official said.\n \n\n   \n  A former senior Pentagon official pointed to the logistical challenges of doing what the memo says is required, telling CNN that the Defense Department does thousands of engagements with Congress and state officials a month, talking with staffers regularly on everything from personnel and military installation issues to operational details. It would be logistically challenging to get prior approval and coordination for every one of those engagements.\n \n\n   \n  The memo says that the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, Dane Hughes, will conduct a review of all congressional affairs activities and submit a report to Hegseth detailing how to streamline activities, current issues with the congressional engagement process and more.\n \n\n   \n  Hughes said in a memo signed October 17 that he would be convening a working group as part of his review and directed senior leaders and combatant commanders to provide a senior official from their office who oversees legislative functions to participate.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/india/india-new-delhi-pollution-diwali-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"03:19:00-04:00","title":"After festival of lights, New Delhi plunged into toxic darkness and world’s most polluted air","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Diwali celebrations, New Delhi faced one of the most polluted air conditions in the world, with PM2.5 levels more than 40 times the WHO guideline due to fireworks and widespread stubble burning.

The Bloc Québécois have 22 seats.\n \n\n   \n  Carney won the election in a  stunning comeback  for his party,  abetted by US President Donald Trump’s threats  to enact sweeping tariffs on Canada and annex the country as the 51st US state.\n \n\n   \n  But Bloc Québécois incumbent Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné challenged the result, after a voter came forward to say her mail-in ballot, which she had cast for her, had not been counted.\n \n\n   \n  Terrebonne resident Emmanuelle Bossé  told public broadcaster CBC Radio-Canada  in May her ballot was returned to sender because of an incorrect postal code on the return envelope provided by the national elections commission.\n \n\n   \n  According to statements filed in the case at the province’s top court, an Elections Canada employee discovered he had mistakenly printed his own postal code on dozens of ballots in the lead-up to election day, according to the Canadian Press news agency.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t the one who got Elections Canada’s address wrong on the envelope,” Bossé told Radio-Canada. “Elections Canada glued this label on the envelope.”\n \n\n   \n  Bossé said she was upset her vote hadn’t been counted, especially given how close the race was.\n \n\n   \n  “I voted for the Bloc,” Bossé told Radio-Canada. “So it was maybe the vote that could have changed something.”\n \n\n   \n  The election result was muddled from the start. Auguste was initially projected to win the seat by just 35 votes. But following a standard validation process, Terrebonne went to Sinclair-Desgagné by 44 votes.\n \n\n   \n  The tight race triggered a judicial recount – required by law for any race won by a margin of less than 0.1%. Following the recount, Auguste was renamed the winner on May 10 with a total of 23,352 votes – just one more than Sinclair-Desgagné.\n \n\n   \n  In Quebec’s Superior Court this week, lawyers for both candidates put forward competing arguments over whether the result should be upheld, or if a new election should be called.\n \n\n   \n  Sinclair-Desgagné’s lawyer Stéphane Chatigny told the court Monday that solidifying the election result would “send a disastrous message to voters” and “undermine public confidence,” according to Canadian Press.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Auguste’s lawyer Marc-Étienne Vien said cancelling the result would “deny the right to vote” of the tens of thousands of Terrebonne residents that cast their ballots in April.\n \n\n   \n  David Baum, lawyer for Elections Canada, told the court elections are “not designed to achieve perfection,” according to the Canadian Press.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a big, complex machine, and errors are inevitable,” Baum said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump-visit-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:44:00-04:00","title":"North Korea test-fires ballistic missiles ahead of Trump’s Asia trip","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"North Korea conducted its first ballistic missile test in five months on October 22, 2025, launching short-range missiles from south of Pyongyang toward the northeast, with the South Korean military detecting and confirming they did not land in the sea.

ahead of Trump’s Asia trip \n       \n  Story by the Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:44 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  North Korea performed its first ballistic missile tests in five months Wednesday, days before US President Donald Trump and other leaders are expected to meet in South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  South Korea’s military said it detected multiple short-range ballistic missiles that were launched from an area south of Pyongyang and flew about 350 kilometers (220 miles) toward the northeast. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t release more specific flight details but said the missiles didn’t land in the sea.\n \n\n   \n  The Joint Chiefs added that the South’s military remains ready to repel any provocations by North Korea based on its solid military alliance with the United States.\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s new Prime Minister  Sanae Takaichi  told reporters that Tokyo was closely communicating with Washington and Seoul, including by sharing real-time missile warning data. North Korea didn’t immediately comment on the launches.\n \n\n   \n   Trump is to leave for Asia  at the end of the week in the first trip to the region of his second term. He plans to go to Malaysia first for a regional summit, and then head to Japan before travelling on to South Korea for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, an annual summit meant to promote economic integration and trade.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was expected to visit the South Korean city of Gyeongju ahead of the summit for bilateral meetings with leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, but South Korean officials say Trump won’t likely attend APEC’s main conference set for Oct. 30-Nov. 1.\n \n\n   \n  Experts earlier said North Korea could conduct provocative missile tests before or during the APEC summit to underscore its commitment to gain recognition as a nuclear weapons state. Experts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would need that status to call for the U.N. to lift the economic sanctions punishing it for its weapons program.\n \n\n   \n  Wednesday’s ballistic missile launches by North Korea were the first of their kind since the country on May 8 tested short-range systems that simulated nuclear counterstrikes against US and South Korean forces. They were also North Korea’s first ballistic missile testing activities since Lee took office in June with a promise to push to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n \n\n   \n  Kim has been sharply accelerating the pace of weapons tests since his high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over the US-led economic sanctions. But last month, Kim suggested he could return to talks if the US drops its demand for North Korea’s denuclearization, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Kim displayed  a new intercontinental ballistic missile  at a military parade attended by Chinese, Russian and other top officials. The parade highlighted Kim’s growing diplomatic footing and his relentless drive to build a reliable arsenal of nuclear missiles targeting the US and its allies.\n \n\n   \n  North Korea’s state media said the Oct. 10 parade featured the Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, which it described as the country’s “most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system.” Observers said the new ICBM is designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to defeat US missile defenses and that North Korea could test-launch it in coming months.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/sport/football-nfl-week-7-takeaways-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"04:51:00Z","title":"NFL Week 7 Takeaways: Second-year QBs ascending to stardom, Colts duo on historic pace, is Chiefs offense back to its best?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season featured standout performances from second-year quarterbacks Caleb Williams and Drake Maye, who are rapidly establishing themselves as stars after early-season struggles.

best? NFL Week 7 takeaways \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:51 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Outside of arguably the wildest ending to a regular season game in recent NFL history,  Week 7  had plenty of other talking points.\n \n\n   \n  Whether it be the Philadelphia Eagles finally getting their offense back on track or the never-ending struggles of the New York Jets, the unusually parity-filled season in the NFL continues to produce storylines.\n \n\n   \n  Here are the three main takeaways from Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season.\n \n\n   \n    Second-year QBs ascending to stardom\n \n\n   \n  Last season saw 2024 No. 2 overall pick  Jayden Daniels  explode as a rookie sensation with the Washington Commanders.\n \n\n   \n  This year though, the two passers picked either side of Daniels in last year’s draft – No. 1 pick Caleb Williams and No. 3 pick Drake Maye – are having their time in the spotlight.\n \n\n   \n  After losing the first two games of the  season , Williams and the Chicago Bears have won their last four games under first-year head coach Ben Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  Although Sunday’s 26-14 win over the New Orleans Saints wasn’t a vintage Williams performance – he threw 15-of-26 for 172 passing yards with no touchdowns, one interception and two fumbles – his overall confidence level appears to have improved in Johnson’s offensive system.\n \n\n   \n  The 23-year-old came into the league as the consensus top pick in last year’s draft but struggled as a rookie, in a season which saw the Bears fire their head coach Matt Eberflus following a  disastrous Thanksgiving Day loss .\n \n\n   \n  After a game where everything wasn’t smooth sailing – Chicago had plenty of pre-snap penalties and Williams’ two fumbles came on botched snaps with the center – the young quarterback says these experiences are important if the team are going to continue improving.\n \n\n   \n  “Days like today are needed, just in the sense of it gives you a little bit more to be able to look back on something and figure out what’s important,” Williams told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “You have these moments, and then you get later in the season and you may start to have one of these moments, and you get to go back to the feeling, go back to what was wrong and what you needed to figure out early in the season. So it’s like: ‘Okay, I remember what it was, I remember how I can fix it.’”\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Maye is also thriving in New England under a new head coach with the experienced Mike Vrabel now at the helm and long-time playcaller for Tom Brady, Josh McDaniels, installed as offensive coordinator.\n \n\n   \n  Maye and the Patriots are also riding their own four-game winning streak following a 31-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Maye was almost perfect in the win, throwing 21-of-23 for 222 yards and two touchdowns, while also running for 62 yards on eight carries.\n \n\n   \n  As the Pats look for the quarterback to fill the sizable void left by the legendary Brady, Maye’s outing on Sunday hinted he might be just that man; his 91.3% completion rate broke Brady’s single-game franchise record of 88.5%, which he set against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2009.\n \n\n   \n  It’s rare you have three potential star quarterbacks in the same draft but Williams and Maye are showing that together with Daniels, they could make the 2024 class one for the ages.\n \n\n   \n    Colts duo on historic pace\n \n\n   \n  No one could’ve predicted how well this Indianapolis Colts season is going.\n \n\n   \n  Quarterback Daniel Jones was coming off being cut by the New York Giants and spending time as a reserve QB for the Minnesota Vikings. Jones won the starting job after an offseason battle with 2024 fourth overall pick Anthony Richardson but expectations were not high.\n \n\n   \n  However, the Colts have been everything and more through seven weeks of the 2025 campaign.\n \n\n   \n  Their 38-24 win over the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday saw them hold onto their spot atop the AFC and improve their record to 6-1.\n \n\n   \n  Indy’s proficient offense, led by Jones and running back Jonathan Taylor, has scored 232 points, averaging a league-best 33.1 per game. The 232-point tally is the most scored by a Colts team through seven games since 1964,  per the NFL .\n \n\n   \n   According to NFL researcher John Todd , Jones is the first player to complete two-thirds of his passes and have 200-or-more pass yards in each of his first seven games of a season since at least 1950.\n \n\n   \n  Jones has undoubtedly been helped by Taylor’s excellence; on Sunday, he rushed for 94 yards and three touchdowns on 16 carries. It is his third game this year with at least three rushing scores.\n \n\n   \n  In doing so, he became the  fourth player since 1950  to have at least three games of scoring three-plus rushing touchdowns within the first seven games of the season, joining Derrick Henry, Priest Holmes and Jim Brown.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor  leads the NFL  in rushing yards (697) and rushing touchdowns (10) and is second in the league in rushing attempts (131). He led the league in all three categories in the 2021 season and, if he was to do so again this year, he’d be the first player since Brown to achieve the feat more than once.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s the best back in the league right now, there’s no doubt,” Colts head coach Shane Steichen said of Taylor. “He’s running hard, he’s running physical, he’s got great vision. Yeah, he’s just balling out man.”\n \n\n   \n  The Colts are the surprise playoff contenders, but if Jones and Taylor can keep performing at the highest level, who’s to say a deep postseason run couldn’t be on the cards?\n \n\n   \n    Is the Chiefs offense back to its best?\n \n\n   \n  When Patrick Mahomes exploded onto the scene with the Kansas City Chiefs, he had a revolutionary effect on how offenses operate in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  But as defenses have found ways to slow him down and some of the Kansas City QB’s key contributors have moved on or gotten older, the Chiefs offense has transitioned into more of a dink-and-dunk operation.\n \n\n   \n  That is until this year.\n \n\n   \n  After a slow opening two weeks, the explosive plays are back for Mahomes and the Chiefs, culminating in their 31-0 domination of the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas City has now scored over 30 points in its past four games – in contrast, they had scored 30 points or more six times over the past two seasons combined – and, following the return of receiver Rashee Rice from his  six-game suspension , boasts a plethora of offensive weapons.\n \n\n   \n  Rice was playing at an All-Pro level last year before suffering a torn ACL, second-year receiver Xavier Worthy is always improving and even tight end Travis Kelce is appearing more sprightly than last campaign.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Mahomes threw three touchdown passes – two to the returning Rice and one to Marquise Brown – while Isiah Pacheco ran for another. It was the 28th game of Mahomes’ career where he’s had at least three TD passes and no interceptions, surpassing Russell Wilson for the most such games by a quarterback in their first nine seasons in NFL history.\n \n\n   \n  It was also the 93 rd  regular season victory of his career, passing Peyton Manning for the most regular-season wins ever by a player under the age of 31.\n \n\n   \n  After Sunday’s dominant victory over the Raiders, head coach Andy Reid highlighted the impact of having Rice back on the field to help the offense.\n \n\n   \n  “He did a great job. I was a little cautious with him on how many plays and all that. I thought he came out and functioned at a high level for being gone for all this time,” Reid told reporters. “It’s crazy that he can come back and do what he did and do it at the level that he did it at.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ll gradually build him up. We’ll get his reps up here a little bit as we go. You got to be careful with that when somebody’s been off for a while. I thought all of them together did some really good things. … There’s a lot of things happening there that are positive.”\n \n\n   \n  Even though the Chiefs’ 4-3 record is some way off the top of the AFC at the moment – the Colts lead the conference with a 6-1 record with the Patriots and Denver Broncos sitting at 5-2 – this revival in offensive production has put the rest of the league on notice.

Here’s who gets paid — and who doesn’t — during a federal government shutdown \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Federal workers are bearing the brunt of the government shutdown, with more than 1 million of them  going unpaid  while Democrats and Republicans in Congress argue over funding federal agencies for the current fiscal year.\n \n\n   \n  But those lawmakers on Capitol Hill aren’t missing any paychecks during the impasse, which began October 1, with no end in sight. They continue to receive their salaries, as directed by the  Constitution  – although some have said they wouldn’t accept their pay or will donate the money.\n \n\n   \n  Shutdowns typically fall unevenly on those who work for the federal government. And this time, President Donald Trump is taking additional steps to shield — at least temporarily — certain employees and the  military  from the financial pain, even as he threatens that hundreds of thousands of other staffers may never receive the  back pay  guaranteed to them under a 2019 law that he signed.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Senate GOP leaders will put to a vote a bill that would  pay certain essential workers  during the shutdown, though Democrats don’t seem inclined to support the measure unless it applies to all federal staffers who aren’t being paid during the impasse. Some GOP lawmakers are also questioning the effort, saying it would remove one of the  main pressure points  that could help end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  With many federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, missing even one can be financially devastating. Scores of federal employees have written to CNN about the economic toll the shutdown is taking on them and their families, leaving them at risk of losing their homes or cars or making it difficult for them to feed and provide for their families.\n \n\n   \n    Here’s who gets paid\n \n\n   \n  In addition to lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and federal judges will still receive their paychecks, thanks to the Constitution. So will political appointees who are confirmed by the Senate, along with certain other appointees.\n \n\n   \n  Also, roughly 830,000 federal workers are continuing to be paid during the impasse, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center review of shutdown contingency plans filed by agencies. That’s because their compensation doesn’t rely on annual appropriations from Congress. Instead, they are paid through other spending packages, such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, through fees or through other resources.\n \n\n   \n  Only days before the roughly 2 million active-duty and reserve members of the military were set to  miss their first paychecks , the Trump administration announced it would use about $8 billion in Pentagon research and development funds to cover the October 15 payroll. But there isn’t enough money for the next distribution at the end of the month.\n \n\n   \n  In addition, the Trump administration has  moved to pay  Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents, according to Kash Pael, the agency’s director. Plus, 70,000 law enforcement personnel in the  Department of Homeland Security , including in Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Secret Service and other divisions will receive their paychecks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem  posted on X. \n \n\n   \n    Here’s who doesn’t get paid\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 730,000 federal employees are working without pay, while another roughly 670,000 have been furloughed, according to the latest estimate from the Bipartisan Policy Center. However, agencies have made changes as the shutdown drags on. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service originally said it would use the Inflation Reduction Act to keep paying all of its roughly 74,300 employees but a week later decided to  furlough nearly half its workforce .\n \n\n   \n   Senate staffers  learned Friday that they will not receive their October 20 paychecks and won’t be paid for the remainder of the shutdown, while the judicial branch announced that it has run out of funding to sustain full operations. Essential staff will stay on the job, working without pay, while other court employees will be furloughed.\n \n\n   \n  In the past, federal workers typically received back pay when impasses ended, but Congress made it official in 2019. However, the White House budget office is considering a new interpretation of that law, arguing it doesn’t cover furloughed employees.\n \n\n   \n  Many  federal contractors , including those who handle security, clean offices and staff the cafes in federal buildings, are also laid off during shutdowns. But unlike federal workers, they have no guarantee of being made whole at the end of the impasse.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/us/united-cockpit-window-weather-balloon-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-04:00","title":"United flight’s cockpit window may have been struck by weather balloon, company says","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A United Airlines Boeing 737 flight, United Flight 1093, experienced a cockpit window crack during its journey from Denver to Los Angeles, which injured the first officer and led to an emergency landing in Salt Lake City.

Zalmanovich and Tamir Adar’s remains had been identified and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had informed their families,   a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  Two coffins carrying the bodies of Zalmanovich and Adar crossed the border into Israel earlier on Tuesday and were taken to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine for formal identification and to investigate the causes of death.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has now returned 15 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages outlined in the US-proposed ceasefire agreement, which was signed on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  Zalmanovich was abducted alive from his house at Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel during the October 7 attacks and is thought to have been killed in captivity on November 17, 2023, at the age of 85.\n \n\n   \n  He was the oldest hostage taken by Hamas, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement, describing him as “a tough and modest man who demanded nothing for himself.” The kibbutz said he was one of the founders of the community.\n \n\n   \n  Tamir Adar, also from Kibbutz Nir Oz, died fighting to defend it against Hamas on October 7, 2023, and his body was taken to Gaza, the IDF said. He was 38 at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “Those close to him describe him as sociable and beloved, a thoughtful and sensitive conversationalist with a keen sense of humor,” the families’ forum said.\n \n\n   \n  “The government of Israel shares in the deep sorrow of the Zalmanovich and Adar families, and of all the families of the fallen hostages,” the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n    A grandfather and a family man\n \n\n   \n  Zalmanovich was a father of two, a grandfather of five and “a man of the land,” said a spokesperson for the Nir Oz Kibbutz.\n \n\n   \n  A farmer by occupation, he grew wheat “in the harsh conditions of the Negev” and “agriculture was the center of his life,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  As a founding member of the community, Zalmanovich, known as Zalman, “saw the kibbutz as the fulfillment of his life and his home, and the community as his family,” the statement added.\n \n\n   \n  “We will always remember Zalman as an honest and humble worker, an idealist and a farmer at heart and soul,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  Adar, a father of two, was described as a “family man, a lover of people and nature, a farmer and an educator by profession,” by the kibbutz spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  An avid supporter of Maccabi Tel Aviv Football Club, Adar was “always surrounded by friends and loved by everyone,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  “He was very fond of birds of prey and used to follow them with binoculars while working in the fields and on trips,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  “We will remember Tamir as a dedicated educator, connected to nature and agriculture, a beloved husband, father, son, brother and grandson who is missed by all of us,” the kibbutz said.\n \n\n   \n  Under the Trump administration’s ceasefire agreement, Hamas was supposed to return all the living and deceased hostages within the first 72 hours of the ceasefire going into effect.  Israeli intelligence has assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has said “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies in Gaza. One of the bodies handed over by Hamas under the agreement last week did not belong to an Israeli hostage, according to the Israeli military.\n \n\n   \n  Initial assessments at the time suggested Hamas misidentified the body rather than intentionally sending the wrong one, an Israeli source said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Not going to happen overnight’\n \n\n   \n  The latest hostage release comes hours after US Vice President JD Vance touched down in Israel and the Trump administration moves to implement the next phase of its ceasefire plan.\n \n\n   \n  Over the weekend, Israel and Hamas  affirmed their commitment  to the ceasefire deal after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers, prompting waves of airstrikes.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas and the Israeli military have each accused the other of violations.\n \n\n   \n  Vance on Tuesday  downplayed concerns  about the fragility of the ceasefire  but declined to put a timeline on the return of all deceased hostages and Hamas’ complete disarmament.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a focus of everybody here to get those bodies back home to their families, so that they can have a proper burial. Now, that said, this is difficult. This is not going to happen overnight,” Vance said at a press conference in Israel.\n \n\n   \n  The US vice president also said some of the deceased hostages are “buried under thousands of pounds of rubble.

poll shows Americans aren’t laughing \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:02 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republicans have spent many days trying to marginalize the massive anti-Trump “No Kings” rallies held across the country over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  They’ve argued the people involved were extremists and even  predicted they would be violent  (which turned out not to be true). They’ve claimed the protesters hate America. And they’ve argued that the “No Kings” message itself is nonsensical, given President Donald Trump is a democratically elected president who sometimes works with Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Sunday that the people were “not representative of this country.” He and his team have taken to mockingly posting memes and AI videos  with Trump donning a crown  — including one that the president shared in which he dumps brown waste on protesters.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson added Monday night on Fox News that the protesters’ messages were “completely the opposite of what America was founded upon.”\n \n\n   \n  New polling, though, reinforces how much the thrust of the “No Kings” message has resonated with much of the American public.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, a majority of Americans appear sympathetic to it, at least to some extent. And their ranks appear to be growing.\n \n\n   \n  The  survey from the Public Religion Research Institute  gave people two options. One was that Trump is a “potentially dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys democracy.” The other was that he’s a “strong leader who should be given the power he needs to restore America’s greatness.”\n \n\n   \n  Americans chose the “dictator” option by a strong margin, 56%-41%.\n \n\n   \n  And notably, that margin has nearly doubled since April, when Americans also sided with the “dictator” option but  by a smaller, 52%-44% margin .\n \n\n   \n  The same poll also showed a 54% majority sided with the view that Trump is waging an “assault on constitutional balances and the rule of law.” The alternative was that his overhaul of the federal government is “a long-overdue correction of disastrous policies” (43%).\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible to oversell poll numbers like this. Giving people binary choices can inflate numbers by making people choose one extreme or another. People who don’t like Trump but don’t think he’s a dictator might feel compelled to choose the “dictator” option to avoid endorsing a man they don’t like.\n \n\n   \n  But tellingly, the poll also asked people about the strength of their views. Fully 45% of Americans said they “strongly” agreed Trump was a dangerous dictator, and 43% strongly agreed that he’s waging an assault on checks and balances and the rule of law.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, nearly half of independents strongly agreed with those sentiments.\n \n\n   \n  These are, to put it mildly, not insignificant numbers. Say what you will about elements of the “No Kings” rallies; this polling suggests the thrust of the demonstrations hardly appears ridiculous to a majority of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And this is merely the latest indicator that huge numbers of Americans have such concerns.\n \n\n   \n    Clear majorities see him exceeding his powers\n \n\n   \n  Whether “dictator” or “king” are particularly apt labels, Americans are clearly sympathetic to the idea that Trump is abusing his power.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the rallies Saturday, a number of conservatives argued that invoking “Kings” was a non sequitur, given Trump was popularly elected in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t understand how Trump is a King when he won every single swing state, the electoral college and popular vote in a democratic election,”  said  Meghan McCain.\n \n\n   \n  Fox News analyst Brit Hume noted that at least some of Trump’s policies have gotten congressional approval. “ Some King ,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But there is no question that Trump has disregarded the limits of his authority — and disregarded Congress — in extraordinary ways. The protesters don’t seem to be arguing that Trump is technically a monarch, so much as that he’s seeking to exercise unchecked power when he can.\n \n\n   \n  And that seems to be an argument that a majority of Americans sympathize with.\n \n\n   \n    Many have worried about this for a long time\n \n\n   \n  If anything, these concerns already existed and have just gotten more pronounced as Trump has grabbed for more power.\n \n\n   \n  Before Trump’s second term began:\n \n\n   \n    It’s not just a partisan thing\n \n\n   \n  It might be tempting to look at these numbers and think, well, it’s just partisan.\n \n\n   \n  A decade ago, many Republicans  accused Barack Obama of acting like a king , too. And what about when Joe Biden tried to work around a Supreme Court ruling invalidating his move on student loans?\n \n\n   \n  But Americans clearly see a difference with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  For one, in that last poll mentioned above, only about 2 in 10 voters said Trump’s then-opponent, Kamala Harris, was a fascist — less than half of Trump’s number.\n \n\n   \n  For another, the Washington Post-Ipsos poll showed just 34% of Americans thought Biden had exceeded his authorities, compared with Trump’s 62%.\n \n\n   \n  And perhaps tellingly, the AP-NORC poll in April showed a majority of Americans suddenly wanted to restrict that presidency in ways they hadn’t before. The percentage who said a president has “too much” power rose from 32% last year (under Biden) all the way up to 54% (under Trump).\n \n\n   \n  All of which suggests Americans — or at least a majority of them — see something extraordinary happening right now.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans can try to diminish the “No Kings” rallies all they want, but they’re speaking to something that’s very real to lots of people.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/trump-israel-gaza-vance-ukraine-russia-putin-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-04:00","title":"Reality catches up with Trump’s Ukraine peace drive and threatens his Mideast push","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's ambitious peace initiatives in Ukraine and the Middle East are faltering despite high-profile efforts.

peace drive and threatens his Mideast push \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:00 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Wishing for peace is far easier than making peace.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s grand ambitions in the Middle East and Ukraine are struggling against their own internal limitations and the horrific hangovers of two brutal wars.\n \n\n   \n  Trump ditched plans for a quick second summit with  Russian President Vladimir Putin , declaring Tuesday that he didn’t want to waste his time, in the latest dizzying gyration of his drama-laden but so far futile peace push.\n \n\n   \n  And  Vice President JD Vance  rushed to the Middle East, where Trump  just last week  expressed hopes he’d forged “everlasting peace.” The ceasefire he brokered  between Israel and Hamas  is holding … just.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s critics might take some satisfaction that his big plans risk stalling out. He’s brought some skepticism on himself with his hyperbolic presentation of promising incremental events as epochal breakthroughs. But rooting against him just to deprive him of wins would be crass, given that global stability and thousands of lives may depend on Trump’s success.\n \n\n   \n    Trump needs to work both wars around the clock\n \n\n   \n  Complications bursting up around both of Trump’s major peace efforts underscore how constant US engagement is needed along with the president’s personal attention despite the constant whirl of controversy that surrounds him.\n \n\n   \n  After he halted fighting in Gaza, a significant achievement, there were hopes he could vault into a fresh attempt to end the murderous  war in Ukraine  after previous efforts foundered following his August summit with a stubborn Putin.\n \n\n   \n  But on Tuesday, the president called an abrupt halt to the latest chapter in his wild ride with Putin, making clear that a summit he’d predicted could take place in Budapest within weeks was no longer on the front burner.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to have a wasted meeting. I don’t want to have a waste of time,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after a call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart on Monday failed to yield breakthroughs.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s disappointment was the latest shift in a confusing week in which he seemed poised to send  cruise missiles  to Ukraine, was talked down by Putin and then had a new Oval Office clash with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .\n \n\n   \n  So far, Trump’s Ukrainian efforts are only achieving one thing — disproving his own questionable assertions that Putin wants peace.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president’s hurried attempt to shore up progress in the Middle East, meanwhile, is meant to stop the administration’s other big peace initiative suffering a similar fate. After the fanfare of Trump’s victory lap in the region, the liabilities of his approach are becoming clear.\n \n\n   \n  The big question was always how to bridge an initial pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas and the ambitious peace plan that envisages Hamas giving up weapons and disengaging politically.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s visit followed — seeking to create an illusion of forward momentum to allow negotiators time to try to fill vacuums.\n \n\n   \n  The ceasefire teetered after Israel accused Hamas of killing two Israeli soldiers at the weekend and launched a wave of airstrikes that killed dozens of people in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  But Vance, seeking to stop the situation deteriorating further, sought to reassert the big picture in a symbolic warning to Israel and Hamas to stick to the terms of the agreement. His visit also demonstrated US commitment to key Arab states needed to implement Trump’s plan.\n \n\n   \n  “What we’ve seen the past week gives me great optimism the ceasefire is going to hold,” Vance said in an upbeat assessment that didn’t necessarily jibe with reality. “I feel very optimistic. Can I say with 100% certainty that it’s going to work? No.”\n \n\n   \n    How the latest Russia plan fizzled\n \n\n   \n  If Trump needed confirmation that Putin is not ready to make peace in Ukraine, he got one in a swarm of drones that attacked Ukrainian power plants in a return to a brutal strategy of  using winter as a weapon  against shivering civilians.\n \n\n   \n  The US president had hoped for signs of true policy shifts from Russia to justify a relaunching of his personal diplomacy with Putin. But the Kremlin strongman just played his classic card, calling Trump a day before he hosted Zelensky in the White House in a show of flexibility designed to mitigate new US pressure and the president’s anger and frustration.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had been speculating about sending Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine that would allow Kyiv’s forces to reach deep into Russia. But he snatched the idea off the table after speaking to Putin and rounded on Zelensky instead. But then, the call between Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday showed that any fresh summit would mirror Alaska’s impasse.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has not fundamentally changed a position that Ukraine could never accept. It wants Kyiv to cede territory in two eastern regions,  Luhansk and Donetsk , that it has been unable to fully capture in three years of fighting. Ukraine says such a step would leave it dangerously vulnerable to a future attack by Russia launched from the key lands.\n \n\n   \n  The melodrama repeated a well-worn cycle. Putin reacted when Trump looked like he might impose a price for Russian intransigence. Then the US president, after speaking to Putin, imposed pressure on Ukraine to give up territory. Then the process hit a wall again, leaving Trump frustrated.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is now back to his previous position that the enemies should stop fighting at current frontlines. “The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this, we take that,’” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky had earlier predicted that nothing will happen without Trump trying to coerce Putin to the table. “As soon as the issue of long-range capabilities became a little further away for us — for Ukraine — Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,” he said in his daily address on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The impasse suits Putin, who shows no sign of wanting to stop fighting and could use more time to pursue his war of attrition with the goal of winning as much Ukrainian territory as possible before any peace talks.\n \n\n   \n  After a week of acrimony and shifting positions, nothing much has changed.\n \n\n   \n    The Middle East win was meant to inject a boost into the Russia effort\n \n\n   \n  Time is also a problem in the Israel-Hamas standoff. The current interregnum between the ceasefire deal and the implementation of later steps of Trump’s deal are allowing tensions to boil and threats to its durability to grow.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas has used the end of fighting with Israel to reassert its control over Palestinians in Gaza with revenge killings against alleged collaborators, raising doubts that it will ever lay down its arms as Trump demands. An international peace force is envisaged to keep permanent peace in the Gaza Strip, but until it can be formed, the ceasefire will remain fragile.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s trip was a sign to Netanyahu of just how important maintaining the ceasefire is to Trump and to states including Qatar and Turkey that they must keep up their pressure on Hamas to follow his 20-point plan. US negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff will seek to use the cover provided by Vance to try to create some progress to keep momentum alive.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s about 10 Tier-1 priorities, and we’re working all of them in parallel,” Kushner said in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  But more incidents in which Israeli soldiers die would almost certainly prod it to reopen hostilities with Hamas. This is why the complex transitional elements of the peace plan must be implemented quickly.\n \n\n   \n  “The critical issue right now is to begin to put in place the alternative administration. That starts with the Board of Peace, reinforced by having this technocratic Palestinian administration, and it is further strengthened by having the International Stabilization Force,” former US peace negotiator Dennis Ross told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga on Monday. “All that has to be implemented sooner rather than later. That creates some momentum on its own.”\n \n\n   \n  So far, however, the stabilization force hasn’t got much past the theoretical stage, prompting Trump to try to push regional powers into hurrying along.\n \n\n   \n  “Numerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East, have explicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and ‘straighten our Hamas’ if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  No regional states are publicly lining up to send their young soldiers into Gaza to insert them between Israeli and Hamas forces. So the president’s post was closer to hope than reality — a description that regrettably also applies to his interrupted plan to end the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  But at least he’s trying. And it’s not too late yet.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/europe/louvre-heist-jewels-recovery-scli-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"04:27:00Z","title":"Stolen Louvre Jewelry Estimated to Be Worth $102 Million, Prosecutor Says, as Search Continues","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A high-profile heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, in October 2025, involved the theft of valuable royal jewelry, including a tiara and necklace from Queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense, and an emerald necklace from Napoleon’s wedding to Marie-Louise.

Louvre jewelry estimated to be worth $102 million, prosecutor says, as search continues \n       \n  By Jack Guy, Caitlin Danaher, Pierre Meilhan, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:27 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The jewelry taken from the  Louvre  Museum in Paris is estimated to be worth 88 million euros ($102 million), according to a French prosecutor, as the search continues for the stolen treasures.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told French radio station RTL the value of the loot taken in Sunday’s daylight robbery had been estimated by the museum’s curator.\n \n\n   \n  “This sum is indeed spectacular, but we must remember that this damage is economic. But it has nothing parallel or comparable to the historical damage caused by this theft,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Around 100 investigators are involved in the manhunt to track down the criminals who made off with artifacts from the French crown jewels, dating from the Napoleonic era, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Experts fear that the prospects of recovering the jewelry are slim. But Beccuau warned that the thieves may struggle to obtain the loot’s value if they chose to dismantle the pieces to resell the jewels or melt down the metals.\n \n\n   \n  The Louvre remained closed on Tuesday, in accordance with its scheduled opening times, but is due to reopen on Wednesday. The Apollo Gallery targeted by the thieves will remain closed.\n \n\n   \n    How did the heist happen?\n \n\n   \n  The thieves used a truck-mounted ladder to gain access to the Apollo Gallery, one of the most ornate rooms in the Louvre, through a window.\n \n\n   \n  Armed with tools including an angle grinder and a blowtorch, they targeted two high-security display cases.\n \n\n   \n  Paris prosecutors say it took the robbers four minutes to break into the gallery, snatch the jewelry, and leave.\n \n\n   \n  “At 9:34 a.m., half an hour after opening, two men wearing yellow vests broke a window,” the prosecutor’s office said in a Monday statement. The robbers “left at 9:38 a.m,” and left on two scooters “along the banks of the Seine.”\n \n\n   \n  The entire operation lasted just seven minutes, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n    What was stolen?\n \n\n   \n  Among the items taken from the Louvre was a diamond and sapphire jewelry set including a tiara and necklace worn by Queen Marie-Amélie and Queen Hortense.\n \n\n   \n  The diadem – a jeweled headpiece worn by royalty – features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Also stolen was an emerald necklace and earrings set that was a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Marie-Louise of Austria, in March 1810, containing 32 intricately cut emeralds and 1,138 diamonds.\n \n\n   \n  Eight of the nine items taken remain unaccounted for.\n \n\n   \n    Wider implications for France\n \n\n   \n  French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin admitted that the Louvre heist exposed security failings at the museum.\n \n\n   \n  “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn’t been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road,” he said on France Inter radio. “What is certain is that we have failed.”\n \n\n   \n  “The French people all feel like they’ve been robbed,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Elaine Sciolino, author of “Adventures in the Louvre: How to Fall in Love with the World’s Greatest Museum,” emphasized the significance of a robbery at the Louvre, which was originally built as a fortress before becoming a palace for the French royal family.\n \n\n   \n  “This attack really is a dagger into the heart of France and French history,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    How is the investigation going?\n \n\n   \n  Investigators do not have any solid leads as to who was behind the heist but are slowly amassing a body of evidence, a law enforcement official in France who has been briefed on the ongoing investigation told CNN on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  The thieves were not able to burn the truck they used for the break in, so investigators are combing it for any traces of DNA, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  As part of this process, investigators have had to build a tent around the truck so they can fume it to bring forth fingerprints, which has slowed down the process slightly, the official said.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, investigators recovered one of the two scooters the thieves used to get away, according to the official. They have also retrieved a helmet believed to have been worn by one of the thieves, the official added.\n \n\n   \n    Will the jewelry be recovered?\n \n\n   \n  Natalie Goulet, a Centrist member of the French senate, told CNN on Monday that she believes the jewelry has probably already been taken out of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that the pieces are already abroad,” she said. “I think it’s lost forever.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet also appeared on BBC Radio about the prospects of recovering the jewelry, replying: “None.”\n \n\n   \n  “The jewelry will be cut up and sold and used as a money-laundering system,” she said. “It’s the easiest way to clean dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  The robbery was probably linked to organized crime, Goulet said.\n \n\n   \n  “They have absolutely no morals,” she said. “They don’t appreciate the jewelry as a piece of history but the way to clean their dirty money.”\n \n\n   \n  Goulet added that she was “very, very pessimistic” about the prospects of recovering the jewelry.\n \n\n   \n  Sciolino, the author, was similarly downbeat.\n \n\n   \n  “They can be dissembled, they can be cut, they can be sold on the black market,” she told BBC Radio. “It is unlikely that all of them are going to be recuperated in the shape that they are now.”\n \n\n   \n  Christopher Marinello, the founder of Art Recovery International, said that if the thieves are just looking to get cash out as quickly as possible, they might melt down the precious metals or recut the stones with no regard for the piece’s integrity.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to break up these gangs and find another approach, or we’re going to lose things that we are never going to see again,” Marinello told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    Past heists\n \n\n   \n  The most well-known robbery at the Louvre took place in August 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa was stolen off the museum’s walls by handyman Vincenzo Peruggia.\n \n\n   \n  It was 24 hours before anyone even noticed the Mona Lisa was missing, with artworks often removed to be photographed or cleaned.\n \n\n   \n  A bungling police investigation then dragged on for two years before the painting was recovered in December 1913, making it the most famous artwork in the world.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, a work by French painter Camille Corot was stolen from its frame in 1998 and has never been found.\n \n\n   \n  More recent heists at other European museums include the  theft of four ancient gold artifacts  from a museum in the Netherlands in January.\n \n\n   \n  Robbers used explosives to break into the Drents Museum in Assen, making off with three gold bracelets dating from around 50 BC, as well as the 5th-century BC gold Helmet of Cotofenesti, a historically important artifact on loan from the National History Museum of Romania in Bucharest.\n \n\n   \n   Correction:   This story has been updated to reflect that there was a theft from the Louvre in 1998. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/americas/peru-lima-state-of-emergency-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:54:00-04:00","title":"Peru declares 30-day state of emergency in Lima to tackle rising crime","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Peruvian President Jose Jeri declared a 30-day state of emergency in Lima and the neighboring province of Callao in response to rising crime and violent protests that left one person dead and over 100 injured.

Here’s what we know \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:36 AM EDT, Wed October 22, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Trump administration has been given the green light to send the Oregon National Guard into Portland after a federal appeals court on Monday overturned a lower court’s order to bar the deployment – but there’s at least one more legal hurdle to clear before there will be boots on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  “After considering the record at this preliminary stage, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority,” the 2-1  ruling  from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Monday said.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling, supported by two judges appointed by President Donald Trump, overturns a temporary restraining order issued by US District Judge Karin Immergut, who last week extended two orders blocking the mobilization of federal troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  It also marks a big win for the administration as it continues to battle other Democrat-led cities over troop deployment – efforts that local and state leaders say are a disproportionate response to protests against the administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what else we know:\n \n\n   \n    When will troops be deployed?\n \n\n   \n  The ruling overturns only one of two lower court decisions to block the deployment of the National Guard in Portland, and because a second decision is still in force, troops can’t immediately be mobilized.\n \n\n   \n  The second restraining order blocks the administration from mobilizing National Guard troops from anywhere in the US in Oregon. The administration argued in a Monday evening filing the second order should also be overruled given both lower court orders relied on the same legal reasoning.\n \n\n   \n  As the legal battle over Oregon continues, hundreds of National Guard troops are in a holding pattern far from home, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek said in a  news conference  Monday. “These citizen soldiers have been pulled away from their families and their jobs for weeks to carry out some kind of mission in Oregon.”\n \n\n   \n  If the second temporary restraining order is revoked, it is unclear when troops would be deployed or how many would be federalized, Kotek said, citing a lack of communication from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  “We have approximately 200 Oregon National Guard members still at Camp Rilea in limbo, as well as California National Guard members at Camp Withycombe. No idea of the mission. No idea of the timeline,” Kotek said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  A response Tuesday from the state of Oregon and others argued the court should not end or pause the second temporary restraining order.\n \n\n   \n  “Until there is an en banc vote, it would be legal error for this Court to construe the panel’s non-final decision as a ‘significant change in the law’ warranting dissolution of the Second TRO. Had Defendants appealed the Second TRO, the relief they now seek from this Court would already be before the Ninth Circuit,” the filing said.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, in their rush to file their Motion to Dissolve, Defendants have misconstrued the finality of the Ninth Circuit proceedings, failing to carry their burden for dissolution of the Second TRO,” it added.\n \n\n   \n    Will the state or city appeal?\n \n\n   \n  The sole dissenting vote on the three-judge appellate panel came from Judge Susan P. Graber, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.\n \n\n   \n  “Today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions,” Graber wrote in her dissent.\n \n\n   \n  Echoing Graber’s sentiments, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement, “Today’s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification.”\n \n\n   \n  Rayfield asked the 9th Circuit to “act swiftly” and throw out the majority’s ruling through an “en banc” review, in which a larger panel of 11 appellate judges would reconsider the case.   \n \n\n   \n  Separately, a 9th Circuit judge Monday afternoon asked the court to vote on whether the case should be reheard en banc. While such a request is not unusual, it’s more common for either plaintiffs or defendants to request such a rehearing.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the state and the Trump administration have until midnight on Wednesday to make their arguments.\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Portland against White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared  riot  and  arson  arrests in mid-summer. The scene was  largely calm  until Trump  declared  in late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials have characterized Oregon’s biggest city as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, which Kotek and other leaders in Oregon have  emphatically disputed . Kotek on Monday said in court that the situation in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Friday  to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, a group of senators, including those from Oregon, asked for an inquiry into recent deployments of National Guard troops across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The senators argued that deployments were dangerous, unconstitutional, and also “straining military readiness and resources,” according to the letter.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently request that you initiate an inquiry into the cumulative effects of these domestic deployments of U.S. active-duty troops and the National Guard—over the objections of state and local officials—on military readiness, resources, personnel, and our military as an institution,” the senators requested.\n \n\n   \n    What this means for other states\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s success in Oregon comes on the same day officials from Illinois and the city of Chicago asked the US Supreme Court to block the administration’s emergency request to keep National Guard troops in that state.\n \n\n   \n  The filing notes there is no rebellion or inability to execute federal law in Illinois, arguing the administration hasn’t met legal requirements to activate troops over the state’s dissent.\n \n\n   \n  “No protest activity in Illinois has rendered the President unable to execute federal law,” the filing says, describing protests at the ICE facility in Broadview, near Chicago, as “small,” manageable by local authorities and having “never hindered the continued operation of the ICE facility there.”\n \n\n   \n  The filing addresses constitutional concerns that the federal government is pressuring Illinois to either use its own National Guard to carry out the Trump administration’s priorities or let federal troops takeover, stating, “Such coercion is independently unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  The Monday filing comes after Trump on Friday  urged the Supreme Court  to allow him to deploy the National Guard in Chicago in an emergency appeal against a lower court order that blocked the deployment of troops in the city. That temporary restraining order is set to expire on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling, the administration argues, “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  Describing  those protesting  the administration in Chicago as “rioters” who are leading a “violent resistance,” the Trump administration  told the justices Tuesday  its decision to deploy the National Guard is unreviewable by courts or – at the very least – is entitled to great deference.\n \n\n   \n  “If the president’s determination is reviewable at all, such review must be extremely deferential,” the administration told the Supreme Court, pointing to recent decisions from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals that endorsed “the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles and Portland to address similar violent resistance to federal immigration enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  In Tennessee, a group of seven elected officials sued the governor and the state’s attorney general last week for allowing the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor (Bill) Lee’s deployment violates both the Tennessee Constitution and state statutes, which allow the Guard to be called up only in the event of a rebellion or invasion—and only when the General Assembly declares that public safety requires it,” the officials said in a  statement published  by the National Immigration Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  “No such conditions exist in Memphis today.”\n \n\n   \n  Lee’s office responded Monday to the lawsuit filed against him, saying the governor has the authority to deploy the state’s Guard troops under Tennessee law,  CNN affiliate WATN  reported.\n \n\n   \n  Federal troops were seen in Memphis for the first time on October 10,  the Associated Press reported , including soldiers accompanied by Memphis police officers patrolling at the Pyramid, a landmark in the city.\n \n\n   \n  And for the second time in a week, Trump said on Sunday he would send the National Guard to San Francisco, telling Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo that the city “went wrong, went woke.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to San Francisco and we’re going to make it great,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  In response to Trump’s comments, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a  video address  that sending the National Guard would not help with the city’s ongoing efforts to combat drug dealing.\n \n\n   \n  “I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers – and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,” the mayor said.\n \n\n   \n  While welcoming stronger coordination with federal authorities, Laurie cited declines in violent crime rate reaching “levels not seen since the 1950s” and record low tent camps to show the city achieving safety “without compromising on our values or our laws.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody wants you here,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom also said in a  social media post  in response to Trump’s comments. “You will ruin one of America’s greatest cities.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/trump-ballroom-east-wing-demolition-preservation-group","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:24:00-18:00","title":"Historic preservation group urges pause on East Wing demolition as Trump pushes ahead with his ballroom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A historic preservation group, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, has urged the Trump administration to halt the demolition of the White House East Wing, which is being torn down to make way for a new 90,000-square-foot privately funded ballroom.

Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:24 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One of the nation’s premier historic preservation groups on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to pause  demolition of the White House East Wing , which excavators began tearing into this week to make way for President Donald Trump’s planned  ballroom .\n \n\n   \n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Congressionally chartered non-profit tasked with preserving historic buildings, wrote in a  letter  to the National Park Service and two administration commissions that Trump’s proposed 90,000-square-foot addition would “overwhelm the White House itself — it is 55,000 square feet — and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House.”\n \n\n   \n  The alarm among preservationists at the demolition now underway reflected the shock many felt this week as images emerged of the East Wing facade being crushed into a pile of rubble.\n \n\n   \n  The work continued Tuesday as the excavators tore further into the building, the sounds of rhythmic pounding and occasional crashing drifting across the 18-acre White House campus.\n \n\n   \n  “You hear that sound? That’s music to my ears; I love that sound,” Trump told a group of Republican senators having lunch in the Rose Garden. Trump has said the $200 million project will be funded through private donations.\n \n\n   \n  The structure being demolished includes the suite of offices traditionally used by the first lady, as well as space for White House calligraphers, certain military aides, and the social secretary. Staffers in those departments have been relocated to other areas on the complex.\n \n\n   \n  The East Wing’s wood-paneled foyer has long been the main point of entry for visitors attending social events at the White House, as well as those going on tours of the building. The section emerged in its current form in 1942.\n \n\n   \n  While Trump announced months ago his plans to replace the East Wing with the new ballroom — a necessary addition, he says, to accommodate large events — the demolition appears to have proceeded without an extensive public review process.\n \n\n   \n  In Tuesday’s letter, the National Trust for Historic Preservation “respectfully” urged the administration to “pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public.”\n \n\n   \n  “These processes provide a crucial opportunity for transparency and broad engagement—values that have guided preservation of the White House under every administration going back to the public competition in 1792 that produced the building’s original design,” the letter read.\n \n\n   \n  The two commissions the letter was addressed to — the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts — have in the past reviewed proposed additions to the White House. That includes changes to the perimeter fence and the construction of a new tennis pavilion within the past decade.\n \n\n   \n  The current chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, Will Scharf, who serves as Trump’s staff secretary, said during a meeting of the commission last month that its jurisdiction covers construction, but not demolition — suggesting the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.\n \n\n   \n  “I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I’m excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,” Scharf said.\n \n\n   \n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation is not the only group to call for a more rigorous review of the ballroom project. Last week, before demolition began, the Society of Architectural Historians wrote in a  statement , “Such a significant change to a historic building of this import should follow a rigorous and deliberate design and review process.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s letter. But earlier Tuesday, officials distributed a lengthy list of past construction projects at the executive mansion, suggesting the ballroom fell into a pattern of improvements to the building.\n \n\n   \n  “In the latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump’s visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House — a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and renovations from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence as a beacon of American excellence,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  The images included construction of the West and East Wings, a multiyear gut renovation undertaken during Harry Truman’s administration, and the installation of a swimming pool overseen by Gerald Ford.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/asia/indonesia-uk-lindsay-sandiford-repatriated-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"21:46:00-04:00","title":"British grandmother spared firing squad in repatriation deal with Indonesia","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A British grandmother, Lindsay Sandiford, aged 68, was sentenced to death by firing squad in Indonesia in 2013 after being arrested in 2012 for smuggling 3.8 kilograms of cocaine, claiming she was forced to carry the drugs by a gang threatening her children.

     9:10 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Paul Ingrassia is no longer the nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, two White House officials told CNN on Tuesday, after his chances of getting through the Senate confirmation imploded following reports of racist text messages that he allegedly sent to a group chat.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia posted earlier Tuesday evening that he was withdrawing himself from his confirmation hearing “because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time.” He added that he appreciated the “overwhelming support” he received and that he “will continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again!”\n \n\n   \n  His post came hours after Senate Majority Leader John Thune hinted that the White House would pull Ingrassia’s nomination following the reports of racist text messages. “I think they’ll have something official to say about that, but you know what we’ve said, and you’ll probably be hearing from them soon,” he told reporters at the White House.\n \n\n   \n   Earlier Tuesday, a White House official told CNN his nomination was “under review.”\n \n\n   \n  Thune said Monday night that he hoped the White House  would pull the nomination  after  Politico’s reporting  on the messages. “He’s not going to pass,” Thune added of Ingrassia, whom Trump nominated in May to lead the independent agency tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia was set to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, but one Republican senator on the panel had already announced he’d vote against advancing the nomination.\n \n\n   \n  “No, I do not support him,” Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Monday night. Scott’s opposition would have effectively sunk the nomination in committee, assuming every Democrat joined him.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, after Politico’s report,  CNN’s KFile reported  that Ingrassia lost the support of the main Jewish group backing his nomination\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia, whose nomination had already drawn scrutiny, allegedly texted a group chat of other Republicans saying he has “a Nazi streak” and that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell,” according to Politico, which viewed the group chat.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia’s lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, initially questioned the authenticity of the messages but added that if authentic, they were meant satirically.\n \n\n   \n  “Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted. However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters ‘Nazis,’” he wrote in a statement to Politico.\n \n\n   \n  “In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi,” Paltzik added. In a subsequent statement to Politico, he said, “there are who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs,” and that “we do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages.”\n \n\n   \n   KFile  has previously reported on Ingrassia’s history of racist invective and conspiratorial rants, and affinity for a well-known White nationalist and Holocaust denier. His nomination had drawn scrutiny over his past promotion of conspiracy theories and tweets from his podcast that included calls for martial law following Trump’s 2020 election loss and harsh anti-Israel rhetoric aimed at the GOP. Ingrassia also argued publicly that “straight White men” are the most intelligent demographic group and should be prioritized in education.\n \n\n   \n  Amid KFile’s initial reporting in July, the Trump administration insisted that Ingrassia had the backing of “many Jewish groups,” listing four — but most of those groups told CNN in July that they do not support him.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Morton Klein — president of the main Jewish group that had been backing Ingrassia’s nomination, Zionist Organization of America — told CNN in a statement, “If these text revelations are accurate, I have no choice but to immediately withdraw my support. In this time of a surge and growing antisemitism, it is incumbent upon all of us to fight even any hint of antisemitism or racism.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia, who was admitted to the bar only last summer, held a brief White House internship during Trump’s first term. This year, Ingrassia first worked as a White House liaison at the Justice Department  before reportedly  being pushed out and reassigned to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n\n   \n  He would have marked a sharp departure from previous heads of the OSC, a role designed to be politically independent and to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. Rather than a long record of managerial or prosecutorial experience, typical of those who previously held the job, Ingrassia brought a fervent loyalty to Trump and a lengthy record of inflammatory statements.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, Em Steck, Morgan Rimmer, Ted Barrett and Annie Grayer contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/adelita-grijalva-lawsuit-sworn-in-house","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"19:53:00Z","title":"Arizona Sues Over Mike Johnson’s Refusal to Swear In Democrats’ Newest Congresswoman","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Arizona's attorney general, Kris Mayes, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. House of Representatives, challenging Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to swear in newly elected Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won her seat in September 2025.

attorney general has sued the US House of Representatives over Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s refusal to seat an Arizona member of Congress – who was elected in late September – due to the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “This case is about whether someone duly elected to the House,” Kris Mayes and other attorneys wrote in the filing Tuesday, “may be denied her rightful office simply because the Speaker has decided to keep the House out of ‘regular session.’”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson has said he is “following the Pelosi precedent” in not administering the oath of office to Adelita Grijalva, noting that when Republicans had won similar special elections, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi waited until lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill following periods of recess.\n \n\n   \n  In a news conference Monday, Johnson said that Grijalva won her race after the House “had already gone out of session.”\n \n\n   \n  “So I will administer the oath to her on the first day we come back [to] legislative session,” Johnson said. “I’m willing and anxious to do that.”\n \n\n   \n  Moments after the lawsuit was filed, the speaker dismissed the effort as “patently absurd” and a bid for publicity.\n \n\n   \n  “We run the House. She has no jurisdiction. We’re following the precedent,” he told reporters as he left the Capitol. “She’s looking for national publicity. Apparently she’s gotten some of it, but good luck with that.”\n \n\n   \n  ﻿Grijalva told CNN on Tuesday that she is trying to schedule a meeting with Johnson before she leaves town to go back to her district on Thursday to put an end to their back and forth and try to convince him to swear her in.\n \n\n   \n  “I am going to try to schedule an appointment and just sort of sit down to say this back and forth is not good. It’s not healthy. It’s, you know, a clap back here and there. It’s not something that I want,” Grijalva said in an office interview, adding that in the 28 days since winning her election, she has never spoken to Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit argues that “the Constitution does not give that authority to the Speaker—or anyone else” to delay Grijalva’s appointment.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit accuses Johnson of delaying Grijalva’s swearing in because he is attempting to prevent a petition that would force a vote in the House on releasing records around Jeffrey Epstein as well as “strengthen his hand in the ongoing budget and appropriations negotiations.”\n \n\n   \n  The Constitution, Mayes argues, requires elected members to be sworn in if they meet the standard qualification, which Grijalva does, the lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  “If the House wishes to remove a member for other reasons, it must first seat the member, then expel by a two-thirds vote,” the lawsuit states, adding that “the Constitution does not specify who must administer the oath, only that Representatives must take it.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson, Mayes says, “has been in the Capitol during this time and has not identified any reason that he (or a designee) is unable to administer the oath to Ms. Grijalva.”\n \n\n   \n  The Arizona attorney general also accused Johnson of arbitrarily delaying Grijalva’s seating since he does not dispute her qualifications or her election, adding there is “no practical reason why he is unable to administer the oath.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC’s federal court, also argues that Johnson’s refusal to seat Grijalva injures both the elected congresswoman, by preventing her from doing her job, and the people of Arizona by being down a member to represent their interests.\n \n\n   \n  Mayes is asking that a judge decide that if Johnson refuses to swear Grijalva in, another person qualified to administer oaths be allowed to do so for the new congresswoman.\n \n\n   \n   This story is updated with additional details.

into him, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.\n \n\n   \n  “It could be,” Trump responded when asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about a  New York Times report  that he was seeking the money in connection with complaints he had filed about past DOJ investigations.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it. All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n \n\n   \n  Though many of the details remain unclear, Trump acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying himself” damages to resolve claims that the Justice Department under his predecessor had wronged him.\n \n\n   \n  “With the country, it’s interesting, because I’m the one that makes the decision,” Trump said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself. In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you’re paying yourself in damages?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  A settlement to Trump would come from taxpayer funds.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has long claimed the Justice Department was weaponized against him, focusing his ire on the two federal indictments brought against him after his first term. Both cases  were dropped  after he won ree﻿lection last year.\n \n\n   \n  Trump argued Tuesday that he was damaged by the investigations into him and suggested he deserved to be paid for that, but added that he’d give away the money or use it to  renovate the White House .\n \n\n   \n  “As far as all of the litigation … they probably owe me a lot of money, but if I get money from our country, I’ll do something nice with it,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The New York Times reported Tuesday on that Trump was seeking $230 million in compensation and that any settlement might be approved by Justice Department officials who defended Trump, or those around him, during the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  Trump submitted the complaints in 2023 and 2024, before he was reelected, The Times report says. The first claim seeks damages for alleged rights violations including the investigation into  Russian interference  in the 2016 election.\n \n\n   \n  The second complaint focuses on Trump’s  classified documents case  — which was dismissed after he was reelected — including accusing the FBI of violating his privacy when it searched his Florida estate in 2022. CNN  previously reported  on that claim, which sought $100 million.\n \n\n   \n  Asked to confirm the $230 million amount, a spokesperson for Trump’s outside legal team said only that “President Trump continues to fight back against all Democrat-led Witch Hunts, including the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax and the un-Constitutional and un-American weaponization of our justice system by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers.”\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear what steps Trump or his legal team had taken more recently to press the Justice Department for a payment out of those complaints. According to The Times, both claims were filed as part of an administrative process that allows people who believe they have been wronged to seek compensation from federal agencies. That is different from a lawsuit filed in court and decided by a judge.\n \n\n   \n  The No. 2 official at the Justice Department — Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche — worked as Trump’s lead criminal defense lawyer. Another top DOJ lawyer, Stanley Woodward, who runs the department’s Civil Division, represented a Trump co-defendant in the classified documents case.\n \n\n   \n  In theory, both officials could be involved in discussions about paying a settlement to someone alleging wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether top Justice Department officials would be conflicted in this matter, DOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin told CNN, “In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.”\n \n\n   \n  The Justice Department  fired its ethics chief  in July, part of a purge of at least a dozen employees who had worked with the special counsel who brought the federal indictments against Trump.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report. \n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/business/walmart-h1b-visa-pause","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"18:56:00-04:00","title":"Walmart halts job offers for applicants who need H-1B visas after Trump raises fees to $100,000","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Walmart, the largest private-sector employer in the U.S., has paused job offers to foreign candidates needing H-1B visas after President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee on these high-skilled work visas.

time for Trump to get involved in shutdown talks even as leaders rebuff idea \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, Annie Grayer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:02 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Republican leaders have stuck to a straightforward position in their standoff with Democrats over government funding: No negotiations until the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  But as the impasse drags on, some rank-and-file Republicans are starting to wonder if it’s time to change tactics.\n \n\n   \n  Several GOP lawmakers have suggested that  President Donald Trump  take a more direct role in resolving the shutdown in recent days, including potentially opening up negotiations with Democrats if it’s what’s required to end the standoff.\n \n\n   \n  “If he gets involved, he can move it,” GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville said of Trump. “He can make a decision on what we do.”\n \n\n   \n  “We absolutely need him,” GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN. “He has the strength and skills to get it done. The speaker is doing a great job, but we need Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  The restlessness within the Republican conference comes as both sides have continued to dig in, leaving no clear avenue toward reopening the government without a major shakeup in the dynamics on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  And it signals growing unease in parts of the GOP with the toll that the shutdown is taking on the country and over  which party will ultimately shoulder the blame  — even as Trump and Republican leadership project confidence that their strategy will win out.\n \n\n   \n  “At the end of the day, to move this needle and get this thing off the bubble, President Trump will have to get involved,” said Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia. “That’s probably what will have to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has not spoken with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries since before the government shuttered weeks back, a White House official confirmed earlier this week. The two Democratic leaders said Tuesday they’d put in a new request for a meeting with the president.\n \n\n   \n  Yet so far, Trump has opted to steer clear of the day-to-day maneuvering despite his self-fashioned image as a dealmaker, tasking House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune with managing the shutdown instead.\n \n\n   \n  They have so far refused to entertain any negotiations with Democrats, vowing not to bend to demands for concessions on health care in exchange for funding the government. Johnson, who has kept in regular touch with the president, has similarly dismissed the idea of getting Trump more directly involved.\n \n\n   \n  “He (Trump) is not going to negotiate with the Democrats, who have taken the American people hostage. We’re not going to pay a ransom to reopen the government,” Johnson told reporters on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  A frustrated Thune insisted to CNN on Tuesday that there is no “plan B” for ending the shutdown, signaling Republican leaders will keep forging ahead and pressuring Democrats to simply accept the House’s short-term funding bill.\n \n\n   \n  The extended standoff represents a departure from prior shutdowns, where funding lapses have typically prompted a scramble on both sides of the aisle to reach an agreement. During  the last lengthy shutdown  — a 35-day stalemate during Trump’s first term prompted by his insistence on funding for a border wall — lawmakers repeatedly floated proposals aimed at breaking the logjam, while Trump went as far as to cancel a holiday trip to Mar-a-Lago to remain in Washington amid the crisis.\n \n\n   \n  But this time around, Republican and Democratic leaders have so far found little reason to talk — with each resorting instead to attempting to outlast the other. There are no weekend meetings or meaningful negotiations. And the House hasn’t even been in session for over a month, with Johnson vowing not to bring the chamber back until Democrats are ready to cave.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Tuesday hosted Senate Republicans at the White House for a lunch billed in part as an effort to encourage continued solidarity, predicting in a speech that Democrats would ultimately lose out politically.\n \n\n   \n  “They are the obstructionists,” he said. “The reason they’re doing it is because we’re doing so well.”\n \n\n   \n  In conversations with senators over a meal of cheeseburgers, Trump signaled that he was open to talking with Democrats, and he later reiterated the stance in remarks from the Oval Office, saying he he had just “one little caveat”: only when the government opens.\n \n\n   \n  That stated position is in line with talking points echoed by congressional Republican over the last three weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s open to a conversation if there’s something substantive they have to offer, but the idea that they can hold the government hostage in a shutdown is not going to work,” Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota said, as senators returned from the White House clutching MAGA hats and other White House memorabilia.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also touted the opportunity the shutdown has provided him to seize greater authority over the government’s vast operations and workforce, bragging about deep cuts to the federal workforce and funding cuts aimed primarily at ramping up pressure on Democrats. White House officials have sought to fire more than 4,000 government employees, while halting billions of dollars meant for infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic states and districts.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not going to get a lot of things back,” Trump said of the cuts, later adding that “maybe indirectly, they’re doing good” by giving the administration an excuse to hack away at unwanted parts of the government.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has telegraphed deeper cuts in the coming days, with budget chief Russell Vought saying he hopes to lay off more than 10,000 federal workers in total. Trump in the meantime has redirected funding to pay military service members and law enforcement officers, in steps that have effectively allowed crime and immigration initiatives central to his agenda to move forward unimpeded.\n \n\n   \n  Yet while Trump has reveled in the newfound leeway, some on Capitol Hill have grown increasingly impatient with the standstill. And with Democrats showing no fresh signs of backing off their stance, they argued that Trump may be the only one who can apply the direct pressure needed to force a resolution.\n \n\n   \n  Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley went as far as to encourage Democrats to start contacting Trump directly. “He would answer anybody. They could call him. He would answer. I mean, he’s like very accessible,” he said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have similarly called for Trump to re-engage with Capitol Hill, as part of their bid to secure an extension of enhanced Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that House and Senate Republicans don’t do anything without getting permission from their boss, Donald J. Trump. And the reason why there have been no negotiations – zero negotiations – since Republicans shut the government down is because Donald Trump clearly wants the government shut down,” Jeffries said, arguing that “Trump definitely needs to get involved” and “off the sidelines.”\n \n\n   \n  But despite the rising pressure on both sides of the aisle, Republican leaders have indicated no willingness to budge.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know what there is to negotiate,” Thune said at the White House. “Open up the government first.”\n \n\n   \n  Within the West Wing, officials have so far projected a similar resolve. They’ve seized on recent polling showing some subtle shifts among voters toward blaming Democrats for the impasse. And as Democrats’ have begun to push for direct talks with Trump, aides have interpreted it as a sign that the party’s position is growing increasingly untenable — and further confirmation that there’s no reason now to give them an easy out.\n \n\n   \n  “This is just frantic wishcasting from the Democrats because they’re in disarray and their shutdown strategy has led them into a trap,” one White House official said. “Our position has not changed in terms of what we want, and our feelings on the government shutdown.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/weather/tropical-storm-melissa-forecast-track-path-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"20:42:00-04:00","title":"Tropical Storm Melissa Expected to Become Hurricane, Threatens Caribbean","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the Caribbean Sea and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday.

Its track is unclear, but it’s bringing a dangerous threat \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologist Mary Gilbert\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:42 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea, proving this year’s  Atlantic hurricane season  won’t be wrapping up quietly.\n \n\n   \n  The storm could slam the northern Caribbean with pouring rain and strong winds as it strengthens over extremely warm water this week. Melissa’s worst impacts could center on Hispaniola, where significant flooding and dangerous mudslides are possible for parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa was churning about 300 miles south of Haiti with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Tuesday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n \n\n   \n  The storm is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday, according to the center, but it’s still tough to pin down exactly how strong it will become from there.\n \n\n   \n  A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus. Puerto Rico is much more likely to experience some of the storm’s rain.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    Days of rain and wind\n \n\n   \n  Melissa’s exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios forecasters have been monitoring for days. The one looking most likely at this point could spell disaster for parts of Hispaniola; the other could eventually take Melissa close to Central America.\n \n\n   \n  Both involve Melissa first loitering out over the Caribbean Sea for multiple days this week, churning up seas and bringing nasty weather to islands within the storm’s reach.\n \n\n   \n  From there, Melissa could take a turn to the north by late week and potentially move close to Hispaniola through the weekend, strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday morning. This is the scenario the hurricane center’s track for the system reflects.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa is the 13th named storm of the season but is the first to churn in the Caribbean Sea. The lack of storms allowed the Caribbean to become so extremely warm that its water is now basically rocket fuel for storms.\n \n\n   \n  If Melissa taps into that energy, it could explode in strength – something that’s  happening more often  as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent  extreme rapid intensification :  Erin ,  Gabrielle  and  Humberto .\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola. It’s still unclear exactly what parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.\n \n\n   \n  Melissa could also deliver a considerable amount of rain to Jamaica and Puerto Rico in this scenario, with flash flooding and mudslides possible.\n \n\n   \n  Alternately, there’s still a chance that Melissa misses its window to take a northward turn and instead just creeps west over the Caribbean until it nears Central America — potentially Nicaragua or Honduras — next week. It could make landfall there or take a very late turn to the north and head for Cuba.\n \n\n   \n  The northern Caribbean would likely still receive a few days of wet and windy weather in this scenario, but rainfall totals would be lower, as would the flood risk, with Melissa moving steadily west.\n \n\n   \n    So… will it hit the US?\n \n\n   \n  It’s unlikely — though not entirely impossible — Melissa will deliver a direct hit to the mainland US. At this time, the storm’s most likely impact to the US could be in the form of some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.\n \n\n   \n  Florida could be in play if Melissa remains a weaker storm for longer and takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa’s wind and rain.\n \n\n   \n  The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently,  Hurricane Nicole  slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and  Hurricane Zeta  smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.\n \n\n   \n  As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.\n \n\n   \n  Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/anti-immigrant-protests-dublin-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"18:37:00Z","title":"Anti-immigrant protesters burn police van in Dublin after young girl attacked","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On October 21, 2025, anti-immigrant protesters in Dublin burned a police van and attacked officers near a building housing asylum seekers, with over 500 people participating and displaying anti-immigrant slogans.

5:59 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump’s  hopes for a quick meeting  with Russian President Vladimir Putin have stalled out, with an administration official telling CNN on Tuesday there were “no plans” for a summit between the two “in the immediate future.”\n \n\n   \n  The change in posture comes after Trump said the leaders would meet “within two weeks or so, pretty quick” following a Thursday phone call. Now, it appears, that timeline is unlikely.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said Tuesday he didn’t want the meeting to be “a waste of time.” He may still meet with the Russian leader, he implied, but he indicated it was no longer a top priority. “We’ll be notifying you over the next two days as to what we’re doing,” the president told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said after the Thursday call that the US and Russia had “agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week,” and officials had expected Secretary of State Marco Rubio would meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to lay the groundwork for the Trump-Putin summit.\n \n\n   \n  But multiple officials told CNN that diplomatic engagement, too, was no longer happening — at least for the time being — and one source said Rubio and Lavrov had divergent expectations about a possible end to  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine . Rubio and Lavrov spoke by phone Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov had a productive call. Therefore, an additional in-person meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future,” the administration official said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Although the US described the call as “productive,” a source familiar with the matter told CNN that officials felt afterward that the Russian position had not evolved enough beyond its maximalist stance, and there was a sense that Rubio was not likely to recommend moving forward on a Putin-Trump meeting next week. The source said Monday that Rubio and Lavrov could speak again this week.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, Lavrov rejected the notion of freezing the conflict — an idea put forward by Trump after  a meeting with  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week and backed by Kyiv and Europe as part of negotiations toward an end to the war.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin had previously sought to tamp down expectations of a rapid Trump-Putin summit, saying after the US president first announced it that it “may happen within two weeks or a bit later.” It added at the time that talks between Rubio and Lavrov would mark the first step toward organizing the Russia-US summit in Budapest, Hungary.\n \n\n   \n  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the summit cannot be postponed, because no date was ever set.\n \n\n   \n  “You cannot postpone what has not been scheduled,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The White House stressed Trump was still committed to brokering peace in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has consistently worked towards finding a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to end this senseless war and to stop the killing,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN. “He has courageously engaged parties on all sides and will do everything in his power to achieve peace.”\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Zelensky asserted that Russia “became less interested in diplomacy” after the United States declined to provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  “As soon as the issue of long-range capabilities became a little further away for us — for Ukraine — Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,” Zelensky said Tuesday in his daily address. “This is a signal that this very issue — the issue of long-range capabilities — may be the indispensable key to peace.”\n \n\n   \n  “The greater Ukraine’s long-range capabilities,” Zelensky added, “the greater Russia’s willingness to end the war.”\n \n\n   \n  Even before revealing there were no immediate plans for Trump and Putin to meet, the Trump administration had come to believe that a big stand-alone meeting between Rubio and Lavrov was not essential to set the table for a summit. That is largely because Lavrov is not empowered to meaningfully move the process along, a senior administration official said.\n \n\n   \n  The administration views calls between the two aides as effective to get a sense of where the Russian side is on certain topics, but it does not believe a big meeting between the two would be useful, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  A European diplomat described Lavrov as someone who is “100% loyal to Putin but who’s never in the room when real important decisions are being taken.”\n \n\n   \n  “To negotiate with Lavrov is somewhat a diversion while the important discussions are only with Putin himself,” the diplomat said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the conversations about setting up a meeting between the two diplomats remains fluid, a senior administration official said, adding that it is possible they meet on the sidelines of a meeting of world leaders organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, which is set to take place next week in Malaysia.\n \n\n   \n  In Rubio and Lavrov’s Monday phone call, they discussed “next steps” to follow up on the call between their two presidents last week about a possible end to the conflict in Ukraine, according to a brief US State Department readout. Rubio “emphasized the importance of upcoming engagements as an opportunity for Moscow and Washington to collaborate on advancing a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war, in line with President Trump’s vision,” according to the readout.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin, meanwhile, described the call as a “constructive discussion” that dealt with “possible concrete steps to implement the understandings” Trump and Putin reached during their conversation.\n \n\n   \n  It has been more than two months since Trump held his last  in-person summit  with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. The nearly three-hour meeting ended without a deal as both leaders touted progress.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly called for Kyiv and Moscow to “stop the war immediately.”\n \n\n   \n  “You go by the battle line, wherever it is. Otherwise, it’s too complicated. You’ll never be able to figure it out. You stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  European leaders and Ukraine put out a joint statement Tuesday saying that they support Trump’s position “that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations” and that pressure on Russia must increase.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is scheduled to meet NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/style/ddlj-bollywood-30-years-anniversary-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"19:49:00-04:00","title":"Why a Bollywood classic about forbidden love still captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the enduring cultural significance of the 1995 Bollywood film 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), which has remained a beloved romantic classic for over 30 years.

Mogul and Ayushi Shah, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Inside the Maratha Mandir movie theater, audience members jump to their feet as the first notes of an iconic mandolin riff play, their bodies casting silhouettes against the opening credits of a film screened here   nearly every day for 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  A joyous, collective roar erupts from the rows as the lead actors share their first fated glance. Near the front, a young couple mirrors that gaze, their wedding photographer capturing a timeless moment against the iconic backdrop.\n \n\n   \n  Governments have fallen, and a new millennium has dawned, yet people still come to this Mumbai cinema to immerse themselves in the comfort of a love story known by heart, for less than $1 a ticket.\n \n\n   \n  Released in 1995, “Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” commonly referred to as “DDLJ,” tells the story of two young Indians, Raj Malhotra and Simran Singh, raised in London, who fall for each other during a freewheeling trip across Europe, only to face the ultimate test – earning her father’s approval. It became a cultural touchstone and the second-highest-grossing film of its decade.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, the cinema’s daily showing has drawn young Indians dreaming of their own epic romance, those seeking a brief escape from the pressures of city life in Mumbai, and curious tourists who want to see the fandom up close.\n \n\n   \n  “I watch it almost every day,” said Suneel Shedge, a 50-year-old diamond worker from a nearby neighborhood who speaks with leading man charisma, and is prone to bursting into songs from the movie. As the film hits its three-decade anniversary this month, he has come to pay homage to what he considers Bollywood’s greatest love story.\n \n\n   \n  “Sometimes I cry, sometimes there’s pain. There’s happiness, there’s sadness,” he said. “A movie like this will never be made ever again.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s the “most beautiful love story,” said 23-year-old Vaishnavi Deshmukh, who has lost count of how many times she has seen the film.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t explain how I feel,” her boyfriend, Tejas Raout, 23, said. “It’s nostalgia.”\n \n\n   \n  In many ways, “DDLJ’s” narrative mirrors India’s own pivotal journey in the early 1990s — a nation shaking off its socialist slumber, opening its arms to the world, and finding a confident new voice that was both global in its outlook and Indian at its core.\n \n\n   \n  This cultural resonance also had a seismic effect on its cast. The film catapulted Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, who played lovers in the film, from rising stars into cinema royalty, cementing them as the definitive on-screen couple for years to come.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, pinning down the exact formula which created this cultural phenomenon is impossible, said prominent Indian film critic and writer, Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  You can’t attribute its success to “just one single thing,” the author of “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge: A Modern Classic,” which analyzes the film’s commercial triumph, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “When the cinema gods deem that you create a classic, the stars align. Everybody’s stars align. And you get a film like this, which I think becomes a romantic blueprint for many generations.”\n \n\n   \n    Capturing the national zeitgeist\n \n\n   \n  In 1995, India was a nation beaming with endless possibility.\n \n\n   \n  Four years after the floodgates of economic liberalization had been thrown open, the country was in the midst of a cultural awakening. The state-run Doordarshan, which aired a mix of entertainment and news, was now competing with the vibrant pulse of MTV and Star TV, while the Indian-manufactured Ambassador car vied for space on the road with models made by Japan’s Maruti and South Korea’s Daewoo. On giant billboards towering over cities, Coca-Cola returned to wage war against Pepsi, and the American daytime soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful” had become a household name.\n \n\n   \n  This influx of choice created a thrilling but anxious juxtaposition: Indians were captivated by globalization but also fearful of losing their own identity.\n \n\n   \n  Into this cultural moment, stepped filmmaker Aditya Chopra (no relation to film critic Anupama Chopra), the son of the late Yash Chopra — Bollywood’s legendary “King of Romance.”\n \n\n   \n  “In the ’90s, the mood was about aspiration. The mood was about looking westward,” he said in the 2023 Netflix docuseries, “The Romantics,” which chronicles his family’s contribution to Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In his early twenties, Aditya Chopra had an idea for his directorial debut: a script he wrote that would capture the energy of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  In “DDLJ,” Simran, the devoted daughter of Baldev Singh, a hardworking owner of a corner shop, is initially not attracted to Raj, the low-achieving but fun-loving son of a wealthy immigrant. As they dance and sing their way through Switzerland, however, they eventually fall in love. But Simran’s stern, conservative father, has already arranged her marriage to another man.\n \n\n   \n  “Love was always rebellious, against the parents,” Aditya Chopra said of other films at the time. “That always bothered me.”\n \n\n   \n  So, instead of eloping in defiance of tradition, the charming Raj embarks on a mission to win Simran’s father’s approval in elaborate, often comedic ways. Simran, on the other hand, struggles between her duty as a daughter and her desire to marry the man she loves.\n \n\n   \n  In the film’s climax, Baldev looks at his daughter and grants her his blessing. “Go, Simran, go. Live your life,” he says. What follows is an iconic sequence, captured in slow-motion: Simran’s desperate sprint down a train platform after ditching the planned wedding, her traditional bridal attire and thick, black hair billowing in the wind, Raj’s hand outstretched from the carriage door, his face bloodied after a fight with Simran’s doomed fiancé, and the triumphant embrace as he pulls her up to safety.\n \n\n   \n  The first half of the film unfolds in the cosmopolitan landscapes of London and continental Europe, while the second half transports the audience to the agrarian fields of India’s Punjab state.\n \n\n   \n  The characters take elements of Western culture to India, including the clothes they wear and their attitude towards love in a society where, in the mid-nineties, many parents claimed the right to choose — and veto — potential spouses.\n \n\n   \n  The central conflict captivated the nation back then and continues to resonate with many young Indians today. For viewers like Deshmukh, who was at the Maratha Mandir screening, the takeaway is clear: “Parents matter the most,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The score, composed by the duo Jatin-Lalit, created an enduring legacy, producing an all-hit album whose songs became timeless anthems for romance and celebration. All these years later, people “watch it for the music,” said Lalit Pandit.\n \n\n   \n  “I could feel right away this wasn’t just another film,” Manish Malhotra, the designer behind the movie’s costumes, told CNN. “(Aditya Chopra) was a first-time director, yes, but the way he spoke about Raj and Simran was so vivid, emotional, and precise that you almost saw the film come alive in that very moment.”\n \n\n   \n  Malhotra, who went on to become one of India’s leading fashion designers, was particularly inspired by the duality at the heart of the film’s message, which he channeled directly into Simran’s wardrobe. He looked at her “not just as a heroine, but as a young woman caught between London and Punjab, her wardrobe needing to echo both her Western upbringing and her Indian soul.”\n \n\n   \n  Simran wore short skirts and halter dresses, reflecting what young Indian women were wearing in the West. Meanwhile, “every pastel salwar, every floral skirt, every dupatta drape was about telling her story with authenticity,” he said, referring to some of her traditional Indian outfits.\n \n\n   \n  On the film’s impact, Malhotra admits he couldn’t have predicted its eventual scale. “But I did know it was special,” he said. “Because when you connect to a story that deeply, when the characters feel that real, the work flows with sincerity. And that sincerity has a way of staying with people long after the film is over.”\n \n\n   \n    Impact on future romance films\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” was the first mainstream Bollywood film not just to represent Indians living overseas but place their unique cultural conflict at the very core of its narrative.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to the film’s release, Indians abroad were rarely heroes in Bollywood movies. They were confined to negative archetypes: the villain who had lost his Indian values, or the seductress whose drinking and smoking habits signaled moral corruption.\n \n\n   \n  “One of the reasons that ‘DDLJ’ is so amazing is that there’s a piece of everybody there in it,” said Snigdha Sur, founder & CEO of The Juggernaut, a media platform that writes stories about South Asia and the South Asian diaspora.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re very Indian, and if you’re very nationalist… this film is about returning home to India… and getting permission the right way. If you’re a diaspora kid, you’re saying ‘we haven’t forgotten our traditions,’” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “You see two people who really want to be together, fighting for something they believe in. For Indians, and specifically from my experience… that’s the story of my life,” said Indian Canadian YouTuber Lilly Singh in the “The Romantics.” “I know, deep down, I really seek my parents’ approval. And that’s why the ending of ‘DDLJ’ meant so much to me.”\n \n\n   \n  The wider Indian diaspora’s connection to the movie was immediately tangible and reflected in the box office numbers at the time. Made on a budget of less than half a million dollars, “DDLJ” earned nearly $2 million overseas,  according to  movie analyst Taran Adarsh. Back home, it became a blockbuster hit and the highest grossing film of 1995.\n \n\n   \n  But beyond numbers, it created the blueprint for the modern Indian film that would dominate Bollywood for the next decade; “a watershed moment,” according to the author Anupama Chopra.\n \n\n   \n  The cinematic landscape prior to “DDLJ” was defined by two prevalent narratives. There was the “angry young man”— a working-class protagonist, typically a victim of a corrupt system, whose story was driven by a quest for vengeance or social justice. Then there were the family melodramas centered on romances thwarted by stark class divides. Crucially, both worlds were almost exclusively rooted in India.\n \n\n   \n  Aspects of “DDLJ’s” s storyline influenced a string of future blockbusters, from “Pardes” (1997), which explored the search for a traditional bride for a Westernized son; the grand family saga “Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham” (2001), centered on a wealthy patriarch’s disapproval of his son’s marriage to a commoner and set between London and New Delhi; and “Kal Ho Naa Ho” (2003), which tells the story of love and sacrifice within New York’s vibrant Indian community.\n \n\n   \n  “DDLJ” also launched the legendary on-screen pairing of Khan and Kajol, who have starred in seven major films together, setting the gold standard for Bollywood romance for decades to come.\n \n\n   \n  “When you keep repeating (their pairing) and it keeps attracting an audience, it cements their position,” Anupama Chopra said. “And off the top of my head, I can’t think of any pairing that had that sort of longevity.”\n \n\n   \n    A step back in time\n \n\n   \n  Back at the Maratha Mandir, walking into the screening of “DDLJ” feels like stepping into a time capsule.\n \n\n   \n  A living museum of a bygone era, the building is an unassuming structure, its age showing in dilapidated sections and torn posters clinging to its gates. Inside, faded red leather seats evoke a classic, old-world ambiance. Popcorn and chips are still sold in simple, vacuum-sealed plastic bags.\n \n\n   \n  “People from all around the world come here,” said its manager Manoj Pandey, who has been working at the institution for 15 years. “When the movie came out in 1995, no one thought we’d be here watching it 30 years later… But it was definitely right after the opening that it was going to become a blockbuster and have a long life.”\n \n\n   \n  They still sell about 100 tickets a day, he said.\n \n\n   \n  The theater’s owner briefly flirted with the idea of stopping the show in 2015. But the announcement was met with outcry from the public. “We received hundreds of letters in protest,” said Pandey.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, Khan and Kajol reunited on stage for the Filmfare Awards, one of India’s most notable annual events that honors excellence in Hindi cinema, where they danced to one of movie’s most beloved songs, “Tujhe Dekha Toh,” which translates to “When I See You.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet, for all the love and adoration, there are moments from the film that haven’t aged so well, according to some fans.\n \n\n   \n  Viewed through a contemporary lens, the film’s gender politics feel dated, said “The Juggernaut’s” Sur, particularly in a scene where Raj gaslights a panicked Simran into believing they slept together after a night of drinking. This is compounded by the reduction of Simran’s agency to the singular goal of marrying her beloved, leaving her own personal ambitions completely unexplored.\n \n\n   \n  “What does she do? What are her work ambitions?” Sur said. “I want to know more about what she’s studying, where she wants to work.”\n \n\n   \n  For Anupama Chopra, the whole idea of Simran “being parceled between lover and father” is equally frustrating. “But every film is a product of its time,” she said. “And I can tell you at the premiere, none of us thought there was any problem with it because we didn’t know any better.

We’re on Day 21, and if it lingers into early November, Congress could surpass the current record of 35 days – from, as it happens, the first Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Who knows if we’ll get there. There is a premium in these debates on appearing resolute. That means neither side telegraphs that it might fold – right up until the moment one does.\n \n\n   \n  But there are also a number of dynamics pushing us toward an especially prolonged shutdown right now.\n \n\n   \n  And at the top of that list is the blame game, where we’re in uncharted territory.\n \n\n   \n  But plainly: History suggests it’s Democrats who would eventually back down. But they seem to have relatively little reason to do so right now.\n \n\n   \n  Generally speaking, it’s  the side that made extraneous policy demands that loses  politically in shutdowns. In this case, that’s the Democrats, who are demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. People overwhelmingly say they don’t like using shutdowns as leverage – by massive margins, in fact.\n \n\n   \n  But public opinion on this shutdown hasn’t gone that way.\n \n\n   \n    Democrats keep winning the blame game\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that Democrats were “getting killed in the polls.”\n \n\n   \n  “The public understands what they’re doing; they’re doing the wrong thing,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  This does not appear at all accurate.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, every quality public poll has shown Trump and Republicans continue to shoulder more blame than Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  In a  Reuters-Ipsos poll  conducted October 15-20, Americans blamed congressional Republicans more than Democrats, 50%-43%.\n \n\n   \n  The gap was larger in a  CNBC poll  conducted October 8-12. It showed Americans blamed Trump and the Republicans over Democrats, 53%-37%. (Independents blamed Trump by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, 58%-21%.)\n \n\n   \n  Before the shutdown started, polls showed the blame game favoring Democrats by between 7 and 11 points. Polling since it started has shown it favoring Democrats by between 7and 17 points.\n \n\n   \n    This is not normal\n \n\n   \n  The other longest shutdowns on record were in 1995-96 (21 days) and 2018-19 (35 days), both of which involved Republicans making the policy demand.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, the blame game was against the GOP from the start and seemed to get worse as things dragged on.\n \n\n   \n  In 1995-96, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll before the shutdown showed people were prepared to blame Republicans by 11 points. Polling after the shutdown began showed the GOP getting blamed by more than 20 points.\n \n\n   \n  In 2018-19, pre-shutdown polling showed Americans were predisposed to blame Trump and the Republicans by 14-15 points. Most quality polls after it began showed Americans blaming the GOP by 20 or more points.\n \n\n   \n  In both cases, the GOP was arguably fighting a losing battle before things even got started, and then it became clear they weren’t winning either politically or policy-wise. So they gave up.\n \n\n   \n  That’s been flipped on its head now.\n \n\n   \n  A big reason appears to be that what Democrats are demanding  is actually popular  – unlike, for instance, the GOP’s demand of building Trump’s border wall in 2018-2019. The new Reuters-Ipsos poll shows 72% of Americans and even 51% of Republicans want health care subsidies to be extended. Those numbers have also been consistent.\n \n\n   \n    How much of a stomach do Democrats have?\n \n\n   \n  The question is whether Americans believe the policy goal that they very much want is worth continuing the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  That could be a tougher ask, especially as some key impacts of the shutdown set in. Federal employees will miss their first full paycheck later this week, for example. Small business loans will be held up. Aid to low-income Americans like food stamps  could soon be halted .\n \n\n   \n  But the looming impacts cut both ways. November 1 is as an especially important deadline for Democrats’ policy demand. It’s when open enrollment for the Obamacare plans begins.\n \n\n   \n  At that point, many Americans would begin to see the significantly higher premiums caused by letting the subsidies lapse – in most cases  doubling or close to doubling , according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.\n \n\n   \n  There is a school of thought that Democrats could give up at that point, believing they had forced Republicans to own the premium hikes and that they had cast a spotlight on the fact that the GOP stood in the way of renewing them.\n \n\n   \n  But if you’re a Democrat and you’re looking at these polls, you have to be intrigued by the possibility of holding out. What if Republicans really get scared about owning those premium hikes – like  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia and  even Trump’s own pollster  have warned them – and suddenly feel compelled to come to the table?\n \n\n   \n  Democrats haven’t had many wins since the November election, and this situation presents at least the possibility of a very significant one.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps as significantly, how would a Democratic base that has sharply criticized their party’s leaders for their lack of fight react to their side throwing in the towel when it looked like they were on the winning side of the issue?\n \n\n   \n  Plenty will play out over the next 10 days. But the plot is significantly thicker than in past shutdowns.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/lamonica-mciver-ice-hearing","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:03:00Z","title":"Democratic Congresswoman Appears in Court to Fight Charges She Interfered with ICE Arrest","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court to defend herself against a three-count indictment alleging she interfered with ICE officers during a congressional oversight visit to an ICE detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, on May 9, 2025.

LaMonica McIver appeared in federal court Tuesday as she continues to fight a three-count indictment alleging she impeded and interfered with federal officers in a highly publicized incident at a Newark, New Jersey, ICE detention facility in May.\n \n\n   \n  Her attorneys have argued she’s being selectively and vindictively prosecuted because her political views are   at odds with the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Jamel Semper did not rule from the bench on McIver’s motion to toss the charges, but he did ask prosecutors to push Department of Homeland Security officials to  remove statements  from their online platforms that allude to the incident involving McIver. The judge said it is prejudicial for “fact free” social media posts from government officials to be floating on the internet to potentially taint a jury pool while McIver’s prosecution is pending.\n \n\n   \n  Semper   said he’d seen posts from government officials that suggest information ”counter to the indictment” like claims that McIver trespassed and that the incident was tied to Antifa activity.\n \n\n   \n  DHS press releases related to the incident have been removed, according to prosecutor Mark McCarren who also said he’d try to get the social media posts removed.\n \n\n   \n  One X post that’s still visible on the official DHS profile suggests members of Congress “stormed” the facility gate.\n \n\n   \n  The congresswoman was indicted in June on the charges connected to her alleged attempt to physically thwart the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, outside the facility.\n \n\n   \n  McIver, who joined the House Homeland Security Committee last year, was at the ICE facility with Democratic Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman for an oversight inspection.  McIver’s attorneys say employees at the facility actively tried to impede her oversight of the facility delaying the lawmakers’ access.\n \n\n   \n  Homeland security officials also forced Baraka out of the facility when he tried to join the congressional oversight visit. Baraka was then arrested for trespassing outside the facility gates in a crowd of protestors. The trespassing charge against Baraka was later dropped.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say when McIver tried to intervene in the arrest, she “slammed” her forearm into the body of a uniformed agent and forcibly grabbed him in an attempt to restrain him. McIver also allegedly pushed another ICE officer and “used each of her forearms to forcibly strike (him) as she returned inside the secure area of the facility,” according to the complaint.\n \n\n   \n  If the case goes to trial on November 10 as currently scheduled, prosecutors said Tuesday they’ll rely heavily on  surveillance and officers’ body worn camera footage  that shows the scuffle that lasted just over a minute.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s defense attorney Paul Fishman argued any of the congresswoman’s conduct should be covered by the Speech or Debate Clause because she was there on legislative business. Semper questioned the idea that an alleged assault outside the facility gate was a part of her official legislative inspection.\n \n\n   \n  McIver’s attorneys called her prosecution retaliatory and partisan claiming it’s “Part of a broader partisan agenda of ending ‘wokeness.”’ President Donald   Trump has publicly criticized McIver since the incident and said the “days of woke are over” when commenting on her case.\n \n\n   \n  Fishman said Tuesday that McIver’s prosecution is in stark contrast with Trump’s pardons of individuals accused of violent activity in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot.\n \n\n   \n  “She was charged with something she never would’ve been charged with if she was a Republican,” Fishman said.\n \n\n   \n  Semper challenged the defense, pointing out that the other Democratic lawmakers weren’t charged in connection to the incident on May 9.\n \n\n   \n  McIver was shoved by an ICE agent and caught in a scuffle she didn’t start, Fishman argued.\n \n\n   \n  The other members also weren’t as close to the action in the moment, Fishman added.\n \n\n   \n  Fishman  said ICE agents were “spectacularly irresponsible” in their handling of the mayor’s arrest, starting a “reckless” and “dangerous” situation in a crowd of civilians.\n \n\n   \n  McIver told supporters after the hearing, “I’m not going to stop holding this administration accountable.”\n \n\n   \n  Several Democrats, including Reps.

It targets a House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis – one of three Black members of Congress from the state. The new district lines aim to give Republicans the advantage for 11 out of 14 US House seats from North Carolina.\n \n\n   \n  The GOP currently controls 10 seats under the map used in last year’s elections.\n \n\n   \n  The map is now in the North Carolina House, which is expected to vote on it Wednesday. State law does not give Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, veto power over redistricting legislation – although litigation over the map is likely.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina is the latest GOP-controlled state to accede to President Donald Trump’s demands  to take up drawing new district lines  to prevent Democrats from flipping the US House. Off-year elections generally favor the party out of power in the White House, and Democrats need to gain just three more seats to gain control of the chamber.\n \n\n   \n  A Democratic-controlled House could thwart Trump’s agenda and launch investigations during the final two years of his presidency into his actions and those of his administration.\n \n\n   \n  Battles over congressional districts are underway around the country – after Trump kick-started the fight by  pushing Republicans in Texas  to craft new maps to help the party pick up five more seats.  Democrats in California, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom , have responded with their own redistricting push that asks voters next month to replace the state’s current congressional maps with new ones that aim to net the party five US House seats.\n \n\n   \n  During the debate this week, North Carolina Republicans made clear their political goals.\n \n\n   \n  If Democrats take back the House, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” said state Sen. Ralph Hise, the Republican helping oversee the map legislation. He claimed that Democrats across the country had gerrymandered maps to favor their party in previous redistricting cycles.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina is fighting fire with fire,” he added in a statement. “If Gavin Newsom and his Democrat cronies want to try and take control of Congress to force their liberal agenda on the American people, then we’re going to respond in kind.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger also defended the vote, arguing that Democrats across the country have “spent decades” gerrymandering states they control.\n \n\n   \n  “North Carolina Republicans will not sit quietly and watch Democrats continue to ignore the will of the people in an attempt to force their liberal agenda on our citizens,” Berger said in a statement. “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats, meanwhile, accused GOP lawmakers of bowing to Trump’s demands without regard for the state’s voters.\n \n\n   \n  “Clearly, this new congressional map is beyond the pale,” Davis said in a statement, noting that the district elected him and voted for Trump in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  “What is happening today … is a response from a president who has demanded fealty from members of his party who control legislatures across this country,” Democratic state Sen. Julie Mayfield said during the floor debate on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Another Democrat, state Sen. Michael Garrett, cast Tuesday’s vote as a perilous moment for American democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “Future historians will look back at 2025 and ask, ‘When democracy was openly under assault, when a president demanded states rig their elections, when millions took to the street, begging their leaders to protect their rights, what did those in power do?’” Garrett said. “Did they stand with the people or did they stand with the powerful?”\n \n\n   \n   The story and headline have been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Arit John contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/russian-drones-target-ukraine-energy-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:18:00Z","title":"Swarms of Russian drones plunge parts of Ukraine into darkness, as Zelensky turns to Europe again","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia has intensified drone attacks on Ukraine’s power, water, and heating infrastructure, particularly in northern regions like Chernihiv and Sumy, with repeated strikes over the past month.

has stepped up drone attacks on power facilities supplying millions of homes across the country.\n \n\n   \n  There are signs that the Russian military is repeatedly hitting the same areas to aggravate the population’s suffering. The northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy – adjoining Russia and Belarus – have seen constant attacks over the past month.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands of people in Chernihiv were without power or water on Tuesday after more than 50 drones and missiles targeted essential facilities overnight. Two attack drones hit a heat supply facility and another energy installation, according to Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv regional military administration.\n \n\n   \n  Later Tuesday, some 20 Russian drones targeted the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi, according to Chaus, killing two men and two women.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has targeted Chernihiv’s power infrastructure on 15 days over the last month, according to the regional energy company.\n \n\n   \n  There was also a  massive  Russian attack on energy facilities in several regions, including Kyiv, on October 10.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s tactics are to kill people and terrorize them with cold,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  And the Ukrainians see another new Russian tactic.\n \n\n   \n  “The Russians are deliberately launching unmanned aerial vehicles that continuously circle over damaged facilities, making it impossible to carry out work safely and deliberately prolonging the humanitarian crisis,” Ukraine’s energy ministry said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Russia has developed a mix of drones and missiles in its attacks on energy infrastructure that sometimes overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses. In Sumy, which borders Chernihiv, power is yet to be fully restored in the town of Shostka and surrounding area after strikes two weeks ago.\n \n\n   \n  After the latest strikes, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called on allies “to urgently mobilize additional assistance for Ukraine’s resilience: from energy equipment to energy sources and air defense capabilities.”\n \n\n   \n  “There are 203 key facilities in Ukraine that we need to protect with air defense systems,” Zelensky said earlier this month, most of them to do with electricity, gas and water.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian government has a two-pronged response to the growing Russian onslaught: more and better air defenses and longer-range missiles to intensify  Ukraine’s own attacks  on critical Russian infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Later Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said that Ukraine had targeted Russia’s Bryansk Chemical Plant – which produces gunpowder and other explosive materials – with long-range Storm Shadow missiles. Without mentioning the plant, the regional governor of Bryansk claimed on social media that Russia had “detected and destroyed 57 enemy aircraft-type UAVs” during a Ukrainian attack on Tuesday. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But Ukraine is not getting  US Tomahawk  cruise missiles, as had been anticipated in Kyiv and it’s still chronically short of air defenses.\n \n\n   \n  “Just a few weeks ago, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin felt real pressure and the threat of Tomahawks and immediately showed a willingness to return to diplomacy,” Zelensky said Tuesday. “As soon as the pressure eased a little, the Russians began to try to jump off the diplomatic bandwagon.”\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian officials are anxious that US President Donald Trump is again souring on Kyiv ahead of a possible summit with Putin in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian source described Zelensky’s meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday as tense – if constructive overall. Zelensky himself said that “after many rounds of discussion” they had agreed the starting point for any ceasefire is “where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides understand what is meant.”\n \n\n   \n  Less than a month ago, Trump  mused  that Ukraine could win back all the territory it had lost.\n \n\n   \n    Zelensky eyes Russian assets\n \n\n   \n  Not for the first time, Zelensky is now turning to Europe for back-up, and will meet European leaders on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s stalling tactics have shown time and time again that Ukraine is the only party serious about peace,” Zelensky and 10   of the continent’s   leaders said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “We are developing measures to use the full value of Russia’s immobilised sovereign assets so that Ukraine has the resources it needs,” they added in a joint statement.\n \n\n   \n  About $200 billion of Russian assets in Europe have been frozen, and the European Union is exploring ways to use some of them as a loan to Ukraine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said last week he would call for the EU to provide a 140-billion euro ($163 billion) loan to Ukraine to finance its war effort.\n \n\n   \n  The Kremlin has described the idea as an illegal seizure of Russian property.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky has suggested some of the frozen assets be used to fund the purchase of Patriot air defense batteries and long-range missiles. He’s aiming to procure 25 Patriot systems – but acknowledged this would take years rather than months.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky and Ukraine’s European allies are also wary of a summit in Budapest hosted by Putin’s closest ally in Europe, Viktor Orban – though the Kremlin said Tuesday that the venue and date have not been confirmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I do not believe that a prime minister who blocks Ukraine everywhere can do anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution,” Zelensky said Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  There’s a clear pattern in Putin’s tactics, according to analyst Tatiana Stanovaya, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, based in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  “Whenever Trump becomes too angry or frustrated with Russia, Moscow reaches out,” Stanovaya  wrote on X  Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  After Putin’s conversation with Trump on the eve of Zelensky’s visit to Washington, “Trump’s tone seems to have shifted,” Stanovaya said. “He’s back to saying that Russia is winning, that Ukraine will have to give up territory, and that the US cannot afford to keep sending missiles. Russia’s position has not changed at all – it is the same as six months or even a year ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked on Sunday how Kyiv would respond if a meeting in Budapest went badly, the Ukrainian president replied: “Even when it seems you’re cornered, it’s not as hopeless as it looks.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/lawyers-jack-smith-no-lawmakers-wiretapped","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00Z","title":"Lawyers for Jack Smith Rebut Claims That Investigators 'Wiretapped' GOP Members of Congress in January 6 Probe","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith have directly rebutted claims by Republican lawmakers that FBI investigators wiretapped GOP members of Congress during the January 6 Capitol riot investigation.

investigators in the January 6 election subversion case had “wiretapped” GOP members of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republicans in recent weeks accused Smith and the FBI of “political weaponization” after the FBI disclosed 2023 court orders used to obtain phone toll records belonging to eight senators and one House member.

Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and his Democratic counterpart, Dick Durbin, Smith’s lawyers dispute that there was any political motive in obtaining the records, which they note were disclosed in the 2024 indictment of Trump and in Smith’s report on his investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “As described by various Senators, the toll data collection was narrowly tailored and limited to the four days from January 4, 2021 to January 7, 2021, with a focus on telephonic activity during the period immediately surrounding the January 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol,” reads the letter from Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, which was reviewed by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The subpoena’s limited temporal range is consistent with a focused effort to confirm or refute reports by multiple news outlets that during and after the January 6 riots at the Capitol, President Trump and his surrogates attempted to call Senators to urge them to delay the certification of the 2020 election results.”\n \n\n   \n  The Smith attorneys note that toll records of then-President Joe Biden were obtained by special counsel Robert Hur in the probe of his mishandling of classified documents, and in the investigation of Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who was convicted on bribery and foreign influence charges.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Smith’s use of the toll records as Special Counsel was lawful and in accordance with normal investigative procedure,” the letter from Smith’s attorneys says.\n \n\n   \n  Republican senators raised the disclosure of the toll records during a recent Senate hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi. During the same hearing, Democrats asked about possible political motives of the recent indictments brought against Trump’s perceived political enemies, including former FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/chicago-national-guard-supreme-court","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump touts Oregon National Guard ruling as Supreme Court weighs deployment to Chicago","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, citing a recent 9th Circuit ruling that supported similar actions in Portland and Los Angeles, where protests against federal immigration enforcement were deemed 'violent resistance.'

In its latest filing, the Department of Justice framed Trump’s decision to send the Guard into Illinois as a response to what it described as a broader national threat.\n \n\n   \n  “As the Ninth Circuit recognized, ‘the president can, and should, consider the totality of the circumstances,’ and it is error for courts to ‘discount evidence they deem less relevant,’” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court. “That is especially so where, as here, the events in Chicago are not occurring in a vacuum, as violent riots have occurred in Los Angeles and Portland, a shooter tried to murder federal agents in Dallas, and Mexican cartels are offering bounties on DHS personnel.”\n \n\n   \n  The states fighting Trump have scoffed at the idea that protests merit sending in the troops. When she temporarily blocked the deployment in Illinois earlier this month, US District Court Judge April Perry disputed the administration’s description of what has been happening on the ground at the ICE facility in Broadview. Perry, nominated by former President Joe Biden, pointed to what she described as a “troubling trend” of the administration of “equating protests with riots.”\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago-based 7th Circuit largely  upheld  Perry’s temporary order.\n \n\n   \n  To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison’s order to mobilize during the War of 1812. The Supreme Court rejected Mott’s argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”\n \n\n   \n  Chicago officials have balked at the notion that the protests against ICE agents are akin to an invading foreign army.\n \n\n   \n  “State and local law enforcement officers have handled isolated protest activities in Illinois, and there is no credible evidence to the contrary,” Illinois officials told the Supreme Court in their own set of written arguments this week.\n \n\n   \n  “The War of 1812,” they wrote, “entailed ‘vastly different’ facts than the record below.”\n \n\n   \n  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/north-carolina-republicans-redistricting-battle-map-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"16:38:00Z","title":"Republicans are poised to add a seventh GOP seat in Donald Trump’s redistricting battle","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A nationwide redistricting battle is unfolding, driven by Republican-led legislatures in states like North Carolina, Texas, and Missouri, who are drawing new congressional maps to gain additional GOP seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

seat in Donald Trump’s redistricting battle \n       \n  By Fredreka Schouten, Dianne Gallagher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:38 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A full-scale redistricting battle is raging across the country – largely at President Donald Trump’s behest – with Republican-controlled legislatures in multiple states facing increasing calls from the president and his allies to eke out additional GOP seats to fortify the party’s majority in the US House.\n \n\n   \n  In North Carolina, the Republicans who control the legislature are moving quickly to advance a new congressional map, joining a growing list of states carrying out an extraordinary redistricting push ahead of next year’s midterm elections. The state is poised to join  Texas  and  Missouri  in drawing new lines to benefit the GOP, bringing to seven the total number of new Republican-friendly districts created this year.\n \n\n   \n  The proposed map targets the US House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis and aims to give Republicans the advantage in 11 out of 14 House seats from North Carolina, up from the current 10.\n \n\n   \n  The Tar Heel State is the latest state to begin work on a once-rare, mid-decade redistricting. The president’s party typically loses ground in midterm elections, and Democrats need to flip just a handful of seats to take control of the House after next year’s congressional elections.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina Sen. Ralph Hise, a Republican who helped oversee the map-drawing, described the high stakes in stark terms.\n \n\n   \n  “The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular: draw a new map that will bring an additional Republican seat to the congressional delegation,” he said. If Democrats take control of the House, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” Hise added.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans in North Carolina have acted swiftly to accede to Trump’s wishes. State lawmakers held the first open meeting about the new map on Monday morning and approved it in the state Senate the following day – despite sharp criticism from Democrats and members of the public who showed up at the state Capitol in Raleigh to protest the move. It moves next to the state House.\n \n\n   \n  Under North Carolina law, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein does not have veto power over the maps. This week, he called the Republican actions “outrageous.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are failing the voters of North Carolina by deciding for them who their congressional representation will be,’” Stein said.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina is a politically competitive state. And Democrats such as Stein and his predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, have captured statewide offices in recent election cycles. But Republican leaders this week framed the lopsided congressional map as an outcome Trump deserved given his electoral success in the state.\n \n\n   \n  “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times,” the state Sen. Phil Berger, the top Republican in the Senate, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    State-by-state battle\n \n\n   \n  Legislators in deep-red Texas kicked off the political arms race this year with a  map that seeks to send five more Republicans  to Congress. Missouri Republicans also have drawn new lines aimed at adding  an additional GOP member  to the state’s congressional delegation. Both face court challenges, and activists in Missouri are seeking to overturn the map through a petition drive.\n \n\n   \n  So far, the biggest pushback from Democrats comes from  California, which launched a redistricting effort in response to Texas . A multimillion-dollar advertising and get-out-the vote campaign now is underway to persuade voters to temporarily override congressional maps drawn by an independent commission next month and create as many as five new US House seats for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have a clear advantage over Democrats in the number of states that could redraw maps. The GOP holds control of the governor’s office and both chambers of the legislature in 23 states, compared to Democrats’ 15.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers in other Republican states also are contemplating new maps, including Kansas, where legislators have  approved  $460,000 to fund a special session that would target the lone Democrat representing the state in Washington, four-term Rep. Sharice Davids. Two-thirds of the state House and Senate must agree to call a special session.\n \n\n   \n  In Indiana, where Republicans hold a 7-2 edge in the US House, the White House has repeatedly urged the GOP lawmakers in the majority in the state legislature to target at least one of the Democratic-held seats. Vice President JD Vance has twice visited the state to lobby legislators.\n \n\n   \n  Two other Republican-controlled states, Ohio and Utah, also are in throes of redistricting battles that began before Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  In Utah, a judge found that an existing map hadn’t followed guidelines imposed by a citizen ballot measure. Earlier this month, the GOP-dominated legislature passed a new congressional map that could give Democrats a slim chance of breaking the GOP’s monopoly on the state’s congressional delegation.\n \n\n   \n  That map needs to go back before the judge for her approval, with a final decision expected in early November. At the same time, Republicans in the state have launched a signature-gathering petition in the hopes of blocking the new map.\n \n\n   \n  In Ohio, the redrawing of its congressional districts is an outgrowth of a state law that requires maps approved without bipartisan support be redrawn after four years. Crafting new maps will ultimately fall to the Republican-controlled General Assembly, likely next month.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are vowing to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  The top Democrat in the US House, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, is weighing an effort to counter Republicans in Ohio. If the map is passed along partisan lines, state law allows a voter referendum that could invalidate the map, and Jeffries is prepared to go all-in to support that effort — including raising money, according to a person familiar with his planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose internal deliberations.\n \n\n   \n  John Bisognano, the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Democrats will mount lawsuits, protests and citizen-led ballot initiatives to push back on the actions in GOP-dominated states.\n \n\n   \n  “Republicans are openly stating that they need to take away the voting power of the American people through gerrymandering in order to win the 2026 midterms,” Bisognano said in a statement. “That alone is a sign of incredible weakness. The fact that they are taking the gerrymandering crisis to even more states beyond Texas and Missouri underscores just how scared they are of the opposition they are facing from the American people – even in deep red states.”\n \n\n   \n    Democratic fury in North Carolina\n \n\n   \n  Trump has praised the new lines, writing last week on Truth Social that it “would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections, which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda, not just in North Carolina, but across our Nation.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis’ district representing a swath of eastern North Carolina is the only competitive US House seat remaining in North Carolina after previous rounds of redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump won the district last November even as Davis won a second term by less than two percentage points. The new map makes the district more favorable to Republicans by swapping out several counties with more conservative communities on the coast.\n \n\n   \n  Some North Carolina Republicans argued that actions in California – and other deep-blue states – required them to respond. “This is a political arms race that Republicans did not start,” Hise said, pointing for former President  Barack Obama ’s support of the California redistricting initiative.\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic state lawmakers along with multiple members of the public who spoke during the elections committee meeting denounced the map as a brazen power grab.\n \n\n   \n  “California hasn’t redistricted a thing,” Mark Swallow of Democracy Out Loud, a liberal activist group, said during the public comment period in a Senate committee meeting. “What they’ve done is respond to Texas, which started this fiasco for our country, and put an initiative on the ballot to ask Californians if they should be redistricted.”\n \n\n   \n  “You should do the same,” he told legislators, “but I doubt that you will because you know that North Carolinians will never approve this scheme. So, you are liars and cheats. That’s what this boils down to. You’re liars and cheats.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic state Sen. Val Applewhite said Republican lawmakers were going along with Trump’s “coordinated national effort to reshape this country’s political map in his image to guarantee one thing: that Donald Trump and only Donald Trump remains in power.”\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2023/11/08/world/panda-diplomacy-us-china","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:58:00-04:00","title":"The National Zoo’s panda program is ending after more than 50 years as China looks elsewhere","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. is ending its more than 50-year partnership with China over the loan of giant pandas, marking the end of a long-standing tradition of 'panda diplomacy' that began in 1972 during President Richard Nixon’s visit to China.

China looks elsewhere \n       \n  By Yong Xiong, Melissa Gray and David Culver, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:58 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Three giant pandas left their enclosure at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC, and departed by plane back to China on Wednesday, marking the end of more than 50 years of Chinese pandas being housed at the zoo.\n \n\n   \n  The black and white bears – Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their youngest cub, Xiao Qi Ji – were transported from the zoo in crates and loaded onto a FedEx aircraft at Dulles International Airport, taking off around 1 p.m.\n \n\n   \n  The Smithsonian National Zoo was the first US zoo to showcase pandas as part of what’s been called “panda diplomacy.”\n \n\n   \n  Zoo staff call it a “hiatus” in their five-decade wildly popular panda program; Chinese officials have yet to say whether it will continue.\n \n\n   \n  And with relations between the two superpowers in a constant state of flux, these national treasures may be finding themselves part of the extension of the diplomatic chaos that has taken over the relationship between the two countries.\n \n\n   \n  The   pandas’ departure from the National Zoo leaves Zoo Atlanta as the only other US zoo to feature pandas from China, and not for much longer. The contracts for Atlanta’s four bears expire next year, with no word on an extension.\n \n\n   \n    It started during the Nixon presidency\n \n\n   \n  China acknowledges the cuddly creatures are used for its “major political and diplomatic needs,” especially in places where it hopes to gain more influence or closer relations. China says its focus is on conservation and research and says the US program has been productive.\n \n\n   \n  “The two sides have formed good cooperative relations, achieved fruitful results and played a positive role in protecting endangered species,” said spokesperson Mao Ning of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  “The purpose is to better protect endangered species and promote global biodiversity conservation.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s panda diplomacy with Washington kicked off in 1972, following President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to China.\n \n\n   \n  Chairman Mao Zedong’s government gave two giant pandas to the United States in a sign of warming bilateral ties after decades of diplomatic deep freeze.\n \n\n   \n  First lady Pat Nixon welcomed the pandas to the nation’s capital, saying, “They will be enjoyed by the millions of people who come from across the country to visit the nation’s capital each year.”\n \n\n   \n  Seeing the pandas’ popularity rise among Americans, China sent more of the   cuddly and charismatic creatures   to other zoos across the United States, eventually loaning them instead of giving them as a gift.\n \n\n   \n    Changing diplomacy\n \n\n   \n  Agreements between China and the US zoos stipulate Beijing owns the pandas and any of their offspring, and they require payment “for the conservation of giant pandas in China.” The National Zoo has paid $500,000 a year; Zoo Atlanta says it has  contributed more than $16 million  since the start of its program in 1999.\n \n\n   \n  Since giant pandas arrived at the National Zoo in 1972, animal care staff and scientists have studied their biology, behavior, breeding, reproduction and disease,  according to the zoo .\n \n\n   \n  “The Zoo’s giant panda team works closely with colleagues in China to advance conservation efforts for giant pandas in human care and in the wild,” the zoo says on its  website .\n \n\n   \n  At the height of the program, there were 15 pandas at one time in the United States, but in the past decade, the numbers have dropped – coinciding with worsening US-China relations. And soon, there could be no more pandas at American zoos.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, videos surfaced on Chinese social media claiming pandas returning from the Memphis Zoo were being abused. Partially fueled by Chinese state media, the claims went viral.\n \n\n   \n  Chinese doctors defended the zoo’s treatment of the pandas, confirming that the giant panda, named YaYa, was suffering from a skin disease, but was in good health.\n \n\n   \n  But some in China still see it as a symbol of America’s bullying and oppression of China, with others highlighting countries such as Russia, which also hosts the animals, as a place where pandas are treated well.\n \n\n   \n  Assuming China chooses not to send over more giant pandas, and Atlanta sends theirs back next year, by the end of 2024 the only panda in zoos throughout all of the Americas would be Xin Xin in Mexico City.\n \n\n   \n  Xin Xin – who at 33 is old for a panda – is owned by Mexico and is a main attraction at the zoo, which is now bracing for a possible surge in visitors.\n \n\n   \n  “For the time being, come to Mexico!” said Fernando Gual Sill, director general of the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City. “In Mexico City we have the fortune to have (a panda) and to see it and to enjoy it!”\n \n\n   \n    Pandas around the world\n \n\n   \n  Pandas that are part of China’s loan program are meant to serve as an  envoy of friendship  between China and the host country, so the fading program in the United States may indicate a diplomatic shift.\n \n\n   \n  Russia, China’s northern neighbor, received a pair of pandas in 2019, with Chinese President Xi Jinping standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin as they welcomed the bears to the zoo in Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  Qatar received its first panda last year.\n \n\n   \n  Including the United States, 23 countries have pandas on loan from China, but that number is dwindling. Scotland will lose its two pandas in December when the  Edinburgh Zoo  must return them to China; Australia’s  Adelaide Zoo  has its two pandas only for one more year.\n \n\n   \n  The pandas leaving America will head to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, where in recent years conservation efforts have proven successful. Pandas are no longer on the endangered species list, and their population has jumped nearly 17% over the past decade,  according to Zoo Atlanta .\n \n\n   \n  Still, the total number of giant pandas in China – 1,864 as of the latest census, in 2014 – is considered low for breeding and maintaining a viable population. Only around 61% of China’s pandas are protected by reserves, and their habitat is threatened by logging in established forests, which eliminates the large tree hollows pandas like to use for dens,  Zoo Atlanta says .\n \n\n   \n    Will the pandas ever return stateside?\n \n\n   \n  Staff at the National Zoo say they’re hopeful China might one day send over more giant pandas. They’re even planning renovations for the soon-to-be vacant panda exhibit.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re hopeful for the future, so we have submitted an application that’s being reviewed,” said Bob Lee, director of animal care at the National Zoo.\n \n\n   \n  Zoo Atlanta’s panda habitat  cost $7 million to build  ahead of the bears’ arrival in 1999, and assuming the bears leave at the end of their contracted stay, it will now stand empty. Plans for the exhibit, with a welcome sign announcing the “Giant Pandas of Chengdu” and a panda-themed gift shop, aren’t clear.\n \n\n   \n  Remembering how the pandas first came to Washington, zoo visitor Jane Mahalik said she hoped the current first lady might work for their return.\n \n\n   \n  “Pat Nixon got the pandas here,” Mahalik told CNN, “and Jill Biden should go and get these pandas back for us.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Yong Xiong reported from Washington, DC, and New York; Melissa Gray reported from Atlanta; and David Culver reported from Los Angeles and Mexico City.

attorney says he’ll recommend resentencing in decades-old Menendez brothers’ murder case \n       \n  By Cindy Von Quednow, Amanda Musa and Melissa Gray, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:55 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Los Angeles County’s district attorney said Thursday he’ll recommend that a judge resentence Lyle and Erik Menendez nearly 30 years after the brothers were convicted of the murders of their parents – a recommendation that he said would make them eligible for immediate parole.\n \n\n   \n  “After very careful review of all arguments made from people on both sides of this equation, I came to a place where I believe under the law resentencing is appropriate and I am going to recommend that to a court tomorrow,” District Attorney George Gascón said at an afternoon news conference in Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers have been serving life without the possibility of parole since their 1996 convictions of first-degree murder in the 1989 killings of their parents, Jose and Kitty, in their California mansion. Gascón’s decision to recommend a resentencing – the culmination of a review that came after  defense attorneys said in 2023 they had new evidence  pointing to abuse by their father – was made about an hour before he announced it, he said.   \n \n\n   \n  “I believe that they have paid their debt to society and the system provides a vehicle for their case to be reviewed by a parole board, and if board concurs with my assessment … they will be released accordingly,” Gascón said in front of a packed room that included several media outlets and family members.\n \n\n   \n  A Los Angeles Superior Court judge will ultimately decide whether to resentence the brothers, Gascón’s office  said . While Gascón said he’d make his recommendation to the court Friday, a date for a hearing on the matter has not been determined, his office said. Nancy Theberge, deputy in charge of Gascón’s resentencing unit, hopes a hearing will be held in 30 to 45 days, she said.\n \n\n   \n  Gascón   said he supports the resentencing of the brothers to life with the possibility of parole – which normally would mean 50 years to life in prison. But because the crimes happened when the brothers were under 26 years old, under California law they would be eligible for youthful parole.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re very sure not only that brothers have rehabilitated and will be safe to be reintegrated into our society, but they have paid their dues, not only for the crimes that they committed, but because of all the other things they have done to improve the lives of so many others,” Gascón said in the news conference﻿, indicating that the men created groups to address how to deal with untreated trauma and helping inmates with physical disabilities.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers “have been model prisoners by all accounts,” Gascón said in an interview with CNN later Thursday, after he announced his decision.\n \n\n   \n  “Not only have they worked on their own self-improvement, but they have done a lot of work to better the life of those around them, which that part is unusual,” Gascón told CNN. “I believe they have served enough time.”\n \n\n   \n  One of the brothers’ attorneys said his team is “hopeful” the decision will one day allow the men to have a life outside of prison.\n \n\n   \n  “We are grateful the district attorney recognized not only the extraordinary contributions Erik and Lyle have made while in prison, but the role that sexual abuse played in their actions as well,” attorney Cliff Gardner told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The reexamination of the case came more than 35 years after the fatal shooting of Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills home. Their sons, Lyle and Erik, who were 21 and 18 at the time, were arrested less than a year later, in 1990, and accused of first-degree murder.\n \n\n   \n  At their high-profile trials decades ago – one of the first cases to be televised – the brothers did not deny killing their parents. However, they argued they should not be convicted because they acted in self-defense after enduring a lifetime of physical and sexual abuse by their father.\n \n\n   \n  A first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors deadlocked on the charges. In their second trial, much of the defense evidence about sexual abuse was excluded. The brothers were found guilty in 1996 and sentenced to life in prison.\n \n\n   \n    What the 2023 defense petition said\n \n\n   \n  Gascón’s reexamination of the case came after attorneys for the Menendez brothers filed  a habeas corpus petition  in 2023, citing what they argue is  new evidence , as well as a recent  California law  on resentencing in which the court can take into consideration sentences in comparable cases. The judge can consider whether the defendants were victims of psychological or physical abuse, whether they are rehabilitated and whether they are a danger to society.\n \n\n   \n  Among the new evidence the 2023 petition asked a court to consider: a sworn statement by former Menudo boy band member Roy Rosselló, who alleged Jose Menendez sexually assaulted him in the 1980s. The attorneys also said  a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin  months before the killings alludes to the abuse he endured.\n \n\n   \n  The defense was asking the court to either vacate the brothers’ conviction and sentence, or permit discovery and an evidentiary hearing during which they can provide proof, the petition says.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers’ story has taken on new interest following the September release of the Netflix series, “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,” co-created by Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan.

door for possible parole, judge rules \n       \n  By Taylor Romine, Matthew J. Friedman, Nick Watt, Melissa Gray, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:54 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A judge resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez to 50 years to life in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents, ruling Tuesday the brothers will be eligible for parole. The brothers have been serving life without parole for the killings.\n \n\n   \n  The stunning decision came at the end of the first day of what was scheduled to be a two-day hearing about resentencing for the brothers, who were convicted of first-degree murder for the killings in the living room of the family’s Beverly Hills home.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Michael Jesic said during the resentencing that a horrific crime was committed, but he was equally shocked by the letters from prison and corrections officers, saying it’s remarkable what the brothers have done.\n \n\n   \n  While they are immediately eligible for parole, Jesic said he is not suggesting they should be released, but “one day they should get that chance.”\n \n\n   \n  The state parole board and governor must still decide whether to grant parole. A hearing with the board is already scheduled for June 13 as part of a separate bid by the brothers.\n \n\n   \n  They’re also seeking clemency from the governor, which could allow for their immediate release, and they have filed a habeas petition for a new trial.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s now up to the parole board and the governor of California,” Jesic said. CNN has reached out to the governor’s office and the state parole board for comment on the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  The parole board could either deny their request or recommend to the governor that they be granted parole. If the board recommends parole be granted, the decision will go to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n \n\n   \n  In California, the governor has “executive authority to affirm, reverse, or modify any Board decision to grant or deny parole to a convicted murderer,” according to  the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation . He’ll have 120 days to do that.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, Newsom  used that authority  to deny parole for Sirhan Sirhan, the man convicted of assassinating Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, after the board recommended Sirhan for parole.\n \n\n   \n  Last fall, former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón  recommended resentencing for the brothers , but his successor, Nathan Hochman, has fought against it.\n \n\n   \n  “The decision to resentence Erik and Lyle Menendez was a monumental one that has significant implications for the families involved, the community, and the principles of justice,” Hochman said in a statement Tuesday evening. “Our office’s motions to withdraw the resentencing motion filed by the previous administration ensured that the Court was presented with all the facts before making such a consequential decision.”\n \n\n   \n  The hearing moved much more quickly than expected. Jesic had given no indication about when or in what form he would rule, acknowledging the complicated nature of the case in which the family members are victims who also support the defense. It was even thought a decision wouldn’t come before the end of proceedings Wednesday, he said.\n \n\n   \n    Brothers take ‘full responsibility’ for the murders\n \n\n   \n  The high-stakes hearing began Tuesday with arguments about whether Erik and Lyle Menendez should be resentenced in the first place.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers appeared remotely from prison before the judge made the decision, and both took “full responsibility” for the murders.\n \n\n   \n  “I committed an atrocious act against two people who had every right to live, my mom and dad,” Erik said, adding that he “created a crushing sadness” for his family and there was “no excuse” for his behavior.\n \n\n   \n  “I will never stop trying to make a difference whether I am inside or outside of prison,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lyle also admitted to killing his parents, saying he “was immature” and “filled with rage.”\n \n\n   \n  “Had I trusted others to help me, I wouldn’t have committed these crimes,” he said. “I didn’t think anyone would believe me about my sexual abuse.”\n \n\n   \n  If he was let out of prison, he would “continue to serve sexual abuse victims,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  After court, defense attorney Mark Geragos said, “I just know that on a day like today, that redemption is possible.”\n \n\n   \n  “The fact is, the Menendez brothers have done remarkable work, and today is a great day after 35 years,” he said. “They are a real family, real people who have lived through unimaginable horrors, and I’m hopeful and glad that we’re one, one huge step closer to bringing the boys home.”\n \n\n   \n  The brothers were hoping the judge would reduce that sentence to life with parole; Geragos said earlier Tuesday he hoped the judge would go even further and reduce the charge to voluntary manslaughter, with a sentence of time served.\n \n\n   \n    Family members and close supporters testify\n \n\n   \n  Family members who have long supported the brothers were in court Tuesday, with several taking the stand to plead for the brothers’ release.\n \n\n   \n  “We just want this to end,” cousin Anamaria Baralt testified.\n \n\n   \n  Relatives say the brothers have  demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation , and that the severity of the sentence should be revisited because of an evolving understanding of childhood sexual abuse. The brothers have maintained they carried out the murders in self-defense after years of abuse by their father, and continued to say that Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Diane Hernandez, another cousin who testified Tuesday, lived with the Menendez family in their Beverly Hills home and viewed herself as an older sister to the boys. On the stand, she described how Jose Menendez intimidated and terrorized the house, and testified about his “hallway rule” that when he was with the brothers, no one else could be.\n \n\n   \n  “Please be merciful,” Hernandez told the judge. The brothers, she said, “are remarkable human beings at this point.”\n \n\n   \n  Hochman, the current Los Angeles County district attorney, had said he was not opposed to resentencing, but doesn’t feel it’s justified yet. The brothers, he says, have “fabricated” their claims of abuse and self-defense and must admit it first.\n \n\n   \n  “The Menendezes have had numerous chances to come clean with all their actions and if and when they do, they’ll be ready for resentencing,” Hochman told CNN earlier Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors pressed family members on whether they were aware of the brothers having lied to them over the years.\n \n\n   \n  “Were you aware the brothers lied to the family, to law enforcement and to the media?” Seth Carmack asked Tamara Goodell, another cousin. She said she was, but that the brothers never spoke about it to her one way or another and they talk about the murders with her only to say sorry.\n \n\n   \n  Baralt was also asked whether the brothers had ever admitted to lying and trying to manipulate the case. She said Lyle had recently admitted asking a girlfriend to lie about his father’s abuse.\n \n\n   \n  Retired Judge Jonathan Colby, who knew the brothers through a prison program, also testified they were great inmates, calling them “peacemakers” in prison. Anare Brown, who met the brothers while he was in prison, said they have remorse and insight, and have helped “dozens” of people they were imprisoned with.\n \n\n   \n  Another factor Hochman cited in opposing resentencing is the recent finding the brothers would pose a “moderate” risk of violence if released. That came in a pair of comprehensive risk assessments conducted by the state parole board.\n \n\n   \n  Both brothers had committed cell phone violations while in prison, he said – Lyle in November 2024 and Erik in January 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutor Habib Balian asked Baralt on Tuesday about the cell phones, and she acknowledged some of her conversations with Lyle had taken place on an illegal burner phone he had in prison.\n \n\n   \n    Efforts toward release\n \n\n   \n  Unlike a new trial, which would focus on the facts of the case, resentencing allowed the judge to consider a variety of factors, including the brothers’ rehabilitative efforts.\n \n\n   \n  The brothers have founded a long list of prison programs, with Erik starting at least five, including a support group for disabled and elderly inmates. Lyle founded a massive beautification program, raising more the $250,000 to install greenery to help prison life to resemble the outside world.\n \n\n   \n  Besides authority to change parole board decisions, Newsom also has the power to commute the brothers’ sentences, which would immediately free them – but he has so far refrained from doing so. The “comprehensive risk assessments” the judge requested ahead of the resentencing hearing were commissioned by the state’s Board of Parole after Newsom asked them to investigate whether the brothers would pose an “unreasonable risk” to the public if released.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the Menendez brothers are also pursuing a new trial, formally known as a habeas corpus petition. Attorneys claim to have new evidence against the brothers’ father, including a 1988 letter from Erik Menendez to a relative referencing the alleged abuse.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/07/20/us/timeline-james-craig-colorado-poisoning-trial","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:43:00Z","title":"What we learned about the events leading up to a Colorado dentist poisoning his wife’s protein shakes","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Craig, a former Colorado dentist, was convicted of murdering his wife Angela Craig by poisoning her protein shakes and eyedrops with cyanide, arsenic, and tetrahydrozoline.

events leading up to a Colorado dentist poisoning his wife’s protein shakes \n       \n  By Melissa Gray, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:53 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former Colorado dentist  James Craig  was convicted of murder Wednesday after a trial that lasted nearly two weeks, found guilty of killing his wife and the mother of their six children by poisoning her protein shakes.\n \n\n   \n  Angela Craig was 43 when she died in 2023, by which point she’d been hospitalized three times in 10 days with symptoms no one could initially explain. A coroner’s report later said her  cause of death  was acute cyanide and tetrahydrozoline poisoning, with subacute arsenic poisoning listed as a significant condition.\n \n\n   \n  Police  arrested  Craig for first-degree murder on March 19, 2023, hours after his wife was taken off life support. Prosecutors  added more charges against  him earlier this year, alleging he plotted to kill four people from behind bars while awaiting trial.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we learned about the events in Angela Craig’s final weeks.\n \n\n   \n   Late 2022-February 2023 : Three women meet James Craig on  seeking.com , a dating website, they separately testify. Each woman said their relationship with Craig evolves into a romantic one, with him providing monetary gifts. One woman testifies Craig bought a car for her daughter, while another said she received about $8,000 from him, mostly through Venmo transactions.\n \n\n   \n  One woman recalled a conversation with Craig about “The Purge,” a fictional horror movie about a short period of time when all violent crime, including murder, is legal. Craig said he would “purge” his wife if that were reality, she testified.\n \n\n   \n   February 22-25, 2023:  James Craig attends a dental conference in Las Vegas where he meets Karin Cain, a Texas dentist going through a divorce, prosecutor Ryan Brackley said in his opening statement. The two begin a relationship and discuss seeing each other again.\n \n\n   \n   Monday, February 27:  Craig creates a new email account with the handle “jimandwaffles” using a computer in an exam room at his Aurora dental practice, according to a probable cause affidavit. The Gmail address was used to conduct searches on arsenic and undetectable poisons,   order arsenic on Amazon and make arrangements for Cain to travel to Denver, the affidavit says.\n \n\n   \n   February 28:  Search queries for “how to make murder look like a heart attack” and “a dosage of tetrahydrozoline that is fatal” are in the search history on this day for the “jimandwaffles” account, according to a forensic exam of the computer from exam room 9 at Craig’s dental practice, testified Molly Harris, an Aurora Police detective with the Major Crimes Homicide Unit.\n \n\n   \n   March 1:  Angela Craig visits family in Utah and attends a genealogy conference with one of her sisters, Brackley said. It was a shared hobby, he said.\n \n\n   \n  When Angela Craig leaves for her trip, Craig texts Cain: “Maybe she will decide to stay gone for a long time,” according to the prosecutor.\n \n\n   \n  A search for “how long does it take to die from arsenic poisoning?” is found in the search history of the computer from exam room 9, Harris says.\n \n\n   \n   March 4:  The arsenic order is delivered to the Craigs’ house, according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n   March 5:  Angela Craig returns home from Utah, the affidavit says.\n \n\n   \n    First hospital visit\n \n\n   \n   Monday, March 6:  After waking up, Angela drinks a protein shake her husband made for her; Brackley said the couple often made them for each other. She works out but starts to feel “strange.” She texts her husband, “My stomach feels fine, but my head feels funny and dizzy. Very strange.”\n \n\n   \n  James misses the daily 6:45 a.m. staff “huddle” at his dental office and arrives closer to 7 a.m., when the practice opens, according to testimony from office manager Caitlin Romero. He apologized and said his wife wasn’t feeling well, possibly because he had put too much protein powder in the shake he’d given her. He works for a couple of hours but then leaves to take Angela to the hospital, Romero testified.\n \n\n   \n  At the emergency room of AdventHealth Parker Hospital, Angela has tests including an MRI, CT scan and bloodwork, but she is sent home after nothing is found, Brackley said.\n \n\n   \n  James Craig texts Cain that his wife is at the hospital and says, “Just for the record, I will never drug you.”\n \n\n   \n  He returns to the practice that evening after business hours, according to Romero, who said she frequently stayed there late. Craig said he wanted to be alone and came back “just to get away for a minute.” Romero said his office lights were off when she was leaving and she thought he’d left again, so she was “startled” to see him working on a computer in one of the exam rooms with the lights off. She testified that while on her drive home, she received a text from Craig saying he’d be receiving a personal package at work and not to open it.\n \n\n   \n  Craig orders oleandrin from Adooq Bioscience, according to the probable cause affidavit. The compound had come up when Craig had searched lists of the world’s deadliest plants, Brackley said. Detectives intercepted the package before it could be delivered.\n \n\n   \n  There were searches found on the exam 9 room computer on this day for “visine” and “tetrahydrozoline poisoning timeline,” according to Harris.\n \n\n   \n   March 7 : Angela still feels sick and goes to an urgent care clinic but is sent home without a diagnosis, Brackley said.\n \n\n   \n   March 8 : James Craig orders potassium cyanide from Midland Scientific, according to the affidavit. He notes in the order: “Hopefully this is in stock and I can come pick it up tomorrow, March 9.”\n \n\n   \n  At 10:50 p.m., a credit card belonging to James Craig is used to purchase 12 packages of eyedrops from a King Soopers store in Aurora, according to testimony from a company representative. Tetrahydrozoline – a medication commonly found in eyedrops – was one of the poisons Craig used to kill his wife.\n \n\n   \n    Second hospital visit\n \n\n   \n   Thursday, March 9 : Angela Craig drinks a protein shake in the morning and her symptoms worsen, Brackley said. “There’s a moment on March 9 where her kids find her passed out, fainted,” he said in his opening statement. “There’s a moment on March 9 where she crawls across the floor because she can’t get up, and she goes back to the hospital.” She is admitted to AdventHealth Parker hospital and James Craig arrives. She will remain at the hospital until March 14.\n \n\n   \n  A sample of Angela Craig’s blood taken at 11:24 a.m. showed a high and toxic level of arsenic, according to testimony from Dr. James Brower, a forensic toxicologist with NMS Laboratories, which did the testing after she died. The level in her blood was 330 micrograms per milliliter, he said, an amount that causes gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, lightheadedness and a feeling of being uncoordinated.\n \n\n   \n  James Craig receives an order acknowledgement from Midland Scientific for the potassium cyanide, according to the affidavit. He’s told it is not in stock, but the company can overnight it to him. An employee then contacts him about additional documentation the product screening team requires for the order. Craig says he is a surgeon performing a craniofacial reconstruction and hopes to publish the results of using potassium cyanide for the procedure in a paper for the National Institutes of Health.\n \n\n   \n  The employee reaches out again and says because James Craig is a new customer, the supplier needs an additional day to establish him in their system and process the order.\n \n\n   \n  That night, at 10:16 p.m., seven packages of Visine eyedrops are purchased from the same King Soopers store as the day before, using James Craig’s credit card, the company’s representative testified.\n \n\n   \n   March 10:  James Craig contacts Midland Scientific to ask about the potassium cyanide shipment and is told it will arrive the next day, according to the affidavit.\n \n\n   \n   March 11 : James contacts Midland Scientific to ask about the shipment, saying it’s 7:30 p.m. and he has waited all day for it at his office, the affidavit says. It is a Saturday. He doesn’t receive an immediate response.\n \n\n   \n   March 13 : The potassium cyanide is delivered to James Craig’s office, but another employee, unaware of Craig’s instructions to Romero, opens it. Romero testified the employee handed her a silver foil package with a folded invoice from the box it was delivered in. The box was addressed to “Jim Craig – Personal” and had biohazard stickers on it. She looked at the packing slip and saw it was potassium cyanide. Romero put the items back in the box and placed it on Craig’s desk, but said she looked up potassium cyanide online because she’d never seen it delivered to the office before and was unfamiliar with what it was.\n \n\n   \n   March 14 : Angela is discharged from the hospital. Within an hour of returning home, she starts searching online for the possible causes of her symptoms, Brackley said.\n \n\n   \n  That evening, video from the Craigs’ kitchen security camera shows James making a protein shake for his wife.\n \n\n   \n    Third hospital visit and death\n \n\n   \n   Wednesday, March 15 : At 9:35 a.m., James Craig texts Angela’s sister to make sure she gives Angela a prescription. Brackley said Angela had been on medication (clindamycin) for a sinus infection and Craig had emptied one of the capsules and refilled it with potassium cyanide. Her sister gave her the pill.\n \n\n   \n  At 11:08 a.m., Angela Craig goes to UCHealth Anschutz with severe headache and dizziness, accompanied by her brother. James Craig arrives later. At 2 p.m., she suffers a seizure and rapid decline and is placed on life support in the ICU.\n \n\n   \n  A sample taken from Angela Craig at 11:50 a.m. showed high levels of arsenic, cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, Brower testified.\n \n\n   \n  The amount of arsenic was less than on March 9 but showed she’d been exposed to arsenic again, he said. She also had a level of cyanide that could have only come from ingestion or exposure, Brower said. The chemical can cause similar symptoms to arsenic, and eventually it results in organ failure, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The same sample showed Angela Craig also had a lethal amount of tetrahydrozoline in her blood that could have come only from ingesting it, Brower said. The concentration indicates it came from “a bottle or more” of eyedrops, he said. When consumed orally, the substance can cause a person’s heart to stop beating, he said.\n \n\n   \n  James Craig calls Caitlin Romero and says he doesn’t think Angela will make it through the night. She testified this was the second time he’d made that comment; she believes the first comment came on March 9, when Angela went to the hospital for the second time.\n \n\n   \n  Romero leaves the office around 3 p.m. and calls Jacqueline Calderon, the office manager of an affiliated dental practice, telling her about the potassium cyanide delivery and how Angela’s symptoms, as described by James Craig, lined up with poisoning symptoms she had found online. She testifies she didn’t mention her concerns on the 13th “because thinking that somebody was capable of possibly poisoning somebody else — it was not something that I was taking lightly.” Romero then speaks with Craig’s business partner, Dr. Ryan Redfearn, and his wife about the potassium cyanide.\n \n\n   \n  Redfearn and his wife visit the hospital where Angela is staying, the affidavit says. They speak briefly to James Craig, who steps away for a phone call. While he’s on the phone, Redfearn pulls a nurse away and tells the nurse about his concerns that Angela may have been poisoned with potassium cyanide.\n \n\n   \n  A blood sample taken from Angela Craig at 8:21 p.m. shows an even higher level of cyanide than in the morning blood sample — 3.7 micrograms per milliliter, compared to 1.7 earlier in the day, Brower said. It “looks like there had to have been a second administration of cyanide in the hospital,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   March 16 :  Karin Cain  visits Denver, a flight itinerary shows. Police speak with the Redfearns.\n \n\n   \n   March 18 : Angela Craig is pronounced brain dead at 4:29 p.m.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Andi Babineau and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/science/elon-musk-sean-duffy-nasa-spacex","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:01:00Z","title":"Elon Musk calls acting NASA chief ‘Sean Dummy’ as SpaceX moon contract hangs in the balance","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Elon Musk publicly criticized Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, calling him 'Sean Dummy' and accusing him of low intelligence, after Duffy suggested NASA might sideline SpaceX from its $2.9 billion lunar lander contract due to schedule delays.

    \n  By Hadas Gold, Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:01 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Elon Musk lashed out at Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a series of insulting posts on his social media platform X on Tuesday, after Duffy suggested  NASA may sideline  SpaceX from its moon mission.\n \n\n   \n  Musk, SpaceX’s CEO, called Duffy “Sean Dummy,” accused him of having a “2 digit IQ” and posted sophomoric  memes  aimed at Duffy.\n \n\n   \n  “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America’s space program?” Musk asked in a  post  Tuesday morning, which he pinned to his X profile. (Duffy, a former member of Congress, is a world champion lumberjack speed climber.)\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Duffy said in an interview with CNBC that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon’s surface, is lagging behind schedule, potentially thwarting NASA’s efforts to return humans to the moon before China amid a new space race.\n \n\n   \n  “So, I’m going to open up the contract. I’m going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “They do remarkable things,” Duffy told Fox News about SpaceX on Monday, “but they’re behind schedule.” NASA’s pivotal moon-landing mission, called Artemis III, is planned for as soon as mid-2027.\n \n\n   \n  Musk spent Tuesday morning posting about how SpaceX is “the only company to successfully human-certify a new orbital space vehicle in the US” and resposting criticisms of Duffy.\n \n\n   \n  Musk also responded to reporting from the Wall Street Journal that Musk ally Jared Isaacman may be back in the running to lead the agency, as Duffy jockeys to fold NASA completely under the Transportation Department. Trump had pulled Isaacman’s nomination for NASA administrator  earlier this year  – the same week Musk departed his role in Washington.   Though Trump cited Isaacman’s “prior associations” as the reason for pulling the nomination,  CNN previously reported  that a faction of people in Trump’s inner circle advocated against Isaacman after Musk left Washington and shortly before Musk’s very public falling out with the President.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman — who has twice flown to orbit on SpaceX capsules he commissioned — has reportedly been back in the running, and a source familiar with the matter confirmed he has met with Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!” Musk  posted  on Tuesday, as well as reposting others’ praise for Isaacman.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman told CNN he has “never expressed confidence about renomination at any point” and that he has “a lot of respect for Secretary Duffy and I have always enjoyed the time I’ve spent with him.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m grateful to all the supporters and to President Trump for the consideration, and most of all, I just wish to see NASA continue to shine as the world’s most accomplished space agency,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a spokesperson for Duffy said that the transportation secretary “never said he wants to keep the (NASA) job himself.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson added that Duffy has suggested NASA “might benefit from being part of the Cabinet, maybe even within the Department of Transportation,” but reiterated he has not said he would like to become NASA’s permanent leader.\n \n\n   \n  “The President asked him to talk with potential candidates for Administrator, and he’s been happy to help by vetting people and giving his honest feedback,” the spokesperson said. “The bottom line is that Secretary Duffy is here to serve the President, and he will support whomever the President nominates.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/climate/iceland-mosquito-discovery","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Iceland Just Found Its First Mosquitoes","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iceland has confirmed the first wild sighting of mosquitoes, specifically the species Culiseta annulata, discovered in Kiðafell, Kjós, near Reykjavík, by resident Björn Hjaltason.

This week, scientists announced the discovery of three mosquitoes — marking the country’s first confirmed finding of these insects in the wild.\n \n\n   \n  Mosquitoes are found almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of Antarctica and, until very recently, Iceland, due to their extreme cold.\n \n\n   \n  The mosquitoes were discovered by Björn Hjaltason in Kiðafell, Kjós, in western Iceland about 20 miles north of the capital Reykjavík. “At dusk on October 16, I caught sight of a strange fly,” Hjaltason posted in a  Facebook group  about insects, according to  reports  in the Icelandic media. “I immediately suspected what was going on and quickly collected the fly,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  He contacted Matthías Alfreðsson, an entomologist at the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, who drove out to Hjaltason’s house the next day. They captured three in total, two females and a male. Alfreðsson identified them as mosquitoes from the Culiseta annulata species.\n \n\n   \n  A single mosquito from a different species was discovered many years ago on an airplane at the country’s Keflavík International Airport, Alfreðsson told CNN, but this “is the first record of mosquitoes occurring in the natural environment in Iceland.”\n \n\n   \n  The Culiseta annulata species is native to a huge part of the Eastern Hemisphere, ranging from North Africa to northern Siberia. It appears well adapted to colder climates, primarily because adults can ride out the cold in sheltered places, Alfreðsson said. “This allows them to withstand long, harsh winters when temperatures drop below freezing.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the mosquito arrived in Iceland, but theories include the possibility it came via ships or containers. Further monitoring will be needed in the spring to see whether the species can survive the winter and “truly become established in Iceland,” Alfreðsson said.\n \n\n   \n  Mosquitoes, which tend to thrive in warmth and humidity, are likely to be  one of the few real winners  as the planet heats up.\n \n\n   \n  As climate change accelerates, bringing more heat, storms and floods, the range of these disease-carrying insects is increasing, according to a growing body of research. Rising temperatures also allow mosquitoes to grow faster and live longer.\n \n\n   \n  Iceland is no stranger to the impacts of climate change and has experienced record-breaking heat. In May, temperatures in parts of the country were  more than 18 degrees  Fahrenheit above normal. This extreme heat was made 40 times more likely by climate change, an  analysis  from the World Weather Attribution network found.\n \n\n   \n  But there are a still a lot of unknowns about how mosquitoes are behaving as the world warms and experts urge caution when it comes to linking Iceland’s discovery with global warming.\n \n\n   \n  Alfreðsson said he’s not sure climate change played a role in the discovery but “warming temperatures are likely to enhance the potential for other mosquito species to establish in Iceland, if they arrive.”\n \n\n   \n  Iceland may have been hospitable to these insects even in the absence of climate change, said Colin J. Carlson, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University School of Public Health. Mosquitoes have been found  quite far north  into Scandinavia, he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Climate change may have made this more likely, but I’m not convinced it’s a clear, direct impact,” Carlson said. “The truth is, we just don’t know a lot about endemic mosquito range shifts that are already happening.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/tourism-shutdown-national-park-smithsonians","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00Z","title":"Tourism and Safety Concerns Amid Ongoing Government Shutdown in National Parks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a prolonged government shutdown, tourists continue to visit national parks like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite despite closures, lack of entrance fees, and absence of park rangers.

visit national parks and DC, advocates and local businesses warn about long-term impact of shutdown \n       \n  By Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:19 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The government shutdown didn’t deter 26-year-old Nudrat Mahajabin from visiting Grand Canyon National Park earlier this month, even though the signs were clear: No entrance fees would be collected, the visitors’ center was closed and no park rangers were nearby.\n \n\n   \n  “We had planned this trip a while back. So, there was really no going back,” she said. “I feel like a shutdown might not close the gates, but it does affect and impact the caretakers. And I guess that’s what worries me the most.”\n \n\n   \n  While many tourists like Mahajabin are yet to be discouraged by the government shutdown, national park advocates and businesses are worried about the safety of national parks and tourism’s impact on the local economies that surround them if the congressional stalemate continues.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown, which congressional leaders do not appear close to resolving, has meant tourist destinations like the Smithsonian museums in DC are closed and 9,000 National Park Service employees are furloughed, impacting the operations of the parks. The Department of Interior is keeping many national parks partially open amid the shutdown, and some sites have gotten a boost from state funds.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, where tourists typically flock for hiking, white water rafting and spotting fall foliage, New River Gorge National Park and Harpers Ferry National Historical Park are staying open using state funds because of an agreement made with the Department of Interior.\n \n\n   \n  The state’s Republican governor, Patrick Morrisey, said last week that West Virginia would keep the parks fully running through October 18 for Bridge Day, a festival where onlookers gather to see jumpers parachute off the New River Gorge Bridge.\n \n\n   \n  “We know that tourism is huge for West Virginia, bringing in billions and billions of dollars every year,” he said. “So, this was not the time to be shut down.”\n \n\n   \n  Some business owners near national parks say they have yet to take a hit, while others say they’re bracing for bigger impacts down the road if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Rob Dobson, the owner of West Virginia Adventures near the New River Gorge National Park, told CNN he’s not expecting a drop in reservations for white water rafting trips or cabin stays this fall.\n \n\n   \n  “This shutdown has had zero effect on us. We are open for business,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Elisabeth Barton, general manager of Echo Adventure Cooperative, a guide service in Groveland, California, told CNN that with no one collecting fees at the entrances to Yosemite, the business is “having a much busier October than we would normally have.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, where business leaders are worried the shutdown may deter tourists from traveling to the nation’s capital, the shutdown has been a boon for some private museums, which have seen a rise in visitors since the Smithsonian Institute was forced to  close its museums  and the National Zoo on October 12.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Mount Vernon, the nearby home of George Washington, said the estate has seen 50% more visitors than during the first two weeks of October last year and has been averaging 100 phone calls per day. The National Law Enforcement Museum and the International Spy Museum, both private museums, also told CNN they are already seeing an uptick in visitors.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether tourism overall in DC has taken a hit, nearly three weeks into the government shutdown. In the first nine days of the shutdown, total ridership on DC’s trains and buses was higher than the same period last year, according to a CNN review of  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s data  on daily train station entries and bus boardings.\n \n\n   \n    Concerns about long-term impact of the shutdown\n \n\n   \n  Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, a non-profit marketing group that promotes the nation’s capital, also warned of the shutdown’s economic impact on the city, which  lost about $47.4 million  in revenue during the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019.\n \n\n   \n  “Everything from the small mom-and-pop sandwich shops to the larger entities are impacted by the shutdown,” Ferguson told CNN. “We are in the prime months and weeks for convention business and tourism. So, the impact is significant.”\n \n\n   \n  And at the national parks, which have limited staffing, advocates are warning about the consequences of staying open – there are no rangers at the park entrances to collect entrance fees, and there may be delays in law enforcement and emergency responses.\n \n\n   \n  With the absence of park rangers and other Park Service employees in Yosemite, Barton, the business owner, said the park is getting a “weird contingent of folks who have a need for unfettered access, who think ‘I can do anything I want.’”\n \n\n   \n  She said there have been instances of “people being frustrated, easily tuned-up.” Her guides have witnessed people flying drones, which are generally banned in national parks. When her guides approached the operators and told them it was prohibited, she said many became hostile. She said that people are also base jumping — leaping from structures and using a parachute to descend to the ground — which is illegal.\n \n\n   \n  With these concerns in mind, the National Parks Conservation Association is asking national parks to close.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors “might be able to access beautiful places, but they’re not going to have the full experience that they’re used to at national parks. And that also means that people are not going to be getting some of the fundamental guidance,” David Lamfrom, the vice president of regional programs for the National Parks Conservation Association, told CNN, adding that staff reductions could impact safety and search-and-rescue operations.\n \n\n   \n  Emily Thompson, the executive director of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, is concerned about the safety of the parks with limited staff.\n \n\n   \n  “Park rangers and Park Service employees do so much at parks regarding safety and preventative messaging,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Thompson’s group has already received reports of trash piling up in some national parks, an issue that arose in previous shutdowns, notably in 2018. One park ranger told CNN that as the shutdown goes on, they are increasingly worried about vandalism and trash buildup, which could create a backlog of work when the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  In Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park, staff and volunteers from the YMCA of the Rockies are gathering to clean up trash left behind on hikes.\n \n\n   \n  “My hope in all this is that people are leaning in,” said Jason Nelson, the group’s communication’s director. “We don’t know how long this government shutdown is going to be.”\n \n\n   \n  The Interior Department told CNN earlier this month that “critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, some local businesses near national parks say they are doing OK but are watching closely for impacts to their business and their communities if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  Eddie Love, who runs Mountain Mama vacation cabins with his wife in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, told CNN bookings are down 30%, and that anecdotally, at least one person canceled because they had been furloughed due to the shutdown. While his business will be OK, fewer visitors could harm the shops in the downtown area, he noted.\n \n\n   \n  “October is usually a pretty strong month for us,” he said. “We’ll be OK even if the shutdown continues, but I know there are lots of other businesses that are a little more on the margin and might have a harder time making ends meet if it dragged on.”\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, William Torres, the owner of DC Trails — a tour bus company — told CNN the government shutdown is not a big concern “at the moment.”\n \n\n   \n  “If it keeps going and it goes on, you know, past November and into the Thanksgiving season, then it could probably affect me some,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/uk/virginia-giuffre-memoir-epstein-prince-andrew-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:39:00-04:00","title":"Virginia Giuffre raped by ‘well-known Prime Minister,’ US version of posthumous memoir claims","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network, published her posthumous memoir 'Nobody’s Girl,' in which she alleges being raped and violently abused by a powerful man she described as a 'well-known Prime Minister' — widely interpreted as Prince Andrew.

version of posthumous memoir claims \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:39 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Virginia Giuffre , one of the most prominent victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, wrote in her posthumous memoir that she was brutally beaten and raped by an unidentified prime minister and that she feared she might “die a sex slave.”\n \n\n   \n  “In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people. I was habitually used and humiliated – and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied,” Giuffre wrote of Epstein and his circle. “I believed that I might die a sex slave.”\n \n\n   \n  Six months after her  death by suicide  in Australia, Giuffre’s memoir “Nobody’s Girl” was published Tuesday and contains harrowing details of the abuse she allegedly suffered as a teenager, and her years attempting to get justice for herself and her fellow victims.\n \n\n   \n  In the US version, Giuffre claims she was raped by a man whom she had “taken pains to describe in my legal filings only as a ‘well-known Prime Minister.’” In the UK version, the passages are almost identical but refer to the man as a “former minister.” It was not clear what accounted for the discrepancy.\n \n\n   \n  While on the sex offender’s Caribbean island, Giuffre described how Epstein “trafficked me to a man who raped me more savagely than anyone had before.” She wrote she was 18 at the time.\n \n\n   \n  “He repeatedly choked me until I lost consciousness and took pleasure in seeing me fear for my life. Horrifically, the Prime Minister laughed when he hurt me and got more aroused when I begged him to stop,” she wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Afterward, I tearfully begged Epstein not to send me back to him,” Giuffre wrote. “I got down on my knees and pleaded with him. I don’t know if Epstein feared the man or if he owed him a favor, but he wouldn’t make any promises, saying coldly of the politician’s brutality, ‘You’ll get that sometimes.’”\n \n\n   \n  The memoir will intensify a transatlantic scandal over the proximity of the rich and powerful to Epstein, which has claimed political scalps in Britain and for months wracked Congress in the United States. Its publication will heap fresh scrutiny on Prince Andrew, the disgraced British royal accused by Giuffre of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager. Andrew, who’s King Charles’ brother, vehemently denies the accusations against him.\n \n\n   \n  Facing further public outrage over his relationship with Epstein,  Andrew  announced last week he had relinquished the use of his royal titles and would no longer be known as the  Duke of York , saying: “I have decided, as I always have, to put duty to my family and country first.” He will, however, retain the title of “prince,” since he is the son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n \n\n   \n  While Buckingham Palace would have hoped Andrew’s decision could mark the end of a scandal that has plagued the royal family for years, the latest revelations in Giuffre’s memoir will likely deepen the prince’s disgrace.\n \n\n   \n  Among those is Giuffre’s claim that Andrew’s “team” tried to hire online “trolls” to harangue her around the time she brought a civil case against the prince in New York. Giuffre alleged that, having been trafficked by Epstein, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17.\n \n\n   \n  Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions to settle the civil case in 2022. Writing of that settlement, Giuffre said: “After casting doubt on my credibility for so long – Prince Andrew’s team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me – the Duke of York owed me a meaningful apology as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The allegation that Andrew tried to hire trolls comes after the Mail on Sunday, a British paper, reported that Andrew in 2011  asked a police officer  assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on Giuffre. London’s Metropolitan Police said it was “actively looking into” the report.\n \n\n   \n  Another damaging report found that Andrew had kept up his friendship with Epstein two months after he insisted he had broken it off. In a disastrous 2019 BBC interview, in which Andrew’s attempt to clear his name backfired spectacularly, the prince insisted he had broken off his friendship with Epstein during a walk in New York’s Central Park in December 2010.\n \n\n   \n  Newly unearthed emails have contradicted that claim. The Mail on Sunday reported that, in February 2011, a day after the British press published an image of the prince with his arm around the teenage Giuffre, Andrew wrote to Epstein: “It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/government-shutdown-congress-federal-workers-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:48:00.000Z","title":"What’s happening to end the government shutdown?

Republicans rarely reach beyond their base. And President Donald Trump, supposedly the world’s greatest dealmaker, is tuned out.\n \n\n   \n  This Washington stasis explains why no end is in sight to  a government shutdown  now tied for the second-longest ahead of Trump’s expected departure for Asia at the end of the week for summits. There’s no sign he’ll emulate his first predecessor, President Barack Obama, who canceled a tour of the region in 2013 because of a similar stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  “Plan B is open up the government,” Republican Senate Majority Leader  John Thune told CNN’s Manu Raju  on Tuesday, pledging to continue to pressure Democrats to accept a short-term House spending bill they’ve been blocking to try to force Republicans to extend expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  As Congress keeps doing the same thing, with the same inconclusive result, the costs of the partial closure of federal operations are escalating.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands of government workers are furloughed. The administration has fired  several thousand more . On Monday, most specialists who oversee the US nuclear stockpile at the National Nuclear Security Administration got  furlough notices . More  air traffic control staffing shortages  were reported over the weekend, in an ominous foreshadowing of potential travel crunches if the impasse drags on until Thanksgiving. And time is ticking down to the expiry of  critical nutrition support  for 42 million Americans next month.\n \n\n   \n  Significant pain is being inflicted on federal workers who have mortgages and car payments coming due and on millions of citizens who rely on the government. But it hasn’t yet reached leaders in both parties in sufficient volume to force them to seriously negotiate on a reopening. Three weeks in, neither side has moved beyond the first stage of shutdown politics — blaming the other.\n \n\n   \n    At some point, Democrats and Republicans will have to change tactics\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have succeeded in using the shutdown to create a platform for their demands for Republicans to agree to  extend the enhanced ACA subsidies , without which millions of policies will shoot up in price at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  “This is day 20 of the Trump Republican shutdown and the government remains closed because Republicans have zero interest in actually providing affordable health care to everyday Americans,” House Democratic Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “That’s the challenge that the country faces right now.”\n \n\n   \n  But how do Democrats turn their success in elevating a key issue into a meaningful political victory? Republicans aren’t shifting an inch on their refusal to hold talks on Obamacare subsidies until the government is opened — thereby depriving Democrats of leverage. And calls by some House progressives for multiyear extensions of the subsidies before the standoff ends appear rather optimistic.\n \n\n   \n  Centrist Democratic senators, who might be looking for a way out, saw their position complicated this weekend by “ No Kings ” protests  targeting Trump . They can hardly reach a compromise that looks like caving to the president after an estimated 7 million people got off their couches on Saturday to blast him as a wannabe dictator.\n \n\n   \n  But Democratic attempts to split the usually deal-hungry Trump from Republicans in Congress have so far failed.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s the way out of it? Trump,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the podcast “The Checkup,” according to a transcript released by his office. But Democrats are proving less successful than  Russian President Vladimir Putin  at getting the commander in chief to change his mind. He’s expected to lunch with GOP senators at his new “Rose Garden Club” terrace at the White House on Tuesday in a show of GOP unity.\n \n\n   \n  New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker told CNN on Tuesday that Trump was absent from discussions. “He’s getting ready to do another trip overseas to negotiate on foreign policy issues. What he should be doing is calling Democrats to the White House and negotiating with us,” Booker said. “The urgencies are growing. But where is the president? Why is he doing nothing? Why isn’t he sitting down with people? Why isn’t he understanding that there’s no Democrat or Republican way to do this? It’s only a bipartisan way,” Booker said.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans, meanwhile, are enjoying their daily media appearances in which they slam Democrats for closing the government. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday kept his speechwriters busy finding new superlatives, accusing the opposition of pulling off the “most selfish, most dangerous political stunt in the history of the United States Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  But Johnson is no closer to solving the GOP’s own conundrum. How does the party in power escape blame for huge hikes in Obamacare premiums if the subsidies expire? That tough reality explains why Democrats believe Trump, already blamed for  massive Medicaid cuts , may eventually fold. And Republicans do understand the political threat. At the weekend, they twinned their willingness to talk about a solution — if the government reopens — with a call to reshape the 15-year-old health-care law, even though they’ve never proposed a viable replacement.\n \n\n   \n  “I have said that I’m absolutely open to having conversation, but we’re not going to extend a program that is wrought with fraud, waste and abuse,” Alabama Sen. Katie Britt told Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. “Our health care system is broken, the system that they put in place,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  This will only make Democrats more wary of a deal. Reform of the ACA sounds a lot like a fresh attempt by the GOP to finally kill a law the party has been trying to eradicate since it was an idea in the 44th president’s first campaign.\n \n\n   \n    Where is the House?\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of any serious discussions to end the shutdown, political games are escalating on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson is keeping the House dark, arguing that his members did their job by voting last month to temporarily fund the government, apparently ignoring all the other duties of the people’s representatives. “I refuse to allow us to come back and engage in anything until the government’s reopened,” the speaker said Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.”\n \n\n   \n  One reason Johnson might not want his members in town is they could spoil his attempt to stifle dissent after complaints about the shutdown spilled out from  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  and others. He’s also refusing to swear in  new Democratic member Adelita Grijalva , who has pledged the deciding signature to force a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, until the House fully returns to Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats are meanwhile arguing that as terrible as the shutdown is, they are alleviating even greater misery by fighting to extend health care subsidies. In an odd way, the extreme realities of life in Trump’s Washington might be mitigating some of the political duress that usually boils up to end shutdowns. Furloughs of federal workers don’t seem so extreme after thousands were already fired in Trump’s federal government purge. And at a turbulent moment when Trump is trying to  send troops into cities  and posting bizarre AI videos, the rituals of a government shutdown seem routine by comparison.\n \n\n   \n  In a futile and now-familiar dance unlikely to be noticed much outside the Senate chamber, Thune held a vote to pass a stopgap funding bill to reopen the government Monday evening. But Democrats stood firm for the 11th time, depriving the measure of the 60 votes needed to break the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  Thune may also bring up a bill this week to pay essential workers required to show up during the shutdown. The move might put Democrats in a tough spot. But they are likely to oppose any move that would allow Trump to pick and choose which workers get salaries. And in a signal that not all Republicans are on board with their leader’s strategy shift, Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville argued Tuesday that the bill could alleviate incentives to end the crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has already announced that his administration has shuffled existing funds to paying military personnel and FBI officers, two of the few categories of government workers about whom he seems to care.\n \n\n   \n  His move lifted one of the usual sources of political heat that usually end up solving shutdowns. None of the others are working either.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/pardoned-capitol-rioter-arrested-hakeem-jeffries-threat","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-04:00","title":"Pardoned Capitol rioter arrested on charge that he threatened to kill Hakeem Jeffries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A man convicted of participating in the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack, Christopher Moynihan, was arrested on a new charge of threatening to kill Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

along with others convicted of January 6 offenses — earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Tuesday, Jeffries thanked law enforcement for apprehending Moynihan before criticizing Trump’s

administration officials privately worry \n       \n  By Alayna Treene, Eugenia Yosef, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:17 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Vice President JD Vance downplayed concerns about the fragility of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire while speaking in Israel on Tuesday, even as some Trump administration officials are privately concerned the deal could fall apart, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “What we’ve seen the past week gives me great optimism the ceasefire is going to hold,” Vance said at a news conference, adding, “I feel very optimistic. Can I say with 100% certainty that it’s going to work? No.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance also declined to put a timeline on both the return of all Israeli hostage remains and Hamas’ disarmament, saying it will “take a little bit of time” and that security and humanitarian structures must be implemented in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  “If Hamas doesn’t comply with the deal, very bad things are going to happen. But I’m not going to do what the president of United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult,” Vance said.\n \n\n   \n  Vance’s presence in the region is meant, at least in part, to ensure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to the US-negotiated deal as some Trump administration officials worry he could work to thwart it.\n \n\n   \n  One US official characterized it as “Bibisitting.” Another framed it as a “show of force from the highest-ranking person after the president himself” to make the administration’s view clear that the ceasefire needs to be durable enough to “outlast inevitable skirmishes.”\n \n\n   \n  The sources added that the general belief among US officials involved in the negotiations is that the truce is most threatened in the short term, which is why the trip needed to happen so soon after  Trump’s visit  just last week.\n \n\n   \n  The concerns reached new heights after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack over the weekend that killed two IDF soldiers. Israel responded with waves of airstrikes that killed dozens of people in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  US officials worked to minimize the fallout of the strikes and ensure the ceasefire was not threatened, the sources said. And while Israel and Hamas each accused the other of violating the deal, both sides  ultimately reaffirmed  their commitment to the truce.\n \n\n   \n  The vice president said Tuesday that it is going to be a “constant effort” to “mediate these disagreements as they come up.” He asserted the trip “had nothing to do with events in the past 48 hours.”\n \n\n   \n  Vance was accompanied at the news conference by Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, the key US architects of the deal. The pair are in Israel this week as the administration begins to work on the longer-term goals of the president’s  20-point peace plan  for the region.\n \n\n   \n  While there, Witkoff told Israel the country’s response to violence from Hamas needs to be proportionate to the violation, according to an Israeli source familiar with the matter. Witkoff also emphasized that the next 30 days are crucial for the deal to hold and for talks to enter the second phase, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israelis, meanwhile, are ramping up pressure on the US to demilitarize Hamas before talks move on to the reconstruction phase, an Israeli official said.\n \n\n   \n  All of this comes as Trump himself has argued both privately and publicly that Sunday’s attack on IDF soldiers wasn’t the work of Hamas leaders but part of a “rebellion.” He has said that some members of Hamas “got very rambunctious,” but he believes the group is still committed to the truce and negotiations, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump did, however, threaten to have the group “eradicated” if ultimately necessary.\n \n\n   \n  The president wrote on social media Tuesday that “great allies” in and around the Middle East would “welcome the opportunity” to enter Gaza and “straighten [out] Hamas” if they continue to “act badly.”\n \n\n   \n  Trum﻿p said he told these unspecified countries “not yet,” as “there is still hope that Hamas will do what is right.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Aileen Graef contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/marine-corps-artillery-155-mishap","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:05:00-04:00","title":"Marine Corps Artillery Mishap Part of Unusual Firing Over Highway","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a 250th birthday celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, the US Marine Corps fired a 155mm artillery shell over the I-5 interstate highway, resulting in a premature detonation that sent shrapnel damaging a California Highway Patrol cruiser.

The celebration at Camp Pendleton, California, was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The Marine Corps is currently investigating what went wrong with the round, a 155mm artillery shell that had been fired by an M777 Howitzer. The day before Marines had successfully fired more than two dozen shells from the same batch of artillery, according to the official, lending more questions as to what happened on Saturday and why.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reported there were no injuries from the incident, which the California Highway Patrol Border Division Chief Tony Coronado called “an unusual and concerning situation.”\n \n\n   \n  The Marine Corps did not respond to questions about who made the decision to fire over I-5, when the last time was that the Marine Corps fired artillery over the interstate, or if there were broader concerns regarding the artillery batch the shell that prematurely detonated came from.\n \n\n   \n  The US has been rapidly increasing its production of the 155 mm shells, more than  tripling production since 2022  up to 40,000 rounds per month that has included opening new production facilities as part of $5.5 billion in US investment in manufacturing the munitions. The driver of that surge in production has been Ukraine’s need for the shells in its protracted war repelling Russian forces, with the US already having sent  more than 3 million 155 mm rounds  to the country since the start of the conflict.\n \n\n   \n  California’s Gov. Gavin Newsom, in an escalating spat with the White House over the safety of Saturday’s demonstration, had closed the interstate ahead of the exercise, which involved firing artillery from a beach area over the highway onto land that is part of the Camp Pendleton military facility.\n \n\n   \n  After Newsom had described plans to fire shells over the highway as “dangerous” and said he was making the decision to close the highway, a spokesman for Vance had told CNN that the showcase was “an established safe practice.”\n \n\n   \n  Live-fire exercises, where real ordnance is used for training, are a common occurrence for US military units around the country. However, the specific route planned for the shells on Saturday hadn’t been used since before I-5 became an interstate in the 1950s, according to the US official.\n \n\n   \n  “Firing from the beach, firing over I-5, in theory shouldn’t have been a problem,” Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel who served as an artillery officer and who is currently a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “The shells were high when they went over I-5 and that’s why the Marine Corps apparently said shutting down the highway was not necessary because in theory, they’d be so high they wouldn’t interfere with anyone below,” he said. “And for some reason one of them went off prematurely.”\n \n\n   \n  The batch of artillery shells used during the demonstration has likely been frozen and will not be used again until the Marines further clarify what happened, Cancian said.\n \n\n   \n  A  2024 Reuters investigation  of artillery production found some issues with manufacturing lines of the munitions, including cracked shells in Iowa that shut down a production line further delaying their delivery, and a US decision to change the kind of explosive used in the shell.\n \n\n   \n  Years before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US decided to move away from using TNT inside the shell to an explosive believed to be “less vulnerable to detonation by accident,” the Reuters report said.\n \n\n   \n   The Army confirmed to Reuters it reversed course and began using TNT once again after the war began, due to cost efficiency needs and to increase the production rate.\n \n\n   \n  The military services often try to put together a compelling showcase when important leaders make a visit to a military facility, Cancian said.\n \n\n   \n  “The idea that when a VIP shows up you do something special for them is totally normal,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  What is abnormal, he added, is that the shell detonated prematurely. The 155 shells, Cancian explained, weigh roughly 95 pounds – the majority of that weight due to the shell itself, and only 15 pounds of it attributed to the actual explosive. When the shell explodes, the metal casing is meant to splinter into tiny fragments in an effort to inflict more casualties on a battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  A photo of one of those fragments on a patrol car was shared in a press release by the California Highway Patrol, which said shrapnel struck and damaged a patrol vehicle. Cancian emphasized that the patrol car was not “hit” by an artillery shell but rather struck by fragments of the shell which exploded far overhead, slowing down as they fell through the air before landing on the patrol car.\n \n\n   \n  “It went off very high, and the shell fragments came down to the ground, didn’t look like they were going very fast,” he said, adding that “obviously that should not have happened.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/us/chicago-suv-ramming-case-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"13:26:00-20:25","title":"Federal Vehicle in Chicago Ramming Case May Have Had Repairs Before Defense Looked at It: Can the Court Do Anything About It?","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a federal case involving Marimar Martinez and Anthony Ruiz, who are accused of ramming a Border Patrol vehicle in Chicago on October 4, 2025, defense attorneys raised serious concerns about the removal and movement of the vehicle—owned by CBP—not just from Illinois to Maine, but over 1,000 miles.

Can the court do anything about it? \n       \n  By Andy Rose, Bill Kirkos, Andi Babineau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:26 PM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Thursday was supposed to be a day of no surprises for Marimar Martinez, the woman who was shot after allegedly  ramming the car  of a Border Patrol agent she had been following. She was headed to a routine court hearing.\n \n\n   \n  But earlier that day, defense attorney Christopher Parente learned a piece of evidence that may be critical to the case was no longer in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  “I was informed about two hours before the hearing that the agent’s vehicle was gone,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Gone,” as it turned out, was more than 1,000 miles away. Department of Justice attorney Aaron Bond said in court the agent was told he could take it back to his home in Maine.\n \n\n   \n  Parente said he was concerned moving the vehicle so far away could leave it open to being altered, and his concern seemed justified in another hearing four days later.\n \n\n   \n  A government attorney said some repairs may have been “processed or at least approved,” but couldn’t say whether any work had actually been done.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Georgia Alexakis was “troubled by what I’m hearing in terms of the repair work in particular,” the  Biden appointee  said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  While the government has accounted for the missing SUV, Parente says there are more questions to answer when it comes to the where, the how and the why of the SUV’s long journey.\n \n\n   \n    Vehicle’s condition is critical to defense, attorney says\n \n\n   \n  Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen, and her co-defendant, Anthony Ruiz – who was driving a different vehicle – both entered not guilty pleas to a federal charge of assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers. They are accused of “aggressively and erratically” following and then ramming a Border Patrol vehicle on October 4 as it was on security detail on Chicago streets.\n \n\n   \n  The incident took place as Chicago became one of the epicenters for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, with regular  protests  at a suburban ICE facility and dramatic  raids  and  patrols  in the heart of the Windy City.\n \n\n   \n  Both Martinez and Ruiz left the scene of the crash, prosecutors say, although Parente  said  his client drove “to a safe place where she pulled over and called 911” to report the shooting. She was treated at a hospital for gunshot wounds and released.\n \n\n   \n  They have not denied they were closely tailing the Border Patrol vehicle through Chicago streets. But Parente says Martinez, who was shot five times after the crash, did not cause the wreck, arguing the agent was the person who actually initiated the contact by sideswiping his client, making the condition of his vehicle crucial to her defense.\n \n\n   \n  “The cars are the big issue,” Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  The Border Patrol agent is expected to testify about his actions related to the vehicle at a November 6 status hearing. A trial for Martinez is set to start in February.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance video  obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times  shows the vehicles of Martinez and Ruiz following closely on the sides of the government SUV before the incident, but the only known video of the crash itself comes from a body-worn camera.\n \n\n   \n  Parente, who has seen the bodycam video but is not allowed to share it under a court order,  told CNN  it shows the agent behind the wheel turning into his client’s vehicle, with one  agent  heard saying “Do something, b*tch” before shots were fired.\n \n\n   \n  He also said the government has put out misleading information on Martinez. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said  in a news release  Martinez was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” But Parente  told  CNN his client is a licensed gun owner and had a handgun in her purse but never brandished it. The criminal complaint against her doesn’t mention she had a firearm.\n \n\n   \n  At some point after the crash, the agent, who has not been publicly named, was allowed to return home to Maine with the SUV because it was his “personal vehicle,” Bond told the court last week. It was not clear if Customs and Border Protection had consulted with prosecutors before giving that permission, Parente said.\n \n\n   \n  The  criminal complaint  stated the vehicle is owned by CBP, not the agent. CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and asking for clarification on how the agent is connected to the SUV. Through a spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office, Bond declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  At the Monday hearing, Assistant US Attorney Ronald DeWald said the agent took the vehicle to a secured parking area of a CBP station in Maine.\n \n\n   \n    Can the judge punish the government for moving the SUV?\n \n\n   \n  As Martinez’s and Ruiz’s vehicles remain impounded in an FBI garage, Alexakis told the government to return the SUV to Chicago. No alteration is allowed – not even a car wash – before the defense gets a look. And this time, it will be making the journey on the back of a flatbed tow truck.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a reasonable request,” said Alexakis. “There’s only so much you can tell from photos.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Parente told the judge he couldn’t believe a key piece of evidence had been removed from the state by one of the main figures in the case.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not just the driver, this is the shooter,” Parente said incredulously in court.\n \n\n   \n  Parente isn’t the only attorney who was amazed the government’s Chevy Tahoe was allowed to leave the state. Patrick Griffin, a San Diego lawyer who has been a defense attorney in criminal cases involving Border Patrol vehicles, said the defense has a right to get access to the SUV.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not some novel concept. This is as basic as it gets,” Griffin told CNN. “It’s 101 that the vehicle needs to be maintained and needs to be able to be examined by the defense.”\n \n\n   \n  Although Alexakis agreed the car should be returned, Griffin says there is a high bar before the government can be punished for allowing the car to be taken away.\n \n\n   \n  In the  1984 Supreme Court decision  California v. Trombetta, justices said prosecutors are not required to preserve evidence unless they have a reason to believe it could help the defendant.\n \n\n   \n  “If it’s just not obvious that the evidence would be exculpatory, then you must show bad faith,” said Griffin.\n \n\n   \n  Even then, the Supreme Court said, it may not matter if the defense has other evidence that can still prove innocence.\n \n\n   \n  Parente, said he had asked the court to order DHS “to preserve and maintain any and all records, emails, text messages, documents, notes and other materials related to” the Martinez case.\n \n\n   \n  While Parente has focused in court on the physical condition of the SUV’s exterior, the most important piece of evidence is probably inside the Tahoe. Most vehicles now have an event data recorder – the EDR – that is similar to an airplane’s “black box.”\n \n\n   \n  “It can show all the data that leads up to a crash,” said Griffin. “Did the person swerve? Did they hit the brakes? What was the speed? And this is really just fundamental evidence that is necessary to determine what happened.”\n \n\n   \n    ICE detainees and officials have been suddenly moved\n \n\n   \n  It is not the first time concern has been raised about important elements in a Department of Homeland Security-related case being quickly moved from one state to another – although it usually involves people rather than physical evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Multiple people who have been arrested in immigration cases this year – including  Mahmoud Khalil ,  Badar Khan Suri  and  Rümeysa Öztürk  – were quickly moved hundreds of miles away to remote detention facilities shortly after being taken into custody, frustrating the efforts of their families and attorneys to gain their freedom.\n \n\n   \n  Last week,  Arthur Berto , a 13-year-old boy who was taken by ICE after an arrest for allegedly threatening another student at school, was transferred to a juvenile facility in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  The Massachusetts-based federal judge in that case ruled he didn’t have the authority to decide whether Berto should be freed because the child had crossed the Massachusetts border an hour before his family’s petition was filed. Defense attorney Andrew Lattarulo told CNN last week he was still working to find an attorney in Virginia to represent his client.\n \n\n   \n  Even ICE officials have sometimes been difficult to track down.\n \n\n   \n  In a  separate case  in Chicago challenging federal agents’ use of riot control munitions and tear gas against protesters and journalists, Judge Sara Ellis asked an ICE interim field director to testify in court and explain why an order she issued appeared to be ignored.\n \n\n   \n  But the government  announced  one business day before the Monday hearing the official  had been reassigned to Washington, DC, and  other officials  would have to testify in his place.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis said she would accept the last-minute substitution as long as those officials can answer her questions.\n \n\n   \n  But until the defense team actually gets a look at the vehicle and if anything has changed in the 2,000-mile round trip, legal experts say it’s not clear whether the Trump administration will be punished for allowing it to be moved.\n \n\n   \n  “The question arises whether the car will have been altered in a material way,” said Richard Friedman, a University of Michigan law professor who has written  books  on the rules of evidence. “If they haven’t done anything to the car, then maybe ‘no harm, no foul’ if they bring it back.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether rules of evidence were actually broken or not, Martinez’s attorney says it should raise concern.\n \n\n   \n  “This was a case involving the Border Patrol shooting of a US citizen in broad daylight and lack of integrity in this investigation is alarming,” Parente told CNN.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/media/warner-bros-wbd-sale-paramount-skydance-suitors","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:58:00+00:00","title":"Warner Bros.

Discovery, the parent of CNN, is contemplating a sale.\n \n\n   \n  The media giant says it has received “multiple” expressions of interest from potential buyers, indicating that Paramount Skydance is not the only suitor for the media company.\n \n\n   \n  In a Tuesday morning statement, WBD said its board of directors has started a “review of strategic alternatives,” which could result in a sale of the entire company, a continuation of the current plan to split the company into two, or some other outcome.\n \n\n   \n  Paramount has been making overtures to buy all of WBD in advance of the planned split, signaling that a behind-the-scenes bidding war is underway. The WBD board rebuffed the first offer, two people with knowledge of the matter told CNN last week. One of the sources said both sides recognized it was a “lowball” proposal by Paramount’s new CEO, David Ellison.\n \n\n   \n  Paramount has declined to comment on its interest in WBD, but Ellison has kept up the pressure in recent days, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has been preparing to split the company into two publicly traded halves, believing Warner Bros. (which would house the HBO Max streaming service and the movie studio) and Discovery Global (which would house CNN and other cable channels) will be much more highly valued that way.\n \n\n   \n  WBD may still decide to complete the planned split, but Tuesday’s announcement suggests that other outcomes may be more likely.\n \n\n   \n  Comcast is one of the other media industry heavyweights that is evaluating WBD’s assets, given Warner’s openness to a deal, two people with knowledge of the matter said. A Comcast spokesperson declined to comment.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street analysts have asserted that both Comcast and Netflix could be interested in the streaming and studios half of WBD, given the iconic brands and shows that the company controls.\n \n\n   \n  Rather than kicking the proverbial tires next year, after the breakup would take effect, suitors are likely to conduct due diligence and consider a bid now, since WBD has said it is open to offers.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,” Zaslav said in a statement. “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.”\n \n\n   \n  Zaslav told employees in a separate memo that “evaluating potential interest, conducting due diligence, and assessing next steps will take time, likely over a period of weeks and months.” He said “there’s no set timeline for final decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Zaslav outlined several possibilities: The already-planned split, “a transaction involving the entire company,” “separate transactions for Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global,” or “an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. and spin-off of Discovery Global to our shareholders.”\n \n\n   \n  Shares in WBD spiked more than 11% in midday trading Tuesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/food/coca-cola-cane-sugar-launch","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"11:18:00-04:00","title":"Coca-Cola’s Trump-approved soda begins to roll out in the United States","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Coca-Cola has begun rolling out a new soda formulation in the United States that uses cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, fulfilling a demand initiated by former President Donald Trump.

Her arrival at the pinnacle of Japanese politics tops a remarkable rise, from TV presenter to flag bearer of traditional and nationalist ideals.\n \n\n   \n  In her first news conference as prime minister on Tuesday night, Takaichi focused heavily on economic issues and advancing Japan’s interests, saying that she will “work boldly and tirelessly, unafraid of change” for “the nation and its people.”\n \n\n   \n  A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has laid claim to his conservative legacy.   She becomes the fourth prime minister to hold office since he stepped down in 2020, reflecting the political deadlock in the world’s fourth largest economy.\n \n\n   \n  Like Abe, she supports revising Japan’s pacifist constitution and has visited a   controversial war shrine that includes the names of those convicted of war crimes during World War II – both issues that spark anger in neighboring China and South Korea, who are also vital trade partners for Japan.\n \n\n   \n  She also opposes same-sex marriage, and   a growing movement to allow married couples to use separate surnames.\n \n\n   \n  Some of these stances, such as her hawkish views on China, could complicate Japan’s regional relationships. And within Japan, some worry about her economic proposals – to spend big and cut taxes – as the country struggles with sky-high inflation and living costs.\n \n\n   \n  She has openly aspired to be like Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to become British prime minister – known as the “Iron Lady,” a nickname that has since been used for Takaichi herself.\n \n\n   \n  “Like Thatcher, (Takaichi) is a conservative and she is also a woman in a male-dominated world,” said Shihoko Goto, vice president of programs at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “That said, Thatcher was then – Japan is now. It’s facing a great deal of change, it’s facing a lot of internal domestic pressure … She will be expected, first and foremost, to deal with those immediate threats.”\n \n\n   \n  In her news conference Tuesday night, Takaichi said that she will “build a strong Japanese economy and protect Japan’s national interests at all costs through diplomacy and security.”\n \n\n   \n  Vowing to “reclaim Japan’s diplomacy and let it flourish at the center of the world,” Takaichi said that “Japan faces a major crisis from within and without. There is no time to stand still.”\n \n\n   \n  She noted that she will soon be meeting with Trump, adding that she will work to “elevate Japan-US relations to new heights.”\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s neighbors offered lukewarm responses to news of her win on Tuesday, with China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying it had “noted the election results” and hoped for a “mutually beneficial relationship.”\n \n\n   \n  A South Korean foreign ministry spokesperson similarly promised to continue cooperating with “Japan’s new Cabinet,” without naming Takaichi, according to news agency  Yonhap .\n \n\n   \n    An unconventional start\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many of her male peers, Takaichi doesn’t come from a political dynasty. She was born in Nara, a city frequented by tourists for its wild deer, to a father who worked for a car company and a mother who was a police officer.\n \n\n   \n  Before entering politics, she interned for a US Democratic congresswoman and worked as a TV commentator.\n \n\n   \n  Since joining the ruling LDP party, Takaichi has been elected as a member of parliament nine times. She’s held multiple cabinet posts, including on gender equality and demographic issues, and chaired the party’s Policy Research Council. Most recently, she served as minister of economic security under the administration of Fumio Kishida.\n \n\n   \n  She was elected leader of the LDP earlier in October, beating more moderate candidates. It suggested a rightward turn for the scandal-hit party, which suffered bruising losses in the last two parliamentary elections after  discontented voters  switched to new far-right groups.\n \n\n   \n  But now as prime minister, she’ll have to answer to the populace of 120 million Japanese. Tackling the high price of goods will be one of her first challenges; for instance, the price of rice, a staple food in Japan, has almost doubled from last year.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the ever-present headache of Japan’s declining birthrate, shrinking workforce and swelling elderly population. There’s a growing public backlash against mass immigration. And then there is the Trump administration and its whiplash tariffs, which shook Asian economies earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the immense challenge of winning back public trust, with the LDP experiencing its biggest crisis in decades and being stripped of its parliamentary majority under former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba after a political slush fund scandal.\n \n\n   \n  Simply being elected as the leader of the ruling party would usually have been enough to secure the premiership. But Takaichi’s path to power was complicated; besides losing its majority, the LDP also lost its coalition partner of 26 years, Komeito, which terminated the alliance when she won the leadership race.\n \n\n   \n  That left the LDP scrambling to find a new coalition partner – and it ultimately joined forces with the opposition Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation Party) ahead of Tuesday’s vote.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s new cabinet will also include a female finance minister – another first for Japan. Satsuki Katayama, who also worked as a minister in Abe’s government, was appointed to the role on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  “Takaichi’s rise to become Japan’s first female prime minister is more about remaking party politics than transforming foreign policy,” said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n \n\n   \n  “She is tasked with rebranding rather than revolutionizing her party, along with co-opting smaller parties in a realignment of legislative coalitions.”\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s party hopes she can be the answer to their recent unpopularity. But with a revolving door of prime ministers in recent years, Japan’s so-called ‘Iron Lady’ will need to deliver results quickly to stay in power.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/19/europe/louvre-jewelry-heist-history-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00-04:00","title":"Jewelry heist at the Louvre is latest problem to beset France’s most famous museum","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent jewelry heist at the Louvre Museum in October 2025, in which thieves stole high-value artifacts including the crown of Empress Eugénie — which was damaged during the robbery — marks a culmination of long-standing security and operational failures.

is latest problem to beset France’s most famous museum \n       \n  By Caitlin Danaher and Camille Knight, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:51 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Sunday’s audacious heist  saw thieves  break into the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery and make off with jewelry of “inestimable” value. The suspects carried out the burglary in just seven minutes, France’s interior minister Laurent Nuñez told radio station France Inter.\n \n\n   \n  French media reported that thieves had attempted to steal the crown of Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, but the crown was found outside the Louvre, according to French culture minister Rachida Dati. The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, according to French TV station TF1 and newspaper Le Parisien.\n \n\n   \n  The robbery, which prompted the swift evacuation of visitors and the museum’s closure for the rest of the day, is only the latest in a series of troubles to befall the venerable institution.\n \n\n   \n  A Court of Auditors report obtained by Franceinfo and covering the period between 2019 to 2024 noted a “persistent delay” in updating security systems at the Louvre. The report also identified “operational implementation” of security device renovations as an issue, stating that it appeared they were “uneven and generally very limited.”\n \n\n   \n  “The obsolescence cycle of the museum’s technical equipment has accelerated more significantly than the pace of investment made by the institution to address it,” the report concluded.\n \n\n   \n  Built in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace was the official residence of the kings of France for centuries. King Louis XIV’s decision to move his court to Versailles, on the outskirts of the French capital, allowed for the establishment of the Louvre Museum in 1793. Since then, it has become the most visited museum in the world and a cultural highlight of any stay in Paris.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, with tourists from the United States making up 13% of all guests, second only to the French. But the large crowds entering through the museum’s doors each day have put a strain on the centuries-old building – and its staff.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, French newspaper  Le Parisien  reported on a confidential letter sent from the president of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, to Culture Minister Rachida Dati warning of the dilapidated state of one of Europe’s top attractions.\n \n\n   \n  In the memo, dated January 23 and confirmed to CNN by the Louvre, des Cars requested urgent help to address a slew of issues affecting the museum. She warned of an increase in damage to the museum’s spaces, with some areas becoming “very deteriorated.”\n \n\n   \n  Problems included water leaks, overcrowding, and worrying temperature fluctuations which threatened to “endanger the conservation of works of art,” the memo detailed.\n \n\n   \n  The museum president cautioned that the Louvre was offering “insufficient” services to the public due to overcrowding, with food services and restrooms “well below international standards” in number.\n \n\n   \n  “Visiting the Louvre constitutes a physical ordeal; reaching the artworks takes time and is not always easy,” the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  Visitors often flock to the Salle des États to see one of the most famous artworks in the museum, if not the world, Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.” But the museum president called for the placement of the artwork to be reconsidered.\n \n\n   \n  French President Emmanuel Macron announced later that month that the “Mona Lisa” would get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre as part of major renovation plans. The expansion of the Parisian landmark is expected to take up to 10 years.\n \n\n   \n  Just six months later, in June, the museum closed its doors for a day as workers there went on strike, complaining of unmanageable crowds, understaffing and poor working conditions in a building unable to handle its current popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday’s brazen daylight robbery was also not the first instance of theft to beset the Louvre.\n \n\n   \n  Most famously, the jewel in the Louvre’s crown, the “Mona Lisa,”  was stolen in 1911  by Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia. Having slipped the painting under his clothing, Peruggia escaped the building undetected and wasn’t caught for two years. The public became fascinated by the two-year manhunt, with the daring burglary catapulting the “Mona Lisa” from a relatively unknown work to a world-renowned icon.\n \n\n   \n  More recently, two pieces of  16th-century armor  were returned to the Louvre Museum almost 40 years after they were stolen. The Renaissance-era helmet and body armor were on display in the Louvre when they were stolen overnight from May 31 to June 1, 1983. It wasn’t until March 2021 that the stolen artefacts were returned to the museum.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/nicolas-sarkozy-paris-prison-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"07:24:00-04:00","title":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Starts Five-Year Prison Sentence for Campaign Finance Conspiracy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has begun a five-year prison sentence for criminal conspiracy related to his 2007 presidential campaign, where funds were allegedly sourced from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favors.

Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A social media standout-turned-music-star has some drama brewing on TikTok, and for those who are not chronically online, we’re here to explain.\n \n\n   \n  Shane Boose is 20-year-old a singer who performs under the stage name Sombr. His singles “Back to Friends” and “Undressed” went viral earlier this year, and he’s amassed quite the fan base on and off social media.\n \n\n   \n  One of those fans is a TikTok user named Meg,  whose scathing review  of Sombr’s show at the The Anthem in Washington, DC has lit up the comment section and prompted a response from the singer.\n \n\n   \n  Calling it “one of the worst experiences of my life,” Meg, who says she is 25 years old, explained that she was excited to see Sombr’s The Late Nights & Young Romance Tour, but it ended up being “by far, genuinely, the worst concert I’ve been to in my life, for a multitude of reasons.”\n \n\n   \n  She went on to explain that the show, which she attended with her boyfriend, was filled with so many young people that it was “the closest to a middle school dance I’ve ever been since I was in middle school at a dance.”\n \n\n   \n  “The only adults in the room were the parents (of the young concert goers) and then my boyfriend and I,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Meg said she tried to stick it out so she could hear her favorite songs, but regretted it as the humor skewed immature – with Sombr making references to niche memes, including  a 6-7 joke  – and, at one point, did a bit called the “Sombr dating show,” where he was solicited participants from the tween-skewing crowd to call their “toxic ex” while on stage.\n \n\n   \n  Calling the scene “cringe,” Meg also alleged that the artist made jokes that were inappropriate given the average age of the audience. She said she ended up leaving early.\n \n\n   \n  Boose seemingly responded to her post in his own  video , referring to the situation as a “TikTok drama.”\n \n\n   \n  “I am a 20-year-old artist – freshly 20 – and if you’re 25 years old, and you’re gonna come to my concert and not expect people younger than you to be there when I, the artist, am five years younger than you, it’s just a skill issue,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He also took umbrage with being attacked for the tone of his jokes, noting that anyone who has followed him online knows that he has “never uttered a serious word in my life.”\n \n\n   \n  “And, also, I make jokes for 5 minutes of the concert and the rest is music,” Boose said. “Like, live a little, enjoy life.”\n \n\n   \n  To underscore his latter point, toward the end of his video, he touched what appeared to be some fake grass as a “tutorial.” Telling someone to “touch grass” is a common social media diss.\n \n\n   \n  Meg later  responded , saying that even though she has often posted political content that could cause division, she’s never received as much “hate” as she did after posting her Sombr concert review video.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to both Meg and a representative for Sombr for comment.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/longest-government-shutdown-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"09:58:00-04:00","title":"The US Government Shutdown: A Timeline of Recent Shutdowns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. federal government is currently in a full shutdown due to Congress failing to pass any of the 12 required appropriations bills.

Here’s how long the current shutdown has been going on:\n \n\n   \n  The last time the government shut down — which started on December 22, 2018, and went until January 25, 2019 — it lasted 35 days, making it the longest in history. It cost the United States an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n \n\n   \n    Here are all the government shutdowns since 1981\n \n\n   \n  US agencies were first instructed in the early 1980s to stop normal operations during government funding lapses, and resume operations when Congress appropriated more money.   The first federal government shutdown happened in 1976, according to CNN research.\n \n\n   \n  While government shutdowns have become less common in recent decades — there have been six since 1990 — an increasingly partisan Washington has left Congress unable to resolve sticking points on spending for longer periods of time.\n \n\n   \n  With Republican Speaker Mike Johnson overseeing one of the  narrowest House majorities in history,  and the GOP lacking the 60 votes needed to overcome a Senate  filibuster , the path to avoiding a shutdown was murky in the 11th hour as negotiations stalled.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Tami Luhby  has more on which government services are expected to halt , and which are likely continuing, during this shutdown.\n \n\n   \n    The last government shutdown\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown that began in December 2018 was a partial shutdown, where Congress had approved annual funding for certain agencies, allowing them to continue operations while other federal departments went dark. During that time, an estimated 800,000 people were employed at the shuttered federal agencies, and about 300,000 of those were furloughed, meaning they were not paid and asked not to report to work, according to the CBO.\n \n\n   \n  The rest were considered exempt from furlough, meaning they needed to report to work but could not receive pay. Both furloughed and exempted employees received backpay when their agencies reopened after the funding agreement was passed.\n \n\n   \n  The current Congress has not passed any of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the US government. That means this is a full government shutdown.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/sport/soccer-maccabi-tel-aviv-ban-ticket-allocation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"09:33:00-04:00","title":"Israeli Soccer Fans Banned from Maccabi Tel Aviv vs. Aston Villa Match Over Security Concerns","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Maccabi Tel Aviv has refused to accept ticket allocations from Aston Villa for their upcoming UEFA Europa League match in Birmingham on November 6, 2025, due to security concerns.

we know about Israeli soccer fans being banned from attending Maccabi Tel Aviv’s match against Aston Villa \n       \n  By Amy Woodyatt, Ben Church, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:33 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Maccabi Tel Aviv has said it will not accept any prospective ticket allocation from Aston Villa following a  ban  on the Israeli soccer club’s fans from attending a Europa League game in Birmingham next month due to security concerns.\n \n\n   \n  The ban was put into place by local authorities in England and triggered condemnation from many politicians, sports organizations and Jewish groups, who have since tried to reverse the decision.\n \n\n   \n  “The wellbeing and safety of our fans is paramount and from hard lessons learned, we have taken the decision to decline any allocation offered on behalf of away fans and our decision should be understood in that context,” Maccabi Tel Aviv said in a  statement published to X  on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the ban and the subsequent reaction.\n \n\n   \n    Why was a ban on traveling Maccabi fans put in place?\n \n\n   \n  Aston Villa said that the decision was made following an instruction from the city of Birmingham’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG), which provides health and safety guidance at events and issues safety certificates for matches at Villa Park.\n \n\n   \n  The SAG wrote to Villa and European soccer governing body UEFA advising that no away fans should be permitted to attend the game, which takes place on November 6.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, West Midlands Police (WMP)  said in a statement  that it had deemed the match to be high risk “based on current intelligence and previous incidents” and that it agreed with the decision by local authorities to ban traveling fans.\n \n\n   \n  “Based on our professional judgement, we believe this measure will help mitigate risks to public safety,” said WMP.\n \n\n   \n  “We remain steadfast in our support all affected communities, and reaffirm our zero-tolerance stance on hate crime in all its forms.”\n \n\n   \n    What happened this past weekend?\n \n\n   \n  Days after the decision, the Tel Aviv soccer derby between Hapoel and Maccabi was canceled on Sunday after what police described as “public disorder and violent riots” – the latest episode of fan unrest involving Maccabi fans.\n \n\n   \n  The Israeli Premier League match was due to be played at Bloomfield Stadium, which is shared by the two rivals, but videos on social media showed fans clashing with police both inside and outside the area.\n \n\n   \n  In a  statement  Sunday, Israel Police said that 12 civilians and three police officers were injured in the unrest, with nine people arrested. Authorities said that a further 16 people were detained for questioning.\n \n\n   \n  Footage released by police showed pyrotechnics and smoke grenades being thrown from the stands before kickoff, and police  said  the decision to cancel the match was made due to “endangerment of human life.”\n \n\n   \n  This comes almost a year after Maccabi supporters were beaten and injured in violent clashes in Amsterdam ahead of a Europa League game against Ajax, which Dutch authorities condemned as antisemitic.\n \n\n   \n    What have politicians said about the ban?\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson said that the UK government was “saddened” by Maccabi Tel Aviv’s decision to turn down its ticket allocation for the match but “respect(s) the club’s right to do so.”\n \n\n   \n  The spokesperson told reporters: “This government wants a Britain built for all. We will never accept antisemitism on our streets. The focus now is to ensure the game moves ahead safely and that Jewish people across the country feel secure in their communities.”\n \n\n   \n  UK authorities had previously sought to reverse the ban on Maccabi fans from attending the game at Villa Park.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Keir Starmer said last week that it was the “wrong decision,” adding that the “the role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”\n \n\n   \n  Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, meanwhile,  said  that the government would “find the resources” to allow Maccabi fans to attend the match next month.\n \n\n   \n  She added that the situation came “against the backdrop of rising antisemitism here and across the world, and  an attack  on a synagogue in Manchester in which two innocent men were killed.”\n \n\n   \n    What was Maccabi’s response?\n \n\n   \n  In addition to declining any possible ticket allocation to Villa Park, Maccabi said in a statement: “As a result of the hate-filled falsehoods, a toxic atmosphere has been created which makes the safety of our fans wishing to attend very much in doubt. Inflammatory rhetoric, trafficking in half-truths is never healthy, but in this particular case the remarks being generated are of the most concerning variety.”\n \n\n   \n  The statement added: “We acknowledge the efforts of the UK government and police to ensure both sets of fans can attend the match safely, and are grateful for the messages of support from across the footballing community and society at large.”\n \n\n   \n  “We as a club believe that football should be about bringing people together not driving them apart and no one should feel unsafe for simply wanting to come and support their team nor feel any hesitation about being accompanied by family and friends.”\n \n\n   \n  Maccabi said it looked forward to “being able to play in Birmingham in a sporting environment in the near future,” adding that it hoped “circumstances will change.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/va-therapists-treatment-sessions-limited","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00Z","title":"VA Therapy Sessions Being Limited, Veterans and Providers Raise Alarm Over Access to Long-Term Care","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Veterans and mental health providers report that VA therapy sessions — especially long-term one-on-one therapy for conditions like PTSD — are being abruptly limited or terminated, despite clinical need.

therapists and patients say their treatment sessions are being limited, raising alarm \n       \n  By Brian Todd, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:00 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  An edge comes to Michael’s voice when he speaks about his time serving in Afghanistan and his struggles living with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n \n\n   \n  A hardened Marine veteran, Michael — who asked to use the pseudonym to speak candidly about sensitive health issues — describes in tones that are measured but laced with irritation what he saw in conflict: vehicles being blown up, children being exploited, cellphones that could trigger unexpected detonations.\n \n\n   \n  Though he left the armed forces years ago, he still has flashbacks. To this day, he is “trying to figure out how to stop the nightmares,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It took him years to find a trusted VA therapist, who gave him a lifeline after he struggled with addiction and was hospitalized following multiple suicide attempts, he said.\n \n\n   \n  But recently, Michael’s one-on-one sessions with the provider were suddenly terminated.\n \n\n   \n  Some Veterans Affairs hospitals, including the one where Michael gets his care, have stepped up enforcement of a policy in recent years that limits the number of long-term therapy sessions available to individuals, according to half a dozen mental health providers and VA patients     at locations across the country who spoke to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Under the policy, put in place under earlier administrations, patients initially get a certain number of one-on-one therapy sessions, which can vary between four and 24 sessions, depending on the type of treatment.\n \n\n   \n  Mental health care providers at four facilities have told CNN that, whereas in the past they had discretion to extend the number of sessions based on their assessments of their patients, the VA is now pressing them to stop one-on-one sessions at the end of the allotted series, and more broadly reduce the number of patients who get this long-term care — without consideration for whether this is clinically appropriate. The providers asked not to be named for fear of retribution. \n \n\n   \n  In some cases, providers told CNN that if they pushed back on the policy, they faced disciplinary consequences, which could result in their privileges to practice therapy at VA facilities being removed. CNN has viewed some of these documents discussing disciplinary measures. Some providers said they had to justify extending care to more sessions in writing — a change from previous practice at their VA facility.\n \n\n   \n  Contacted by CNN, the VA denied veterans aren’t getting the care they need.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the department said it was not aware of providers facing disciplinary reviews for challenging a policy to limit sessions.\n \n\n   \n  “There are no limits on the number of VA appointments a Veteran can have in mental health or any other areas,” Peter Kasperowicz, the spokesperson, said.\n \n\n   \n  The VA “works with Veterans over an initial eight to 15 mental health sessions and collaboratively plans any needed follow-on care,” he said. “As part of this process, Veterans and their health care team decide together how to address ongoing needs, including whether to step down to other types of care and self-maintenance, or continue with VA therapy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The goal is recovery, healing and helping Veterans achieve greater independence and resilience.”\n \n\n   \n  While some providers who spoke to CNN said they are given some flexibility to extend care, all said there has been a draconian effort to move patients out of individual therapy more quickly since President Donald Trump took office in January and installed Doug Collins as VA secretary.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really, really frustrating. These people need help,” one provider said. The person stressed that some mental health conditions are “chronic,” and those patients would need treatment for life.\n \n\n   \n  Another provider described having to inform one of their patients that sessions would be ending, saying: “It was terrible. The timing wasn’t right. There were still things we were working on.”\n \n\n   \n  “It felt like it was a moral failing on my part, even though it wasn’t my fault,” the provider said. “It’s re-traumatizing for the veteran. It almost feels like I’m a perpetrator of that, having to carry out those orders.”\n \n\n   \n  Michael, the combat veteran, said that finding out his therapy sessions were to stop felt “like being abandoned — you’re thrown away like yesterday’s trash.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not ready to address all my issues on my own yet,” he said. “It feels like they took the training wheels off before I’m ready.” He has re-applied for one-on-one care and is in the middle of a   monthslong   waiting period.\n \n\n   \n    A larger debate\n \n\n   \n  Some providers said they were told the rationale for the renewed push to limit therapy sessions is to free up room for more veterans to enter the VA system and receive mental health treatment, and to move patients through the system more rapidly.\n \n\n   \n   Some   studies  do suggest that shorter-term, limited sessions can work well for particular veterans.\n \n\n   \n  And the practice of limiting longer-term mental health care for some patients is also commonplace in the private sector. “Larger hospitals and health care systems do sometimes place limits,” said Caitlin Thompson, a former VA psychologist who oversaw the Veterans Crisis Line  and suicide prevention program and now works in the private sector. “It depends on what’s clinically appropriate,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  One former VA mental health care provider, who is now in the private sector and didn’t want to give their name, said: “When insurance is paying for mental health care, utilization review is standard practice. It’s not open-ended. There are weigh stations.” It is often important to set goals and timeframes in treatment to track progress, they added.\n \n\n   \n  However, VA providers who spoke to CNN said there were problems with how the limits were being implemented at their VA facilities.\n \n\n   \n  One provider said that while they agreed with the objective to bring more veterans into the system to access care, “it should be agreed upon between the patient and the therapist” regarding when treatment should end — and not be imposed by the institution.\n \n\n   \n  Another mental health care provider at a VA facility in the western US said that because of the intensified push to limit sessions, “we have been hemorrhaging staff  ” as some mental health providers quit in frustration over the policy — at a time when the VA already has a severe shortage of psychologists,  according to a recent VA Inspector General report . \n \n\n   \n  Stephen Long, a former VA psychologist at the Northport VA Medical Center on Long Island, told CNN that he retired in 2024, in part because he was told to limit one-on-one sessions with patients.\n \n\n   \n  Longer-term, more open-ended therapy builds more trust between veterans and their therapists, he said. “If you can’t have this kind of therapy, you’ll miss opportunities to develop that trust.”\n \n\n   \n  Some veterans will need therapy for the rest of their lives, Long said. Treatment needs for physical illnesses would never simply be cut off — “If you need insulin for your diabetes, you don’t stop it,” he said — and mental illnesses should be treated the same. Some providers who spoke to CNN also said veterans often have issues that lend themselves to needing longer-term care.\n \n\n   \n  Mark Jorges, a former psychotherapist and mental health counselor at the VA hospital in Temple, Texas, says he resigned this May in part because of his frustrations over the mandate to limit sessions.  “I brought it up all the time” to leadership at his hospital, Jorges told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He says from the time he started working at that VA facility in 2021, there have been various attempts to have therapists limit sessions.\n \n\n   \n  But setting a set number of sessions   “as a directive is not appropriate clinically, because veterans have different pathologies according to what they’ve been through,” Jorges said. “You could be talking about someone with PTSD, depression, anxiety, acute stress disorder … that’s the majority of patients I saw. You can’t put a cap on it. It’s just not appropriate.”\n \n\n   \n  The American Psychological Association, the largest scientific and professional organization for psychologists in the US, told CNN it is aware of reports from VA psychologists   of mental health visits being limited for some veterans, and is looking into them.\n \n\n   \n  “Veterans deserve individualized, recovery-oriented care based in shared decision-making between the provider and the Veteran,” Katherine McGuire, the APA’s chief advocacy officer, said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The VA has a great history of providing excellent mental health care by exceptionally skilled providers apt at assessing veterans’ needs and appropriate treatment options.”\n \n\n   \n  Patients were offered other options for treatment, such as group therapy or the chance to re-apply for one-on-one treatment.\n \n\n   \n  But some veterans who have come to depend on their trusted therapists say those are not palatable options.\n \n\n   \n  Michael said he was offered group therapy, but does not want to take it as he feels uncomfortable speaking about his issues in a group setting. Even when he is approved for one-on-one treatment, which can take months, he is not assured of seeing the same therapist.\n \n\n   \n  He feels uneasy about potentially seeing another therapist, he said. “It took me a long time to open up” to his trusted therapist, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Jake Pannell, an Army veteran who’s been receiving one-on-one mental health treatment for PTSD and anxiety at a VA facility in Washington state for several years, told CNN that in recent months, providers have told him that “unless there’s an active crisis, they are no longer going to do just check-in visits.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve continuously received one-on-one treatments at the VA for many, many years,” Pannell said. “And as we’re starting to get notified of these things, even the providers that are taking care of these veterans are telling us that, regardless of what the condition is, or regardless of what the veteran’s going through at the time, they are limiting a certain time frame down to 8 to 12 visits.”\n \n\n   \n  Pannell, who now works for a federal workers union, has himself previously worked as a VA behavioral health counselor specializing in drug and alcohol rehabilitation.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got veterans with severe PTSD, drug and alcohol issues. And that requires continuous maintenance,” he said. “Once that crisis happens, so — we have to wait ‘till veterans threaten to kill themselves before they get care?” he asked. “I’m scared to death. I’m scared to death for my veterans.”\n \n\n   \n  “We just want the care that we were promised,” the Afghanistan combat veteran said. His main concern as he’s waiting for a new set of therapy sessions, he says, is “just lettin’ everything take back over.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/science/data-centers-in-space-spc","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"05:33:00-04:00","title":"Why these companies want to send data centers into space","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Advances in artificial intelligence are driving a massive surge in data center demand, leading to concerns over land use, energy consumption, and carbon emissions.

But these warehouse-like facilities, containing computers that process and store data, require a lot of land and huge amounts of energy, generating significant carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\n \n\n   \n  Data center power demand will increase 165% by 2030, according to  Goldman Sachs . Some data centers use renewables, and others are being constructed with  renewable energy generation on-site , but clean energy sources like solar and wind farms require physical space, as does data center infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Now, some are looking to put data centers into space, bypassing the problem of finding available land. Space also offers  better access to solar energy , without the cloud cover, the darkness of nighttime or the seasonality of Earth.\n \n\n   \n  In Europe, the ASCEND project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of space-based data centers for reducing CO2 emissions.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, France-based  Thales Alenia Space , which led a European Commission-funded  study  into the feasibility of ASCEND, found that sending data centers to space to take advantage of continuous solar energy could offer “a more eco-friendly and sovereign solution for hosting and processing data.” But that would be contingent on technological advancements in several areas, said Xavier Roser of Thales Alenia Space.\n \n\n   \n  While the total emissions from rocket launches are currently only a fraction of those from the aviation industry, rockets release pollutants at higher altitudes, where they last longer.\n \n\n   \n  The ASCEND study estimated that for space data centers to effectively reduce carbon emissions compared to their terrestrial counterparts would require the development of a launcher that emits 10 times less carbon over its lifecycle than current ones. It’s not clear when or if such a rocket may be in development. SpaceX, which has revolutionized the cost of rockets with its fleet of Falcon launch vehicles, has not revealed any plans to debut a more environmentally friendly rocket design.\n \n\n   \n    Small steps\n \n\n   \n  Abu Dhabi-based startup  Madari Space  has collaborated with an industrial accelerator program run by Thales Alenia Space, and is one of a handful of companies that are launching small computing components into orbit as technical demonstrations. \n \n\n   \n  Madari founder and CEO Shareef Al Romaithi, who is also a pilot for Etihad Airways, said space-based data centers could benefit a variety of customers, including those with Earth observation satellites. He said storing and processing their raw observation data in space can reduce lag time in anlayzing their findings, and “allow them to make informed decisions in a timely manner,”\n \n\n   \n  He hopes to eventually deploy a constellation of data satellites into orbit. While that goal is a way off, Madari’s first mission, scheduled for 2026, will send a payload about the size of a toaster oven — consisting of data storage and data processing components — into orbit aboard an Emirati satellite, part of the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA)’s Access to Space for All Initiative.   \n \n\n   \n  Others have already carried out launches. In May, China launched  12 satellites  for a space-based computing constellation — the first of a proposed 2,800-satellite fleet to process data in space.\n \n\n   \n  Al Romaithi says that should be a wakeup call to consider space a viable location for data centers. “It is a reality that’s happening,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lonestar Data Holdings, a Florida-based firm, said in March that it  successfully tested  a small data center on the moon, despite the system  landing on its side and powering down early . \n \n\n   \n  In November, Starcloud — a Washington state-based startup — will launch a satellite equipped with a Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit (GPU). The company told CNN via email that it will set a record for the most powerful in-orbit compute power.\n \n\n   \n  “My view is that in 10 years’ time, almost all new data centers will be being built in space, purely because of the constraints we are facing on building new energy projects terrestrially,” Philip Johnston, its CEO, said in the email. The main challenges to overcome first are dissipating large amounts of heat in a vacuum and making the chips work in a high radiation environment, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Still, it’s very early days for the sector — and a giant leap to launch data centers big enough to offer an alternative to those on Earth. Cost will be key, with launch costs dependent on the weight of the payload.\n \n\n   \n  Lonestar has signed a  $120 million deal with spacecraft provider Sidus  to build and provide on-orbit support for six data-storage satellites. It plans to launch the first in 2027 — a 15-petabyte system operating from the Earth-moon Lagrange point L1, some 60,000 kilometers from the moon. The next five satellites will each double in storage capacity, while keeping the same weight and energy requirements, the company says.\n \n\n   \n  Each will share a ride with larger satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon, making up around 15% of the payload mass. That could cost in the region of $10 million per launch, for a fraction of the storage of many terrestrial data centers.\n \n\n   \n    Overcoming astronomical challenges\n \n\n   \n  But some experts are skeptical about the economics of data centers in space. “To do a cost effective, true, objective analysis of it, it doesn’t really stand up to scrutiny,” said  Quentin A. Parker , the director of the Laboratory for Space Research at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).  “The terrestrial solutions are still there, and they’re still probably a lot cheaper than trying to put anything into space,” he added. “Putting them into space has all sorts of problems associated with it.”\n \n\n   \n  While advocates claim that storing data in space could provide protection from data centers being attacked, or damaged due to natural disasters,   Parker points out that space brings its own risks, including radiation,  space debris , and also the consequences of sending more human-made objects into space without a solution for cleaning them up.\n \n\n   \n  Experts have been raising alarm bells about the increasing amount of human-made junk left in space; they warn that a collision could take down space-based technologies that power our everyday lives.\n \n\n   \n  Others have pointed out that maintaining and repairing data centers in space could  pose a major challenge , while space weather, such as solar flares, could disrupt services. And a number of nations are  reportedly developing “counterspace technologies,”  such as jamming systems that can be targeted at satellites.\n \n\n   \n  Proponents of space-based data centers may be “overselling the advantages and significantly underselling the major drawbacks,” said Parker.\n \n\n   \n  But for Al Romaithi, looking off-planet is a necessity. “It is worth overcoming these challenges because the alternative is technological stagnation,” he said. “We will reach a point where we are exhausting our resources just to run data centers.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/sport/football-nfl-week-7-mnf-review-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"05:27:00-04:00","title":"Breakout RB display, another serious injury to a star and third-year receiver continues rise: NFL Week 7 MNF review","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In Week 7 of the 2025 NFL season, the Detroit Lions defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24-9 in a game marked by a breakout performance from running back Jahmyr Gibbs, who recorded 218 total yards and two touchdowns — the most for a Lions player since Calvin Johnson’s 2013 game.

and third-year receiver continues rise: NFL Week 7 MNF review \n       \n  By Ben Morse, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:27 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For the final time this NFL season, there was a double-header on Monday Night Football.\n \n\n   \n   Week 7’s  two Monday games saw the Detroit Lions comfortably handle the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Seahawks outlast the Houston Texans to provide a small salve to  Seattle sports fans .\n \n\n   \n  There were plenty of storylines to come from the two games, including a breakout performance for a star running back and another serious injury suffered by a big-time wide receiver.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s everything you need to know about the two MNF games.\n \n\n   \n    Gibbs explodes as Lions dispatch Bucs\n \n\n   \n  Entering the 2025  NFL  season, Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs could claim he was the best at his position; he was tied for the most rushing touchdowns in the league last campaign.\n \n\n   \n  But through the first six weeks of the season, it had been fairly ho-hum by his lofty standards.\n \n\n   \n  Well, that all changed on Monday night when the 23-year-old exploded for 218 total yards – 136 on the ground on 17 attempts and 82 through the air on three catches – as well as two rushing touchdowns in Detroit’s 24-9 win over Tampa Bay.\n \n\n   \n  His 218 yards from scrimmage were the most in a single game for a Lions player since Hall of Fame receiver  Calvin Johnson  had 329 yards in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  “It was huge. You felt like this was coming,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said of Gibbs’ performance afterwards. “You felt like this has been building and as he gets in better shape and starts getting his feet under him and starts getting a feel of it – starts breaking some tackles.\n \n\n   \n  “Every week, you feel like it’s gotten closer and closer. Tonight was the night where he just busted one of these out of there and there’ll be no looking back. I think he’s just going to continue to do this.”\n \n\n   \n  From the opening quarter, Gibbs looked up for the challenge. He caught a 30-yard pass on the team’s opening possession and then broke a 78-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, showing the speed and elusiveness he’s become known for since being drafted out of Alabama in 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Gibbs’ performance came at the perfect time for the Lions, with quarterback Jared Goff having an uncharacteristically sloppy game, throwing one interception and losing a fumble.\n \n\n   \n  “Those long ones are fun to watch,” Goff said of Gibbs’ 78-yard TD run. “I feel like I got the best seat in the house just to like see him hit the hole and then just like take off. I don’t know how many safeties in the league could catch him. So, as soon as he gets there, it’s over and he’s gone. … It’s pretty cool. He’s dang fast and it’s fun to watch.”\n \n\n   \n  It was Gibbs’ best outing of the season by far, having not surpassed 100 rushing yards or 110 scrimmage yards in the 2025 season.\n \n\n   \n  For Tampa Bay, it was a disappointing overall display after an excellent start to the season.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from the defeat which sees them slip to 5-2, the main negative on the night was another serious injury suffered by the team’s star wide receiver Mike Evans.\n \n\n   \n  Evans, who was returning from three-game absence due to a hamstring injury, was carted off the field in the second quarter after his head hit the turf while trying to catch a pass.\n \n\n   \n  The 32-year-old was quickly ruled out with a concussion and a shoulder injury, but after the game, Bucs head coach Todd Bowles announced that Evans had suffered a broken clavicle and would miss most of the remainder of the NFL season.\n \n\n   \n  It likely ends Evans’ run of 11-straight seasons with at least 1,000 receiving yards and leaves Tampa Bay’s receiving core down to the bare bones. The team was already without veteran Chris Godwin due to a fibula injury and breakout rookie Emeka Egbuka has been dealing with a hamstring issue.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s never good to see one of your star players go down like that, especially with him just coming back and everybody excited to see him,” Bowles said. “So, it’s a blow and we’ve been holding down since he’s been gone and we just got to regroup and come back.”\n \n\n   \n    Jaxon Smith-Njigba shines as Seahawks beat Texans\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s other game was a tighter affair, with the Seahawks overcoming the Texans 27-19 at Lumen Field.\n \n\n   \n  The Seahawks had raced into a 14-0 first-quarter lead before a string of errors let Houston back into the game.\n \n\n   \n  Seattle receiver Cooper Kupp threw an interception, then the team had a field goal attempt blocked. Houston had two field goals in the meantime to make it 14-6 at the half.\n \n\n   \n  Three plays after the break, Texans QB CJ Stroud threw an interception to set up a quick Seahawks field goal before a sack, forced fumble and fumble return touchdown – all from Houston pass rusher Will Anderson – cut Seattle’s lead to five.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the Texans looking like they had the momentum, 10 straight points from the Seahawks put the home team back on top.\n \n\n   \n  And although Woody Marks’ touchdown run with just over two minutes to play made it a one-score game, an unnecessary roughness penalty by Houston’s Tim Settle meant the Seahawks could run out the rest of the clock and hold on to an important win and improve to 5-2 in a three-way tie for first in the NFC West.\n \n\n   \n  In what was a defensive grind at times, the star of the show on offense was Seahawks receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba who continued his excellent third season in the NFL.\n \n\n   \n  The former Ohio State star finished the game with eight catches for 123 yards and a touchdown; he celebrated his score with an athletic basketball-esque dunk of the football over the goal posts for which he received a penalty.\n \n\n   \n  He now  leads the league  with 819 receiving yards and now has five games this season with over 100 receiving yards.\n \n\n   \n  Smith-Njigba has become the favorite target of Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold in his first year with the team and looks to be among the league’s best at his position.\n \n\n   \n  The Seahawks signal-caller was asked about how Smith-Njigba compares to Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson, who Darnold connected with so effectively last season.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re both really, really good players. Great players, if you will,” he told reporters. “I think they are really different. At the end of the day, they both know how to get open. I think that’s the only thing that matters.\n \n\n   \n  “They run routes in different ways, but they understand coverage. They understand the DB they’re going against. Again, that’s habits. That’s both of their film study habits they have every single week, understanding the guys that they’re going against, understanding the coverages we’re going to see.\n \n\n   \n  “I think at the end of the day it’s them just understanding who we’re going against and the preparation that Justin and JSN have during the week.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/slovakia-prime-minister-attacker-jail-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"06:12:00-04:00","title":"Slovakia court sentences suspect in attempted assassination of Prime Minister Robert Fico to 21 years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Slovak court has sentenced Juraj Cintula, a 72-year-old former mine worker and public activist, to 21 years in prison for attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Robert Fico in May 2024 in the town of Handlova.

It has absolutely blown away the competition.\n \n\n   \n  Having lost just one game all season, it is currently 11 points ahead of nearest challenger Hammarby in second, and with its 2-0 win over IFK Göteborg, Mjällby assured the title with three games remaining.\n \n\n   \n  Win even one of its remaining fixtures – or draw two – and Mjällby will set a new record for the  most points ever  amassed by an Allsvenskan team, beating the record set by Swedish giant Malmö FF in 2010 and matched by AIK in 2018.\n \n\n   \n  “Malmö is the richest club in Sweden and Mjällby has something like 15% of their budget, so everyone believed that Malmö would go on and win their third title in a row before this season started,” explains Hadzic.\n \n\n   \n  Even when Mjällby enjoyed a strong start to the season, the team still wasn’t seen as a title contender. It was only after defeating Malmö in August that “all of a sudden, it felt like, ‘Yeah, they could really make it,’” Hadzic adds.\n \n\n   \n  European soccer is no stranger to David and Goliath stories in recent years.  Leicester City ,  Bayer Leverkusen  and Montpellier have all shocked their respective leagues to claim unlikely titles.\n \n\n   \n  But even those stories did not begin a decade prior, stranded in the third tier and fighting bankruptcy.\n \n\n   \n  “You can’t really compare because Leicester still had really wealthy owners,” Olof Lundh, a Swedish sports journalist, tells CNN Sports. “I have a hard time finding equivalent achievements, especially considering they’re from this really small municipality.\n \n\n   \n  “They shouldn’t even be in the top division,” he adds. “Just being in the top division is impressive, and being in the top half of the top division is super impressive and then winning the title, it’s incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  The obvious question, then, is: how exactly did this happen? How is it possible for a team from a village approximately 1/250th the size of Malmö to fight off Sweden’s elite and have arguably the best season in the nation’s history?\n \n\n   \n  Under chairman Magnus Emeus, a local businessman who returned to his hometown after working abroad, Mjällby has followed a philosophy whereby “you’re supposed to be able to measure everything,” says Lundh.\n \n\n   \n  “I think they’ve just been really smart and worked really hard,” adds Hadzic. “They’ve been tremendously good in their scouting. They’ve found some good players, they’re giving players a second chance and they’ve just blossomed at Mjällby.”\n \n\n   \n  And when your town is so small that everyone knows everyone else – Mjällby’s head coach is a school principal and its scout is a postman – your weaknesses can become your biggest strengths.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a team based on very high team spirit,” Hadzic explains. “Some of the players live in the same flat.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something I never thought would happen in my life. I’m so incredibly grateful for this group,” striker Jacob Bergstrom said Monday, according to Reuters. “We showed that a collective can take you incredibly far, we have a lot of players who give everything for Mjällby, it’s fantastic.”\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been here for eight years (in total) and I have my best friends playing here and it’s all just wonderful, so I’m grateful.”\n \n\n   \n  That spirit seeps out into the local community, too; the local florist recently  developed  its own chocolates to honor the club’s achievement.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, in sporting director Hasse Larsson, Mjällby has a man who has given decades of his life to the club.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s like the heart and soul of the club,” says Hadzic. “He’s been a player, a manager, and now he’s a sporting director. Somehow, his soul embodies the whole club. He’s willing to do so much for Mjällby and willing to work so hard for them.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, luck has played its part in Mjällby’s triumph. The club has taken advantage of several of the league’s biggest teams, including Malmö, underperforming and all beating each other, Lund pointed out.\n \n\n   \n  That hard work will most likely continue ahead of next season when, should it emerge from the qualifying stage, Mjällby would be taking on Europe’s elite in the  Champions League . The thought of the likes of  Real Madrid  or Liverpool making the journey to the edge of the Baltic Sea is one that the team’s fans would have laughed at just 12 months ago.\n \n\n   \n  “I have a hard time putting it into words, I can honestly say. It’s so incredibly powerful,” Mjällby head coach Anders Torstensson said after Monday’s win, per Reuters. “Together with the team, we have kept it away from us, the pressure, the speculations and what is possible and not possible. It’s fantastic.\n \n\n   \n  “Redeeming to stand here as Swedish champions with little bloody Mjällby. It’s unreal.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/europe/lisbon-funicular-crash-faulty-cable-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"03:26:00Z","title":"Cable in deadly Portugal funicular crash failed to meet specifications, preliminary report finds","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A preliminary investigation by the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) found that a steel cable in the Lisbon Glória funicular failed to meet safety specifications and was not certified for passenger use, leading to a fatal crash in September 2025.

Video by Lali Houghton, Ladan Anoushfar, Estefania Rodriguez, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:37 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In the bracing morning air, workers leave their homes in the outer suburbs and hurry toward the industrial buildings lining the Guatemalan capital’s highways.\n \n\n   \n  Some go by foot. Others by motorcycle; whole families on the school commute, children in their mothers’ arms. Many more travel on old yellow school buses, imported from the United States after decades of service.\n \n\n   \n  The workers are almost entirely women, ranging from their late teens to early 60s. They stream into factory buildings past heavy metal gates and 10-foot walls topped with barbed wire.\n \n\n   \n  What happens inside these garment factories, known as “maquilas” throughout Central America, is largely hidden from public view – even though they employ tens of thousands of workers and are crucial to Guatemala’s economy.\n \n\n   \n  Cameras and other recording devices are not allowed inside, several of the workers told CNN. Independent inspectors are hamstrung by factory bosses, according to government officials. Trade unions are few and attempts to organize are met with threats, firings and, in some cases, violence, the workers said.\n \n\n   \n  What does emerge from these factories is box after box of garments overwhelmingly destined for the US: clothes for some of the biggest brands in North America, such as Carhartt, Target and Ralph Lauren, among others.\n \n\n   \n  After decades of nearshoring policies pursued by successive US administrations, Guatemala has become an integrated hub for cheap apparel – and some of the consequences for the local workforce have been brutal.\n \n\n   \n  A months-long investigation by CNN gathered dozens of testimonies of workplace abuse. Workers spoke of public dressing-downs and threats to fire staff unable to fulfill impossible quotas, wage theft and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n  Some maquila workers told CNN they were given daily quotas of thousands of apparel items, and made to stand for up to 15 hours a day, while earning a minimum wage of less than $500 a month.\n \n\n   \n  “If you don’t keep up, they flag you out, they discipline you,” said one worker, Rosa Guerra. “They ask us to hurry up and say that they cannot pay us.”\n \n\n   \n  Others described deplorable working conditions: “The (drinking) water was dirty. Sometimes it even had soap or cockroaches in it,” said Merida Jacinto.\n \n\n   \n  But dissent is not an option for the vast majority of maquila workers. Of the more than 850 textile maquilas in Guatemala, only 76 allow a workers’ union, Labor Minister Miriam Roquel told CNN. That’s about 9% of factories.\n \n\n   \n  Guatemala has long been a cheap supplier for US companies. But maquilas took on an increasingly central role during the Covid-19 pandemic, when lockdowns meant many containers sat idle in East Asian ports for months – and US manufacturers looked to production closer to home. Between 2019 and 2022, apparel imports from Guatemala grew 37%, according to data from the US Department of Commerce.\n \n\n   \n  The sector now counts for almost 10% of Guatemala’s GDP, and is so crucial to the economy it was granted an exemption to continue operating during Covid-19 restrictions.\n \n\n   \n  Back in Guatemala City, as the light begins to fade from the skyline, the maquila workers emerge from their factories. Now, some are ready to share their stories of the world inside.\n \n\n   \n    What a lifetime of maquila work looks like\n \n\n   \n  Rutilia Cano had worked for the same garment factory for 23 years – until she was abruptly made jobless in February.\n \n\n   \n  An indigenous woman from the Guatemalan highlands, Cano never learnt to read and moved to the capital as a young mother in the 1980s to escape the violent civil conflict between the Guatemalan Army and leftist guerrillas that caused the death of tens of thousands of Maya civilians between the 1960s and the early 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Working in the textile industry was the only job she could land, and the pace of work was brutal. “We were asked to make some 300 t-shirts an hour, but I never managed to,” Cano, now in her late fifties, told CNN. “I’m old, I could only get to 150, 175 t-shirts maybe, and the managers were always coming after me.”\n \n\n   \n  Her dream was to one day return to her village and purchase land to build a house. But for more than three decades her home has been a rundown apartment with a plastic curtain as a door.\n \n\n   \n  Like many of her fellow workers, Cano was never able to purchase the fruits of her labor. The t-shirts, skirts and more that she made at the factory – owned by Korean company KOA Modas – were supplied to US retailer Target and sold abroad. Throughout her employment Cano was never under contract with Target, who – as a third-party client – was not responsible for her layoff. Target used an intermediary to purchase garments from KOA Modas, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  On a rare visit to a large department store that sells international brands, Cano ran her strong hands shaped by a lifetime of sewing along the hanging rails of clothes. “It would take me days to afford what is on offer here,” she told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the garment factories here are run by Korean companies, who control almost two-thirds of investments in the Guatemalan textile industry, according to a 2022 report by USAID.\n \n\n   \n  In this intricate supply chain, US brands do not have formal relationships with most of the Guatemalan workers who manufacture garments on their behalf, nor are they legally responsible for the working conditions inside the maquilas.\n \n\n   \n  However, they benefit from a pattern of sub-contracting deals that keep prices down and deliveries running unabated, advocates have said.\n \n\n   \n  According to a company fact sheet, big US brand Ralph Lauren purchases from 17 facilities across Guatemala, some of which are owned by Korean companies. Ralph Lauren did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment on its supplier relationships.\n \n\n   \n  Mother-of-three Cano had been looking forward to retiring one day and spending more time with her family. But in February, that future was upended when Cano’s factory declared bankruptcy. Labor inspectors told her the factory’s ownership had left millions of dollars in outstanding payments to the Guatemalan welfare agency. Cano’s pension was gone.\n \n\n   \n  “I was due some 80-90,000 quetzales ($11,000)… and nothing. I feel so sad because we all lost our jobs, even me, a single mother. It’s just sad…” Cano told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Target told CNN suppliers are required to comply with lawful, safe and respectful working conditions and that the company decided to end the relationship with KOA Modas because the factory did not comply with its standards.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to KOA Modas for comment, but did not receive a response at time of publishing.\n \n\n   \n  After the factory closed, Cano joined litigation involving Sae-A Trading, another Korean company which used to purchase KOA Modas’s apparel on Target’s behalf and, after a lengthy legal battle, pledged to fulfill the vast majority of severance payments.\n \n\n   \n  While Sae-A Trading has no legal responsibility for the workers, it agreed to make a “humanitarian contribution” to those affected by the closure, it said in a resolution document. Its contribution of $3.3million is “considered a loan,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  Such severances are “by far the largest single sum of money most of these families will ever see in their lives,” Scott Nova, executive director at the Worker Rights Consortium, a US-based organization that investigates the garment industry, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  He said it was common in the industry for workers not to receive their pension, adding “it’s difficult to put into words how financially and psychologically devastating it is to work 20 years to earn this one sizable, real pot of money, and then just have it taken from you.”\n \n\n   \n  When CNN last spoke with Cano in late September, she was still waiting to be paid under the settlement with Sae-A Trading. “I need that money,” she told CNN, adding “at my age I’m struggling to get work – the only thing I could do is cleaning houses but that is very tiring.”\n \n\n   \n    A culture of fear\n \n\n   \n  For other maquila workers, simply joining their factory’s trade union – if it even exists – can be met with trepidation.\n \n\n   \n  Corina Olivares is one of the union representatives at the Texpia II factory, also owned by Sae-A Trading. She took over after her predecessor, Anastacio Tzib Caal, was shot dead outside of Guatemala City in June last year.\n \n\n   \n  In the months leading up to Caal’s death, obscenity-ridden threats appeared on the walls of workers’ toilets, which CNN has seen photos of. “Unionists, son of b****es, resign or we will lynch you,” read one, with the stylized image of a revolver mimicking a signature. “Unionist b**ch, go to sh*t don’t mess with the factory, be grateful it’s given you to eat for many years,” read another.\n \n\n   \n  While the US Department of Labor implied Caal’s murder was linked to his union activity, Olivares wasn’t so certain. However, she added, the threats made her seriously question whether to run as his successor: “For months, I was genuinely scared to walk to work,” she said. Olivares told CNN that the company blamed the union – which had campaigned for reduced working hours and clean drinking water being made available between shifts – for a contraction in trade. The resulting hostility from other workers toward union members made her feel unsafe.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Texpia II confirmed that threatening graffiti appeared between May and June last year but stressed that factory’s management took actions to condemn the threats and support union activities.\n \n\n   \n  Any form of verbal abuse or personal harassment is not tolerated at Texpia II, the spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, VESTEX, the civil association representing the textile export industry in Guatemala, said in a statement to CNN that the group’s Code of Conduct strictly bans verbal and physical abuse, including corporal punishment, coercion and sexual harassment.\n \n\n   \n    Power dynamics and sexual abuse\n \n\n   \n  Inside factories, the balance of power between the male-dominated management and the mostly female workers can lead to another disturbing problem.\n \n\n   \n  Worker Laura, who chose to remain anonymous, described how one manager would touch her inappropriately at work. “I knew it was not okay, but I was too scared to speak out,” she told CNN. “I didn’t know that inside a maquila, female workers were so exposed to the middle managers, as if a man who thinks he’s superior to us can dominate in such a way,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Another worker, Alexandra, who also preferred to remain anonymous, told CNN of a manager who sexually harassed her for years. “He would come toward me from my back in a really creepy way, putting his hands on my neck, touching me in a way that made me very uncomfortable,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  When she rejected his advances, Alexandra said the manager would change her shifts, and scold and insult her in front of other workers.\n \n\n   \n  When Alexandra and her colleagues complained about sexual and workplace abuse, she told CNN that the answer from upper managers was always that they were free to leave.\n \n\n   \n  In reality, Alexandra had few options but to stay on, telling CNN that she could not afford to be unemployed, and resigning would have meant giving up her severance pay.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory sells almost exclusively to the US market. Past clients include Carhartt, which told CNN it parted ways with the factory in 2019, though it does continue to purchase from Guatemala more broadly.\n \n\n   \n    Powerless to intervene\n \n\n   \n  Instead of quitting, Alexandra decided to join a workers’ union. The group relayed the abuse to the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor. But when labor inspectors were sent to the factory earlier this year, the company’s management refused to meet with them, video seen by CNN shows.\n \n\n   \n  The following week, all the members of the union were laid off.\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, the Ministry of Labor has continued to engage with the company, with no results. “(More recently) We tried to enter that maquila with our inspectors to register the workers’ conditions,” labor inspector Silvia Juarez told CNN. “We simply couldn’t: the management barricaded behind a shut door and we would need police intervention to break through,” she told CNN, gritting her teeth.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra’s factory did not respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN. However, the textile factories trade association VESTEX, told CNN in a statement that the group works hand in hand with the labor inspectorate to make sure regulations are respected.\n \n\n   \n  The Guatemalan president, Bernardo Arévalo, is the first progressive leader to be elected in the country in decades. His inauguration in 2024, after years of political malaise, raised hopes that rampant corruption and chronic malpractices could finally be reined in. But change is taking longer than expected.\n \n\n   \n  “What has been lacking in Guatemala is the political will to make public institutions work,” the president told CNN, a nod to the abuse in the maquila sector that has been infamous since at least the 1990s.\n \n\n   \n  Arévalo’s government raised the minimum wage for maquila workers by 6% and has pledged to do more to enforce existing regulation. But as the labor ministry’s inability to engage with shows, the state can do only so much.\n \n\n   \n  Months after their dismissal, most of the workers fired along with Alexandra told CNN they were getting by doing odd jobs and had struggled to find a new employer – their membership in the union apparently a stain in the eyes of other maquila   owners.\n \n\n   \n  The future for these maquila workers feels even more uncertain as the White House has imposed import tariffs on several countries that play a key role in the supply chain, leaving textile workers around the world exposed. The impact of those tariffs is yet to be felt in Guatemala, but other countries such as Lesotho and Haiti are already facing a bleak outcome.\n \n\n   \n  Prachi Agarwal, a research fellow at the ODI think tank, has written about a “gendered supply chain shock” as the vast majority of the workforce in the global garment industry are women.\n \n\n   \n  Alexandra meanwhile has decided to cut ties with the sector altogether. She hopes her daughter – who is studying law – will have a brighter career.\n \n\n   \n  “I will never want my daughter to work in a maquila. Ever,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Credits\n \n\n   \n  Reporter: Stefano Pozzebon\n \n\n   \n  Editor: Sheena McKenzie\n \n\n   \n  Video Journalist: Lali Houghton\n \n\n   \n  Video editor: Estefania Rodriguez\n \n\n   \n  Field producer: Sofia Menchú\n \n\n   \n  Commissioning editor: Ladan Anoushfar\n \n\n   \n  Copy editor:   Andy Raine\n \n\n   \n  Associate Producer: Marta Simonella\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/21/us/daniel-naroditsky-chess-grandmaster-dies-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"04:03:00Z","title":"American Chess Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky Dies at 29","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Daniel Naroditsky, a 29-year-old American chess grandmaster born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, died unexpectedly.

Naroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who attracted a massive online following through his livestreamed play and accessible teachings, has died at 29.\n \n\n   \n  The Charlotte Chess Center, a chess academy in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Naroditsky served as a head coach, announced his death in a  statement  on social media Monday. The announcement did not include a cause of death or say where he died.\n \n\n   \n  “It is with great sadness that we share the unexpected passing of Daniel Naroditsky. Daniel was a talented chess player, commentator, and educator, and a cherished member of the chess community. He was also a loving son, brother, and loyal friend to many,” the Charlotte Chess Center said in a statement attributed to Naroditsky’s family.\n \n\n   \n  Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Naroditsky began learning chess at age 6, starting a journey that would see him earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by the International Chess Federation to the world’s top players – before he was a senior in high school, according to the  center .\n \n\n   \n  His talent was evident early: he won grade-level national championships twice, and in fifth grade became the youngest player ever to claim the California K-12 Championship. That same year, in November 2007, he earned international acclaim as the under-12 World Youth Chess Champion, establishing himself as one of the country’s most promising young talents.\n \n\n   \n  After taking a gap year to focus fully on chess, Naroditsky enrolled at Stanford University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in history in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  The chess phenom also showed a spark for teaching the game. The first of his two chess manuals was published when he was just 14, and he went on to become a regular contributor to Chess Life magazine and other platforms dedicated to the game. The New York Times hired Naroditsky as  a chess columnist  in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky also carved out huge followings on his online platforms, garnering nearly half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch .

During a hearing  last week , she said she had concerns about whether her order was being followed.\n \n\n   \n  During the hearing, she added mandatory body-worn cameras to her earlier restraining order, saying it appeared agents were not warning demonstrators before deploying tear gas and firing pepper balls at them.\n \n\n   \n  The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras but her order does not require them if they are undercover, not in uniform or exempt by Customs and Border Protection, ICE or DHS policy.\n \n\n   \n  Every CBP agent on duty in Chicago – more than 200 – has a body camera and knows they are required to use it, CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick said during Monday’s hearing.\n \n\n   \n  ICE’s Special Response Teams, however, have not been issued body cameras, ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers testified. They went to one or two field offices but stopped being issued, and would need to go through Congress to get approved, Byers said without elaborating.\n \n\n   \n    Federal agents are trained on how to respond to protesters\n \n\n   \n  ICE agents have been trained on how to respond to demonstrations and how to arrest protesters as part of their use of force training, Byers said. They have the ability to issue felony and misdemeanor citations during demonstrations.\n \n\n   \n  Members of ICE’s Special Response Team have been outside the Broadview detention facility, the center of many anti-immigration enforcement demonstrations monitoring protests, and Byers indicated they too, are extensively trained.\n \n\n   \n  ICE agents are also specifically trained on how to handle reporters and direct press questions to public affairs. He added journalists have the right to observe, as long as they do not interfere.\n \n\n   \n  “As long as they’re in the media area, we shouldn’t have a problem with press,” Byers said.\n \n\n   \n  When questioned about an incident outside the Broadview facility in which a  pastor  said he was hit with pepper balls, Byers said the pastor did not leave federal property when given multiple commands to do so.\n \n\n   \n  Rev. David Black said he was outside the facility praying for the ICE officers and those detained inside when he was hit. He told CNN’s Erin Burnett on October 9 there was no warning before less-than-lethal force was used during the demonstration.\n \n\n   \n  “After they shot me in my head and my face, and multiple times in my torso, arms and legs, I was shielded by the bodies of others who were there who rushed in to support me and took many more hits that were intended for me,” Black said.\n \n\n   \n    Federal leadership’s a ‘revolving door,’ with multiple agencies on the ground\n \n\n   \n  Operation Midway Blitz is Trump’s recent ICE  deployment  across Chicagoland, yielding more than  1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois  between September 8 and October 3, DHS said.\n \n\n   \n  Harvick on Monday reiterated the White House’s denials of news coverage of tear gas used on protesters without warning in a recent  demonstration  in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood, although he acknowledged he had not seen it personally. Sean Skedzielewski, an attorney representing the Trump administration,  last week  said the judge was relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”\n \n\n   \n  When force is used during protests, reports are reviewed by ICE leadership, the Office of Professional Responsibility and a review committee to determine if the use of force meets policy, Byers said.\n \n\n   \n  The agency’s Special Response Team falls under the same enforcement mission as ICE, but members report directly to Byers, he said, adding ICE leadership has been “kind of a revolving door.”\n \n\n   \n  Harvick and Byers testified Monday after Russell Hott, the former interim head of Chicago’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, had left the Chicago area to return to his permanent job as field operations director in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis will continue to question top brass at a later time after saying Monday she will still depose Hott and Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent at CBP.\n \n\n   \n  She added since Hott was the highest officer in Chicago at the time the protests occurred, he should be able to speak to what happened on the ground.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/middleeast/hamas-gaza-hostage-israel-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-04:00","title":"Israel Identifies Body of Deceased Hostage as Sergeant Major Tal Haimi","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has officially identified the body of deceased hostage Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, killed during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, as part of the ongoing efforts under the US-brokered ceasefire agreement.

Sergeant Major Tal Haimi \n       \n  By Billy Stockwell, Eugenia Yosef, Tal Shalev, Dana Karni, Michael Rios, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Israeli forensics examiners have identified the remains of a deceased Israeli hostage handed over on Monday as those of Sergeant Major Tal Haimi, the prime minister’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Haimi was killed in the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, while defending a kibbutz, the Israel Defense Forces said. He was 41 years old at the time of his death. He is survived by his wife, four children, father and sister, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  Haimi is the 13th deceased hostage to be transferred and identified since the US-proposed Gaza ceasefire deal was signed on October 9.  Thai national Sonthaya Oakkharasri  was the previous one to be identified on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  According to the ceasefire agreement, 15 more deceased hostages remain to be transferred by Hamas.\n \n\n   \n  The Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed condolences to Haimi’s family after his body was returned for a proper burial.\n \n\n   \n  “Alongside the profound grief and the understanding that their hearts will never be whole again, Tal’s return brings a measure of solace to a family that has lived in unbearable uncertainty and anguish for more than two years,” the group said.\n \n\n   \n  A coffin   carrying Haimi’s remains had arrived in Tel Aviv earlier Monday for identification after it was retrieved by the Red Cross in Gaza and then transferred into the custody of Israeli forces in the war-torn territory. The latest transfer comes amid diplomatic efforts in the region aimed at pushing forward the next phase of the Trump administration’s ceasefire plan.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF called on Hamas to “take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas was supposed to return all the living and deceased hostages within the first 72 hours of the ceasefire going into effect.  Israeli intelligence  has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Hamas has said “significant efforts and special equipment” are  needed to recover the bodies  in Gaza after two years of war caused significant destruction in the territory.\n \n\n   \n  One of the bodies handed over by Hamas under the ceasefire agreement last week did not belong to an Israeli hostage, according to the Israeli military.\n \n\n   \n  Initial assessments at the time suggested Hamas misidentified the body rather than intentionally sending the wrong one, an Israeli source said.\n \n\n   \n  The latest news comes after the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza appears to have survived its first major test over the weekend – with both Hamas and the Israeli military accusing the other of violations – and amid anxiety in Israel over the delayed release of deceased hostages.\n \n\n   \n  Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana said Monday that the ceasefire agreement, including the return of all deceased hostages, must be fulfilled “one way or another,” according to a Knesset spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n    Diplomatic push continues\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Israel and Hamas  affirmed their commitment  to the Trump administration’s ceasefire deal after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers, prompting waves of airstrikes.\n \n\n   \n  US President Donald Trump threatened to “eradicate” Hamas if it doesn’t abide by the agreement.\n \n\n   \n  “If we have to, they’ll be eradicated, and they know that,” Trump said, warning that if the violence in Gaza continues, “we’re going to go in and straighten it out, and it’ll happen very quickly and pretty violently.”\n \n\n   \n  US troops would not be involved in any renewed fighting, Trump said, insisting that other forces are in place and ready to carry out orders should he decide that Hamas has violated the ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  The ceasefire deal’s key architects, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner held lengthy meetings with senior IDF generals in Tel Aviv on Monday to discuss ceasefire arrangements in Gaza, an Israeli source with knowledge on the matter told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The source said the meetings took place in the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, during which Witkoff and Kushner met with the IDF’s head of Intelligence Directorate, Major General Shlomi Binder, and the head of the Planning Directorate, Major General Eyal Harel.\n \n\n   \n  Israel’s strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer and the Prime Minister’s military secretary, Major General Roman Gofman, also participated, according to the source.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/10/asia/japan-takaichi-ldp-leader-hnk-intl-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"20:27:00Z","title":"Japan’s new leader drums to relieve stress.

She has many reasons to reach for her sticks \n       \n  By Hanako Montgomery, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:17 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For most of her life, Sanae Takaichi has loved heavy metal.\n \n\n   \n  Since drumming in a college band, the 64-year-old politician has remained a fan of groups like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden. She used to play so hard that she carried four pairs of sticks as back-up in case they snapped, Japanese media has reported.\n \n\n   \n  But unlike most metalheads who mellow with age, Japan’s newly elected prime minister is still an enthusiast. She has an electric drum set at home and bangs out songs whenever she’s stressed, usually about her husband.\n \n\n   \n  “I play after he goes to sleep,” she joked during a recent interview with a Japanese YouTuber.\n \n\n   \n  That same headbanging energy has defined her steady, albeit unconventional, political rise.\n \n\n   \n  The staunch conservative and longtime lawmaker won Japan’s ruling party’s presidency  on October 4 , becoming the first woman ever to secure the post, after her third attempt. On Thursday, Japan’s parliament elected her prime minister.\n \n\n   \n  As Japan’s first woman prime minister, she will inherit a daunting list of challenges.\n \n\n   \n    Aspirations of ‘Japan’s Thatcher’\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi has long championed conservative policies, rooted in nationalist and traditionalist ideals. Her win, a surprising triumph in Japan’s deeply patriarchal political system, signals to disillusioned LDP voters that traditional conservatism is alive and well.\n \n\n   \n  A prominent member of the ultranationalist lobby group Nippon Kaigi, she promotes a patriotic education. She’s also supported revising Japan’s pacifist constitution, particularly Article 9, which renounces war and bans military forces.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many of her male peers, Takaichi doesn’t come from a political dynasty. She was born in Nara prefecture to a father who worked for a car company and a mother who was a police officer.\n \n\n   \n  Before entering politics, she interned for a US Democratic congresswoman and worked as a TV commentator, “wearing miniskirts, riding motorcycles and presenting herself in a lively, unconventional way that sharply contrasted with the typical older male commentators,” Hajime Kidera, a professor at Meiji University’s School of Political Science and Economics, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  But Takaichi gave up her beloved Kawasaki Z400GP motorcycle after becoming a lawmaker in 1993 at age 32, reportedly to avoid accidents that could hinder her work.\n \n\n   \n  Her first stint in politics was as an independent lawmaker in Japan’s parliament. Around that time, she met the hairdresser who’d style her hair for the next three decades. From the start, Yukitoshi Arai told CNN, Takaichi aspired to be like Margaret Thatcher.\n \n\n   \n  When Arai learned Takaichi had won the LDP leadership, he said, “I was so happy it gave me goosebumps.”\n \n\n   \n  He fondly recalled how, after early political struggles, Takaichi joined the LDP in 1996. “We decided to express her renewed determination with her hair and cut it short,” he said. Thus was born the iconic “Sanae cut” – sleek, sharp and practical for a busy politician.\n \n\n   \n  Since joining the LDP, Takaichi has been re-elected nine times. She’s held multiple cabinet posts, including on gender equality and demographic issues, and chaired the party’s Policy Research Council. Most recently, she served as minister of economic security under the administration of Fumio Kishida.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi married in 2004. In a recent interview, she said she agreed to marry her husband, a fellow LDP lawmaker, without ever going on a date.\n \n\n   \n  He proposed over the phone, saying he’d had his eyes on her “for some time.” His audacity and her rashness might surprise some. But her husband was a catch, she said – he’s a trained chef.\n \n\n   \n  “He told me, ‘You’ll never go a day without eating good food.’ So, I just took the plunge,” she laughed, admitting she’s not much of a cook herself.\n \n\n   \n    New leader faces challenges\n \n\n   \n  Japan’s economic and demographic woes pose immediate challenges for Takaichi.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s declining birthrate means a shrinking workforce saddled with supporting a swelling elderly population. Record high inflation and a weak yen are also squeezing households and driving up living costs.\n \n\n   \n  Soon after her election as LDP leader, the yen hit a new low amid expectations of major fiscal stimulus. Takaichi has floated large-scale spending and low inflation under her own banner, “Sanaenomics,” echoing her mentor Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics.”\n \n\n   \n  “That kind of talk can weaken the yen further and raise concerns about Japan’s debt levels. For ordinary people already struggling with rising prices, it’s also a serious worry,” Kidera, the politics professor from Meiji University, said.\n \n\n   \n  Trade relations with Washington could prove tricky, particularly over a  $550 billion Japan-to-US investment deal  announced in September, which Takaichi has previously said she could revisit.\n \n\n   \n  As it stands, Japan’s investment in the US targets sectors like semiconductors, energy, pharmaceuticals and shipbuilding, while also purchasing $8 billion annually in US agricultural products. In return, the US has reduced tariffs on Japanese goods, including cars, to a baseline of 15%.\n \n\n   \n  With few details about the $550 billion investment deal available, and given President Donald Trump’s mercurial nature, Takaichi appears to be waiting to see how it unfolds, said Rintaro Nishimura, a Tokyo-based senior associate at The Asia Group, a consulting firm.\n \n\n   \n  Her first test with Washington could come quickly – she could meet Trump just days into her premiership.\n \n\n   \n  But despite her short runway, comparisons between the two conservative leaders are already being drawn. As a protégé of Abe, who enjoyed a close rapport with Trump, Takaichi is expected to follow her mentor’s diplomatic playbook. Like Abe, Takaichi has called for sharp increases in Japan’s defense budget, a move likely to be welcomed by the Trump administration, which has urged Tokyo to approach NATO’s 5% benchmark.\n \n\n   \n  Geopolitics will further test her leadership. Known as a China hawk, Takaichi has previously suggested that Chinese residents in Japan have a “duty to aid Chinese espionage.” She’s also argued that Japanese war crimes have been exaggerated, and makes regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where Japan’s war dead, including convicted war criminals, are enshrined. Several of her cabinet picks have close ties to Taiwan, risking friction with Beijing, Japan’s top trading partner.\n \n\n   \n  Yet analysts expect her stance on visits to the Yasukuni shrine will soften in office. “In reality, Takaichi will likely follow a logic of practical diplomacy. She’ll have to tone down the anti-China rhetoric she’s shown in the past,” political analyst Nishimura told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Signs of moderation have already appeared. Takaichi said she won’t visit Yasukuni during its autumn festival, likely to reassure uneasy coalition partners.\n \n\n   \n  Her election may also blunt the rise of  Sanseito, a right-wing populist party  that surged in July on an anti-immigration platform. During the LDP leadership race, all five candidates promised tougher measures on foreigners. But Takaichi stood out for her rhetoric, vowing to crack down on rule-breaking visitors and immigrants.\n \n\n   \n  She also cited unconfirmed anecdotes about tourists allegedly kicking sacred deer in her hometown of Nara, remarks that drew criticism. She later clarified she aimed to highlight the growing anxiety and anger among many Japanese about “outrageous” foreigners.\n \n\n   \n  At home, Takaichi must rebuild public trust after years of scandal within her party. In 2022, revelations of some LDP lawmakers’ ties to the former Unification Church hurt the party’s reputation. The following year, several lawmakers were accused of failing to report income or disclose kickbacks, deepening public frustration.\n \n\n   \n  Critics say Takaichi’s record on women’s rights is mixed and will be another test of her public appeal. She opposes allowing married women to keep separate surnames, and resists  female succession in the imperial family.  Still, during her 2025 campaign, she proposed tax breaks for babysitting and corporate incentives for in-house childcare, perhaps signs of a cautious shift toward more women-friendly policies.\n \n\n   \n  Takaichi’s rise delivers a jolt to Japan’s political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  The question now is whether Takaichi’s election, and the LDP’s gamble on her, will revive the party’s fortunes or hasten its decline.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/white-house-east-wing-ballroom-construction","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"19:34:00-04:00","title":"Demolition begins to replace White House East Wing with Trump’s ballroom","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Demolition of the White House East Wing began on October 20, 2025, as President Donald Trump unveils a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom to be built in its place.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said over the summer that the “state ballroom” would occupy space housing the East Wing of the executive mansion, where first ladies have traditionally maintained offices.\n \n\n   \n  The project fulfills a 15-year ambition by the president to construct an event space on the White House grounds that expands the building’s entertaining capacity — but also resembles  the gilded spaces  of his private clubs. The ballroom is just one part of Trump’s  efforts to transform  the buildings and grounds to his liking, which have included adding large flagpoles, paving over the Rose Garden, and decorating the Oval Office in gold.\n \n\n   \n  “I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom,” Trump posted on social media Monday evening. “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also commented on the construction during an event celebrating LSU baseball teams in the White House’s East Room earlier Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “You know, we’re building right behind us — we’re building a ballroom. They wanted a ballroom for 150 years, and I’m giving that honor to this wonderful place,” he said. “I didn’t know I’d be standing here right now, because right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically.”\n \n\n   \n  Renderings provided by the White House depict a vast space with gold and crystal chandeliers, gilded Corinthian columns, a coffered ceiling with gold inlays, gold floor lamps and a checkered marble floor. Three walls of arched windows look out over the White House’s south grounds.\n \n\n   \n  The new ballroom — which will maintain the “theme and architectural heritage” of the neoclassical executive mansion, the White House said — will have a seated capacity of 650 people, more than three times the space in the East Room, the largest event space in the White House.\n \n\n   \n  At  a recent dinner  with high-dollar ballroom donors, Trump said the new space would be “in keeping” with the White House architecture. He said it will be “appropriate in color and in window shape.”\n \n\n   \n  “There won’t be anything like it actually. … You know, a new thing is you build a super modern building next to an old-fashioned building, and I think that’s good, but I don’t have the courage to do that with the White House,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  During the dinner, the president said he was told there were “zero zoning conditions” set for the project.\n \n\n   \n  “I said, ‘How long will it take me?’” Trump recalled. “‘Sir, you can start tonight, you have no approvals.’ I said, ‘You gotta be kidding.’ They said, ‘Sir, this is the White House, you’re the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.’”\n \n\n   \n  White House communications director Steven Cheung on Monday  shared a screenshot  from  Smithsonian Magazine  of construction at the White House during the 1950s, in response to what he called “pearl clutching” after images of the demolition surfaced.\n \n\n   \n  The photo he posted was taken during the Truman administration, when the White House underwent a complete reconstruction after engineers discovered it was “structurally weak and in danger of collapse,” according to the  White House Historical Association .\n \n\n   \n  “Construction has always been a part of the evolution of the White House,” Cheung wrote on X. “Losers who are quick to criticize need to stop their pearl clutching and understand the building needs to be modernized. Otherwise you’re just living in the past.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/nicholas-rossi-utah-rape-conviction-sentencing-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00-04:00","title":"Man accused of faking his own death and fleeing the US after rape charges gets at least five years in prison","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nicholas Rossi, a 38-year-old man from Rhode Island whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, was convicted of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008.

Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:52 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Utah judge on Monday sentenced a man who appeared to  fake his death and flee  the United States to avoid arrest on rape charges to anywhere from five years to life in prison.\n \n\n   \n  Nicholas Rossi, 38, is “a serial abuser of women” and “the very definition of a flight risk,” District Judge Barry Lawrence said before handing down the sentence.\n \n\n   \n  It was Rossi’s first of two sentencings after separate convictions in August and September of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He is scheduled to be sentenced in November in the second case.\n \n\n   \n  Utah allows prison sentences to be given as a range rather than a set period of time. A parole board will determine if and when Rossi is released. Five years to life is the entire range of possible prison time under Utah law for rape, a first-degree felony.\n \n\n   \n  Jurors found Rossi guilty of rape in August after a  three-day trial  in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi left a “trail of fear, pain and destruction” behind him, the victim in the case told the court shortly before Rossi was sentenced. The Associated Press does not typically identify rape victims.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not a plea for vengeance,” she said. “This is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal.”\n \n\n   \n  Rossi posed a risk to community safety and should be in prison, argued Deputy Salt Lake County District Attorney Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case, before the sentencing. Rossi’s lawyers, meanwhile, urged the judge to give him parole.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi did not testify on his own behalf during the trial. Given a chance to speak before being sentenced Monday, he maintained his innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “I am not guilty of this. These women are lying,” Rossi said in a soft, raspy voice. He appeared in court in a wheelchair and used an oxygen tank.\n \n\n   \n  Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to  clear its rape kit backlog .\n \n\n   \n  Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on February 29, 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.\n \n\n   \n  He was  arrested in Scotland  the following year while receiving treatment for COVID-19. Hospital staff recognized his distinctive tattoos – including the crest of Brown University inked on his shoulder, although he never attended – from an Interpol notice.\n \n\n   \n  He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after a protracted court battle. At the time, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.\n \n\n   \n  In his first trial, Rossi’s public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas. Even so, the jury convicted Rossi of the rape charge for which he was sentenced Monday.\n \n\n   \n  The victim in the case had been living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury in 2008 when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within a couple weeks.\n \n\n   \n  She testified that Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn’t be evicted, and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said.\n \n\n   \n  She went to police years later, after hearing that Rossi was accused of raping another woman in Utah around the same time.\n \n\n   \n  The victim in that case went to police soon after Rossi attacked her at his apartment in Orem. The woman had gone there to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi was convicted in that case in September and sentencing is set for November 4.\n \n\n   \n  Rossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before he appeared to fake his death and flee the country. He was previously wanted in the state for failing to register as a sex offender. The FBI says he also faces fraud charges in Ohio, where he was convicted of sex-related charges in 2008.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/us/kada-scott-update-remains-identified","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"20:27:00-04:00","title":"Remains Found Behind Abandoned School Belong to Missing Philadelphia Woman, Kada Scott","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The remains of Kada Scott, a 23-year-old woman missing for about two weeks, were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia.

Those charges were dropped when the victim and a witness did not appear for court proceedings, Krasner said.\n \n\n   \n  Scott, who worked in an assisted living facility, was remembered Monday in a statement by her parents as a source of “light, kindness and beautiful spirit.” They said their hearts were “shattered” and asked for prayers.

Experts including Laura Evans and Remigiusz Plath argue that the heist reflects a new era of 'cultural terrorism' executed with military precision, driven by the high liquidity of materials over cultural significance.

The incident has prompted national concern in France, with Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin criticizing security failures, and Interpol adding the stolen artifacts to its global database.

Why the Louvre robbery is a worrying escalation \n       \n  By Jacqui Palumbo, Caitlin Danaher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:06 AM EDT, Tue October 21, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Paris’ Louvre Museum had already been open for 30 minutes, and welcomed hundreds of visitors through its doors, when thieves in yellow vests scaled a truck-mounted ladder to the second-floor balcony of the Apollo Gallery, home to the French crown jewels, among other treasures.\n \n\n   \n  Using an angle grinder to force open a window, they took just four minutes to enter the room, cut open two cases displaying Napoleonic jewels,  grab nine pieces  and flee back down the ladder.\n \n\n   \n  Beyond its seemingly cinematic plot, the robbery was a clear example of how thieves have started targeting cultural institutions not necessarily for their prized paintings, but for artifacts that can be dismantled, stripped or melted down for their expensive parts.\n \n\n   \n  Thieves executed a similarly daring raid on Dresden’s historic Green Vault in 2019, smashing their way into a glass case with an ax and making off with 21 diamond-studded Saxon treasures worth at least €113 million ($128 million).\n \n\n   \n  Many of the treasures  were recovered years later  when five men were convicted of the crime, but some remain missing to this day. All five told investigators they didn’t know where the missing jewels were.\n \n\n   \n  “What we’ve definitely seen in the last five to seven years is some more shift towards raw materials theft,” explained Remigiusz Plath, the secretary of the International Counsel of Museum Security, part of the International Counsel of Museums, whose experts keep information flowing across the European museum sector on security threats and best practices to safeguard institutions.\n \n\n   \n  The move, Plath says, has been away from stealing art for its cultural value. Works by Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian or Willem de Kooning can resurface years, or decades, later in a  building’s basement  or behind an  unassuming bedroom door . But experts say jewelry, coins or medals, meanwhile, are at risk of being lost forever — and quickly.\n \n\n   \n  “My cynical belief is that these gems from the Louvre have most likely already been broken down for their parts,” said Laura Evans, an art crime historian, author and professor.\n \n\n   \n  Her view is  shared by other experts  who have spoken to CNN about the case. “I don’t think that thieves probably care about the historical, cultural, or emotional significance of these gems as they were, and would not blink at cutting them down into different shapes and sizes. There’s a high liquidity when those gems are dismantled, but a stolen Monet, for example, has a really low liquidity, because it’s instantly recognizable.”\n \n\n   \n  Plath called museums “a relatively soft target” compared to other highly secured buildings, such as banks. Museums have to balance security with the freedom to see and engage with their collections.  “You can actually go in there, when the museum is open, and see it right in front of you,” he said. “And if you apply blunt force, just like a roof, you’re right there — there are not many thresholds to go through to have access to these raw materials.”\n \n\n   \n    A change in tactics\n \n\n   \n  Some of the most notorious museum robberies have captured the public imagination for their ingenuity or boldness. In 1990, at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, two men dressed as police officers pulled off the largest art heist in history, with 13 artworks, including three Rembrandts, and a Vermeer, that have never been found. In 1911, the Mona Lisa skyrocketed to international fame when a worker from the Louvre hid the small Leonardo da Vinci painting in his coat and spirited it away for two years.\n \n\n   \n  As the details of the Louvre heist have emerged, the plan’s sophistication has crystallized.  Like the highly orchestrated Green Vault heist, Evans called the Louvre incident a case of “cultural terrorism, executed with this military-style precision.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not about exploiting the weakest link anymore,” she said. “It’s about using force.”\n \n\n   \n  Police were met with several pieces of evidence when they arrived at the Louvre. Discarded by the truck were two grinders, a blowtorch, gasoline, gloves, a walkie-talkie, and a blanket. Laying nearby was a more eye-catching item, the crown of Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, dropped by the thieves as they made their escape on Yamaha T-Max scooters along the Seine river.\n \n\n   \n  The ornate gold piece, which features 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds, was damaged in the heist, prosecutors said.\n \n\n   \n  Plath is concerned with what he believes are increasingly aggressive “grab-and-go” thefts as thieves gain access to buildings with powerful industrial tools — this time, shockingly, during the day, when the museum was already filled with visitors.\n \n\n   \n  Museum robberies more often happen after hours with fewer risks to bystanders. Evans pointed to a rare case in 1972 when two men shot a security guard at the Worcester Art Museum while fleeing with four paintings that were later recovered. But the theft at the Louvre gives her a greater sense of unease that the danger could be escalating.\n \n\n   \n  “With how these things are progressing, it’s probably only a matter of time before something like that happens again. That’s something that I definitely am worried about,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    An investigation begins\n \n\n   \n  With a national manhunt underway, questions are now being asked as to how the thieves managed to pull off such a feat, who they are, and why French institutions seem to be considered easy targets.\n \n\n   \n  Before the Louvre robbery, thieves targeted Paris’ Natural History Museum in September, stealing gold nuggets worth €600,000 ($699,000), as well as antique Chinese porcelain worth €9.5 million ($11 million) from a museum in Limoges, south of the capital, the same month.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re an investigator for France, you are working under the theory at this stage that these are related because of the frequency, the boldness, the similarities in their mode,” theorized CNN’s senior national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem.\n \n\n   \n  Plath, too, said they could be connected, or copycats who have observed the effectiveness of other heists. Natalie Goulet, a centrist member of the French senate, told CNN on Monday that the robbery was probably linked to organized crime. In the case of the 2019 Green Vault robbery, the five men convicted were part of the Remmo clan, one of Germany’s most powerful crime families, which operates mostly in Berlin.\n \n\n   \n  French authorities will lead the investigation, though Interpol’s dedicated Cultural Heritage Crime unit may become involved if French officials suspect there is an international component.  Interpol  confirmed on X  that the Napoleonic crown jewels have been added to its database for stolen artworks and artifacts.\n \n\n   \n  For French Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, the heist spotlights embarrassing security failings at one of France’s most venerable institutions. “The French people all feel like they’ve been robbed,” he told France Inter radio.\n \n\n   \n  “One can wonder about the fact that, for example, the windows hadn’t been secured, about the fact that a basket lift was on a public road… What is certain is that we have failed,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Evans said that though many will be drawn to the salacious details of the heist — like any riveting crime thriller — there is a deep sense of national loss that should not be forgotten.\n \n\n   \n  “I would encourage people to see beyond the sensationalism of the heist and how it was executed,” she said. “There’s a real hole in the cultural heritage and the history of France as a nation.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/politics/paul-ingrassia-senate-confirmation-concerns","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00Z","title":"‘He’s not going to pass’: Thune says controversial Trump nominee for whistleblower office won’t be confirmed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Ingrassia, nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the Office of Special Counsel—a key federal agency responsible for protecting whistleblowers—has been effectively blocked from confirmation by the U.S. Senate.

John Thune, who declared Monday night that “he’s not going to pass” after Politico  reported   on racist text messages allegedly sent by Ingrassia to a group chat.\n \n\n   \n  Ingrassia is set to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and at least one Republican senator on the panel is already planning to vote against advancing Ingrassia’s nomination.\n \n\n   \n  “No, I do not support him,” Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Monday night. If every Democrat on the committee opposes Ingrassia, and Scott joins them, that would be enough to block the nomination.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if the White House should pull Ingrassia’s nomination, Thune told reporters, “I hope so,” and chuckled before adding, “He’s not going to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump nominated Ingrassia in May to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s  KFile   has previously reported on Ingrassia’s history of racist invective and conspiratorial rants, as well his claims that straight White men are the most intelligent demographic group.\n \n\n   \n  His nomination has drawn scrutiny over his past promotion of conspiracy theories and tweets from his podcast that included calls for martial law following Trump’s 2020 election loss and harsh anti-Israel rhetoric aimed at the GOP. Ingrassia has also been scrutinized for his ties to  Nick Fuentes , a noted White nationalist and Holocaust denier, as well as his defense of Fuentes’ ability to post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Homeland Security Chairman Rand Paul would not say if he’d oppose Ingrassia, but he noted that the administration will have to decide if it is comfortable with Ingrassia’s nomination moving forward.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that ultimately, there are a lot of questions on the nomination that the White House has to make a determination whether they think his nomination can get through, and we’re going to wait and hear from them what their thoughts are, whether they’ve talked to all the Republican members, and whether they think they have the votes,” Paul told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Other GOP senators refused to say if they’d back Ingrassia and said they want to hear from him on Thursday. “It sounds like there’s new information out tonight, I haven’t seen,” said Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley. “I’m sure we will welcome the opportunity to have his hearing on Thursday and respond to folks’ questions.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio added that he hasn’t “delved into it yet,” but he imagined they’d learn more on Thursday, and Oklahoma Sen.

However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters ‘Nazis,’” he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi.”\n \n\n   \n  In a later statement to Politico, Paltzik said, “In this age of AI, authentication of allegedly leaked messages, which could be outright falsehoods, doctored, or manipulated, or lacking critical context, is extremely difficult. What is certain, though, is that there are individuals who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs.

Liptak, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:44 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump’s  working lunch with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday turned acrimonious when the US leader insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, according to European officials briefed on the meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Trump, who would later  endorse a freeze in current battle lines  as part of a peace settlement, grew frustrated and raised his voice multiple times, the officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The episode was the latest chapter in the fraught relationship between the two men, and amounted to another shift in Trump’s approach to how the war will be settled. Last month, after meeting Zelensky in New York, Trump claimed Ukraine might be able to regain all its territory lost to Russia. But now Trump is preparing for another high-stakes meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, this time in Budapest.\n \n\n   \n  It was after a call with the Russian leader on the eve of the Zelensky meeting that Trump again insisted Kyiv must give up swaths of land for the conflict to end.\n \n\n   \n  Trump shrugged off the apparent reversal on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “I never said they would win it. I said they could win,” he said of Ukraine at the White House, where he was meeting the prime minister of Australia. “Anything could happen. You know, war is a very strange thing. A lot of bad things happen. A lot of good things happen.”\n \n\n   \n  He said he still believed Ukraine could win, but that he didn’t think it would.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky emerged from that meeting to brief European leaders on a call in which he sounded pessimistic about Trump’s position, the European officials said.\n \n\n   \n  A Ukrainian source separately called the White House meeting “tense,” but said there was “no shouting,” downplaying reports of a volatile encounter between the two leaders. Overall, the source called the meeting constructive, since Trump ultimately declared that a ceasefire be along the current frontline. Zelensky later endorsed the idea in remarks to reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Asked about the European characterization of the meeting, the White House pointed to comments Trump made Sunday on Air Force One. “We think that what they should do is just stop at the lines where they are, the battle lines,” he said. “The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this, we take that.’”\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, ending the Russia-Ukraine war is now a top priority after he brokered a truce between Israel and Hamas to end the conflict in Gaza. He emphasized the need to end the war quickly in Friday’s talks, the European officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In his phone call with Trump a day earlier, Putin proposed a plan where Ukraine would surrender the eastern Donbas region in exchange for some Russian-held parts of the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, the European official said.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal, which the officials characterized as a slightly less sweeping demand than what Putin raised during his August summit with Trump in Alaska, would still amount to a major loss of territory for Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Trump later arrived at the position of ending the war along the current battle lines.\n \n\n   \n  Trump on Sunday denied he asked Zelensky to concede the entire Donbas region, which Ukraine views as strategically important.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia,” he said on Air Force One. “They should stop right now at the battle lines. … Go home, stop killing people and be done.”\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, Trump told reporters he had asked Putin during their phone call to stop attacks on civilian areas but went on to talk about how many soldiers are dying.\n \n\n   \n  Several people familiar had previously told CNN that last week’s Trump-Zelensky meeting was tense, frank and, at times, “uncomfortable” with the two leaders split over the future of the war.\n \n\n   \n  Trump made clear to Zelensky in a “direct and honest” conversation that — for now — the Ukrainian leader would not receive the  long-range missiles that can reach far into Russia  that he was seeking. One US official said Trump was under the impression that Ukraine is seeking to escalate and prolong the conflict and is worried about potential losses during an upcoming harsh winter.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Olga Stefanishyna on Monday disputed that the meeting was “aggressive” or “negative,” saying that it was “a dialogue” on ending the war. She said Trump and Zelensky left their meeting Friday with “full clarity” on “next steps.”\n \n\n   \n  According to the European officials, Zelensky and his delegation came to the White House with maps showing current battle lines, hoping to convince the US president to maintain and expand American support. Trump seemed uninterested in the arguments, and forcefully insisted Ukraine agree to land concessions for the war to end, they said.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview taped last week, Trump said for the war to end, Putin was “going to take something, he’s won certain property.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has told those around him that his demand for a ceasefire along current battle lines was due to the “realities of where the conflict stands,” arguing there was too much devastation and too much killing, according to one US official.\n \n\n   \n  “Both sides need to make a deal,” another US   official said arguing the conditions are only going to get worse.\n \n\n   \n  Zelensky cast the meeting as a “pointed conversation” in a post to social media but said its outcome “can really help bring this war closer to an end.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional comments from President Donald Trump. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Kristen Holmes, Victoria Butenko and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/tylenol-fda-label-change","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"19:00:00-04:00","title":"Tylenol’s maker pushes back against possible label change linking pain reliever’s use in pregnancy to autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, is opposing a proposed FDA label change that would warn about a possible link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism or ADHD.

Other common pain or fever treatments like  ibuprofen  or  regular-dose aspirin  can increase the risk of serious complications when used during pregnancy.\n \n\n   \n   Untreated  pain or fever can be dangerous for the mother and the fetus, possibly leading to problems like miscarriage, birth defects or high blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n   Beginning the process  to change the safety label on acetaminophen products was just one action the Trump administration planned to take.\n \n\n   \n  US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the news conference last month that his agency would launch a public service campaign about the issue.\n \n\n   \n  The  FDA also sent a letter  to physicians saying that the choice to take Tylenol “still belongs with parents” but that use during pregnancy may cause an “increased risk of neurological conditions such as autism and ADHD in children.”\n \n\n   \n  However, the letter also noted that “a causal relationship has not been established” and that studies about a link are “contradictory.”\n \n\n   \n  The Informed Consent Action Network, an anti-vaccine nonprofit with close ties Kennedy,  said in a letter  dated the day of Trump’s news conference that it had filed a  citizen’s petition  with the FDA. Such filings are a way for individuals, industry or consumer groups to ask the agency to take action on a specific issue.\n \n\n   \n  The petition says that because of the “urgent public health implications,” the FDA should act quickly to add a more detailed warning to the labels of over-the-counter drug products that contain acetaminophen to spell out that “studies show that frequent use of this product during pregnancy may increase your child’s risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.”\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Kenvue asked the FDA to deny the petition, saying that suggested changes to the label are unsupported by scientific evidence “and would represent an unexplained departure from FDA’s longstanding position on acetaminophen during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  The company said it met with Kennedy in early September, after the HHS secretary reached out to say he believed there was a connection between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, and it told him there was no such link.\n \n\n   \n  An HHS spokesperson said Monday that the FDA doesn’t comment on product-specific matters.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA  website on acetaminophen  has not changed to reflect the Trump administration’s views. It says it was last updated in August and specifies, “to date, FDA has not found clear evidence that appropriate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy causes adverse pregnancy, birth, neurobehavioral, or developmental outcomes.”\n \n\n   \n  Acetaminophen has been studied for decades to find any problems it may cause in pregnancy,  according to the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists.   Not one reputable study has concluded that acetaminophen use in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children.\n \n\n   \n  That group points to a study  published  last year of more than 2 million children that found no significant associations between  acetaminophen use  during pregnancy and children’s risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability.\n \n\n   \n   Another study  published in August analyzed 46 studies on acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders. Six of the studies specifically examined acetaminophen use and autism. Overall, the analysis concluded that there was “strong evidence of an association” between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, but the authors were careful to say that the paper could only show an association, the research could not show that acetaminophen caused autism.\n \n\n   \n  “We recommend judicious acetaminophen use — lowest effective dose, shortest duration — under medical guidance, tailored to individual risk–benefit assessments, rather than a broad limitation,” the researchers wrote in that analysis.\n \n\n   \n  After the Trump news conference, medicine regulatory agencies for  the European Union  and  the United Kingdom  and  Health Canada  quickly issued statements confirming that taking the over-the-counter pain-reliever during pregnancy remains safe.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94389","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:45:23+00:00","title":"Government Announces New Immigration Policy with Human Rights Focus","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The government has announced a new immigration policy aimed at addressing rising migration flows while ensuring human rights protections.

Here's what that means across the country \n         By The NPR Network \n        \n           Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 5:04 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It's Day 22 of the federal government shutdown, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it. Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid this Friday, the first full paycheck they'll miss as a result of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but  the White House has tried to cast doubt on that. Meanwhile, President Trump has tied the shutdown to his overall goal of shrinking the size of the government, laying off workers en masse while it continues — and promising more — while specifically targeting what he calls \"Democrat programs.\"  Read the latest on a case brought by some fired federal workers to pause the latest wave of shutdown layoffs. As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know. Jump to state-specific impacts. Why did the federal government shut down?   A  partisan argument  over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some  24 million people  — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.   Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is  not true . Democrats in the Senate  refused to vote  for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP  spending and tax bill  that passed over the summer.  NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a  key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock . That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.  In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.  Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here.   Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as  a health care showdown . —  Selena Simmons-Duffin , NPR Will the military get paid on Oct. 29?    The Trump administration  earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members , according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck, but it only covered one pay cycle. That was on Oct. 15; troops get paid every other Wednesday.  Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills. Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown? The Trump administration has been following through on threats to   further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month.  Some workers are fighting back in court ; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees. Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order    What about WIC and SNAP benefits ? Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program was estimated to run out after about two weeks. But USDA has distributed money from the previous fiscal year,  helping at least some states  continue to fund the program. The White House has said it will  use tariff revenue  to keep WIC afloat, though has provided few details. Trump's budget proposal earlier this year had looked to cut WIC funding.  Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is funded through October.  That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance. USDA earlier this month told state agencies to hold off paying for November benefits for lack of sufficient funding, \"until further notice.\" —  Jennifer Ludden , NPR And what about school lunches? Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals. Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown. \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\" According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist.  —  Kadin Mills,  NPR USPS is 'open for business as usual' \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown,\" according to a  statement by USPS . The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual. IRS furloughs nearly half its staff A  contingency plan  from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees  were issued  reduction in force, or RIF, notices  on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9. The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.  —  Scott Horsley ,  Andrea Hsu  and  Stephen Fowler ,  NPR Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees  have been temporary furloughed , as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.  At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.  This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly  $15 billion  in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.  In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed  were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is  suing the Trump administration  for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages. —  Shannon Bond  and  Cory Turner , NPR The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's  Corrinne Hess  reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that  student financial aid programs will continue , despite the shutdown. National Parks are a mixed bag Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have  brought their operations to a halt . That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise  reports that the Smithsonian assured the public  that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure.  Animal cams  are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown. As  KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported , a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided. Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services. Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support   WBUR's Andrea Shea reports  that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.  Shea reports that  NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs  through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue Social Security,   VA  and other benefits will continue.  But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the  government shutdown  has left them  unable to carry out an important service for some recipients . As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These  official letters  act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.  In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. The report will come come out on Friday, nine days late.  Read more on  how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown  from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said. According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown. \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\"  Noem posted on X  on Thursday. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" – which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\" The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to a post earlier this week  from Noem , from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year. —  Ximena Bustillo , NPR If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job. Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages  disrupt flights across the country .

A \"slight increase\" in  sick leave at two facilities  on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos. Read more on  what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown  from NPR's Joel Rose. The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region. Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country: Alaska The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [ Alaska Public Media ] About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states.

2025 • 4:52 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina is poised to become the first swing state to draw new congressional districts amid a nationwide arms race between Republicans and Democrats to secure additional seats ahead of next year's midterm election. President Trump initiated the mid-decade battle to help the GOP keep control of the U.S. House. In North Carolina, Republican legislative leaders  announced last week  they wanted to redraw the map with the aim of winning 11 of the state's 14 congressional districts. The GOP currently controls 10 of the seats. To accomplish that, Republicans focused on the 1st Congressional District, in the northeastern corner of the state. The 1st is the state's only swing district and has been represented by Black lawmakers for decades, most recently two-term U.S. Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat. \"These maps are a political weapon\" The proposed map moves six coastal counties and some precincts in another county into the 1st Congressional District, making it more conservative. In return, four agriculture-oriented counties around Goldsboro, Kinston and Wilson are shifted into the 3rd District. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Opponents argue that the new map dilutes the voting power of Black residents in eastern North Carolina. \"These maps are a political weapon, and Black voters are the target,\" said Sen. Kandie Smith, who along with all 19 of her Democratic colleagues formally protested the new map Monday. The proportion of Black voters in the current 1st District is about 40%, higher than any other in the state. That would drop to 32% under the new map, while the proportion of Black voters in the 3rd District would only rise to 29%. Republicans have maintained they are drawing the new districts to help their political party. \"Republicans hold a razor-thin margin in the United States House of Representatives,\" state Sen. Ralph Hise, who drew the new map with help from staff, told a legislative committee on Monday. \"And if Democrats flip four seats in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take control of the House and torpedo President Trump's agenda.\" The GOP rationale is likely an attempt to get ahead of lawsuits, said Chris Cooper, director of Western Carolina University's Haire Institute for Public Policy. Both North Carolina courts and the U.S. Supreme Court have ruled in recent years that they will not overturn maps on the basis of partisan gerrymandering but could if a map represents a racial gerrymander. (The U.S. Supreme Court  may soon rule differently  on racial gerrymanders.) \"If [North Carolina Republicans] can say that partisanship part out loud, I think they probably think that puts them on even better, firmer grounds,\" Cooper said. More congressional maps than elections Redistricting has become a near-constant in North Carolina politics. Typically, redistricting only happens at the beginning of a decade, after new census results. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But lawsuits and court rulings have meant that the map now under consideration would be the state's seventh congressional map since 2016, and the fifth version this decade. That's more maps than elections. Unlike most of the other maps, the North Carolina General Assembly decided to draw this latest one. In most other cases, either state or federal courts directed it to draw new districts in response to claims of partisan or racial gerrymandering. The current congressional map follows a 2023 ruling by a new GOP majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court, which  reversed a previous decision  finding a map unconstitutional due to partisan gerrymandering. That 2023 ruling set the stage for the general assembly to do away with a map that had resulted in seven Republicans and seven Democrats in Congress, in favor of a 2024 map that made three additional seats safely Republican. Part of a national arms race The North Carolina state Senate has  approved  the new redistricting plan, with final passage expected by the Republican-led House. Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, can't veto redistricting proposals. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If enacted, the North Carolina map would become part of a larger congressional redistricting battle. At Trump's urging, Texas started the fight earlier this year, with GOP lawmakers there redrawing maps to shift five seats toward their party. California responded by putting a referendum on the state's ballot in November that, if passed, would shift five seats toward Democrats. Meanwhile, Republicans in Missouri redrew their districts to shift one seat toward the GOP, although there is  an effort underway  to secure enough signatures to require that voters approve the new map in a referendum. Republicans have their sights on other states, including Indiana and Kansas. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   The mid-decade redistricting battle between the two major political parties has now moved to the swing state of North Carolina. This is a battle President Trump is waging to help Republicans hold the U.S. House. And in North Carolina, GOP lawmakers are hoping to pick up one more congressional seat. The North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner is in Raleigh, and he joins us now with the latest. Hey, Adam. ADAM WAGNER, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: So give us a little primer. What's the plan in North Carolina? WAGNER: Sure. Republicans are targeting North Carolina's 1st Congressional District. That's represented by Don Davis, a moderate Democrat. It's also the only swing district in the state, and Davis has narrowly won it twice. The new map basically swaps a total of 10 counties between the 1st and the 3rd Districts, and if it goes into effect, Republicans would have a clear advantage in 11 of North Carolina's 14 congressional districts. KELLY: Eleven of the 14 seats - and I just called North Carolina a swing state. I mean, it basically is a swing state. That's pretty remarkable. WAGNER: It is, yeah. So this is a state that President Donald Trump has won three times, but at the same time, it elected Democratic governors all three times. And North Carolina's governor can't veto redistricting proposals. What's kind of striking about this particular one is how quickly it's moved. Republican leaders announced their plan last Monday, and it's moving through the legislature this week. KELLY: And Republican lawmakers, when you ask them what's the rationale, what do they tell you? WAGNER: They've been pretty clear. This is to help the GOP hold the House and to boost the Trump administration agenda. Here's Senate Republican leader Phil Berger answering questions on the Senate floor yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PHIL BERGER: The redrawing of District 1 was done based on a political calculation and a determination that that district could be redrawn for a Republican to have a better chance of winning. That's the only reason it was done. WAGNER: There's some thought that insisting that this gerrymandering is being done for partisan reasons is an attempt to get ahead of the lawsuits that everybody's expecting. Both state and federal courts have said that they can't overturn maps because they offer one party or the other an unfair advantage. KELLY: And what do Democrats say to all this, Adam? WAGNER: So all 20 Democratic members of the North Carolina Senate have formally protested the bill. And during debate yesterday, they argued that this new map splits up a bloc of Black voters in rural North Carolina. Here's Senator Kandie Smith. She represents the area around Greenville, North Carolina. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KANDIE SMITH: These maps are a political weapon, and Black voters are the target. This bill and these maps are designed to fracture historic coalitions, diminish voter turnout and protect incumbents at the expense of the will of the people. WAGNER: The racial elements of this new map will likely be the crux of any lawsuit against it. Republicans are insisting that they didn't consider racial data when they were drawing this map. But the 1st District has elected Black lawmakers to Congress for 32 consecutive years, and the new map moves a significant proportion of Black voters out of that district. So right now, about 40% of voters in the 1st are Black. That's the highest of any congressional district in the state. And this new map would drop that to about 32%. KELLY: And just by way of backdrop, we're talking about the new map, but one thing that is striking is how many new maps North Carolina has had - how often the map has changed there over the last decade, right? WAGNER: Yeah. Redistricting is basically a near constant in North Carolina politics. Because of lawsuits and court orders, the map that's now under consideration would be the state's seventh congressional map since 2016... KELLY: Wow. WAGNER: ...And the fifth version this decade. And just to be clear, that's more maps than there have been elections. What's different here is that typically, state or federal courts have told the general assembly to draw a new map because of claims of partisan or racial gerrymandering. But lawmakers are doing it this time on their own - they say to help Trump. KELLY: That is North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner. Thank you, Adam. WAGNER: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5577961","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"How Digital Platforms Are Reshaping Public Discourse in Developing Nations","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The increasing role of digital platforms in developing nations has led to a transformation in how information is accessed and shared.

But activism nearly cost Yousafzai her life; in 2012, when she was 15, she was shot in the head while riding home on a school bus.  Yousafzai survived the assassination attempt, but her life changed completely. Suddenly she was a symbol of resistance to the Taliban — praised, politicized and picked apart. When she was 17, she became the youngest person ever awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize , an honor that weighed on her as she went off to Oxford University a few years later.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I always have felt that now I need to live up to the expectation [of the Nobel],\" Yousafzai says. \"It was given for the work I had done, but it was also given for the work that is ahead of us. ... I have to work for the rest of my life to prove that it was well deserved.\" Prior to college, Yousafzai had never been away from her parents or lived on her own. At Oxford, she struggled to know who she was as a person. \"This was the first time I allowed myself to be more of myself, to really just test it. ... Am I funny? Am I not? What do I enjoy?\" she recalls.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Yousafzai chronicled her childhood in the 2013 memoir,  I Am Malala .  In the new memoir,  Finding My Way , she writes about her life at Oxford and beyond. It's the story of a college student who, like many others before her, tries marijuana, fails exams and falls in love for the first time. But it also reveals Yousafzai's efforts to deal with the trauma of the attack she had survived years earlier. \"When you face violence, harm and trauma yourself, you understand how terrible and horrible it is,\" she says. \"Whether it's girls being banned from school in Afghanistan, or girls' schools being bombed in Gaza, or children being forced into labor, or girls being married off. … I just hope that we can create a world without any war and terror and harm for children.\" Yousafzai's foundation, Malala Fund, continues to advocate for girls' education worldwide. Interview highlights On illicitly climbing onto a rooftop in college That moment just felt surreal. I was so scared that I might be kicked out of college for this. ... I was terrified that being an advocate for education and then getting in trouble and getting kicked out. … For me it was wanting to disobey rules. I thought I had to live up to expectations and be a certain way. I could never get in trouble. I thought if this is something that puts me in the \"cool kids\" category or the \"rebellious kids\" category, I wanted to give it a try. I wanted these college years to be that experience that I otherwise would never come across. On having a bad reaction to smoking marijuana, which triggered PTSD  The bong incident just turned out to be an experience not that I had imagined. I had heard cool things about it and of course it's different for everybody. In my case, there was this unaddressed trauma. The memory, the visuals, everything had been there. My brain had tried to suppress them because it's a moment of fear that you do not want to see again .  When the bong incident happened, my body froze and I was reliving the Taliban attack. I could see the gunman. I thought this is happening all over again. I often say that I received my surgeries and I recovered so quickly from the Taliban attack, but when this happened I realized maybe I actually had not fully recovered. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On struggling with anxiety and depression, seven years after the attack  I just felt so disappointed with myself that somebody who faced a Taliban gunman was somehow now scared of these small things. It was all trivial stuff that made no sense to me. I thought that I had lost my courage, that I was not brave enough. … I felt like an imposter. And then one of my friends suggested that I see a therapist. On why she was initially against marriage  Growing up I had seen many girls lose the opportunity to complete their education and their dreams to become a doctor or engineer because they were married off. Marriage, that was the last thing I wanted to think about. I did not want to get married. It was not a cool thing. If you wanted to have a future as a girl you wanted to keep yourself away from marriage for as long as you could. … It just meant more compromises for women that you had to readjust to the husband's family and you had to pray that the husband turns out to be  a nice, respectful person. On reading feminist authors before deciding to get married  When I saw Asser I immediately fell in love with him. I knew that I wanted to be with him. So I felt like I was sort of holding his hand … while I was looking on the other side trying to figure out what is marriage and all these things about and am I ready or not? I knew that we had to be married because in our culture for two people to be together you have to be married. But then marriage just felt like a very heavy topic for me. I even went to read some books. … I was like, please Virginia Woolf, help me, bell hooks, can you share a few words of wisdom? I was looking for an answer, like, just someone tell me yes or no. What I realized in the process was it is about understanding the history of these things. It's about the culture, the context, but more importantly then, it's about the two people who decide to be together. What is their mutual understanding? And I realize that Asser was the right person.

College is often a time to figure out who we are, to fall in love for the first time, to experiment, to fail, to question what we believe. But for Malala Yousafzai, it was different. She spent her college years experiencing all of these things under scrutiny and 24-hour security. When she was 15, Malala survived an assassination attempt by the Taliban - a gunshot to the head while riding home on a school bus. But long before that, she'd been standing up to them, demanding the right for girls to go to school in her hometown of Mingora in Pakistan's Swat Valley. The Taliban had taken control, closing schools, banning women from public life and brutally punishing anyone who resisted. MOSLEY: After the shooting, Malala's life changed overnight. She became a symbol of resistance, praised, politicized and picked apart. While the world saw an unshakable young woman with a message, Malala was also a teenager undergoing surgeries to reconstruct what was destroyed by the Taliban, experiencing post-traumatic stress and navigating others' expectations of who she should be. Her new memoir, \"Finding My Way,\" reveals the person beyond the symbol. It's the story of a young Malala learning the bounds of what it means to be a free woman - trying on jeans for the first time, falling in love, failing exams and confronting the trauma of a shooting that for a long time she had no memory of. Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for her efforts to combat the suppression of children and advocate for their education. She's written several books, including \"I Am Malala\" and \"We Are Displaced: True Stories Of Refugee Lives.\" The 2015 documentary \"He Named Me Malala\" chronicles her family's activism. Malala Yousafzai, welcome to FRESH AIR. MALALA YOUSAFZAI: Thank you. MOSLEY: This memoir, in a way - in many ways, picks up where your first memoir left off. Just to, like, put ourselves in this place - I mean, such a dichotomy here because - in how remarkable this is because here you are entering college. I mean, you won the Nobel Prize at 17. So it's an unbelievable honor that I know you take great pride in, but it also comes, as you say, with this tremendous responsibility to always live up to all that you had endured and what you've accomplished, what it represents. Did that expectation also feel like a cage in a way? Like, you wanted to come into college almost as an anonymous person. YOUSAFZAI: Going to Oxford was my childhood dream, and I wanted to be myself, make as many friends. But I think with these titles and recognitions like the Nobel Peace Prize, I thought I had to act differently. And because, you know, a lot of the people who receive these titles are much older in their life, and they - you know, they're usually in their 50s, 60s. They have, you know, like, a family life already established. I received the Nobel Peace Prize when I was in my chemistry class. (LAUGHTER) YOUSAFZAI: So, you know, I was still a school student. So I see it as a big responsibility, and I always have felt that now I need to live up to the expectation. You know, it was given for the work I had done, but it was also given for the work that is ahead of us. So for me now, like, I have to work for the rest of my life to prove that it was well deserved. And for me, that is just, you know, seeing this dream of girls' education becoming a reality in every part of the world. But at the same time, I thought, OK, like, but do you have to change as a person? Like, are you supposed to live a certain way? In college, though, this was the first time that I allowed myself to be more of myself, to really just test it. And to be honest, I didn't even know who I was. Am I funny? Am I not? What do I enjoy? Like, I didn't know any of that. I have never seen boys my age. I have never, you know, been away from my parents or lived on my own. I can decide. I can go to a Diwali party. I can stay up late to 3 a.m., and, you know, like, my parents would not know about this. And, you know, I could sign up for rowing, or I could go to the aerobics '80s-themed party, any of that. We could do all of that. I was somehow feeling that I was reliving all the missed years of my childhood because of the activism that I had to take from such a young age that I missed. MOSLEY: Was there a particular moment when you realized - you're at college, when you realize, wait a minute, I could do whatever I want, you know? YOUSAFZAI: (Laughter) You know, I think about the roof climbing experience oftentime (ph) because that was offered to me by a stranger at college, who told me that there is this crazy thing that only cool college students do. And he offered it to me, and I said, OK, I'll see you at midnight. I told my security, like, I'm done for the day, and you guys can go to sleep. So the security were like... MOSLEY: And I just want to note... YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: ...For folks that you had 24-hour security because... YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: ...During this time period, in the years after you were shot, you received lots of threats against your life. That's why... YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: ...You had 24-hour security - in addition, in the same way that many heads of state have security in the United States. YOUSAFZAI: Yeah. I mean, it was awkward to have, like, guys following you. But at the same time, it just helped me have the opportunity to experience these things and not be worried about safety and security. So, yeah - but for that night, the roof climbing night, I told them, I think I'm going to be safe on my own. I said, you guys can go to bed. So it's midnight. I follow the stranger. We go up to the fourth floor of the building, and there's a small window in this room. And he tells me that we need to sneak out through the window and then walk by this narrow path on the roof. One misstep and you could fall. And I am just nodding, and I follow him, and it was a really scary way making up - making it up to the rooftop. And on the rooftop, there's this bell tower, like, the clock tower. And that moment just felt surreal. I just thought I had, like, conquered something. I was breathing in the fresh air, and I was looking down, just seeing some students still up at night or the light was still on in some rooms. And I was thinking maybe they are still trying to finish their essay or just feeling a moment of victory. And I was so scared that I might be, like, kicked out of college for this and this happening so soon. So I was terrified that - being an advocate for education and then getting in trouble and being kicked out. MOSLEY: What do you think it was about that that, like, really set your heart on this independent journey? Like, that - it's almost like another near-death experience. YOUSAFZAI: I think for me, it was just wanting to disobey rules. I thought I had to live up to expectations and be a certain way. I could never get in trouble. I thought if this is something that puts me in the cool kids category or the rebellious kids category, I want to give it a try. Like, I wanted these college years to be that experience that I otherwise would never come across. MOSLEY: You really did experience a lot of things in college that many students do, including getting high. You - your spring year of college, first year at Oxford, you're with friends. You're hanging out, as college kids do, and you're offered marijuana, specifically a bong. And you join in with your friends, and as the hours tick on, you have a reaction. You can't walk. Everything goes black. And this, you realize, is a very familiar place. Could I have you read what you wrote about it in the book? YOUSAFZAI: (Reading) Suddenly, I was 15 years old again, lying on my back under a white sheet, a tube running down my throat, eyes closed. YOUSAFZAI: For seven days, as doctors tended to my wounds, I was in a coma. From the outside, I looked to be in a deep sleep. But inside, my mind was awake, and it played a slideshow of recent events - my school bus. A man with a gun. Blood everywhere. My body carried through crowded streets. Strangers hunched over me, yelling things I didn't understand. My father rushing toward the stretcher to take my hand. As the images repeated in the same sequence over and over, I raged against them, trying to beat them away. This isn't true, I told myself. The real Malala is the one trapped in this nightmare, not the girl on the stretcher. Just wake up, and it will stop. Wake up. I had tried to force my eyes open, to see something other than this carousel of horrors. Inside, I screamed. Outside, my lips stayed closed, motionless. I was awake and buried alive in the coffin of my body. MOSLEY: It's hard to read. YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: It's hard to read it. Yeah. YOUSAFZAI: The bong incident, you know, just turned out to be an experience not that I had imagined. I had heard cool things about it. And of course, you know, like, it's different for everybody. But I think in my case, there was this unaddressed trauma. The memory, the visuals - everything, I think, had been there. My brain had tried to suppress them because, you know, it's just a moment of fear that you do not want to see again. And when the bong incident happened, my body froze, and I was reliving the Taliban attack. I - you know, I could see the gunman. I thought, this is happening all over again. I often, you know, say that I received my surgeries, and I recovered so quickly from the Taliban attack. But just when this happened, I realized that maybe I actually had not fully recovered. There was this unaddressed part of my recovery, which was mental health, which was the trauma that we did not actually count in the treatment process. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Malala Yousafzai. She's the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and co-founder of Malala Fund, which advocates for girls' education worldwide. Her new memoir is \"Finding My Way.\" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG, \"PEACOCKS\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, I'm talking to Malala Yousafzai about her new memoir, \"Finding My Way,\" which chronicles her coming-of-age after surviving a Taliban assassination attempt at age 15 and navigating life as a global icon while trying to live as a normal young woman. The book reveals her private struggles with mental health, her complicated relationship with fame and her evolution as an activist. When we left off, we were talking about the experience she had in college after getting high on marijuana. There are some dark moments that you experienced. After that night, you started to experience these intrusive thoughts that didn't stop, even after the high went away. You described being afraid of a kitchen knife - not that someone would hurt you with it, but that you might hurt yourself. And I just kept thinking as I was reading this, for someone the world has called the bravest girl on Earth, what was it like to suddenly be frightened of your own hands, of your own self? YOUSAFZAI: It was frightening. And even now, like, when I think about it, it's just - it's a really frightening place to be in. You feel trapped. You do not see a way out. That's exactly what I was going through in those days. I - you know, I would be - I was shaking. I was shaking every minute. I could not look at harmful objects. I could not look at a knife. I could not watch news that said anything about murdering people or - you know, or somebody being killed or shot or wounded. I just felt so disappointed with myself that somebody who actually faced a Taliban gunman was somehow now scared of these small things. It was all just, like, trivial stuff that - it made no sense to me. And I thought that I had lost my courage, that I was not brave enough - the titles I had received my whole life, and I thought I had to live up to them. I felt like an imposter. And then one of my friends suggested that I see a therapist. She said that a lot of students actually get therapy in college - that she herself is seeing a therapist. And I was a bit skeptical. I also thought a therapist would not understand what I'm going through. MOSLEY: Right, because your... YOUSAFZAI: But she said it... MOSLEY: Yeah. YOUSAFZAI: ...I should give it a try. Yeah. MOSLEY: Because your parents didn't believe in therapy. I think your father said only a completely nonfunctioning person needs a therapist. So there was a lot that you needed to get over to actually seek one. YOUSAFZAI: Yes. You know, growing up in Pakistan, we had not heard about therapy and mental health that now we are hearing, where it's been accepted as a normal conversation. People are opening up about it. It - you know, and we don't even have that much support around mental health. MOSLEY: Has it helped you? YOUSAFZAI: Therapy has definitely helped me. I remember the first session, where I told my therapist all my problems - past, you know, present, potential future ones. And I said, OK. Like, now give me some medication. How do we fix it? And she took a deep breath, and she said, you know, this is not how therapy works. And she told me that I had PTSD and anxiety. And this was, like, the first time that I actually heard the word PTSD. You know, people - I had come - like, I had heard it in a few different contexts. But I thought, you know, OK, I faced a trauma, but I think I don't have PTSD. But seven years later, the PTSD appeared. And, you know, I learned something - that when people - they talk about, like, a traumatic experience, it's not necessary that PTSD or the mental health issues appear immediately. It - like, they could appear seven years later, 10 years later. Like, you never know. And that happened in my case. MOSLEY: Let's talk about love. You write that you'd convinced yourself you'd never date, you'd never marry, that you'd be like a - quote, \"like a nun, but Muslim.\" Once you got past yourself and you and your now husband, Asser, fell madly in love, which - folks can read all about it in this book. But you were resistant to marriage for a long time. Why were you against marriage? YOUSAFZAI: I mean, growing up, I had seen many girls lose the opportunity to complete their education and, you know, just their dreams to become a doctor, engineer because they were married off. So like, marriage, that was like the last thing I wanted to think about. I did not want to get married. It was not a cool thing. If you wanted to have a future as a girl, you wanted to keep yourself away from marriage for as long as you could, because even later in your life, it just meant, like, more compromises for women, that, you know, you had to readjust to the husband's family. And you just had to pray that the husband turns out to be a nice, respectful person. I remember when I was thinking about marriage for myself, I put myself in my mom's shoes for the first time. I had never thought about anything from her perspective before. And, you know, I would always admire my dad. And I wanted to, like, follow his footsteps and all of that. But this was the first time I wondered what life would have been like for my mom. When she decided to marry, how did she trust this guy she had not even known and decided to, like, move into his house and be married off and restart a new life? And I asked my mom, actually, what were her dreams when she was a kid? And she said, you know, I just wanted to find a husband who would be respectful. And I can go into the city and, like, have nice food and, like, drive around in a car. And I realized that my mom didn't even have a dream for herself, that marriage was a way for her to find some sort of freedom, a little more freedom than she had right now. So it was sort of a fascinating time. When I saw Asser, I immediately fell in love with him. I knew that I wanted to be with him. And I knew that we had to be married because in our culture, for two people to be together, you have to be married. But then marriage just felt like a very heavy topic for me. I even went to read some books. MOSLEY: Yes. You read a lot of books about feminism and marriage, yeah. YOUSAFZAI: Yes. I was like, please, Virginia Woolf, help me. (LAUGHTER) YOUSAFZAI: bell hooks, can you share a few words of wisdom? MOSLEY: Well, you made this list of questions for him before... YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: ...You marry him. I mean, you asked him about fidelity, about whether he'd control what you wear, whether he'd take another wife. These were real considerations that you had to know. You were trying to extract guarantees, though, and he tried to give them to you, but then he said something to you that was really kind of profound. He said there are no magic words to take away all of your doubts. Why was that the right answer for you to kind of come to the realization that this was the step that you should take. YOUSAFZAI: Yeah, I mean, like, poor Asser. I was asking him every possible question about every horrible things that I had seen or heard about. Like, you know, a husband doesn't allow his wife to work. A husband has a problem that the wife earns more money. The husband is of this view that he can marry, like, more wives or things like that. And he is, you know, OK with, like, telling the wife off or, like, that she has to live by his rules and all of that. So I said, who knows? Like, I know he's a nice guy, but who knows? I think it's better to get a verbal (laughter) confirmation. It's just the fear, the fear that we all carry. I knew that I was a very independent person. I did not need a husband, like, literally. I did not need him. But I wanted him. And I wanted to make sure that this was, like, worth my time. But, you know, when he said that, you know, no answers would clear all my doubts, I think he was right. It was true, because even when he was answering, I still had that little hesitation in my heart. But what I really loved was just the way he was answering those questions. He was very patient. He gave me time. You know, this marriage conversation started, like, a while ago. But he allowed me to go and do my research and talk to people and just, like, take my time off. MOSLEY: My guest today is Malala Yousafzai. We're talking about her new memoir, \"Finding My Way.\" We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Tonya Mosley, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO'S \"GREAT DAY\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. And today, I'm talking with Malala Yousafzai about her new memoir, \"Finding My Way.\" She's the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate and co-founder of Malala Fund, which advocates for girls' education worldwide. In her new memoir, Malala writes about her college years at Oxford, her struggles with PTSD and panic attacks and her decision to marry despite her reservations about the institution of marriage. Malala, I want to talk to you a bit about your parents. Many of us know your father's story. He's an educator who raised you to speak up. Your mother is quieter in the public narrative. And in this book, though, she's complex. She once saved a girl from forced marriage. So she did have that within her, this understanding that whatever power she had, she also was - in a way, would you call her a silent activist, not as vocal and open as your father but still believing nonetheless? YOUSAFZAI: My mom is more an action-driven person. She, you know, doesn't care about, you know, like, what we say. But she - for her, it's more about the actions we take. My mom has helped so many women and girls. I - you know, some stories, like, I saw myself. I remember this girl in Pakistan, when we were living there, who was raped, and she became pregnant. And my mom saved her life. My mom saved her life. She took her for an abortion. And I - at the time, I did not understand any of that. But, like, now, when I reflect on it, I think, you know, my mom took such a brave step that it's - you know, if I ask her about her opinions on certain things, like, she may not give us - she - like, she may not give an answer that truly reflects her actions. But I think, you know, she - for her, it is about the safety and the protection of girls and how - you know, how we can help them and protect them from the harm and the - that they face. MOSLEY: Both of them, both of your parents, have been fiercely brave. But you also describe them as - what will people think? - people. And I found that to be such an interesting way to describe it. I think a lot of people can connect to that. How do you hold both of those truths about your parents, being fiercely brave but also very concerned with the opinions of others? YOUSAFZAI: My mom had a very different childhood than mine. She never went to school. Her female friends never went to school. It was actually normal and expected for a girl not to be educated. The best that she dreamed for herself was to be married into a family where the husband is a bit kind and just lets her have her favorite food or just takes her to one of her, like, favorite places to visit. That's all that she hoped for, and that it doesn't turn out to be a horrible, abusive kind of in-laws family or a husband. And, you know, when I think about it, I'm like, you know, like, my mom's journey was not easy. And she always says that she's so lucky that she found my dad because he is, you know, already known globally for his advocacy, feminism, for standing up for women's rights and, more importantly, for letting his daughter speak. I always tell people that there's nothing unique in my story of activism from Swat Valley. The only thing that's unique or different is that my father did not stop me. If more men are brave enough to allow the girls to do what they want or to not stop them, then we will hear different stories. We will hear more women and girls get the opportunities that they deserve. I know both of them are very kind and caring parents. But they are not just thinking as parents, but I think they're also thinking as representatives of the bigger community in Pakistan or relatives. And sometimes I feel like there are just too many voices that are speaking when they are speaking. And it affects everything - like, even a decision like what I was packing for college. My mom was packing all the traditional Pakistani clothes for me. I just wanted to wear jeans and gray jumpers or sweaters, and I did not want to stand out at all. So I remember packing all of these, like, more normal college clothes. I remember going on Google and looking up, Selena Gomez casual 2017... (LAUGHTER) YOUSAFZAI: Because I was like, you know, what is, like, a cool outfit, a casual outfit that everybody's wearing? MOSLEY: There's this moment in college when you wore jeans to rowing practice. YOUSAFZAI: Yes. MOSLEY: And a picture was taken of you wearing these jeans. Pakistani media went into an uproar. Your father wanted you to issue a clarification. And I'll just say - there's something almost comical in the way that you write about that. What did he say to you? What did he want you to say? YOUSAFZAI: You know, both my mom and dad were really upset when they saw the whole backlash in Pakistan. I remember, like, on phone with both Mom and my dad and just being so mad at them because I said, like, I am here at college, not for some pilgrimage or some, like, religious ceremony. This is my college life, and I want to be like every other student. What am I even going to say in a clarification statement? Like, apologies - I'm not going to wear jeans tomorrow? Or, OK, let me defend jeans and say, you know, there are, like, Muslim people who wear jeans. There's no fixed dress code for Muslims. Or, you know, like, it's - I was like, this is going to be a whole - another debate. Can women and girls just wear what they want? So my dad, in the end, agreed. My mom was still arguing with me, but in the end, she sort of accepted it. But I told them - I said, you know, the - you just never know. Jeans was, like, the last thing that I was worried about. To be honest, I was more worried about people taking photos if I were seen, like, with my friends at a party where we were maybe, like, dancing together. I thought, like, all of these things could be taken out of context. I was super aware of that. But when it happened with jeans, I was like, OK. You know what? I'm I'm just going to go for everything now because, like, people could criticize anything. Like, people could even criticize you for your existence. Where do you draw the line? MOSLEY: Let's take a short break, Malala. If you're just joining us, my guest is Malala Yousafzai. She's the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate and co-founder of Malala Fund, which advocates for girls' education worldwide. Her new memoir is \"Finding My Way.\" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF METALLICA SONG, \"... AND JUSTICE FOR ALL\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, I'm talking to Malala Yousafzai about her new memoir, \"Finding My Way,\" which chronicles Her coming of age after surviving a Taliban assassination attempt at age 15 and navigating life as a global icon while trying to live as a normal young woman. The book reveals her private struggles with mental health, her complicated relationship with fame and her evolution as an activist. The only panic attacks you still experience, you wrote in the book, are about Afghanistan. Is that still true? YOUSAFZAI: Yes. And I remember when I was in South Africa, I was giving a speech at the Nelson Mandela lecture. And I wanted to support the Afghan women's campaign of gender apartheid. So they're calling leaders to recognize what's happening in the country as a gender apartheid because it is actually systemic oppression. And they want it to, like, be considered as an international crime, and the Taliban should be held accountable for it. So I gave my speech. I did my interviews, you know, we had conversation with South African female activists and allies. And everything went really well. And then on the last night, like in the middle of my sleep, I just suddenly woke up. And I was shaking and sweating. And I had, like, this terrible panic attack where I thought, you know, I could die. I was sort of screaming. And, yeah, it was terrifying. But this time, my husband was with me. And he was holding my hand. And he helped me and supported me. So it was just a reminder that the fear is there. And the fear is for what other Afghan women and girls are experiencing right now. It is terrifying. It is truly terrifying. MOSLEY: And yet at the same time, when you're scrolling on your phone, you make yourself stop to watch the videos of Afghan women being beaten and assaulted. And so, in many ways, you're choosing to retraumatize yourself. Why is it important to be a witness? YOUSAFZAI: You know, I have lived through those experiences. I have seen them. And when we were going through the Taliban's brutal time in our hometown in Swat Valley in the north of Pakistan, we wanted the world to see it because this is a reality that women are actually living. These are not things that, you know, sort of have happened in the past and they have stopped. No, like, these terrible things are happening each and every day. Only a few stories actually make it to social media. So when we see something horrible happening to others, I think even just stopping for a moment and just seeing it, witnessing it so that they know that, you know, that you saw and you were there with them and that you feel anger, you feel the frustration. So I think even when we share emotions, it is a message of solidarity. But, you know, I want Afghan women to know that they're not alone. I think they need more support. And that's the work that I'm supporting through Malala Fund. I'm supporting Afghan activists in the country, outside the country. And I hope that things change for them. MOSLEY: I want to ask you about the United States. Having observed our political landscape, maybe what has surprised you most about the state of women's rights here in the United States? YOUSAFZAI: I think women's rights are a very fragile conversation in many parts of the world, including the United States. And in moments like these, I think women and girls and advocates of women's rights should take a moment to reflect on, you know, how much progress we have actually achieved. I know people often ask that, you know, are we shocked to see these setbacks? And I say, yes, I am shocked to see the setbacks everywhere, most importantly in Afghanistan because, like, imagine girls' education being banned. Like, that's a reality girls in Afghanistan have to live under. Or women being banned from work, that's a reality women have to live under. So it's also a reminder that the activism that we're doing for women's rights is more important than ever because of how fragile these accomplishments have been that they're taken away from us the next moment. So we need to do more to protect women's rights and, like, systematically protect them. So one of the campaigns that Afghan women are leading is to recognize what's happening in Afghanistan as a gender apartheid and to make gender apartheid a part of the crime against humanity treaty. And I know it sounds like too much, too many jargons. But what this basically means is that, you know, currently, we do not have anything in the international law that can recognize the level of systemic oppression that the Taliban imposed. Like, the scale of it is just so big and so intense that they're, like, getting away with it. So if it becomes an international crime, then countries are obliged to react. Countries should not be normalizing relationships with them. And it just helps us have a better accountability system. MOSLEY: The challenge is - you know, I think about the United States' role in this. I know the Trump administration's cuts to international aid, and the reinstatement of policies like this expanded global gag rule, it directly impacts women's access to education and health care worldwide. And I was wondering, given your work, have you seen U.S. policy changes impact girls and women in countries where you work? YOUSAFZAI: Yes. So a lot of the activists that Malala Fund supports also receive grants from USAID. And yes, because of the cuts, their organizations were affected, including one organization in Afghanistan as well. And, you know, for an organization like Malala Fund, so we don't receive government grants. But we knew that these activists, who are working in these important, tough areas of the countries where girls need help with education, need our support more than ever. So we are helping them get, like, fundraising in other ways, and we are also providing them with the funding that they need. So, yes, it's reaching to the work for girls' education. It has affected that. MOSLEY: There's this thing that this sociologist, Tressie McMillan Cottom, says - that freedom, she feels, is a responsibility. Her belief is that the more responsible she is to others, the freer she is. And I feel like this is what I'm hearing from you in a way. I was wondering, does that idea resonate with you? YOUSAFZAI: You know, I don't necessarily think about it in the sense of freedom, but I think about it as a purpose of life. I just reflect on the time when I could not be in school. I was only 11 years old, and the Taliban had banned girls from learning. It has been my life's mission since then that no other girl faces that. I remember recovering from the Taliban bullet and processing this moment that somebody could, like, hurt a child. And since then, it has now become my life's goal that no other child takes a bullet. No other child is punishing - no other child is punished for daring to be in school. So when you face violence, harm and trauma yourself, you understand how terrible and horrible it is that you can no longer see it even happening to anybody else. You know, people often ask me, like, how I felt. I'm like, you know, yes, you know, it was all horrible, but I just cannot see it happening to anyone right now, whether it's girls being banned from school in Afghanistan or girls - schools being bombed in Gaza or children being forced into labor or girls being married off, and, you know, they have to, like, live under these constant wars and violence, all of these things. Like, it's just scary. It's - but I just hope that we can create a world without any war and terror and harm for children, where they can have a childhood of joy and learning, and they can have a safe life.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:13 PM EDT, Mon October 20, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Monday will allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in Portland — an important legal victory in a showdown over presidential power that’s happening on multiple fronts.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling overturns one of two lower court decisions to block the deployment as the appeal process plays out, but because the second decision is still in force, the troops can’t immediately be deployed.\n \n\n   \n  The three-judge panel weighed in on a temporary restraining order issued by US District Judge Karin Immergut, who last week  ruled to extend  two temporary restraining orders barring the deployment of federal troops to Portland.\n \n\n   \n  In light of the appellate court’s ruling, the Trump administration is asking that Judge Immergut’s second order be thrown out or paused, arguing in a Monday evening filing that both lower court orders relied on the same legal reasoning.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s success in Oregon comes days after he urged the Supreme Court to allow him to  deploy the National Guard in Chicago  in an emergency appeal of a lower court order that the administration said “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  Even if Trump exaggerates the severity of Portland’s protests on social media, “this does not change that other facts provide a colorable basis to support the statutory requirements,” the majority said in the ruling.\n \n\n   \n  Two Trump-appointed judges, Ryan D. Nelson and Bridget S. Bade, sided with the administration’s appeal while a third, former President Bill Clinton appointee Judge Susan P. Graber, dissented, saying, “Today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions.”\n \n\n   \n  The majority’s ruling, from the White House’s point of view, proves the lower court’s decision was incorrect, according to Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  “As we have always maintained, President Trump is exercising his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel following violent riots that local leaders have refused to address,” Jackson said.\n \n\n   \n  The president has cited  protests outside  Portland’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the call-ups of troops in the deep blue city.   \n \n\n   \n  “Today’s ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a  statement  Monday. “We are on a dangerous path in America.”\n \n\n   \n  Rayfield asked the Ninth Circuit to “act swiftly” and throw out the majority’s ruling through an en banc review in which a larger panel of 11 appellate judges would reconsider the case.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a Ninth Circuit judge Monday afternoon asked the court to vote on whether the case should be reheard en banc. ﻿While such a request is not unusual, it’s more common for either plaintiffs or defendants to request such a rehearing.\n \n\n   \n  The state plans to file its own petition for an en banc review, a spokeswoman for the Rayfield’s office said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Attorneys for the state and the Trump administration have until midnight on Wednesday, October 22, to make their case for or against an en banc review.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I’m very troubled’\n \n\n   \n  As the legal battle in Oregon wages on, hundreds of National Guard troops are in a holding pattern far from home, Gov. Tina Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek said in a  virtual press conference  Monday. “These citizen soldiers have been pulled away from their families and their jobs for weeks to carry out some kind of mission in Oregon.”\n \n\n   \n  Kotek echoed the sentiments in Judge Graber’s dissent and asked that the Ninth Circuit review the case again given the seriousness of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it was a really important development that the one judge in the 2-1 ruling was immediately calling on their on her colleagues, to vacate this order,” Kotek said.\n \n\n   \n  If the second temporary restraining order is revoked, Kotek added, it is unclear where troops would be deployed or how many would federalized, citing a lack of communication from the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Kotek, along with other leaders in Oregon, has  emphatically disputed  the president’s characterizations of the city as “war-ravaged” and uncontrollably violent, arguing in court the situation on the ground in Portland is nowhere as extreme as federal officials portray it to be.\n \n\n   \n  Protests in Oregon’s biggest city over White House immigration policies started in June, with a declared  riot  and  arson  arrests in mid-summer. The scene was  largely calm  until Trump  declared  in late September he was sending 200 Oregon National Guard troops to the city.\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter sent Friday  to the Defense Department Office of Inspector General, a group of senators, including those from Oregon, asked for an inquiry into recent deployments of National Guard troops across the country.\n \n\n   \n  The senators argued that deployments were “fundamentally un-Constitutional, dangerous for American civil rights” and risk “straining military readiness and resources,” according to the letter.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently request that you initiate an inquiry into the cumulative effects of these domestic deployments of U.S. active-duty troops and the National Guard—over the objections of state and local officials—on military readiness, resources, personnel, and our military as an institution,” the senators requested.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling comes as   President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to send the National Guard to San Francisco as his administration continues an effort to crackdown on a growing list of cities it claims to be ridden with crime.\n \n\n   \n  “San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago it went wrong, it went woke,” Trump said during an interview with Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to San Francisco and we’re going to make it great.”\n \n\n   \n  “Nobody wants you here,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a  social media post  in response to Trump’s comments. “You will ruin one of America’s greatest cities.”\n \n\n   \n  The president told Bartiromo the cities he feels are in need of troop deployment are almost exclusively “Democrat-run,” describing them as “unsafe” and “a disaster.” Trump also claimed he could, at any moment, invoke the  Insurrection Act  – a seldom-used law that allows the president to deploy military forces in the US in certain limited situations.\n \n\n   \n  The mobilization of National Guard troops to cities like Chicago; Memphis, Tennessee; and Portland, Oregon, has been met with fierce backlash from residents as well as local and state leaders – including some who have gone so far as to sue the administration.\n \n\n   \n  Federal deployments have also sparked pop-up protests in these cities and helped fuel a second  “No Kings” rally  over the weekend, where millions took part in more than 2,700 events across the country to protest the Trump administration.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s the latest on Trump’s efforts to federalize troops in several US cities:\n \n\n   \n    San Francisco\n \n\n   \n  Trump toyed with the idea of deploying federal troops to the Bay Area last week when he told FBI Director Kash Patel that San Francisco was among the “great cities that can be fixed.”\n \n\n   \n  “San Francisco neither needs nor wants Trump’s personal army on our streets,” California state Senator Scott Wiener, whose district includes San Francisco,  said on X . “We don’t need Trump’s authoritarian crackdown in our city. Bottom line: Stay the hell out of San Francisco.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump initially received support from Bay area tech billionaire and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who told the New York Times ahead of his “Dreamforce” AI conference last week, he backed Trump’s troop deployment to the city. But Benioff later backtracked,  saying on X  he does not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco and his comments were made out of “an abundance of caution around the event.”\n \n\n   \n  “I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has not directly commented on Trump’s comments, but said in a news conference last Friday crime in the city is  down 30%  – the lowest point in decades.\n \n\n   \n  The city has faced a shortage of police officers but recently reported its largest surge of recruits in years, according to the  San Francisco Police Department , with 3,375 entry-level applications so far this year, up more than 40% from last year.\n \n\n   \n  For his part, Newsom  sued the Trump administration  in June over the federalization of the California National Guard to quell protests in Los Angeles and joined a  lawsuit in Oregon  earlier this month over Trump’s attempt to send federalized troops in Los Angeles to Portland to respond to protests there.\n \n\n   \n    Memphis\n \n\n   \n  A group of seven elected officials in Tennessee filed a lawsuit against the state’s governor and attorney general last week, challenging the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Governor Lee’s deployment violates both the Tennessee Constitution and state statutes, which allow the Guard to be called up only in the event of a rebellion or invasion—and only when the General Assembly declares that public safety requires it,” the officials said in a  statement published  by the National Immigration Law Center.\n \n\n   \n  “No such conditions exist in Memphis today.”\n \n\n   \n  Federal troops were seen in Memphis for the first time on October 10,  the Associated Press reported , including soldiers accompanied by Memphis police officers patrolling at the Pyramid, an iconic landmark in the city.\n \n\n   \n  Memphis  Mayor Paul Young,  defended the city, noting crime has fallen by double-digit percentages since last year, but acknowledged the situation is different from efforts to fight the federalization of troops in Portland or Chicago,  CNN affiliate WMC  reported.\n \n\n   \n  “Memphis is different than L.A. and Chicago or Portland in that the governor of Tennessee and the president of the United States made the decision to bring the National Guard and the federal resources to the City of Memphis,”  Young said Wednesday .\n \n\n   \n  Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said last week she hoped troops would help direct traffic and have a presence in public retail spaces, but not operate at checkpoints, the AP reported.\n \n\n   \n  “From a public safety standpoint, we’re trying to utilize Guard personnel in non-enforcement types of capacities, so it does not feel like there is this over-militarization in our communities, in our neighborhoods, and that’s not where we’re directing those resources, either,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    Chicago\n \n\n   \n  The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago in a court filing Monday asked the US Supreme Court to block the Trump administration emergency request to keep National Guard troops in the state to help combat protests and perceived crime despite objections from local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this month, a district court issued a temporary restraining order against the federalization and deployment of troops in the city. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit partially stayed that ruling, allowing federalization but not deployment. The temporary restraining order expires Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Supreme Court is being asked to decide whether to allow the deployment while the legal battle continues.\n \n\n   \n  The filing says there is no rebellion or inability to execute federal law in Illinois, arguing that the administration hasn’t met legal requirements to activate troops over the state’s dissent.\n \n\n   \n  “No protest activity in Illinois has rendered the President unable to execute federal law,” the filing says, describing protests at the ICE facility in Broadview as “small” and manageable by local authorities and saying they “never hindered the continued operation of the ICE facility there.”\n \n\n   \n  The filing addresses constitutional concerns that the federal government is pressuring Illinois to either use its own National Guard to carry out the Trump administration’s priorities or let federal troops take over, stating, “Such coercion is independently unconstitutional.”\n \n\n   \n  In Trump’s appeal of the temporary restraining order ,  the administration said the lower court order “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal describes the situation in Chicago as threatening, asserting that federal officials there have been “assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”\n \n\n   \n  Clashes between protesters and law enforcement in Chicago became the focus of courtroom discussions last week with a judge  demanding answers  from federal authorities over violent encounters with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  US District Judge Sara Ellis said recent news reports were leading her to believe the Trump administration was not following her instructions to limit use of force and actions against journalists documenting Chicago protests.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis last week expanded her restraining order, requiring all federal agents with body cameras involved in quelling protests to have them on when encountering demonstrators.\n \n\n   \n  Her order, however, does not require agents to wear body cameras if they’re undercover, not in uniform or exempt from Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Department of Homeland Security policy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581554","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump uses 'common sense' to make a political point.

point. It has populist appeal \n         By Danielle Kurtzleben  \n        \n           Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The idea of \"common sense\" has been central to American politics since the founding of the United States. Politicians still use the phrase all the time — and perhaps none more so than President Trump. Just this month at a Cabinet meeting, he used the phrase when he again recommended that pregnant women not take Tylenol. \"There's something going on, and we have to address it. And so, I'm addressing it the best I can as a nondoctor, but I'm a man of common sense,\" he said. He also used the term when he cast doubt on the monthly jobs report on CNBC in August: \"It's totally rigged. Smart people know it. People with common sense know it.\" The White House has also used it to explain the current government shutdown. \"Not enough Democrats voted for this common sense, clean continuing resolution to keep the government open,\" White House press secretary  Karoline Leavitt recently told NPR's  Morning Edition . This isn't exactly new. \"Common sense\" is such a widely used political phrase that University of Pennsylvania history professor Sophia Rosenfeld wrote an  entire book  on it. And yet, she says, Trump's usage of it is unique. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"He uses it more than almost anybody else in American politics,\" she said. \"Although, of course, it has a really old origin story.\" That goes back to Thomas Paine, in his 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" which made the case to the earliest Americans that British rule of the colonies was wrong. And in that, she says, Paine had hit upon the populist appeal of the phrase. \"It invokes some kind of primordial basic sense of ordinary people, a kind of lived experience that should transcend what the official or elite position is on something and particularly should transcend book learning and school learning,\" she said. And Trump often invokes that dichotomy of common sense vs. academic smarts. Speaking to military leaders in Quantico, Va., last month, Trump differentiated his administration from Joe Biden's, saying that Biden was surrounded by \"radical left lunatics that are brilliant people but dumb as hell when it came to policy and common sense.\" The phrase appeals more to several demographics that strongly align with Trump, says Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican strategist. \"Common sense is a higher priority to those who live in rural communities than those in the urban areas. Common sense does better among older voters than it does among younger voters,\" he said. \"And I think the reason why is that it reminds people of a more simple past.\" And that understandably appeals to people who want to make America great again. But Democrats use the phrase too. President Barack Obama tried to pass what he called \"common sense gun reform.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., used it this year on her Fighting Oligarchy Tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \"I believe that in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, if a person gets sick, they shouldn't go bankrupt. Common sense,\" she told a crowd at Arizona State University in March. One way to look at \"common sense\" is as an attempt to signal that a policy isn't extreme and could have broad appeal. But as Luntz points out, it can also be a cudgel, especially in Trump's hands. \"For him, common sense has an even broader meaning,\" he said. \"It's not just that you're right for the right reasons. It's also that the other side is wrong for being ideological, for being political or being outside the mainstream.\" Rosenfeld has a similar take. \"It's also potentially rather demagogic,\" she says of the phrase. \"Common sense also suggests not that there's another side to it. The other side in a debate with common sense is nonsense.\" And in that sense and others, common sense can be considered one of the most powerful pieces of rhetoric the MAGA movement has found. To Rosenfeld, Trump especially uses the phrase to try to excuse norm-shattering behavior — like a September social media post that Chicago was \"about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\" Here's how Trump explained that to a reporter: \"We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war — that's common sense.\" \"Common sense\" gives the impression of timeworn policy ideas, even if the policy — mass deployment of the National Guard into U.S. cities — was previously unthinkable. \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   The idea of common sense has been central to American politics since the founding of the U.S. Politicians still use the phrase all the time, perhaps none more so than Donald Trump.

finds \n         By Jon Hamilton \n        \n           Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 6:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Scientists are  reporting  the first compelling evidence in people that cognitive training can boost levels of a brain chemical that typically declines with age. A 10-week study of people 65 or older found that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day increased levels of the chemical messenger  acetylcholine  by 2.3% in a brain area involved in attention and memory. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The increase \"is not huge,\" says  Étienne de Villers-Sidani , a neurologist at McGill University in Montreal. \"But it's significant, considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade normally just with aging.\" So, at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years. The chemical change observed after intensive brain training is persuasive, says  Michael Hasselmo , director of the Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University, who was not involved in the study. \"It was compelling enough that I thought, 'Maybe I need to be doing this,'\" he says. The result backs earlier  research  in animals showing that environments that stimulate the brain can increase levels of certain neurotransmitters. Studies of people have suggested that cognitive training can  improve thinking and memory . Never skip brain day  The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, comes amid a proliferation of online brain-training programs, including Lumosity, Elevate, Peak, CogniFit and BrainHQ. But it has been hard to know whether these programs really work, says de Villers-Sidani, who directs the cognitive disorders clinic at McGill's Montreal Neurological Institute. \"They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures,\" he says, \"but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain and how is it changing the brain?\" So de Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that's closely associated with cognitive performance. Acetylcholine levels typically begin a gradual decline around middle age. The levels drop sharply, though, in people with Alzheimer's disease. The team studied 92 healthy people who were 65 or older. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Half the participants spent 30 minutes a day playing computer games like solitaire and Candy Crush. The others spent the same amount of time each day doing cognitive exercises that are part of the scientifically tested program BrainHQ. The program challenges users to remember the type and location of items that appear and disappear with increasing speed. \"It's really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and it kind of pushes you to the limit,\" de Villers-Sidani says. The researchers used a  special kind of PET scan  to detect changes in acetylcholine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors. \"I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest,\" de Villers-Sidani says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But they did. In people who played games like solitaire, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But in people who did cognitive training, there was a significant increase. Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory. Even modest changes are meaningful, Hasselmo says, because acetylcholine does more than carry messages in the brain. It also modulates the behavior of neurons in ways that affect learning, memory and attention. So when a person takes, say, a high dose of the motion sickness drug scopolamine — which blocks the effects of acetylcholine — things start to go awry. \"If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain, a person can't even think,\" Hasselmo says. \"You go into a delirious state.\" On the other hand, even small increases in acetylcholine can have a \"profound and notable effect\" on memory and thinking in older people. Hasselmo notes that the  earliest Alzheimer's drugs  reduced symptoms by increasing levels of acetylcholine. Now, he says, intensive brain training has the potential to achieve similar gains and stave off cognitive decline. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Scientists have produced the first compelling evidence that mental exercise can cause biological changes in a human brain. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on a new study showing that intensive cognitive training reversed a process associated with aging. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: The internet is filled with brain-training programs that promise to improve thinking and memory. But Etienne de Villers-Sidani of McGill University in Canada says it's been hard to know whether they really work. ETIENNE DE VILLERS-SIDANI: They had a positive impact on some cognitive measures, but then the question was, how much is it changing the brain, and how is it changing the brain? HAMILTON: So De Villers-Sidani and a team of researchers decided to see whether mental exercise could increase levels of a chemical messenger that's closely associated with cognitive performance. It's called acetylcholine. He says levels tend to fall starting in middle age. DE VILLERS-SIDANI: For every decade after the age of 40, 45, you get around 2.5% decline in this neurotransmitter in key brain areas. HAMILTON: The decline is much faster in people with Alzheimer's disease. The researchers studied 92 healthy people who were at least 65 years old. De Villers-Sidani says during the 10-week study, half of the participants spent 30 minutes a day doing mental exercises. These came from a science-backed cognitive training program called Brain HQ. DE VILLERS-SIDANI: Which is really targeted at attention and speed of processing, and its characteristic is that it kind of pushes you to the limit. HAMILTON: By asking you to remember more and more in less and less time - other participants spent their time playing video games like Solitaire and Candy Crush. The researchers used a special kind of PET scan to detect changes in acetylcholine levels. De Villers-Sidani says they focused on the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region that's important for making decisions and detecting errors. DE VILLERS-SIDANI: I was not sure we would find anything, to be honest. HAMILTON: But they did. In people who played video games, acetylcholine levels were unchanged. But De Villers-Sidani says in people who did cognitive training, there was a meaningful increase. DE VILLERS-SIDANI: It was about 2.3%, which is not huge, but it's significant considering that you get a 2.5% decrease per decade, normally just with aging. HAMILTON: So at least in this brain area, cognitive training appeared to turn back the clock by about 10 years. Acetylcholine levels also increased in other brain areas, including the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, appears in the journal JMIR Serious Games. Michael Hasselmo, a neuroscientist at Boston University, says he was impressed by the result. MICHAEL HASSELMO: It was compelling enough that I looked up the task myself and thought, maybe I need to be doing this task. HAMILTON: Hasselmo has spent much of his career studying acetylcholine, which is a chemical messenger that also modulates the behavior of neurons. HASSELMO: If you block the neuromodulator function in the brain with a drug such as scopolamine, a person can't even think. You basically go into a delirious state. HAMILTON: Low levels of acetylcholine are a hallmark of Alzheimer's and appear to contribute to the declines in memory and thinking. But Hasselmo says even small increases in this neurotransmitter can noticeably improve cognitive function. He says a cup of coffee boosts levels enough to improve attention and speed up reactions. HASSELMO: Changing things by 2.5% could have a pretty profound and notable effect even on a subjective level. HAMILTON: Hasselmo says the first Alzheimer's drugs reduce symptoms by increasing acetylcholine. Now, he says, it looks like hardcore brain training can offer a similar benefit.

In contrast, Cuomo, who previously held power as governor and whose career is marred by scandal and perceptions of elitism, struggles to connect with younger voters, who view him as out of touch and politically compromised. The race highlights broader cultural tensions, including differing views on Israel and Palestine, with Mamdani gaining endorsements from Jewish leaders and aligning with youth sentiments favoring Palestinian perspectives.

Cuomo was long a member of Democratic royalty, leading New York as governor for nearly eleven years after serving in the Clinton administration.  His late father Gov. Mario Cuomo was a Democratic Party icon.  Again and again, Cuomo hammered the idea that his deep resume makes him uniquely qualified him to lead America's biggest city. \"This is no job for on-the-job training,\" Cuomo said during the Oct. 16 exchange, painting Mamdani as a political novice with left-leaning ideas outside the mainstream. \"He never has had a job.  On his resume it said he interned for his mother.  This is not a job for a first-timer.\" But Cuomo is running in this race as an independent after Mamdani, who turned 34 last weekend, trounced him during the Democratic Party primary.  Mamdani was an unknown outside his state Assembly district until this year, but has led consistently in the general election by double-digit margins,  according to polls . \"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani said during the debate.  \"And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That barb pointed to the downside of Cuomo's long track record in office: it comes with some gritty political baggage, including a sexual misconduct scandal that led Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021.  Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing.  But Andres Bernal, a political analyst who lectures at the City University of New York, thinks many young voters look at Cuomo's history of controversy and are reminded of the Democratic Party establishment that has left them disillusioned.   \"It's a revolving door, with a lot of corporate America, a lot of funders,  and lobbyists,\" he said. Bernal says Mamdani overcame Cuomo's attacks over his relatively thin resume by offering big progressive ideas, like freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service, that appeal to many young voters.   \"Be ambitious and look for fundamental changes that I think inspire a lot of people and I think are associated with Mamdani's youth,\" Bernal said. It seems to be working.  The latest  poll by AARP and Gotham Polling  shows over half of Mamdani's support comes from young New Yorkers, under age 50. For Cuomo, meanwhile, 76 percent of his support is over age 50.  But it's not only serious policy issues that set these men apart.  It's also lived experience and style. When asked during the debate whether they've bought marijuana in New York City's legal cannabis shops, Mamdani laughed and said Yes.  Cuomo offered a terse No.  Their starkly different tones have played out in social media, where Cuomo offered conventional campaign ads, often attacking Mamdani.  Mamdani's campaign, meanwhile posts upbeat, often funny and hopeful videos that regularly go viral.   \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Zohran Mamdani is right now the epitome of what you're going to see every other candidate trying to do,\" said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx.  Polanco is critical of many of Mamdani's left-leaning policy ideas. But he says Mamdani's use of social media to reach young voters is a game-changer, allowing him to overcome his relative lack of experience. \"He has rewritten the book, I love his style, he's a happy warrior,\" he said. During last week's debate, Cuomo said his campaign's social media messaging has gotten better since he lost the Democratic primary, but he acknowledged playing catch-up.  \"I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now,\" he said.   While Cuomo and Mamdani have sparred, often bitterly, across this generational party divide, the Republican in the race, Curtis Sliwa, has suggested they're closer on policy issues than their campaign rhetoric suggests.  \"We have the architect and the apprentice,\" Sliwa said during the debate. Early voting is now underway.  If Mamdani holds onto his lead through election day on Nov. 4, he will represent one more big generational change, serving as the first Muslim mayor in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel. Cuomo has attacked Mamdani repeatedly for criticizing Israel, but that hasn't appeared to slow Mamdani's momentum.  Mamdani has picked up some  key endorsements from  Jewish leaders  in the city and a  New York Times-Siena poll last month  found most young voters in New York City sympathize more with the Palestinians than with Israel over the war in Gaza. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5581714","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"23:49:00-04:00","title":"Trump pick to lead watchdog agency withdraws after offensive text messages revealed","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Ingrassia, a nominee for the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew from consideration after offensive text messages revealed that he referred to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday as something to be 'tossed into the seventh circle of hell' and described himself as having a 'Nazi streak.'

Paul Ingrassia, who was nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, had been scheduled to have his confirmation hearing this week. On Monday, however, Politico reported on a text chat that showed him saying the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be \"tossed into the seventh circle of hell.\" Ingrassia also described himself in the chat as having \"a Nazi streak\" at times. After the texts came to light, several Republican senators said they would not support his nomination. They included some of the most conservative and stalwart Trump allies in the Senate. \"I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday's HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time,\" Ingrassia posted in an online message. \"I appreciate the overwhelming support that I have received throughout the process and will continue to serve President Trump and the administration to Make America Great Again!\" HSGAC is the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Asked for comment on Ingrassia withdrawing his name from consideration, the White House said simply, \"He is no longer the nominee.\" But Ingrassia's post came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune had said he hoped the White House would withdraw Ingrassia's nomination and several GOP senators said they would not support him. \"I'm a no,\" said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the committee that would've taken up Ingrassia's nomination. \"It never should have got this far.\" Republicans have been able to muscle through the vast majority of Trump's nominees in roll call votes despite stiff Democratic opposition. But there have been sporadic instances when Republicans have pushed back, generally behind the scenes, showing there are limits to their support. Most notably, Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump's first choice for attorney general soon after being tabbed for the job. In May, Trump pulled his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist's modest legal experience and support for Jan. 6 rioters. Last month, the White House announced it would be withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni was supposed to succeed a BLS director who was fired following a disappointing jobs report. But Democrats weren't satisfied with Ingrassia's withdrawal, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling on the president to fire him from his current position as a White House liaison for the Department of Homeland Security. \"This isn't anywhere near enough,\" Schumer said on social media. According to texts viewed by Politico, Ingrassia told those in the chat that \"MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his 'holiday' should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs.\" Politico spoke to Ingrassia's lawyer, who said the text messages might have been manipulated or were missing context. The lawyer did not confirm the texts were authentic. The Office of Special Counsel is an investigative and prosecutorial office that works to protect government employees and whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It's also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. In May, Trump described Ingrassia in a social media post as a \"highly respected attorney, writer and Constitutional Scholar.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580211","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"15:40:00-04:00","title":"Reversing peanut advice prevented tens of thousands of allergy cases, researchers say","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in Pediatrics finds that the reversal of peanut allergy advice — recommending early exposure to peanuts rather than avoidance — has led to a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% drop in overall food allergy rates among U.S. children.

But 10 years ago,  a landmark study  found the opposite to be true, stating that if babies consume peanut products at an early age, they were far less likely to become allergic to them. Health experts quickly took notice — and the resulting reversal in pediatric guidance has helped to push peanuts out of the No. 1 spot as the cause of food allergy for children under 3 in the U.S., according to  a new study published  in the peer-reviewed journal  Pediatrics . \"Early allergen introduction works,\" Dr. David Hill, who led the study, tells NPR. \"For the first time in recent history, it seems like we're starting to put a brake pedal on the epidemic of food allergy in this country.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Growing concerns over food allergies have reshaped parts of Americans' diet, from schools and camps banning peanut butter in sandwiches to airlines nixing once-ubiquitous bags of salted nuts. In 2015,  The New England Journal of Medicine  referenced a quadrupling of peanut allergy's prevalence in U.S. children, citing growth from 0.4% in 1997 to more than 2% in 2010. But when U.S. health guidance changed in 2015 and 2017, so did that trend, according to Hill, a pediatric allergist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who's also an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania. \"There was a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence,\" Hill says, \"and a 36% reduction in any food allergy prevalence.\" He estimates that the changed guidelines have prevented peanut allergies in at least 40,000 children in the last decade. The tipping point in peanut allergy prevention dates to 2015, when  research was published  that aimed to solve a puzzle: Why was peanut allergy 10 times higher among Jewish children in the U.K. than among Israeli children with similar ancestry? Researchers noted that while British and U.S. parents kept their babies away from peanut products, many Israeli parents  routinely fed their infants a puffy peanut snack  called Bamba. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The revised recommendations, including in the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans , calls for introducing infants deemed at high risk for peanut allergy to foods containing peanuts as early as 4 to 6 months, in line with advice published in 2017 by the  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . Hill and his colleagues looked at the rate of food allergy in young children before and after the revised guidelines for peanuts and other allergens were published. They did that by analyzing the health data of more than 120,000 children in the U.S. using records from dozens of different pediatric practices. Dr. Corinne Keet, a professor of pediatrics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who works in the epidemiology of food allergy, says she finds the study interesting, even if she's cautious about reading too much into it. She wasn't involved in the research. \"I'm a little bit surprised by these findings because I might have expected that we might have more diagnoses just because people were thinking about allergies more\" in the past decade, she says. Part of the reason for her caution, Keet says, is that her own research has found families haven't been fully implementing the new guidelines, in many cases due to fear that exposing an infant to peanut products might also endanger a sibling or parent who's allergic. Keet also says it's simply difficult to conduct a high-quality study about food allergy prevalence. She notes that the influential 2015 study, called  LEAP  (Learning Early about Peanut Allergy), produced definitive results by conducting a large clinical trial following hundreds of young kids over time. Hill and his colleagues acknowledge that their study has limitations, such as relying on diagnostic codes — which aren't necessarily equivalent to actual allergy rates. Their data also does not include information about children's eating habits. Still, he sees the study as another positive sign that a strategic shift is helping children. The benefits are far-reaching, he adds, because many peanut allergies are a lifetime condition. \"It's highly persistent,\" Hill says. \"Only about 10% of kids who develop a peanut allergy will outgrow that peanut allergy.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   A major study from 2015 changed our understanding of how to prevent peanut allergies. Ten years later, researchers say that approach is working. NPR's Bill Chappell reports. BILL CHAPPELL, BYLINE: For years, American parents were told not to expose their babies to peanuts too early to prevent a potentially dangerous allergy. Dr. David Hill is a pediatric allergist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. DAVID HILL: And that was well-intentioned, right? These are the youngest, potentially most vulnerable of our society. CHAPPELL: But in 2015, a landmark study found the opposite to be true, saying that if babies eat peanut products at an early age, around 4 to 6 months, they're less likely to become allergic. To gauge the success of early introduction, Hill and his colleagues conducted another study. They looked at the rate of food allergy in young children before and after the guidelines changed by analyzing the health data of some 120,000 children across the U.S. HILL: What we found was that there was a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence. CHAPPELL: They also found more than a third reduction in any food allergy prevalence. HILL: That equates to around 40,000 prevented cases of peanut allergy and around 60,000 prevented cases of food allergy altogether. CHAPPELL: Their findings were published on Monday in the journal Pediatrics. CORINNE KEET: I would definitely say I'm cautious about reading too much into it. CHAPPELL: Dr. Corinne Keet is a professor of pediatrics at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (ph). KEET: I'm looking for more information to confirm these findings. CHAPPELL: Keet is an allergist who was not involved in the research. KEET: I'm a little bit surprised by these findings 'cause I might have expected that we might have more diagnoses just because people were thinking about allergies more. CHAPPELL: Keet wants to see more data to get an idea of the national picture, but Dr. Hill says his study is one more step in understanding allergies, and he has a message for the millions of children in the U.S. who have a food allergy. HILL: We haven't forgotten about you. CHAPPELL: Both Hill and Keet say there's more work to be done.

Al-Waheidi, Michel Martin \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         For nearly three years, Karine Jean-Pierre served as White House press secretary, the public face of the Biden administration through daily briefings and trips around the world. In a new book,  Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines , published Oct. 21, Jean-Pierre says that the party's internal dysfunction and disloyalty had helped pave the way for its 2024 defeat. Speaking with  Morning Edition  host Michel Martin, she reflected on her time in the administration and described why she decided to step away from the party she once represented. Here are five takeaways from the conversation. 1. She says the debate revealed political vulnerability — not cognitive decline Jean-Pierre opened her book with her account of the June 2024 presidential debate, the night questions about former President Joe Biden's health and acuity intensified. \"I had not seen the president because he had been in debate prep,\" she said. \"So the first time I actually heard him speak was while he was debating. So when I heard his voice, I thought to myself, uh oh. He was hoarse. He kind of looked like he was sick.\" She said she immediately recognized how the optics might play publicly. \"Everything that I've been pushing back on — his age, is he fit — like automatically anytime he would sneeze or have a runny nose or something would happen, that would be where the questions would go.\" Still, she maintained she had seen no reason to doubt the president's ability to serve. \"I stand by that. I stand by that 110%.\" 2. She blames, in part, Democratic disunity for Trump's return Jean-Pierre argued that Democrats' inability to rally around Biden cost them politically. \"Joe Biden, objectively, had a very successful four years,\" she said. \"And here we are on the cusp of an election of a lifetime that we all need to get behind our person, and we couldn't do it. Republicans are able to do it … and we weren't able to do it.\" She cited figures such as Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney who, she said, signaled their doubts about the president. \"All of it,\" she said, \"contributed to a perception of disunity.\" 3. She says criticism of her as press secretary reflected deeper bias Jean-Pierre recalled the scrutiny she faced at the podium, including claims she was \"too wooden\" or lacked policy depth. \"Well, look, in the moment, I was quiet,\" she said. \"What I can do is state facts, which is that no one has ever looked like me that has been at that podium.\" She said she understood that \"as a Black woman, things are just different for people who look like me.\" 4. She says Democrats had failed Black women — even as they relied on them In a chapter titled \"Sisterhood,\" Jean-Pierre described the loyalty of Black women voters within the party. \"I feel like, if you look at Black women and how they come out and vote no matter what, because they understand what's at stake ... we get forgotten,\" she said. She said she had appreciated the Biden-Harris administration's effort to elevate those voices: \"They felt seen when they saw me at the podium, behind that lectern, whether it was women of color, Black women, queer community, LGBTQ community, immigrant — they felt seen, and that mattered to me.\" 5. She says becoming an independent was about accountability, not defection Jean-Pierre said her decision to identify as an independent was meant to start a conversation about the direction of American politics. \"Look, for me, I'm not telling people, Hey, you go become an independent,\" she said. \"There is a growing number of people who see themselves as independents, including young people. We have to question, why is that?\" She also said Democrats had failed to anticipate what would follow their loss. Jean-Pierre said she hoped the book would encourage engagement rather than cynicism. \"There's an opportunity to reimagine what politics can be, to reimagine what America can be. That means you can't stay quiet, because silence is complicit.\" The radio version of this interview was produced by Barry Gordemer and edited by Adriana Gallardo. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   For almost three years, Karine Jean-Pierre served as White House press secretary, meaning she was the face and voice of the Biden-Harris administration during daily White House briefings and trips around the world. In a new book, Jean-Pierre argues that Democrats knew what was coming ahead of their defeat in the 2024 elections and not only didn't do enough to stop it, but also helped it along by being disloyal, shambolic and insufficiently committed to its stated values. This led her to ask herself if this was still the party for her. Her answer? No. Jean-Pierre says she no longer identifies as a Democrat. The title of her new book and her new political stance is \"Independent.\" And she's with us now to tell us more about it. Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks so much for joining us. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you so much for having me, Michel. MARTIN: You open the book with your experience behind the scenes of the June 2024 presidential debate, a date that's, you know, seared into a lot of people's memories. And it was there that questions around then President Biden's kind of health and mental acuity really seemed to take off. So tell us a little bit about what you saw behind the scenes. JEAN-PIERRE: So I had not seen the president because he had been in debate prep, and it was on the political side. I was not involved in the campaign in any way. So the first time I actually heard him speak was while he was debating. So when I heard his voice, I thought to myself, uh-oh. He was hoarse. He kind of looked like he was sick. So I thought to myself, something is up. And so what I started thinking from that moment was, oh, goodness. This is what is going to be used for everything that I've been pushing back on, his age - is he fit? Like, automatically, anytime he would sneeze or have a runny nose or something would happen, that would be where the questions would go. MARTIN: Let me just be clear here. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: Because you are very clear in the book that you saw no reason to question the former president's mental acuity, his fitness for the job. You stand by that. JEAN-PIERRE: I stand by that 110%. MARTIN: I do want to say that you realize that a lot of people just don't believe that. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, all I can tell you is what I saw with my own eyes and what I experienced myself. MARTIN: To that end, your beef is not with journalists asking questions. JEAN-PIERRE: No, my beef is not with journalists, no. MARTIN: The core of the book is about the Democratic Party and what you experienced at the White House. You write about what you call bickering and backbiting. So say more about why... JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: ...You say that that backbiting is what opened the door for you to think about other alternatives. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. So Joe Biden objectively had a very successful four years. And here we are on the cusp of a election of a lifetime that we all need to get behind our person, and we couldn't do it. Republicans are able to do it. They were able to get behind their guy, however flawed their guy is. And they say, yep, this is our guy. With all the flaws and everything, this is our guy. And we weren't able to do it. MARTIN: By that you mean, like, for example, the former speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, sort of letting it be known that she was concerned. JEAN-PIERRE: Yes. MARTIN: Or George Clooney and his piece in The New York Times. JEAN-PIERRE: All of it, all of it. MARTIN: Is that what you're talking about? JEAN-PIERRE: All of it. And I talk about that in the book. MARTIN: One other thing you write about, which I really found was interesting, is, like, the snippety sniping directed at you. Apparently, there are people who felt you weren't very good at your job. They said you were too wooden at briefings, that you didn't really understand policy. How do you understand those critiques now that you have some distance from it, or do you? JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, in the moment, I was quiet. I didn't defend myself in the moment because I was focused on a job that I was honored and privileged to have had, which is the White House press secretary, because the president believed that I can do this. What I can do is state facts, which is no one has ever looked like me that has been at that podium standing behind that lectern. And when we are first, you are critiqued and looked at differently because people already don't think you belong there in that position. And, you know, look, I had a job that was coveted. MARTIN: Interesting. JEAN-PIERRE: And the people who wanted my job didn't think I deserved the job for whatever reasons, right? And so I understood as a Black woman that things are just different for people who look like me. MARTIN: You write at length about how you feel the Democratic Party has particularly failed Black women. JEAN-PIERRE: So I have a chapter on, it's called Sisterhood. It's kind of a love letter to Black women. And I feel like if you look at Black women and how they come out and vote no matter what, because they understand what's at stake, 92% for Kamala Harris. Black women understand, look, there's a crisis here. Not only is it going to affect me and my family and the community that I love, but it's going to affect everyone. And we feel like it is our duty to try to save and try to really speak out. And we get forgotten. And one of the things that I respected from the Biden-Harris administration is we didn't forget them. And you see that in how we made sure Black women's voices were everywhere within the administration. I do believe, and I want to be very clear about this, that I meant a lot to people because of the communities that I represented. They felt seen when they saw me at the podium behind that lectern. Whether it was women of color, Black women, queer community, LGBTQ community, immigrant, they felt seen. And that mattered to me. And I wrote this book because I truly believe in what I'm saying, and I want to start a conversation. I'm not looking for a fight with Democrats or Republicans. I'm looking to - well, I'm looking to have a conversation. MARTIN: OK. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. MARTIN: So let's have that conversation. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. MARTIN: What does identifying as an independent solve the problem that you have identified? JEAN-PIERRE: Right. Look, for me, I'm not telling people, hey, you go become an independent. That's not my role. There is a growing number of people who see themselves as independents, including young people. We have to question, why is that? There is a fundamental problem here. For me, it is I want to show, how is this person going to fight for my vote? Rubber-stamping Trump's appointees, let me tell you, that is not the way that that should've gone. We knew what was about to happen, Project 2025. Anti-DEI was, like, one of the first things. We knew. Immigrants being attacked, we knew this was going to happen. And so I feel like we should've been better. MARTIN: So you said you wanted to start a conversation. The book is just out. What are you hearing from people? JEAN-PIERRE: I hope people are inspired to continue to either be in the fight or get into the fight. There's an opportunity to reimagine what politics can be, to reimagine what America can be. That means you can't stay quiet because silence is complicit. MARTIN: Karine Jean-Pierre is the author of \"Independent: A Look Inside A Broken White House, Outside The Party Lines.\" Karine Jean-Pierre, thanks so much for talking with us. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you, Michel. I appreciate it. Thank you for the opportunity.\\ \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5580542","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"The not-so-spooky origins of 'ghost' — and why the word still haunts our language","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the origins and evolution of the word 'ghost,' tracing it back to Old English 'gast' meaning 'breath' or 'life,' and its use in early religious and literary contexts such as the 'Holy Ghost' and the ghosts of Enkidu and Anticlea.

Wednesday, October 22, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         It wouldn't be spooky season without ghosts. The otherworldly white apparitions are a standby of Halloween celebrations. But they weren't always the stereotypical evil spirits we see in books and movies today. The messengers from the afterlife have gone through a variety of makeovers over the centuries, and the word continues to influence the English language in many ways. Part of the reason for that, said Lisa Morton, author of  Ghosts: A Haunted History , is just like ghosts themselves, our fascination with the afterlife just won't die. \"I think one of the reasons we fear them is that sense that this is the worst part of us and this is what's going to survive after death,\" she said. For this installment of  Word of the Week , we look back on the origins of \"ghost.\" Don't be scared! It's just a little etymology. It originally meant \"breath\" or \"life\" \"Ghost\" can be traced to the Old English root  gast , but back then it didn't carry the haunting connotation it does today. \"All of [its meanings] centered on breath, life and the human spirit,\" and it was also used in Christian contexts like the notion of the Holy Ghost, said Jess Zafarris, author of  Useless Etymology  and other books about the origins of words. \"These broad spiritual concepts predate the narrower idea of a ghost as a spooky creature or an apparition of a deceased person,\" Zafarris said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Still, the idea that the spirit of a dead person or animal could return to the land of the living was present as far back as the ancient world, according to Morton, the author of  Ghosts . In the Mesopotamian text  Epic of Gilgamesh , Gilgamesh's late friend Enkidu  appears as a specter  and recounts to Gilgamesh his experience in the underworld. One section of Homer's  Odyssey  describes Odysseus traveling through the underworld and encountering the ghost of his mother, Anticlea. Ghosts take a turn for the malevolent Over time, the word \"ghost\" does some shape-shifting, both in its meaning and in how it's spelled. The Old English  gast  and Middle English  gost  picked up a silent \"h\" centuries later thanks to the influence of Flemish typesetters, said Zafarris. When William Caxton introduced the printing press to England in 1476, the Bruges-trained printer also brought with him compositors from the Low Countries, who modified some English words using Flemish spellings. \"That also happened to words that are related to ghosts, like 'aghast' and 'ghastly,'\" Zafarris said, \"and you'll notice that those also have that breathiness to them, things make you gasp.\" The 19th century ushered in a cultural obsession with spiritualism. Ghosts peppered Victorian literature, and séances soared in popularity. The supernatural rituals, in which participants called upon the spirits of their deceased loved ones and others, challenged the idea that the living couldn't communicate with the dead, said Morton. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Suddenly, along came this notion that any group of people could sit down around a table and call up spirits that they could actually hold conversations with,\" she said. Even Queen Victoria  took part  in séances, which Morton said people of that era found to be \"joyous.\" The physical appearance of ghosts has also fluctuated over time and geography. \"In many parts of Asia, a ghost will appear in such a way that it's almost impossible to distinguish from a living person,\" she said. \"The idea of this sort of wispy, translucent thing is very Western and is fairly modern.\" In the decades that followed the Victorian era, ghosts took on the more sinister reputation they now hold thanks to the growth of horror films and novels, Morton noted. Considered by some as the  first horror film , 1896's  Le Manoir du Diable , translated into English as  The Haunted Castle  or  The House of the Devil , featured a group of what appear to be ghosts shrouded in white. The works of horror writers such as Shirley Jackson and Stephen King have continued to terrify readers for decades. Then again, not all ghosts in pop culture are out for revenge.  Ghostbusters  rubbed elbows with both evil and more eccentric spirits, while the friendly ghost Casper has transcended decades after getting his start in midcentury comic books. How phantasms haunt our modern slang The spectral and unreal quality of the modern ghost has lent itself to several English idioms used to describe things that are both there and not there. Ghost towns evoke abandoned places that were once full of life, while \"to give up the ghost\" means to die or stop working. (Those tiny clumps of lint under your furniture?  Ghost turds .) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The word was used as a verb as early as the beginning of the 20th century, Zafarris said, to describe when someone secretly did work on someone else's behalf, such as ghostwriting. More recently, \"ghosting\" has taken off as a slang term in the dating world for the act of suddenly cutting off contact with a romantic partner.

Guns are drawn. Unmarked cars fill the streets. Agents rappel from a Black Hawk helicopter. But quickly the soundtrack grows more stirring and the video — edited into a series of dramatic shots and released by the Department of Homeland Security days after the Sept. 30 raid — shows agents leading away shirtless men, their hands zip-tied behind their backs. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Authorities said they were targeting the Venezuelan gang  Tren de Aragua , but only two of the 37 immigrants arrested were gang members.

Agents had used a grinder to cut out the deadbolt, and he still couldn’t close the door properly, let alone lock it. So he had barricaded himself inside, blocking the door with furniture.  “I didn’t even hear them knock or nothing,” said Wilson, a 58-year-old U.S. citizen on disability. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Dreams and decay The raid was executed in the heart of South Shore, an overwhelmingly Black neighborhood on Lake Michigan that has long been a tangle of middle-class dreams, urban decay and gentrification. It’s a place where teams of drug dealers troll for customers outside ornate lakeside apartment buildings. It has some of the city’s best vegan restaurants but also takeout places where the catfish fillets are ordered through bullet-proof glass. It has well-paid professors from the University of Chicago but is also where one-third of households scrape by on less than $25,000 a year. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The apartment building where the raid occurred has long been troubled. Five stories tall and built in the 1950s, residents said it was often strewn with garbage, the elevators rarely worked and crime was a constant worry. Things had grown more chaotic after dozens of Venezuelan migrants arrived in the past few years, residents said. While no residents said they felt threatened by the migrants, many described a rise in noise and hallway trash.  \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Water collects on the floor on Oct. 10, 2025, inside the building at 7500 South Shore Drive in Chicago, which was raided by federal agents on Sept. 30.

Repeated calls to a lead investor in the limited liability company that owns the building, a Wisconsin resident named Trinity Flood, were not returned. Attempts to reach representatives through realtors and lawyers were also unsuccessful. Crime fears spiked in June when a Venezuelan man was shot in the head “execution-style,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. Another Venezuelan was charged in the death.  Days after the raid, the doors to dozens of the building’s 130 apartments hung open. Nearly all those apartments had been ransacked. Windows were broken, doors smashed, and clothes and diapers littered the floors. In one apartment, a white tuxedo jacket hung in the closet next to a room knee-deep in broken furniture, piles of clothing and plastic bags. In another, water dripping from the ceiling puddled next to a refrigerator lying on its side. Some kitchens swarmed with insects.  Wilson said a trio of men in body armor had zip-tied his hands and forced him outside with dozens of other people, most Latino. After being held for two hours he was told he could leave. “It was terrible, man,” he said. He’d barely left the apartment in days.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A city under siege?  Chicago, the White House says, is under siege. Gang members and immigrants in the U.S. illegally swarm the city and crime is rampant, President  Donald Trump insists . National Guard soldiers are needed to protect government facilities from raging left-wing protesters. “Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World,” he posted on Truth Social. The reality is far less dramatic . Violence is rare at protests, though angry confrontations are increasingly common,  particularly outside a federal immigration center  in suburban Broadview. And while crime is a serious problem, the city’s murder rate has dropped by roughly half since the 1990s.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Those realities have not stopped the Trump administration. What started in early September with some arrests in Latino neighborhoods, part of a crackdown dubbed  “Operation Midway Blitz,”  has surged across Chicago. There are increasing patrols by masked, armed agents; detentions of  U.S. citizens  and immigrants with legal status;  a fatal shooting ; a protesting pastor shot in the head with a pepper ball outside the Broadview facility, his arms raised in supplication. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Resident Alex Mannings, who said he was awakened by federal agents during a Sept. 30 raid of the building at 7500 South Shore Drive in Chicago, speaks on Oct. 10, 2025.

The raids have  shaken  Chicago. “We have a rogue, reckless group of heavily armed, masked individuals roaming throughout our city,”  Mayor Brandon Johnson  said after the Sept. 30 raid. “The Trump administration is seeking to destabilize our city and promote chaos.” To Trump’s critics, the crackdown is a calculated effort to stir anger in a city and state run by some of his most  outspoken Democratic opponents . Out-of-control protests would reinforce Trump’s tough-on-crime image, they say, while embarrassing Johnson and Illinois  Gov. JB Pritzker,  seen as a possible Democratic presidential contender. So the South Shore raid, ready-made for social media with its displays of military hardware and agents armed for combat, was seen as wildly out of proportion. “This was a crazy-looking military response they put together for their reality show,” said LaVonte Stewart, who runs a South Shore sports program to steer young people away from violence. “It’s not like there are roving bands of Venezuelan teenagers out there.” Officials insist it was no reality show.  The operation, led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, was based on months of intelligence gathering, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The building’s landlord told authorities that Venezuelans in about 30 units were squatters and had threatened other tenants, the official said, adding that the building’s size necessitated the show of force. Immigration agencies declined further comment.  Even before the “Midway Blitz,” Trump’s election had whipsawed through Chicago’s Latino communities.  Stewart said Venezuelan children began disappearing from his programs months ago, though it’s often unclear if they moved, returned to Venezuela or are just staying home. “I had 35 kids in my program from Venezuela,” he said. “Now there’s none.”  A wave of migrant newcomers  The raid echoed through South Shore, pinballing through memories of the surge in violence during the 1990s drug wars as well as economic divides and the  sometimes uncomfortable relations  between Black residents and the wave of more than 50,000 immigrants, most Latino, who began arriving in 2022,  often bused  from southern border states. Chicago spent more than $300 million on housing and other services for the immigrants, fueling widespread resentment in South Shore and other Black neighborhoods where the newcomers were settled. “They felt like these new arrivals received better treatment than people who were already part of the community,” said Kenneth Phelps, pastor at the Concord Missionary Baptist Church in Woodlawn, a largely Black neighborhood. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     People enter the building on Oct. 10, 2025, at 7500 South Shore Drive in Chicago, which was raided by federal agents on Sept. 30.

The message to residents, he said, was that the newcomers mattered more than they did.  Phelps tried to fight that perception, creating programs to help new arrivals and inviting them to his church. But that stirred more anger, including in his own congregation.  “I even had people leave the church,” he said. In South Shore it’s easy to hear the bitterness, even though the neighborhood’s remaining migrants are a nearly invisible presence. “They took everyone’s jobs!” said Rita Lopez, who manages neighborhood apartment buildings and recently stopped by the scene of the raid.  “The government gave all the money to them — and not to the Chicagoans,” she said. Changing demographics and generations of suspicion  Over more than a century, South Shore has drawn waves of Irish, Jewish and then Black arrivals for its lakeside location, affordable bungalows and early 20th-century apartment buildings. Each wave viewed the next with suspicion, in many ways mirroring how Black South Shore residents saw the migrant influx. Former first lady Michelle Obama’s parents moved to South Shore when it was still mostly white, and she watched it change. A neighborhood that was 96% white in 1950 was 96% Black by 1980. “We were doing everything we were supposed to do — and better,” she said in 2019. “But when we moved in, white families moved out.” But suspicion also came from South Shore’s Black middle-class, which watched nervously as many housing projects began closing in the 1990s, creating an influx of poorer residents. “This has always been a complex community,” Stewart said of those years.  “You can live on a block here that’s super-clean, with really nice houses, then go one block away and there’s broken glass, trash everywhere and shootings,” he said. “It’s the weirdest thing and it’s been this way for 30 years.” ___ Associated Press reporters Aisha I.

\n        \n           Updated Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 12:25 PM EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he believes public pressure will mount on Republicans in the coming days to extend health insurance subsidies that are the heart of the shutdown fight. Most of the federal government remains shut down after Senate Republicans and Democrats again failed to pass a spending bill Monday that would reopen the government. Democrats, who have put forward their own spending resolution, remain steadfast that Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies used by more than 20 million people to afford monthly health premiums should be extended. With the credits expiring at the end of the year and ACA open enrollment beginning Nov. 1, many buying insurance through their state's marketplace  are likely to see their monthly costs soar . In an interview with  Morning Edition , Jeffries said he believes \"it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.\" Some Republicans have proposed a one-year extension of the ACA subsidies, which Jeffries has opposed. In  a separate interview with  Morning Edition , GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said Democrats knew the subsidies would expire and dared Jeffries to sign onto the one-year extension if he was \"serious\" about it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In response, Jeffries said that \"If billionaires can be provided tax breaks on a permanent basis in ways that will explode the deficit all across the country and result in people losing their health insurance … it seems to us that Republicans should come to the table to provide a greater degree of certainty as it relates to health care that's being provided to working class Americans,\" referring to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Jeffries discussed how the shutdown is playing out and why Democrats remain adamant on their position. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Interview highlights Michel Martin:  Last night, the Senate failed for the 11th time to pass a measure that would extend current funding until the end of the year, effectively reopen the government. Republicans insist they'll negotiate on health care once the government reopens. Remind us again about why that position is unacceptable to the Democrats. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries:  Well, we've made clear that we want to reopen the government. We want to find a bipartisan path forward toward a spending agreement that actually makes life better for the American people. But we also need to decisively resolve the Republican health care crisis that is crushing people all across the country, particularly as it relates to the need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Open enrollment starts on Nov. 1. That's less than two weeks from now. And tens of millions of Americans are receiving notices as we speak, indicating that their health insurance premiums, co-pays and deductibles are about to skyrocket double, triple — or in some cases, quadruple — at levels that will be unaffordable, which is why these issues taken together need to be addressed at this moment without further delay. Martin:  So as you just pointed out, Nov. 1 is a crucial date because that's when most states will start to send out notices spelling out the cost of coverage, without the subsidies, those huge price hikes that you just mentioned that you're trying to protect buyers from, will have already happened. If we get to that point and there is still no deal, what then? Jeffries:  Well, the open enrollment period, which begins on Nov. 1, will last until the early to mid part of December. The pressure is going to continue to mount on the Congress to take decisive action during that period of time, as people all across America realize that things are about to get extremely costly in states like Georgia, Virginia and Maryland. We now have visibility into the fact that costs may increase on a monthly basis by approximately $2,000 per month. That means that health insurance premiums could actually increase to over $24,000 a year. That's unaffordable. The average income of someone who receives an Affordable Care Act tax credit is around $63,000 a year. And so clearly, these type of premium increases for people to get access to a doctor when they need them are unsustainable. And so over the next few weeks, it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And by the way, health insurance costs are going to increase for people who receive assistance through the tax credits on the Affordable Care Act, as well as people who receive their health insurance from their employer as well. Editor's note: About 90% of ACA premium tax credit recipients have annual incomes at or below $63,000,  according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Martin:  So yesterday you said that you'd oppose GOP legislation to pay military service members. That's something that President Trump already says he's going to do. And then this bill would also pay essential federal workers. You say you oppose this because you call it a political ploy. Notwithstanding the fact that you argue that this would give the president discretion to decide who would get paid and who wouldn't get paid. And you feel that that's not right. There still are a lot of workers in those groups who would face real hardship without pay. What do you say to them? Jeffries:  I support the military being paid. We, in fact, on the Democratic side of the House, have introduced legislation to ensure that that happens. In terms of the legislation that Sen. Ron Johnson [R-Wisc.] apparently was putting forward or may plan to put forward in the Senate, it gives President Trump wide discretion to decide who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, what happens in terms of furloughed workers who apparently will not be addressed in this legislation. And he's already threatened not to pay furloughed workers, even though that's contrary to federal law that he himself signed in 2019. This has been a lawless administration from day one of this presidency and allowing them to have further discretion as to how they may proceed, particularly when they have targeted hard working federal civil servants from the very beginning of this term in extraordinary ways is not an appropriate step forward. It's piecemeal, it's not comprehensive. And we need to reopen the government in its entirety. And we're ready to do that as Democrats. We just need partners on the other side of the aisle in terms of a willingness to proceed in good faith. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   We've been speaking with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle since the government shutdown began 21 days ago. Today, we are joined by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. He represents a district in New York. Good morning, Leader. Thanks so much for joining us. HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Good morning. Great to be on. MARTIN: So last night, the Senate failed for the 11th time to pass a measure that would extend current funding until the end of the year, effectively reopen the government. Republicans insist they'll negotiate on health care once the government reopens. Would you, as briefly as you can, remind us again about why that position is unacceptable to the Democrats? JEFFRIES: Well, we've made clear that we want to reopen the government. We want to find a bipartisan path forward toward a spending agreement that actually makes life better for the American people. But we also need to decisively resolve the Republican health care crisis that is crushing people all across the country, particularly as it relates to the need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Open enrollment starts on November 1. That's less than two weeks from now. And tens of millions of Americans are receiving notices as we speak indicating that their health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles are about to skyrocket, double, triple or, in some cases, quadruple at levels that will be unaffordable, which is why these issues, taken together, need to be addressed at this moment without further delay. MARTIN: So as you just pointed out, November 1 is a crucial date 'cause that's when most states will start to send out notices spelling out the cost of coverage without the subsidies. Those huge price hikes that you just mentioned that you're trying to protect buyers from will have already happened. If we get to that point and there is still no deal, what then? JEFFRIES: Well, the open enrollment period, which begins on November 1, will last until the early to mid part of December. And so the pressure's going to continue to mount on the Congress to take decisive action during that period of time as people all across America realize that things are about to get extremely costly. In states like Georgia, Virginia and Maryland, we now have visibility into the fact that costs may increase on a monthly basis by approximately $2,000 per month. That means that health insurance premiums could actually increase to over $24,000 a year. That's unaffordable. The average income of someone who receives an Affordable Care Act tax credit is around $63,000 a year. And so, clearly, these type of premium increases for people to get access to a doctor when they need them are unsustainable. And so over the next few weeks, it will become readily apparent to people throughout America why it is so important for Congress to act to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. And by the way, Michel, health insurance costs are going to increase for people who receive assistance through the tax credits on the Affordable Care Act, as well as people who receive their health insurance from their employer as well. MARTIN: Why is that? JEFFRIES: Well, because the - there's one system. And to the extent that you begin to remove people from health insurance in numbers that would be contemplated - more than 20 million, perhaps - that's the number of Americans who... MARTIN: Well, the argument being - the argument here being that people... JEFFRIES: Yes. MARTIN: ...Will drop out because it's unaffordable, right? Is that the argument here? JEFFRIES: That's - well, people will drop out because it's unaffordable. And as a result, the costs are going to increase on everybody else. MARTIN: So last week, I spoke with Republican Congressman Mike Lawler. He's a member of the New York delegation, one of your colleagues. He confronted you earlier this month in the Capitol, and this is what he had to say. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) MIKE LAWLER: If you want to solve an issue like the Obamacare subsidies that Democrats put in place for four years and were slated to expire at the end of this year - they knew that they were slated to expire. They passed the bill. And so I've already signed on to legislation to extend the subsidies by a year, and that was part of my point to Hakeem Jeffries. If you're serious about this, if this is the issue you claim it is, then why won't you sign on to this bill with me? MARTIN: What do you say to that? What's wrong with extending the subsidies for a year to give you more time to negotiate? JEFFRIES: Well, what we've made clear is that we need to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits at a level that will provide certainty to the American people, who are already struggling with the high cost of living in this country, living paycheck to paycheck, can't thrive, can barely survive. Now, Mike Lawler and his Republican colleagues earlier this year did all that they could to pass the one big, ugly bill, which included the largest cut to Medicaid in American history. Fourteen million people are at risk of losing their health insurance coverage throughout the country, including in rural America. Hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health clinics are about to close across the country, and we're already seeing that happen in some states. And all of this was done so that Republicans could provide massive tax breaks that they made permanent for their billionaire donors. If billionaires can be provided tax breaks on a permanent basis in ways that, you know, will explode the deficit all across the country and result in people losing their health insurance because, in part, it was paid for by a trillion-dollar cut to Medicaid, it seems to us that Republicans should come to the table to provide a greater degree of certainty as it relates to health care that's being provided to working-class Americans. MARTIN: So yesterday, you said that you'd oppose GOP legislation to pay military service members. That's something President Trump already says he's going to do. And then this bill would also pay essential federal workers. You say you oppose this because you call it a political ploy. Notwithstanding the fact that you argue that this would give the president discretion to decide who would get paid and who wouldn't get paid and you feel that that's not right, there still are a lot of workers in those groups who would face real hardship without pay. How - what do you say to them? JEFFRIES: Well, it's a very important question. In terms - I support the military being paid. And we, in fact, on the Democratic side of the House had introduced legislation to ensure that that happens. In terms of the legislation that Ron Johnson apparently was putting forward or may plan to put forward in the Senate, it gives President Trump wide discretion to decide who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, what happens in terms of furloughed workers, who apparently will not be addressed in this legislation. And he's already threatened not to pay furloughed workers, even though that's contrary to federal law that he himself signed in 2019. This has been a lawless administration from Day 1 of this presidency. And allowing them to have further discretion as to how they may proceed, particularly when they have targeted hardworking federal civil servants from the very beginning of this term in extraordinary ways, is not an appropriate step forward. It's piecemeal. It's not comprehensive. And we need to reopen the government in its entirety, and we're ready to do that as Democrats. We just need partners on the other side of the aisle in terms of a willingness to proceed in good faith. MARTIN: That is Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York. He's the House minority leader. Leader Jeffries, I do hope you'll come back and talk more about this as this situation continues. Thank you so much for joining us today. JEFFRIES: Thank you.

EDT \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Sunday \n        \n      \n\n         On a Friday morning in early October, musicians, industry executives, and politicians packed into the open-air café at the brand new  Museum of Christian and Gospel Music  — the first museum in the U.S. designed to celebrate the breadth of Christian music. They spilled onto the downtown Nashville sidewalk, mere blocks away from historic churches and country stars' raucous tourist bars. It was a ceremony many years in the making. There is an institution devoted to  Black Gospel  in St. Louis, one for  white Southern gospel  in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, and the Gospel Music Association (GMA) has been inducting originators from both those traditions, along with Christian pop pioneers, into its Hall of Fame since 1972. But for the entirety of those 50-plus years, the hall's been without a physical location. Past efforts to build one failed. But Jackie Patillo, the first woman and person of color to lead the GMA, pushed to create a comprehensive home for these musical histories once and for all. \"The word 'gospel' music really encompasses a message with lots of different sounds, so it's been awesome to see how we've gone from the hymns to choruses to rap music and the contemporary Christian music industry,\" said Patillo. The museum now houses the GMA's Gospel Music Hall of Fame, and because its exhibits are designed to weave these varied musical lineages into one story, no one genre gets its own section. Instead, performers are organized according to either chronology or commonalities. One display describes all sorts of family bands, while another spotlights musicians who've embraced pastoring roles and pastors who've become recognized as musicians. All that glitters is not gold The museum has just 11,000 square feet so its executive director and team of curators had to be selective about its contents. But they didn't default to simply featuring the biggest-selling singers. Even though Christian and gospel music have long operated as industries, they measure success differently from the rest of popular music: spiritual impact, a more ephemeral accomplishment, is touted just as much as commercial stats. And the artifacts on display are meant to reflect those priorities. \"We have one little area we're trying to put all the gold records in,\" explained Steve Gilreath, the museum's executive director. \"You don't see them everywhere you go…it's just not about that with this industry.\" The first item visitors encounter upon entering is a trophy,  given to Bill Gaither  when he received the songwriter of the year honor at the very first Dove Awards ceremony in 1969, celebrating excellence in Christian music. Gaither is a noted composer of  Southern gospel standards  that proclaim faith in a saving God, and take sentimental comfort in it. Popularized by his vocal groups, many of his songs have even made it into church hymnals. An American soundtrack The museum highlights iconic singers, composers and choir directors in the culturally and musically distinct African American gospel lineage, too. That tradition supplied American music with its templates for catching the spirit and giving voice to profound lament and righteous conviction, and its canon  served as the soundtrack  of the Civil Rights Movement. \"Gospel music, from the negro spiritual to now, has always been a [symbol] of hope,\" said  Derek Minor, a museum honoree and gospel-schooled hip-hop artist . \"There was always an idea that God was coming back to liberate. The OG gospel artists, I don't think they were just trying to write great songs. They were trying to inspire people that were at their lowest,\" said Minor. He has his own way of carrying on that tradition. On his 2018 album  \"The Trap,\"  he brought gospel uplift to the present-day struggle to break cycles of poverty, violence and incarceration, a perspective that was met with surprise — people didn't expect that a Christian artist would depict those realities in his lyrics. \"There's a liberation that needs to happen in [this] moment as well,\" insisted Minor. \"And that's what I wanna contribute to.\" Religious/secular crossover The idea of crafting devotional versions of secular styles was around long before Minor began rhyming. The museum has a particular focus on a period in the '70s and '80s when a whole new genre began to flourish: Christian Contemporary Music (CCM). One of the largest artifacts in that section is a hulking, vintage studio console. Its inclusion came as a surprise to Brown Bannister, an engineer and producer who used it to help flesh out the sound of contemporary Christian pop. \"When I saw this in here, my heart just stopped,\" he recalled. It reminded him of the seminal soft-rocking albums he  shaped for Amy Grant  and other Christian singer-songwriters, many of whom — like Bannister himself — have since been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The sonic textures he achieved with session players evolved with popular music trends, but one particular emphasis set the CCM approach apart. \"To me, Christian music — it's not about the music, it's about the lyric. That's what differentiates,\" said Bannister. \"So you're making sure that you're serving the artists and serving the lyrics of their song and trying not to get in the way of the message. You're trying to enhance it.\" That mindset was new to Rachael Lampa, who signed her first Christian record deal in 2000 at the age of 14. Lampa is featured in an exhibit on artists who released their debut albums as teenage girls. She gravitated toward  power ballads  and  rhythmic dance tracks  that were in step with the era, but learned that having a Christian platform as a young woman meant that she was expected to be an ideal role model. (She says she once received criticism for simply wearing a tank top.) \"It's people trying to express themselves and express their experience,\" said Lampa. \"But also be a teenager, getting to know who they are in the first place and then who God is and how to talk about that, how to sing about that.\" Walking the halls of the new museum summoned moving memories for Lampa, and if it does the same for other visitors, GMA president Patillo ensured that space is set aside for their reflections. \"We're gonna give people an opportunity in a little testimonial booth where they can share how a song has impacted their lives,\" Patillo explained. \"This music is about changing us, it's about nourishing us, it's feeding our soul and our spirit. And we get to tell those stories here.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         DON GONYEA, HOST:   Gospel has always been a big part of American music. Heard in houses of worship and in homes, at concerts and on the radio. Now it's being celebrated and honored at the new Museum  of Christian and Gospel Music. From Nashville Public Radio, Jewly Hight has the story. BOBBY JONES: Now, I believe everybody knows this song. You ready? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: You bet. JONES: (Singing) Oh, happy day. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #1: (Singing) Oh, happy day. JEWLY HIGHT, BYLINE: Just blocks away from downtown Nashville's venerable churches and raucous tourist bars, Gospel legend Dr. Bobby Jones led a group of musicians, industry execs and politicians in song. They'd all gathered for the museum's ribbon-cutting ceremony. JACKIE PATILLO: People automatically assume that there is a place that celebrates Christian gospel music somewhere in America, and there isn't. HIGHT: That's Jackie Patillo, president of the Gospel Music Association. There are separate institutions devoted to Black gospel and white Southern gospel. But Patillo, the first woman of color to lead the Gospel Music Association, set out to build a more comprehensive home for Christian music. PATILLO: The word gospel music really encompasses a message with lots of different sounds. So it's been awesome to see how we've gone from the hymns to choruses to rap music and the contemporary Christian music industry. HIGHT: Steve Gilreath, the museum's executive director, helped weave those distinct lineages into one story. STEVE GILREATH: We didn't want people to come in and say, where's the Southern gospel section? - and go right to one spot and then leave. HIGHT: So he and his team grouped performers according to what they share in common. Gilreath says what's consolidated in the 11,000 square-foot museum, on the other hand, are markers of commercial success. GILREATH: We have one little area we're trying to put all the gold records in. You don't see them everywhere you go that sold millions, millions, millions. It's just not about that with this industry. HIGHT: But the first artifact visitors encounter is a trophy, the songwriter of the year honor given to Bill Gaither at the first Dove Awards ceremony in 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: The winner is Mr. Bill Gaither. (APPLAUSE) HIGHT: Gaither is known for composing Southern gospel standards that proclaim faith in a saving God and take sentimental comfort in it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BECAUSE HE LIVES\") BILL GAITHER: (Singing) Because He lives, I can face tomorrow. HIGHT: The museum also highlights pivotal singers, composers and choir directors of gospel music. That culturally and musically distinct tradition influenced the feel of so much American music and soundtracked the Civil Rights Movement. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I DON'T FEEL NOWAYS TIRED\") JAMES CLEVELAND: (Singing) I've come too far... UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #2: Yes. CLEVELAND: ...(Singing) From where I started from. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP #2: Yes. DEREK MINOR: Gospel music from the Negro spiritual till now has always been a semblance of hope. HIGHT: Derek Minor should know. His mom had him singing those songs in the church choir until he insisted on rapping instead. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GOD BLESS THE TRAP (FEAT TONY TILLMAN & THI'SL)\") MINOR: ...(Rapping) Droptop Mustang. Now you run around, Headless Horseman scene... There was always an idea that God was coming back to liberate. The OG gospel artists, I don't think they were just trying to write great songs. They were trying to inspire people that were at their lowest. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GOD BLESS THE TRAP (FEAT TONY TILLMAN & THI'SL)\") MINOR: (Rapping) They won't talk 'bout how we can't get jobs and all we got is dope. HIGHT: Just across the hall, Minor's featured in an exhibit on Christian hip-hop. MINOR: I remember when I wrote my album \"The Trap,\" people were like, a Christian artist is writing an album about the trap? But I'm like, that is where we at. There's a liberation that needs to happen in that moment as well. HIGHT: The museum dwells in a period in the '70s and '80s when Christian versions of all sorts of secular styles began to catch on. One of the largest artifacts is a rectangular hunk of vintage recording gear under glass in the rear gallery. It came as a surprise to Brown Bannister, the engineer and producer who used it to help flesh out the sound of contemporary Christian pop. BROWN BANNISTER: When I saw this in here, my heart just stopped. This was the first five years of my career, was on this console. We did the B.J. Thomas thing. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WITHOUT A DOUBT\") B J THOMAS: (Singing) Without a doubt, I finally found out. Without a doubt. BANNISTER: I produced Amy Grant's first album. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WALKING IN THE LIGHT\") AMY GRANT: (Singing) Me and Jesus did some heavy talkin' last night. BANNISTER: We did The Imperials'. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MORE EACH DAY\") THE IMPERIALS: (Singing) I had no love to call my own. HIGHT: Bannister shaped seminal soft rocking albums for Amy Grant and other Christian singer/songwriters with a specific goal. BANNISTER: To me, Christian music - it's not about the music. It's about the lyric. That's what differentiates. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THY WORD\") GRANT: (Singing) Thy word is a lamp unto my feet... BANNISTER: You're making sure that you're serving the artist and serving the lyrics of their song and trying not to get in the way of the message, you know, trying to enhance it. HIGHT: If walking these halls summons meaningful memories of these songs, there's a place for that too, says Patillo, who led the charge to build the museum. PATILLO: We're going to give people an opportunity and a little testimonial booth where they can share how a song has impacted their life 'cause this music is about changing us. It's about nourishing us, feeding our soul and our spirit. HIGHT: What unites the array of music here, says Patillo, is that spiritual sense of purpose. For NPR News, I'm Jewly Hight in Nashville. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TESTIFY\") COMMISSIONED: (Singing) Oh, that's what He's done. That's what He's done. I believe I'm going to go ahead and testify about the goodness of the Lord. Come on. I'm going to testify about your mercy and your faith. Testify. Testify. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-94444","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"13:04:00Z","title":"Spanish League Cancels Plans for Barcelona to Play Regular-Season Match in Miami","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"La Liga, Spain's top soccer league, has canceled plans for a regular-season match between Barcelona and Villarreal to be played in Miami on December 20, 2025, due to mounting domestic opposition and concerns over competitive fairness.

October 22, 2025 • 1:04 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         MADRID — The Spanish soccer league said Tuesday that plans for Barcelona to play a regular-season game against Villarreal outside Miami in December have been called off, a decision that comes following increased opposition to the match domestically. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The league said the decision was made after conversations with the promoter of the planned Dec. 20 match and cited the \"uncertainty that has arisen in Spain over the past few weeks.\" Game promoter Relevent said it informed La Liga of the need to \"postpone the planned match\" because \"there is insufficient time to properly execute an event of this scale.\" It added that \"it would also be irresponsible to begin selling tickets without a confirmed match in place.\" The league had finally succeeded in getting approval from soccer bodies such as UEFA and the Spanish federation to stage its first regular-season game abroad. But opposition by players, some clubs and fans had grown recently in Spain. The Spanish league \"deeply regrets that this project, which represented a historic and unparalleled opportunity for the international expansion of Spanish soccer, will not be able to move forward.\" The league said \"holding an official match outside our borders would have been a decisive step in the global growth of the competition, strengthening the international presence of clubs, the positioning of players, and the visibility of Spanish soccer in a strategic market such as the United States.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It said \"the project fully complied with all federative regulations and did not affect the integrity of the competition, as confirmed by the competent institutions responsible for ensuring compliance, which opposed it for other reasons.\" But the criticism against the game had grown recently, with players protesting during the weekend league games by standing still for a few seconds after kickoff. Earlier Tuesday, Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois criticized Spanish league president Javier Tebas and complained about the league's decision to censor the protests by the players. The television feed of games switched before kickoff to an exterior view of the stadiums and only showed part of the fields from distance. Madrid has been one of the clubs most loudly protesting against the game, saying it would alter the fairness of the competition. Villarreal was officially the home team for the match that was set to be played at Hard Rock Stadium. \"Teams should play home and away,\" Courtois said. \"It's not the same to play against a team at home and away. It's hard to play on the road in the Spanish league. Playing on the road at Villarreal's field is very tough. Every team has to play at home and away unless there is a major reason for that not to happen.\" Barcelona and Villarreal were on board with playing the game abroad. Villarreal fans would be able to travel to the match free of charge, and those who chose not to attend would receive a hefty discount on their season ticket. Barcelona said it respected the decision but regretted \"the missed opportunity to expand the competition's image in a strategic market with the capacity for growth and resource generation for the benefit of all.\" \"The club appreciates the support and unconditional affection it has received from our fans in the United States and deeply regrets that they are unable to attend the official match in the country,\" Barcelona said in a statement.

Some software engineers are skeptical \n         By Huo Jingnan \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 9:17 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Tech CEOs are making ambitious claims about AI's coding capabilities. In March, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei  said  \"we'll be there in three to six months — where AI is writing 90% of the code.\" Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg  predicted  in April that for one project \"in the next year probably … maybe half the development is going to be done by AI.\" Executives of  Amazon ,  Google  and  Microsoft  have also highlighted large language models' (LLMs') abilities to generate code. AI tools have changed how coding works for some developers and there are now  fewer  of the most junior software engineers. But despite the dramatic rhetoric, AI in software engineering might not mean a new age of automation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       After months of sitting on the sidelines, software engineer Colton Voege finally tried out AI tools for his work. He remembered watching a podcast where leaders of tech startup incubator Y Combinator, which helped Voege launch a  company , touted AI's \"incredible productivity.\" \"It kind of confirmed what I already felt about it, in that it's really good at shortcutting certain things,\" Voege said. \"[AI] is great for writing little tools that you'll use once and then throw away.\" But he hasn't seen evidence of long-term boosts to his efficiency. Interviews show that many software engineers, though not all, share Voege's experience. Some tell stories of untangling AI-generated code their colleagues have handed them, others talk about the pressure to make up work that purports to use AI to make higher-ups happy. Yes, AI can write code ... but still needs people In an interview with NPR, Boris Cherny, head of Anthropic's Claude Code unit, said \"most code is written by Claude Code,\" but declined to provide a percentage. \"We're still working on the science to make sure we can give a really precise number.\" Cherny was also clear that no matter how much AI is actually used, \"Every line of code should be reviewed by an engineer.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He said this includes code generated by what Anthropic called \"agents.\" Agents are a component of AI tools that have the ability to test and rewrite code without human intervention. The function, hailed as much more autonomous than previous tools, was first introduced by Claude Code and was celebrated   by many in the industry as a pathway to automation. But agents don't always work. \"When these tools are at their best, they'll auto resolve a lot of issues. ... When they're at their worst, they will go into like death spirals,\" said Voege, describing situations where the tools, far from resolving the issue at hand, get stuck in a testing loop. \"I'm like, oh no, you're way off.\" Cherny did not shy away from describing Claude like a somewhat high functioning person. \"I think a good mental model [is that] it's like an expert programmer that's sitting next to you,\" he said. While he said it can serve as a \"thought partner\" in some cases, \"in the end, it's a human that's doing the work.\" Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who was invited to preview OpenAI's latest model, said it's plausible that AI could write a high percentage of code. However, Willison said, \"I think they'll still need the same or even more humans involved in that process.\" That's because AI cannot think through higher-level problem solving like engineers do. \"Our job is not to type code into a computer. Our job is to deliver systems that solve problems.\" Willison said. For Willison, who is known in the software world for tinkering with new tools and developing open-source ones, the productivity bump from using AI depends on choosing appropriate uses and having relevant expertise. \"I am comfortable saying that for certain tasks, [for] programmers who are experienced programmers — those who can work without AI — with AI, they can get two to five times [the] productivity boost, sometimes more, depending on the specific task.\" Willison later wrote in his blog that the teams that benefit the most appear to adopt best practices in software development and collaboration. But that's not always what happens in real life. People are using AI regardless of whether it's needed, which sometimes results in more work for their colleagues. Researchers coined the term \" workslop \" to describe this. \"A very high level engineer at the company was kind of very gung ho about AI coding and thought he could kind of get this very complicated project done very, very quickly on his own and tried running some AI tools,\" said one engineer at Amazon who is not authorized to speak publicly. \"[It] produced this just kind of messy blob of code that didn't work and nobody understood it. And the thing I'm working on now is just trying to actually do it kind of the old way.\" All this might explain why studies show mixed results when it comes to AI's impact. According to  a study  by AI evaluation nonprofit  METR , experienced open-source software engineers who used LLMs ended up taking 19% longer to complete their tasks compared to peers who did not — contrary to the engineers' own expectations. In a national  survey  in Denmark, software engineers self-reported to have saved 6.5% of their time with AI. It was the highest of the 11 professions, which averaged out to 2.5%. \"I'd definitely take 3% any day. It's like annual productivity growth in a typical occupation,\" said Anders Humlum, co-author of the Denmark study. \"It's not nothing, but I would call it modest relative to the experiments.\" Engineers agree that AI shines more where accuracy matters less. \"Knocking out a quick illustrated prototype would take me an hour [before] and now it takes me five minutes because I could just tell Claude to bash something [together],\" said Willison. \"The fact that it's going to make mistakes and stuff doesn't really matter too much.\" AI has helped cut back on some repetitive coding tasks at work, said Thomas Ptacek, a software developer at the cloud infrastructure company, fly.io. \"Because I've written [a piece of code] many times before … I can also look at that code very quickly and get a sense of whether it's crazy or not.\" Little room for disagreement The Amazon software engineer said management encouraged staff to use AI in all parts of their work, even when there wasn't a case for using it. \"It is very much a solution in search of problems much of the time,\" the engineer said. The engineer said that all this is fostering a sense that there is little room for disagreement. \"You have to use it more and it has to make you more efficient. If you're not, then you're doing something incorrectly.\" That said, the engineer also said the rhetoric's tangible effects on work and promotion vary across the organization. Amazon isn't the only tech company that appears to make assumptions about AI's effects on code. In a memo  first reported by 404 Media and Wired , a Meta executive called for his department to achieve \"5X productivity\" in software as well as a broad set of other functions using AI. \"The more we push ourselves, the more we'll unlock,\" he wrote in the memo. Two engineers  were fired  from an AI startup in San Francisco for not using an AI coding tool enough,  The Information  reported. Both the Amazon software engineer and Voege said they aren't the only engineers skeptical of AI in their workplace. A recent Google  survey  of software engineers across different countries and industries showed that while use of AI is near universal and improves aspects of software development, about half of respondents \"somewhat\" trusted AI's response, and 30% chose \"a little\" or \"not at all.\" Many are also worried about employers replacing junior coders with AI, effectively cutting off the long-term talent supply that's needed to supervise the machines in the years to come. Others raise concerns about the massive amount of electricity and content made by humans that the largest models consume, even as dramatic capability improvements have begun to seem elusive. In a statement to NPR, Amazon spokesperson Tom Parnell said its in-house AI tools \"help engineers move faster, ship more secure code, and spend less time on busywork\" and that through surveys \"engineers tell us these tools help them save time and feel more productive.\" He also said that the company does not mandate AI use, and cannot share what percentage of its software engineers regularly use large language model tools, but it believes \"these tools can help developers work more efficiently.\" Voege has since left his job and is now again thinking about starting his own business. He was floored by how much his old funder Y Combinator has gone from supporting different kinds of technologies to focusing solely on AI. He looked at the organization's latest request for startups. \"It's just AI, AI, AI, five out of five.\" \n         \n         Correction \n         Oct. 21st, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story misstated the name of Anders Humlum as Anders Hulum.  \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/defense-department-pentagon-hegseth-congress-c15a2050aa95998f28e31a6b5c1d287a","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"03:09:10+00:00","title":"Pentagon Implements New Rules on Communications with Congress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In October 2025, the Pentagon, under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Deputy Steve Feinberg, introduced a new policy requiring all military officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—to obtain prior approval from the Department’s Legislative Affairs Office before engaging with Congress.

In an Oct. 15 memo, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his deputy, Steve Feinberg, ordered Pentagon officials — including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — to obtain permission from the department’s main legislative affairs office before they have any communication with Capitol Hill. The memo was issued the same day the vast majority of  Pentagon reporters exited the building  rather than agree to the Defense Department’s new restrictions on their work, and it appears to be part of a broader effort by Hegseth to exert tighter control over what the department communicates to the outside world.

arrested for allegedly threatening to kill Hakeem Jeffries \n         By Barbara Sprunt \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 5:26 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A man who was pardoned by President Trump after storming the U.S. Capitol in 2021 has been arrested on a charge that he threatened to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. New York State Police  say  Christopher Moynihan was arrested after they were advised by the FBI that he had made \"threats to kill a member of Congress.\" Court documents show his arrest came after he allegedly texted that he planned to kill Jeffries, the top Democrat in the House.   Court records show that on or about October 17, Moynihan allegedly sent texts in which he threatened Jeffries' life, writing \"I will kill him for the future.\" \"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live,\" one message reads, according to the criminal complaint. \"Even if I am hated he must be eliminated,\" reads another. Moynihan, 34, was arraigned in local court in Clinton, N.Y. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center \"in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond.\" He is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday.  He faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat. In a  statement  Tuesday, Jeffries noted Moynihan was pardoned on Trump's first day in office. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Since the blanket pardon that occurred earlier this year, many of the criminals released have committed additional crimes throughout the country,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, our brave men and women in law enforcement are being forced to spend their time keeping our communities safe from these violent individuals who should never have been pardoned.\" Moynihan  was sentenced  in 2023 to 21 months incarceration, 36 months supervised release. He received a full pardon, along with more than 1,500 other defendants who were charged with crimes related to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  On that day, Moynihan can be heard on a video captured inside the Senate floor saying, \"There's got to be something we can use against these f***ing scumbags.''\" While many people had no record prior to committing crimes on Jan. 6,  NPR identified dozens of defendants with prior convictions  for crimes including rape, sexual abuse of a minor, domestic violence, manslaughter, production of child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking. That includes Matthew Huttle, who was shot and killed by law enforcement during a traffic stop in Indiana days after receiving a pardon. Moynihan's arrest comes amid rising threats to lawmakers. The Capitol Police told NPR in a statement in September that its agents were on track to work through roughly 14,000 threat assessment cases by the end of the year, a dramatic spike from case workloads in previous years. NPR's Sam Gringlas contributed to this report. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-10-21-2025-29925b9671834bba6e24adb5f2e35b51","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-12","timeOfPublication":"20:30:15+05:30","title":"Supreme Court Reaffirms Presumption of Innocence and Fair Trial Principles in Criminal Proceedings","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court of India delivered a landmark judgment reinforcing fundamental principles of justice in criminal law.

Vance noted  flareups of violence in recent days  but said the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that began on Oct. 10 is going “better than I expected.” The Trump administration’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, added that “we are exceeding where we thought we would be at this time.” They visited a new center in Israel for civilian and military cooperation as questions remain over the long-term plan for peace, including when and how an international security force will deploy to Gaza and who will govern the territory after the war.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Vance tried to downplay any idea that his visit — his first as vice president — was urgently arranged to keep the ceasefire in place.

reason for the decision. Israeli media said Hanegbi had opposed the renewal of Israel’s Gaza offensive in March, and Israel’s failed attempt to assassinate Hamas’ leadership in an airstrike in Qatar in September. In a statement, Hanegbi noted “times of disagreement” with Netanyahu.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Hamas hands over remains of 2 more hostages \n    \n     \n\n\n    \n     \n     \n \n     \n         \n                 \n             \n         \n                 \n             \n     \n     \n         \n         \n     \n     \n \n    \n    \n        \n             \n                 \n                    AP AUDIO: Vance is optimistic about Gaza ceasefire but notes ‘very hard’ work to come\n                 \n             \n        \n    \n    \n     AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Israel. \n    \n Late Tuesday, Israel’s military said the remains of two more Gaza hostages had been returned to Israel, where they would be identified. Since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, the remains of 15 hostages have been returned to Israel. Another 13 still need to be recovered in Gaza and handed over. On his visit to Israel Tuesday, Vance urged a “little bit of patience” amid Israeli frustration with Hamas’ pace of returning the hostages. “Some of these hostages are buried under thousands of pounds of rubble. Some of the hostages, nobody even knows where they are,” Vance said. Israel is releasing 15 Palestinian bodies for the remains of each dead hostage, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It said Tuesday that Israel had so far transferred 165 bodies since earlier this month. As he faced journalists’ questions over the ceasefire’s next steps, he said “a lot of this work is very hard” and urged flexibility. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Once we’ve got to a point where both the Gazans and our Israeli friends can have some measure of security, then we’ll worry about what the long-term governance of Gaza is,” he said. “Let’s focus on security, rebuilding, giving people some food and medicine.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Vice President J.D.

Residents said prices for essential goods soared on Sunday after militants killed two Israeli soldiers and Israel responded with strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians. Israel also threatened to halt humanitarian aid. At a market in the central city of Deir al-Balah, a 25-kilogram (55-pound) package of flour was selling for more than $70 on Sunday, up from about $12 shortly after the ceasefire. By Tuesday, the price was around $30. Mohamed al-Faqawi, a Khan Younis resident, accused merchants of taking advantage of the perilous security situation. “They are exploiting us,” he said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n On Monday, Hamas said its security forces raided shops across Gaza, closing some and forcing merchants to lower prices. Hamas also has allowed aid trucks to move safely and halted  looting of  deliveries. Nahed Sheheiber, head of Gaza’s private truckers’ union, said there was no stealing aid since the ceasefire started. But other significant challenges remain as Gaza’s  financial system is in tatters . With nearly every bank branch and ATM inoperable, people pay exorbitant commissions to a network of cash brokers to get money for daily expenses. On Tuesday, dozens of people in Deir al-Balah spent hours in line at the Bank of Palestine hoping to access their money but were turned away. “Without having the bank open and without money, it does not matter that the prices (in the market) have dropped,” said Kamilia Al-Ajez. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Israeli soldiers move on top of a tank along the Israeli-Gaza border as seen from southern Israel, Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025.

Dr. Muneer al-Boursh, the health ministry’s general director, said on social media late Monday that some had evidence of being bound with ropes and metal shackles, and had deep wounds and crushed limbs. It was not immediately clear if any of the bodies had been prisoners; they are returned without identification or details on how they died. The bodies could include Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody or bodies taken out of Gaza by Israeli troops during the war. The Israel Prisons Service denied that prisoners had been mistreated, saying it had followed legal procedures and provided medical care and “adequate living conditions.” Israeli hostages released from Gaza have also reported metal shackles and harsh conditions, including frequent beatings and starvation. In the 2023 attack on Israel that started the war, Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people as hostages. The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Lidman from Tel Aviv.

know about Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister \n         By Rachel Treisman \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 12:59 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Japan's  first-ever female prime minister , Sanae Takaichi, is a conservative with a traditional view of gender roles and a penchant for heavy metal music. Japan's parliament elected Takaichi on Tuesday, several weeks after she was  chosen to lead  the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has spent much of the last seven decades in power. The LDP is seen as shifting further to the right: It was only able to elect Takaichi by forming an alliance with a right-wing populist party, after losing its longtime coalition partner earlier this month. Takaichi, 64, is \"one of the most conservative people in Japan's conservative LDP,\" explains Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She has advocated for tougher immigration restrictions and embraced hawkish policies on China. She has drawn comparisons to the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for whom she has frequently expressed her admiration and often wears blue suits in tribute. But she also played drums in a band in college, cites Deep Purple and Iron Maiden as some of her favorite bands, once  belted a rock anthem  on national TV and appears to maintain a strong affinity  for motorcycles  and  cars . \"Those are part of the character that is promoted by her, that [she is] more than just the strong Iron Lady, but also somebody who can have some fun,\" Hall says. Here's what else to know about Japan's new leader. 1. She isn't from a political family Takaichi was born and raised in the central Japanese prefecture of Nara. Her dad worked for an automotive firm, while her mom worked for the local police department. \"Unlike most or many of the politicians in her party who became prime ministers, she came from rather modest means,\" Hall says. \"But she did study very hard when she was young, and she passed the entrance exams for some very elite private universities in Japan.\" But he said Takaichi's parents refused to pay for her tuition to an elite university, preferring that she attend a two-year college to save money and live closer to home. She ended up attending Kobe University, a prestigious national university, paying her own way through part-time jobs and making the six-hour round-trip commute from her parents' house. In 1987, Takaichi moved to the U.S. to work as a congressional fellow in the office of  Rep. Pat Schroeder , a Democrat from Colorado — despite her own conservative leanings, Hall notes. After returning to Japan, she was able to market herself as an expert in international politics and secure a job as a television presenter. \"And from there, she segued away from being a TV personality into a politician, which is a common path in Japan,\" Hall says. \"If you're famous on TV, you have a pretty good chance of winning elections.\" 2. She's spent decades in politics  Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993, representing her hometown of Nara as an independent. She joined the LDP three years later and went on to serve in a number of key government positions, including minister of economic security. Notably, she served as the minister of international communications — which is responsible for telecommunications policy and broadcast media regulations — under the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, from 2014 to 2017 and again from 2019 to 2020. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"She served in that, I think, longer than any other politician has ever served, because the Abe administration was a very long administration and he valued her competency,\" Hall says. Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 2006 to 2007 and 2012 to 2020, before his  assassination in 2022 . He was known for his efforts to revitalize Japan's economy — nicknamed \"Abenomics\" — and rebuild its role on the global stage. Takaichi \"definitely depicts herself as the successor to Abe's conservative legacy,\" Hall says, noting that she did get his endorsement in the party's 2021 leadership election. \"I'm not sure how close friends they were, but they definitely were on the same page ideologically when it came to issues like China and the revisionist view of World War II that many of the ultra-conservatives in Japan have,\" he said. 3. Her views have caused controversy Takaichi subscribes to modern monetary theory, \"which says that you can engage in deficit spending on important things like defense and other parts of the budget,\" Hall says. While she is not as traditionally fiscally conservative as others in her party, he says, she is extremely conservative on social issues. For instance, she wants to create programs to promote having children and doesn't think women should be allowed to keep their maiden names after marriage (even though she has used hers in professional and public life). \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She also has what Hall describes as hardline views on Japan's WWII history. In remarks over the years, she has downplayed Japan's aggression during the war and criticized the  war crimes trials  that the Allies held afterward to convict Japan's wartime leaders. Takaichi has been known to regularly visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, though she has recently refrained from doing so to avoid political and diplomatic backlash. Yasukuni is a controversial Shinto shrine that honors the spirits of Japan's war dead, including some convicted war criminals from World War II. Takaichi has also courted controversy with her disdain for immigrants and even tourists, a  rapidly growing industry  in Japan. While campaigning, she cited unconfirmed reports of tourists  kicking sacred deer in Nara Park , part of a larger criticism of tourism that many saw as xenophobic. \"It also ties into a general dislike of foreign people and also immigrants who live in the country,\" Hall says. She has advocated for an  anti-espionage law , suggesting that Chinese residents of Japan could be potential spies for China's government. During her campaign, she  called for restrictions  on non-Japanese people buying property in Japan and a crackdown on illegal immigration. \"People who are very anti-immigration are sort of smiling on her becoming prime minister, expecting that she will do something about it,\" Hall says, adding he thinks that is unlikely because of pressure from Japanese businesses who rely on immigration in the face of  significant labor shortages . 4. She's not necessarily a feminist  Takaichi holds a notable place in the history books as the first female prime minister of a country where women only held  about 10% of seats  in parliament as of 2024. Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in terms of gender equality — the lowest of any Group of Seven nation — according to the World Economic Forum (WEF)'s 2025  Global Gender Gap Report . However, Takaichi appears unlikely to prioritize issues of gender equality. She has long advocated for traditional gender roles, opposes same-sex marriage and supports male-only succession to the Japanese throne. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"This is not going to be a period when women's equality or other gender issues are aggressively advanced,\" Hall says. \"But there is, I guess, some benefit to having a woman as the leader of your country, to show … young women that in the future they could become prime minister, too.\" Takaichi has spoken about women's rights, specifically  advocating for the expansion  of hospital services for women's health and opening up about her own  struggles with menopause  symptoms. Takaichi has also spoken about her struggles to conceive; She has no biological children, but is a stepmother to three kids — and grandmother to four — from her husband's previous marriage. (She is married to former member of parliament and fellow LDP member  Taku Yamamoto , who legally took her last name, a relative rarity in Japan.) Takaichi had promised on the campaign trail to increase the number of women in her cabinet to \" Nordic levels ,\" or  closer to 50% . But in the hours after taking office, she  appointed only two . Hall says Takaichi has had to be more conservative than her male colleagues in order to take the helm of the party. While she and her role model Margaret Thatcher differ in their approaches to fiscal policy, he says both are conservative, hawkish and \"do not want to be seen as weak.\" \"She maybe, in a way, has modeled her rise on Margaret Thatcher by being this very strong figure, despite coming [up] in a party of very conservative men who generally do not promote women to the highest positions,\" he adds. 5. She appears friendly toward Trump Takaichi has indicated a friendliness toward President Trump, who called her \"a highly respected person of great wisdom and strength\" in a  social media post  earlier this month congratulating her on her rise to party leadership and her expected ascension to prime minister. She responded with a post of her own, writing in both English and Japanese that she is \"truly hoping to work together with President Trump to make our alliance even stronger & more prosperous, and to advance a Free and Open Indo-Pacific.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Hall says Trump likely has a good first impression of Takaichi already, because of her reputation as an \"anti-immigration, hard-line conservative who is a respecter of his late friend Shinzo Abe.\" Abe was one of the first foreign leaders to cultivate a relationship with Trump during his first term. The  two became friends  as they bonded over wagyu beef burgers, sumo wrestling and golf. Trump is expected to meet Takaichi on a visit to Japan later this month. Hall predicts she will follow the same playbook as her predecessors: \"You be as nice as possible to the president, you show him the maximum respect, you do not have public disagreements with him,\" he says. \"And when you do disagree over policy, you do it in a very subtle way that doesn't seem like you're telling the president he's wrong.\" \n         \n         CORRECTION \n         Oct. 22nd, 2025 \n         A previous version of this story mischaracterized the Yasukuni Shrine. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/beef-prices-cattle-imports-trump-argentina-9f8e9efd6e74e958c586ea1e32797ba2","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"20:51:59+00:00","title":"Trump’s Beef Import Plan Faces Rancher and Expert Pushback","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump's proposal to lower U.S. beef prices by increasing imports from Argentina is facing strong opposition from American ranchers and agricultural experts.

2025-10-21T20:51:59+00:00\n\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) —  President Donald Trump  ’s plan to cut record beef prices by importing more  meat from Argentina  is running into heated opposition from U.S. ranchers who are enjoying some rare profitable years and skepticism from experts who say the president’s move probably wouldn’t lead to cheaper prices at grocery stores. The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association along with the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America and other farming groups — who are normally some of the president’s biggest supporters —  all criticized  Trump’s idea because of what it could do to American ranchers and feedlot operators. And agricultural economists say Argentine beef accounts for such a small slice of beef imports — only about 2% — that even doubling that wouldn’t change prices much.  South Dakota rancher Brett Kenzy said he wants American consumers to determine whether beef is too expensive, not the government. And so far there is little sign that consumers are substituting chicken or other proteins for beef on their shopping lists even though the average price of a pound of ground beef hit its highest point ever at $6.32 in the  latest report  before the government shutdown began. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I love ‘Make America Great Again’ rhetoric.

In part, that small herd is due to years of drought and low cattle prices.  \n    \n     ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. \n    \n \n Beef imports also are down overall because of the  50% tariffs that Trump imposed  on Brazil, a big beef exporter, and limits on Mexico, where the country is fighting a flesh-eating pest.  \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Kansas State University agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said Argentina can’t produce enough beef to offset those other losses of imports.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Through July, the United States has imported 72.5 million pounds of Argentine beef while producing more than 15 billion pounds of beef. Much of what is imported is lean beef trimmings that meatpackers mix with fattier beef produced in the United States to produce the varieties of ground beef that domestic consumers want, so any change in imports would affect primarily hamburger. Steak prices that were  averaging $12.22 per pound  probably wouldn’t change much. Idea creates uncertainty among US ranchers Even if increased imports from Argentina won’t reduce prices, the idea creates uncertainty for ranchers, making them less likely to invest in raising more cattle.  “We’re always going to have uncertainty in the world. But the more uncertain something is, the less likely most are to put money on the line,” Tonsor said. Argentine livestock producers like Augusto Wallace are excited about the prospect of selling more beef to America because he said “whenever an additional buyer comes, it’s beneficial for everyone, right? For all the producers.” But economists caution that exporting too much beef could backfire for Argentina because that would drive up prices for consumers there. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n American ranchers say the idea of boosting imports from Argentina runs counter to the stated purpose of Trump’s tariffs to encourage more domestic production and help American ranchers compete. “It’s a contradiction of what we believed his new course of action was. We thought he was on the right track,” said the president of R-CALF, Bill Bullard, who hoped Trump’s policies would discourage imports and encourage ranchers to expand their herds. Texas A&M livestock economist David Anderson said “ranchers are finally getting prices that are going to make up for some really bad years in the past with the drought, low prices and high costs. We finally get some good prices. And we start talking about government policy to bring down prices.” Bryant Kagay, part owner of Kagay Farms in Amity, Missouri, said he thinks the plan would hurt ranchers. Cattle prices that had been averaging around $3,000 for a 1,250-pound animal slipped more than $100 immediately after Trump mentioned the idea of intervening in beef prices last week, though they have recovered a bit since then.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Ranchers hope Trump changes his mind Although Kagay voted for Trump in the last election, he worries the trade war is hurting farmers and ranchers by driving up costs and  costing them major markets  like China. “I continue to see things that I don’t really think are in the best interest of our country and the average citizen,” Kagay said. “I guess I hope he starts to see that and quits worrying about punishing opponents and winning whatever battle he’s involved in, and then tries to do what’s best for everybody.” Ranchers are hopeful Trump will reconsider this plan. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Tuesday on CNBC that the administration remains committed to helping ranchers prosper while trying to reduce consumer prices. She promised more details soon about the Argentina plan and a larger effort to reinvigorate U.S. beef production by opening up more land and opening new processing plants while securing trade deals for new markets. The administration wants ranchers to raise more cattle and produce more beef. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The bigger supply — even aligned with a bigger demand — is going to allow those prices to come down, but also to have a vital industry for these ranchers to be able to survive, which is what we’ve got to do,” Rollins said. Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, said Tuesday that after talking to Trump and others in the administration, he expected to see more details about the policy. “It’s very important that we support our cattle ranchers,” Hoeven said. Rancher Cory Eich, who lives near Epiphany, South Dakota, said he doesn’t consider the Argentina idea a serious threat in the long term and doubts ranchers will make changes to their operation in light of the news. “Nobody’s happy about it, let’s put it that way,” Eich said. “Personal opinion, I thought it was kind of a ruse when he mentioned it. I mean, it’s coming from Trump, so take everything there with a grain of salt.” ___ Funk reported from Omaha, Nebraska.

EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         AMMAN, Jordan — Israel, having banned the United Nations aid agency for Palestinian refugees from sending aid and staff to Gaza, is now taking unprecedented steps to de-register major nongovernmental aid groups for ideological reasons, according to several officials of   humanitarian organizations. They say the new rules threaten the ability of some of the biggest international nongovernmental organizations — known as INGOs — to send in aid or staff to both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"INGOs are in limbo — most who have submitted have either been not accepted or rejected,\" an official with an aid organization that is aware of the situation said of the application process required for nongovernmental aid organizations operating in Gaza and the West Bank. The official spoke on the condition that NPR not name their employer and not give their name because they are not authorized to speak publicly. The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza war brokered this month by President Trump committed Israel to a surge in aid into Gaza, where food security experts  declared famine  in parts of the territory. But Israel continues to severely restrict crossings open for aid shipments and who can send aid through them. Of seven Israeli border crossings with Gaza, only two are currently open. Of those that are open, the U.N. and nongovernmental aid groups say many requests to enter Gaza are routinely rejected, without explanation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Israeli military has claimed, without providing evidence, that its aid restrictions are needed for security. Israel this fall began requiring that all international aid groups re-register  under new criteria , including approval by a committee which includes representatives from Israel's Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism. Reasons for delisting aid groups include supporting \"terrorist groups and activities in accordance with Israel law\" and \"inciting racism,\" according to COGAT, the Israeli military's arm that is part of NGO approval process. Aid organizations say the reasoning appears to be used to refer to a wide variety of comments the Israeli government classifies as antisemitic. Israel has in the past accused some aid groups and medical providers of being terrorist organizations. Israel had also demanded that organizations provide personnel details for all local and international staff, a measure rejected by most major aid groups as potentially putting staff in danger. The Norwegian Refugee Council, registered in Gaza since 2009, is one of the major aid groups unable to send in supplies or staff while its application is being considered. \"We quickly realized that the intent behind the process wasn't to facilitate the re-registration of humanitarian INGOs but rather to find a way to re-register us and to remove our ability to operate,\" says Ivan Karakashian, communications manager for the NRC in Jerusalem. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He says there were no clear guidelines as to what delegitimizing Israel included. Any de-registered organizations would have to cease operations in both Gaza and the Israeli occupied West Bank within 60 days, according to aid officials familiar with the criteria. The Israeli military arm responsible for borders and coordination with INGO operations did not respond to NPR's requests for comment on reasons for de-registering or delaying registration of some organizations. Many of those aid groups waiting to be re-registered have had hundreds of trucks waiting for months in Egypt and Jordan intended for Gaza. Humanitarian officials said at least one major U.S.-based NGO has already been de-registered and is now in the appeal process. The organization in question declined to discuss the issue with NPR. Another U.S.-based aid group, Mercy Corps, said following the ceasefire agreement, it had submitted a request to send in aid but it was denied by Israeli authorities because the organization was in the process of re-registering. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Humanitarian officials said Israel has approved a dozen NGOs that do not coordinate within traditional U.N.-led structures and are either ideologically driven or have little experience in humanitarian aid or both. They include one U.S. aid group that partnered with the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a militarized aid response in which almost all other aid groups refused to participate. COGAT did not respond to a request for comment on new aid organizations given registration. At the same time, Israel continues to ban the U.N. agency for providing aid to Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, from sending in aid or staff to Gaza. Israel accused UNRWA, without evidence, of employing hundreds of Hamas members, including some involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel. It has sought since the start of the Gaza war to replace the U.N. aid system that has provided humanitarian assistance there for decades. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       UNRWA, with 12,000 local staff, was the biggest humanitarian organization in Gaza, running shelters, mobile medical clinics, water and sanitation projects and schools. \"The warehouses in Jordan and Egypt are full of food that can feed the entire population of Gaza for three months and we need to bring that in,\" says Tamara Alrifai, UNRWA's director of external relations. The supplies also include medicine, tents, blankets and hygiene products. Israeli airstrikes have damaged or destroyed  more than 90% of homes  in Gaza and most of the civilian infrastructure, according to U.N. figures. The United States, which had been UNRWA's biggest donor, stopped its funding last year, which Alrifai says led to a loss of about one-quarter of UNRWA's total income. Alrifai says while European and other countries have increased their contributions, it does not fill the funding gap. The European Union's top humanitarian aid official said after the Israeli accusations against UNRWA  he saw no evidence from Israel  backing them. Alrifai says UNRWA was trying to start discussions with the U.S. through other countries about renewing the funding. \"We have not had direct talks but we have passed on messages through other governments who are close to Gaza and close to the U.S.\" she says. Aya Batrawy contributed reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Israeli strikes in Gaza continue despite its military pulling back troops under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that took effect last week. Today, an attack killed a Palestinian family of 11, including seven children and three women. Israel also committed under the ceasefire to dramatically increase the amount of aid it allows in. Aid groups say that isn't happening. NPR's Jane Arraf joins us now. Jane, thanks for being with us. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Thank you, Scott. SIMON: What's happened in this attack, and what's happening with the ceasefire? ARRAF: Well, Gaza Civil Defense authorities say this was one of the many families returning to inspect the ruins of their home in Gaza City when Israeli forces fired a tank round at their minibus. The Israeli military said that the family was behind the yellow line where its troops are positioned and that they fired on it because they were an imminent threat. That yellow line, Scott, is visible on the map, we have to note, but not so much to families on the ground. And the ceasefire itself, it's still holding overall, but Israel still controls more than 50% of Gaza territory. It says it plans to mark that yellow line with a physical barrier. SIMON: Israel also pledged to allow 600 aid trucks per day into Gaza. Has that happened? ARRAF: It hasn't. The U.N. says that 600 is the bare minimum to keep people from starving, to provide shelter and repair infrastructure in what is a totally devastated territory. Israel is still keeping shut one of those main border crossings, Rafah, which is Egypt's border crossing with Gaza. And that's where many hundreds of trucks have been waiting for months to be allowed in. It has been allowing aid through two other crossings. But there, it's a bit of a numbers game because Israel refers to all trucks as aid trucks. So just to give you an example, two days ago, the figures show 950 trucks entered Gaza. But a Trump administration official shed some light on that. It appears that only about 10% of that figure were U.N. or international aid organizations, and most of the rest were commercial imports. Those are imports from Israel, by the way. SIMON: And the United Nations has urged Israel to allow the aid organization with which it partners to continue to send aid into Gaza. Help us understand that. ARRAF: Yeah. That's a huge issue which hasn't received a lot of attention. The U.N. doesn't need to be registered, but international nongovernmental organizations, INGOs, do. And Israel this year said it would shut down aid groups that didn't reregister under the new criteria, so it's begun that process. This criteria has a committee that determines whether the organizations have delegitimized Israel through statements or anything else. Here's Ivan Karakashian, the communications manager at the Norwegian Refugee Council in Jerusalem. IVAN KARAKASHIAN: We quickly realized that this wasn't - the intent behind the process wasn't to facilitate the reregistration of INGOs, of humanitarian INGOs, but rather to find a way to deregister us - right? - and to remove our ability to operate within the occupied Palestinian territory. ARRAF: He says his organization is in the process of trying to reregister, and that also applies to some of the biggest U.S. aid groups. If they don't, if they can't, that means they're shut down. SIMON: Jane, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, was the biggest provider of aid in Gaza for decades before Israel banned staff and shipments there. Is that expected to change? ARRAF: Israel hasn't given any indication it's lifting that ban. It had claimed - without evidence - that hundreds of UNRWA staff are Hamas. And the U.S. also cut funding to UNRWA. Some of that funding, but not all of it, was made up by other countries. I spoke with UNRWA's head of external relations, Tamara Alrifai, and here's what she had to say. TAMARA ALRIFAI: We still are trying to work our way back into discussions with the U.S. You know how they say it takes a village? It takes an international community to want the situation in Gaza, in the occupied Palestinian territory and in the region to be stable. ARRAF: UNRWA has been banned by Israel from sending in supplies since March. It has warehouses in Egypt and here in Jordan full of food that UNRWA says could feed the entire population of Gaza for three months. SIMON: NPR's Jane Arraf. Thanks so much. ARRAF: Thank you. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/peanut-allergy-children-infants-anaphylaxis-9a6df6377a622d05e47c340c5a9cffc8","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"04:01:17+00:00","title":"Early Peanut Introduction in Infants Reduces Allergy Rates in U.S. Children","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A decade after the LEAP trial showed that introducing peanuts to infants early in life reduces the risk of developing food allergies, new research confirms that this practice has made a significant real-world impact, with a 27% to 40% drop in peanut allergy rates among young children in the U.S. since 2015.

that feeding peanut products to young babies could  prevent development  of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world. Peanut allergies began to decline in the U.S. after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months. The rate of peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 fell by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015, and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017. “That’s a remarkable thing, right?” said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study  published Monday  in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn’t implemented this public health effort,” he added. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 California restaurants will have to disclose food allergens on their menus under new law \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 California bill would require restaurants to disclose food allergens on menus \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n About 60,000 children have avoided food allergies since 2015, including 40,000 children who otherwise would have developed peanut allergies.

For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King’s College London, published the groundbreaking  Learning Early About Peanut Allergy,  or LEAP, trial. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence. The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow. Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found. Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings. The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University. However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on. “This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research & Education, or FARE. The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions. “It doesn’t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietitian and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her two young sons. At first, Leon’s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed. “As a dietitian, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it’s done now, these are the new guidelines,’ I just though, OK, well, this is what we’re going to do.” ___ This story has been corrected to report that about 40,000 children have avoided peanut allergies after doctors began recommending introducing the peanuts to babies, not 60,000.  ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

gender to be returned to school libraries on some military bases \n         By Elizabeth Blair \n        \n           Tuesday, October 21, 2025 • 12:26 PM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         A federal judge ordered the Department of Defense Monday to return books about gender and race back to five school libraries on military bases. In April, 12 students at schools on military bases in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy and Japan claimed their First Amendment rights had been violated when nearly 600 books were removed from the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools they attend. The students are the children of active duty service members ranging from pre-K to 11th grade. The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Kentucky, and the ACLU of Virginia filed a motion on behalf of the families requesting the return of \"all books and curriculum already quarantined or removed based on potential violation of the Executive Orders.\" Earlier this year, President Trump issued executive orders  demanding  federal agencies remove and prohibit any materials that promote \"gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.\" In January, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued the memoranda \" Restoring America's Fighting Force ,\" which prohibited \"instruction on Critical Race Theory (CRT), DEI, or gender ideology,\" and \" Identity Months Dead at DoD ,\" which barred using official resources for celebrations such as Black History Month, Women's History Month and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. According to the plaintiffs, DoDEA officials sent emails directing teachers to remove books and cancel lesson plans and events that would be in violation of Trump's executive orders and Hegseth's guidance. Books removed from school libraries at military bases covered such topics as sexual identity, racism and LGBTQ pride. You can see a list of the books  here . Two elementary schools cancelled Black History Month events, teachers at a middle school were told to remove posters of education activist Malala Yousafzai and painter Frida Kahlo and another school cancelled Holocaust Remembrance Day. According to the motion filed by the ACLU, the students claimed that when they protested the school's actions, they were punished and became \"increasingly afraid to discuss race and gender in their classrooms, because they fear being silenced by teachers fearful of violating the EOs and DoDEA guidance.\" In her  decision , U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles sided with the students and their families, writing that \"the removals were not rooted in pedagogical concerns\" but rather there was \"improper partisan motivation underlying [defendants'] actions.\" Giles wrote that DOD officials must \"immediately restore the books and curricular materials that have been removed.\" The Department of Defense and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) have not yet responded to NPR's request for comment. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-governors-race-doj-election-fraud-80d58631b61d5b44ba04dc5cf8288bc5","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"22:13:52+00:00","title":"U.S. Department of Justice Reviews Request for Election Monitors in New Jersey’s Passaic County","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing a request from the New Jersey Republican State Committee to deploy federal election monitors to oversee mail ballot processing in Passaic County, a historically Democratic area that flipped to support Donald Trump in 2024.

While voter fraud does occur, it is rare and  there are safeguards  in place to prevent it. But Passaic County drew Trump’s attention in 2020 as a case study in what could happen in an election conducted mostly by mail. A judge  ordered a new election  for a city council seat in Paterson — the largest city in Passaic County — after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud. The Passaic County Board of Elections decided not to count 800 ballots cast in the race after the U.S. Postal Service’s law enforcement arm said hundreds of mail-in ballots were located in a mailbox in Paterson, along with more found in nearby Haledon. In 2024, Trump became the first Republican presidential nominee to win Passaic County in more than 30 years. He carried the heavily  Latino city of Passaic  and significantly increased his support in Paterson, the state’s third-largest city, which is majority Latino and has a large Muslim community. That performance was part of Trump dramatically improving his statewide performance in New Jersey. In 2020, he lost the state by nearly 16 percentage points to Demcorat Joe Biden.

North Korea performed its first ballistic missile tests in five months Wednesday, days before U.S.  President Donald Trump  and other leaders are expected to meet in South Korea.  South Korea’s military said it detected multiple short-range ballistic missiles that were launched from an area south of Pyongyang and flew about 350 kilometers (220 miles) toward the northeast. The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t release more specific flight details but said the missiles didn’t land in the sea.  The Joint Chiefs added that the South’s military remains ready to repel any provocations by North Korea based on its solid military alliance with the United States.  Japan’s new Prime Minister  Sanae Takaichi  told reporters that Tokyo was closely communicating with Washington and Seoul, including by sharing real-time missile warning data.

Earlier this month, Kim displayed  a new intercontinental ballistic missile  at a military parade attended by Chinese, Russian and other top officials. The parade highlighted Kim’s growing diplomatic footing and his relentless drive to build a reliable arsenal of nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies.  North Korea’s state media said the Oct. 10 parade featured the Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, which it described as the country’s “most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system.” Observers said the new ICBM is designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to defeat U.S. missile defenses and that North Korea could test-launch it in coming months.  ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/openai-atlas-web-browser-chatgpt-google-ai-f59edaa239aebe26fc5a4a27291d717a","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:03:35+00:00","title":"OpenAI Launches Atlas Browser, Challenging Google’s Chrome in AI-Driven Web Search","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"OpenAI launched its Atlas browser on October 21, 2025, introducing an AI-driven interface that replaces the traditional URL bar with a chatbot that autonomously searches the internet on behalf of users.

The San Francisco-based company also sells paid subscriptions but is losing more money than it makes and has been looking for ways to turn a profit. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n OpenAI said Atlas launches Tuesday on Apple laptops and will later come to Microsoft’s Windows, Apple’s iOS phone operating system and Google’s Android phone system.

Chrome’s immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat. But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market. Microsoft ended up abandoning Explorer and introducing its Edge browser, which operates similarly to Chrome and holds a distant third place in market share behind Apple’s Safari. Perplexity, another smaller AI startup, rolled out its own Comet browser earlier this year. It also expressed interest in buying Chrome and eventually submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for the browser that hit a dead end when Mehta decided against a Google breakup. Altman said he expects a chatbot interface to replace a traditional browser’s URL bar as the center of how he hopes people will use the internet in the future. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “Tabs were great, but we haven’t seen a lot of browser innovation since then,” he said on a video presentation aired Tuesday. A premium feature of the ChatGPT Atlas browser is an “agent mode” that accesses the laptop and effectively clicks around the internet on the person’s behalf, armed with a users’ browser history and what they are seeking to learn and explaining its process as it searches. “It’s using the internet for you,” Altman said. Harrington, the Forrester analyst, says another way of thinking about that is it’s “taking personality away from you.” “Your profile will be personally attuned to you based on all the information sucked up about you. OK, scary,” Harrington said. “But is it really you, really what you’re thinking, or what that engine decides it’s going to do? ... And will it add in preferred solutions based on ads?”  About 60% of Americans  overall — and 74% of those under 30 — use AI to find information at least some of the time, making online searches one of the most popular uses of AI technology, according to findings from an  Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research  poll taken over the summer. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Google since last year has automatically  provided AI-generated responses  that attempt to answer a person’s search query, appearing at the top of results. Reliance on AI chatbots to summarize information they collect online has raised a number of concerns, including the technology’s propensity to confidently spout false information, a problem known as hallucination. The way that chatbots trained on online content spout new writings has been particularly troubling to the news industry, leading The New York Times and other outlets to sue OpenAI for copyright infringement and others, including The Associated Press, to sign licensing deals. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A study of four top AI assistants including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini released Wednesday showed nearly half their responses were flawed and fell short of the standards of “high-quality” journalism. The research from the European Broadcasting Union, a group of public broadcasters in 56 countries, compiled the results of more than 3,000 responses to news-related questions to help ascertain quality responses and identify problems to fix. —— Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten contributed to this story."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-fluoride-kennedy-trump-science-antiscience-legislation-73af8e65f407331e8f31b2909812a004","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:45:32.123Z","title":"New Economic Policies Announced to Boost Growth and Sustainability","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On April 5, 2023, the government introduced a series of new economic policies aimed at stimulating growth and managing inflation.

An  Associated Press investigation  found that the  wave of legislation  has cropped up in most states, pushed by people with close ties to Health and Human Services Secretary  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  The effort would strip away protections that have been built over a century and are integral to American lives and society.

How AP tracked and analyzed the legislation , with a focus on bills related to vaccines, fluoride and raw, unpasteurized milk \n    \n \n Trump administration officials are directing activists to push anti-science legislation in the states – where public health authority rests – with the ultimate goal of changing laws and minds nationally. The effort normalizes ideas fueled by the anti-vaccine movement that  Kennedy has helped lead  for years. His  Make America Healthy Again  agenda masks anti-science ideas while promoting goals such as  making food more natural  or reducing chemicals.

He was vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae type b, or Hib, but the disease caused his brain to swell and killed him less than two days after he complained of a headache. Hib is transmitted by respiratory droplets, often spread by coughs and sneezes. Doctors said Liam’s case likely stemmed from someone unvaccinated, Ashlee Dahlberg said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n With two other children, the Dahlbergs worry about living in one of the many U.S. communities with low immunization rates.

In its analysis of legislation, AP focused on these three public health policies, which have clear medical evidence behind them and are targets of the Make America Healthy Again movement. AP searched 2025 legislation in all 50 states, analyzing more than 1,000 bills collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures and the bill-tracking software Plural for whether they undermined science-based protections for human health. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     AP Illustration | Source:  SB 6  of the State of Arkansas 95th General Assembly. \n                 \n            \n         \n        \n     \n    \n     \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                 \n             \n         \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                         \n                            \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n                         \n                     \n                     \n                         \n                             \n                                 \n                                     \n                                 \n                             AP Illustration | Source:  SB 6  of the State of Arkansas 95th General Assembly. \n                                \n\n     \n         \n         \n            Add AP News to Google  \n             \n         \n             \n    Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.\n                 \n     \n       \n         \n       \n     \n   \n         \n         \n\n         Share\n            \n             \n            \n             \n\n         \n             \n                 \n                    Share\n                     \n                 \n\n                \n                 \n     \n        \n               \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Facebook \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Copy \n     Link copied \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Print\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Email\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     X \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     \n     LinkedIn \n \n \n        \n             \n\n \n     \n         \n     \n \n Bluesky \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     Flipboard \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     Pinterest \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Reddit \n \n        \n     \n \n\n                \n             \n         \n         \n     \n\n\n\n\n                             Read More \n                         \n                     \n                 \n             \n            \n         \n     \n    \n \n\n                 \n             \n         Anti-vaccine bills – 350 of them – were by far the most common. They come at the issue from various angles: barring discrimination against unvaccinated people, creating the criminal offense of vaccine harm, requiring blood banks to test for evidence of vaccinations and instituting a 48-hour vaccine waiting period. Legislators acknowledge they sometimes draw inspiration from other states: Bills in numerous places target mRNA vaccines, which were credited with saving millions of lives during  the COVID-19 pandemic . Two bills in Minnesota falsely designate them as “weapons of mass destruction.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     AP Illustration | Source:  Bill SF 3456  in the Minnesota 94th Legislature. \n                 \n            \n         \n        \n     \n    \n     \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                 \n             \n         \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                         \n                            \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n                         \n                     \n                     \n                         \n                             \n                                 \n                                     \n                                 \n                             AP Illustration | Source:  Bill SF 3456  in the Minnesota 94th Legislature. \n                                \n\n     \n         \n         \n            Add AP News to Google  \n             \n         \n             \n    Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.\n                 \n     \n       \n         \n       \n     \n   \n         \n         \n\n         Share\n            \n             \n            \n             \n\n         \n             \n                 \n                    Share\n                     \n                 \n\n                \n                 \n     \n        \n               \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Facebook \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Copy \n     Link copied \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Print\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Email\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     X \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     \n     LinkedIn \n \n \n        \n             \n\n \n     \n         \n     \n \n Bluesky \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     Flipboard \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     Pinterest \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Reddit \n \n        \n     \n \n\n                \n             \n         \n         \n     \n\n\n\n\n                             Read More \n                         \n                     \n                 \n             \n            \n         \n     \n    \n \n\n                 \n             \n         Since vaccines became more politicized during the pandemic, more extreme vaccine bills have passed, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine law expert at UC Law San Francisco. “At times of uncertainty and trouble, conspiracy theories have more of a wedge,” Reiss said. Most bills haven’t passed – some died and others are pending – but at least 26 anti-vaccine laws have been adopted in 11 states this year. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n Most of those bills were supported by at least one of four national groups connected to Kennedy: MAHA Action, Stand for Health Freedom, the National Vaccine Information Center and the Weston A. Price Foundation. The groups also opposed dozens of science-driven bills, including one that would protect people by tightening rabies vaccine requirements for pets. There’s a web of connections among the groups and Kennedy. MAHA Action has been run by people close to him, including his longtime book publisher, Tony Lyons, and former campaign staffer Del Bigtree. Stand for Health Freedom was co-founded by Sayer Ji, who now advises the group and volunteers with MAHA Action. The group Kennedy used to lead,  Children’s Health Defense , was a sponsor of conferences held by NVIC and Weston Price. Kennedy has been a featured speaker for both groups.

NVIC, Stand for Health Freedom and Weston Price collaborated on a June letter to President Donald Trump’s Religious Liberty Commission, asking that the federal government stay out of state public health lawmaking — including religious exemptions for vaccines. Anti-vaccine activists have noticed the tide turning away from science-driven legislation, and there has been a reversal: NVIC said that in 2015, it opposed six times as many bills as it supported. Last year, it supported more than twice as many bills as it opposed. In an email to AP, NVIC leader Barbara Loe Fisher called the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic heavy-handed but a wake-up call in state legislatures, where “lawmakers understood the danger to liberty posed by vaccine mandates in a way they had not understood it before.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n She said mandatory vaccination is bad public health policy. The groups AP tracked send out alerts, organize phone campaigns, flood lawmakers’ inboxes and social media, hold Zoom calls with activists nationwide, and send members to testify in statehouses. Lyons told AP the point of the calls is to educate people. He objected to the use of the terms anti-science and conspiracy theories, saying, “It’s just an inflammatory statement meant to get millions of people to think something bad is happening.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Robert F.

Advocates know how to raise money for candidates and create anti-vaccine champions, he said, and use legislative maneuvers to hold up some bills and help others past hurdles. “They’re really a sophisticated political operation as opposed to just a couple of parents that don’t want to vaccinate their kids,” Saunders said. In Indiana, Republican Rep. Bruce Borders sponsored two bills at the request of the group Hoosiers for Medical Liberty. One would allow people to opt out of employer vaccine mandates; another would require vaccine manufacturers to conduct certain safety studies. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Borders, who owns an insurance company and works as an Elvis impersonator, said he’s driven by concern about his grandson, who he believes developed autism after getting vaccinated – though there’s no credible scientific evidence that’s possible. He said these bills aren’t anti-science and that he respects doctors but believes some medical questions deserve more scrutiny. “I’ve done tons of research on this issue because of my grandson,” Borders said. “I would say that my study on these issues would equal that of many people in the medical field.” Other anti-science bills People are often drawn into anti-science ideas in a roundabout way, Reiss said. They might come to the MAHA movement with legitimate concerns about nutrition, for example, then be exposed to others who believe forces are conspiring to keep people sick. “Misinformation is infectious,” she said. The overlap in conspiracy-driven ideas is evident in the slate of bills supported by some groups riding MAHA’s popularity. MAHA Action and Stand for Health Freedom both supported legislation to ban fluoride in drinking water. Stand for Health Freedom and Weston Price both opposed a North Carolina bill they said threatened raw milk sales. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Their arguments often rely on the idea of staying healthy naturally. Stand for Health Freedom, which did not respond to AP’s requests for comment, told its followers, “Water should hydrate not medicate” while pushing an anti-fluoride bill. Weston Price runs a campaign for raw milk, which it calls “real milk,” and the group’s website contains unproven claims it can help treat asthma, allergies and eczema. AP found more than 70 bills that would roll back access to fluoride or make it easier to sell or consume raw milk products. Many fluoride bills would prohibit its addition to water systems outright. One in Pennsylvania was dubbed the “Fluoride Choice Act” by its sponsor, who said individuals would be empowered “to make informed health decisions” and could get fluoride supplements or topical treatments instead. On raw milk, bills would allow for sales beyond farms in Arkansas, decriminalize its sale in Hawaii and let Oklahoma farms sell raw donkey milk. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     AP Illustration | Source:  House Bill 1191  in the 1st Session of the State of Oklahoma 60th Legislature (2025) \n                 \n            \n         \n        \n     \n    \n     \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                 \n             \n         \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                         \n                            \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n                         \n                     \n                     \n                         \n                             \n                                 \n                                     \n                                 \n                             AP Illustration | Source:  House Bill 1191  in the 1st Session of the State of Oklahoma 60th Legislature (2025) \n                                \n\n     \n         \n         \n            Add AP News to Google  \n             \n         \n             \n    Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.\n                 \n     \n       \n         \n       \n     \n   \n         \n         \n\n         Share\n            \n             \n            \n             \n\n         \n             \n                 \n                    Share\n                     \n                 \n\n                \n                 \n     \n        \n               \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Facebook \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Copy \n     Link copied \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Print\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Email\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     X \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     \n     LinkedIn \n \n \n        \n             \n\n \n     \n         \n     \n \n Bluesky \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     Flipboard \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     Pinterest \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Reddit \n \n        \n     \n \n\n                \n             \n         \n         \n     \n\n\n\n\n                             Read More \n                         \n                     \n                 \n             \n            \n         \n     \n    \n \n\n                 \n             \n         Sally Fallon Morell, president of Weston Price, told AP the benefits of raw milk are immense and the risks minimal, denying that such beliefs are conspiracies.

Other anti-science ideas are also in full bloom in Florida. Along with Utah, Florida banned fluoride in public drinking water this year. Experts stress that fluoride not only prevents tooth decay but staves off problems and even heart issues. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     AP Illustration | Source:  H.B. 81 Fluoride Amendments  of the Utah State Legislature 2025 General Session. \n                 \n            \n         \n        \n     \n    \n     \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                 \n             \n         \n         \n            \n             \n                 \n                     \n                         \n                            \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n                         \n                     \n                     \n                         \n                             \n                                 \n                                     \n                                 \n                             AP Illustration | Source:  H.B. 81 Fluoride Amendments  of the Utah State Legislature 2025 General Session. \n                                \n\n     \n         \n         \n            Add AP News to Google  \n             \n         \n             \n    Add AP News as your preferred source to see more of our stories on Google.\n                 \n     \n       \n         \n       \n     \n   \n         \n         \n\n         Share\n            \n             \n            \n             \n\n         \n             \n                 \n                    Share\n                     \n                 \n\n                \n                 \n     \n        \n               \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Facebook \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Copy \n     Link copied \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Print\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     \n        Email\n     \n \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     X \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     \n     LinkedIn \n \n \n        \n             \n\n \n     \n         \n     \n \n Bluesky \n \n        \n             \n     \n         \n     \n     Flipboard \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n     Pinterest \n \n \n        \n             \n    \n     \n         \n             \n         \n     \n     Reddit \n \n        \n     \n \n\n                \n             \n         \n         \n     \n\n\n\n\n                             Read More \n                         \n                     \n                 \n             \n            \n         \n     \n    \n \n\n                 \n             \n         A  coalition  including MAHA Action, Stand for Health Freedom and Children’s Health Defense backed a slate of bills that went after vaccines, fluoride and other parts of the MAHA agenda. It  organized buses  to bring people to the Capitol for a legislative day. MAHA Action has held regular Zoom calls since the summer featuring Trump administration officials and Kennedy advisors who emphasize the importance of advancing MAHA priorities in the states. In Zoom chats obtained by AP, activists ask for talking points and to get connected to local groups. Kennedy’s deputy chief of staff, Stefanie Spear, told activists on one call that it’s critical to “get activated” in state government: “That is going to be when we move the needle enough to enact federal legislation.” A spokesman for Kennedy and the Department of Health and Human Services would not comment to AP for this story. On the same call, Ji celebrated a  new Florida law  making “geoengineering” a felony. Its sponsor explained the bill addresses constituents’ concerns about chemtrails, invoking a conspiracy theory that the  condensation trails  that appear in the sky behind jets are actually chemicals they’re spraying into the atmosphere. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F.

Meanwhile, Kennedy is elevating anti-science ideas nationally. This spring, a wellness influencer shared video of Kennedy doing shots of raw milk with him at the White House. Less than a week later, Emily Marris’ toddler, Brooklyn, was hospitalized and nearly died after drinking raw milk. The Southern California mom did research online, finding a homesteader Facebook group and buying raw goat’s milk from a seller who called it “clean and tested.” Retail sales are legal in California. Brooklyn ended up on dialysis and a ventilator, suffering three cardiac arrests before finally turning a corner. She now has high blood pressure and walks with a limp. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Dr. Charles Fraley, right, checks the temperature of Brooklyn Marris, center, as she arrives for a blood pressure check with her mother, Emily Marris, left, at his office in Winchester, Calif., Sept. 18, 2025.

The cost Lawmakers fighting for science-based policies say what’s missing in the discussion is concern for the public good. Rep. Andy Vargas, a Massachusetts Democrat, has been sponsoring legislation since 2019 to eliminate religious exemptions from childhood vaccines. Despite high vaccination rates in Massachusetts, Vargas said, pockets in every county have lost herd immunity for measles. People who want to participate in public life have responsibilities to others, he said. “It’s just part of the social contract.” In Indiana, Democratic State Rep.

Though there’s no way to know for sure who exposed him, research shows unvaccinated people are more likely to carry Hib and spread it. Severe cases dropped by over 99% after the federal government recommended the vaccine in 1991. In recent years, however, overall vaccination rates  have dropped. After Liam died, the Dahlbergs learned that vaccine policies vary by state. Hib shots are recommended, not required, to enter pre-kindergarten in Indiana, though they are required in Illinois, a 10-minute drive from home. These states and nearly every other allow parents to opt children out of vaccine mandates for nonmedical reasons such as religion. Ashlee Dahlberg channeled her anger into purpose, starting a change.org petition to eliminate religious exemptions in public schools nationally. While most feedback has been positive, she said, they’ve received hateful messages, including: “Your son deserved to die.” But, Dahlberg said, “I want to reach those parents who are on the fencepost about vaccinations.” The Dahlbergs feel it’s up to them to protect their two surviving children from vaccine-preventable diseases. They can’t rely on their government anymore. \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Ashlee Dahlberg takes photos of her daughters Ava, left, and Khloe, on the first day of school in front a memorial for their brother, Liam, in their yard in Lowell, Ind., Aug. 13, 2025.

For now, they’ve made arrangements with Ava’s school to ensure every student in her class is vaccinated. Like her brother, she has severe asthma. In common areas such as hallways or buses, she wears a mask. On the first day of school this year, Dahlberg called Ava to the kitchen to take puffs from her twice-a-day inhaler before ushering the girls outside for first-day pictures. They walked past the collection of mementos reminding them of Liam – his handprint, a photo of him with his dirt bike, a plaster cast of his hand in his mom’s. The girls held a photo of their brother as they stood near a flowering crab apple tree planted in his memory. Shortly before the bus came, Ava broke her mask, ran inside and grabbed another. Dahlberg instructed: “You are to wear that on the bus. You do not take it off.” Bus 21 finally made its way down their street. As Ava got on, her mother nervously waved goodbye. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n\n     \n     \n     Dotted Line with Center Square \n     \n        .dotted-hr-square {\n            border: none;\n            border-top: 3px dotted #777777;\n            width: 50%;\n            height: 0;\n            margin: 20px auto;\n            position: relative; /* Required for positioning the square */\n        }\n\n        .dotted-hr-square::after {\n            content: '';\n            width: 10px;  /* Smaller square size */\n            height: 10px; /* Smaller square size */\n            background-color: #888888; /* Same color as the line */\n            position: absolute;\n            top: -6.5px; /* Adjusted to half of the square's height to vertically center */\n            left: 50%;\n            transform: translateX(-50%); /* Horizontally center the square */\n        }\n     \n\n     \n \n\n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

on the planet has continued an encouraging trend of population growth in the wake of new efforts to protect the giant animals, according to scientists who study them. The North Atlantic right whale now numbers an estimated 384 animals, up eight whales from the previous year, according to a report by the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium released Tuesday. The whales have shown a trend of slow population growth over the past four years and have gained more than 7% of their 2020 population, the consortium said. It’s a welcome development in the wake of a troubling decline in the previous decade. The population of the whales, which are vulnerable to collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear, fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The whale’s trend toward recovery is a testament to the importance of conservation measures, said Philip Hamilton, a senior scientist with the New England Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life.

But there are also reasons to believe the whales are turning a corner in terms of low reproduction numbers, Hamilton said. The whales are less likely to reproduce when they have suffered injuries  or are underfed , scientists have said. That has emerged as a problem for the whale because they aren’t  producing enough babies  to sustain their population, they’ve said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n However, this year four mother whales had calves for the first time, Hamilton said.

And any number of calves is helpful in a year of no mortalities, said Heather Pettis, who leads the right whale research program at Cabot Center and chairs the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium. “The slight increase in the population estimate, coupled with no detected mortalities and fewer detected injuries than in the last several years, leaves us cautiously optimistic about the future of North Atlantic right whales,” Pettis said. ”What we’ve seen before is this population can turn on a dime.” The whales were hunted to the brink of extinction during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades. The whales migrate every year from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. Some scientists have said the warming of the ocean has made that journey more dangerous because the whales have had to stray from established protected areas in search of food. Environmental groups warned Tuesday that the whales are still on the brink of extinction and need more aggressive protection to fully recover. “Continued attacks on the  Marine Mammal Protection Act  and efforts to weaken NOAA’s science-based safeguards put this fragile population at even greater risk. We need Congress to uphold, not undermine, the laws, programs, and experts that give North Atlantic right whales a fighting chance for continued survival,” said Gib Brogan, senior campaign director with Oceana."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/jack-nicklaus-defamation-lawsuit-a752eab8131eb22fff6cb41feae27ac5","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"22:48:15+00:00","title":"Jack Nicklaus Wins $50 Million Defamation Verdict Against Former Business Partners","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Jack Nicklaus, the legendary 18-time major golf champion, has won a $50 million defamation verdict in a Florida lawsuit filed against his former business partners, the Nicklaus Companies, over false claims that he was involved in a $750 million deal with LIV Golf and suffering from dementia.

A six-person jury in Palm Beach County found Monday that the Nicklaus Companies had damaged the 18-time major champion’s reputation and exposed him to ridicule, hatred, mistrust, distrust or contempt. Nicklaus Companies owner and executive chairman Howard Milstein and executive Andrew O’Brien were also named individually as defendants, but jurors did not find them personally liable. Eugene Stearns, an attorney for Nicklaus, said Nicklaus has spent his life helping others and earning a reputation as not just a great athlete but a great human being. “He deserved better than what he got, and we’re pleased that the jury addressed the particular circumstances that were so annoying,” Stearns said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n According to the lawsuit, Nicklaus, 85, claimed Milstein, O’Brien and others at the company spread false stories that Nicklaus considered a $750 million deal to join the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf League and that he was suffering from dementia and no longer mentally fit to manage his affairs. \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Fire and shooting at a camp in Belgrade hosting the president’s loyalists injures 1 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Orbán and his main rival plan dueling demonstrations as Hungary’s elections near \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Money-losing companies with colorful histories have pivoted to crypto \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Defense attorneys said at trial that Nicklaus Companies executives never tried to defame Nicklaus and argued the case was basically a business dispute.

Christopher P. Moynihan is accused of sending a text message on Friday noting that Jeffries, a New York Democrat, would be making a speech in New York City this week. “I cannot allow this terrorist to live,” Moynihan wrote, according to a report by a state police investigator. Moynihan also wrote that Jeffries “must be eliminated” and texted, “I will kill him for the future,” the police report says. Moynihan, of Clinton, New York, is charged with a felony count of making a terroristic threat. It was unclear if he had an attorney representing him in the case, and efforts to contact him and his parents by email and phone were unsuccessful. \n    \n     \n\n\n    \n     \n     \n \n     \n         \n                 \n             \n         \n                 \n             \n     \n     \n         \n         \n     \n     \n \n    \n    \n        \n             \n                 \n                    AP AUDIO: Man pardoned after storming Capitol is charged with threatening to kill Hakeem Jeffries\n                 \n             \n        \n    \n    \n     AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on a threat on a prominent Democrats life. \n    \n \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Moynihan who’s 34, was sentenced to 21 months in prison for joining  a mob’s Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol .

He entered the Senate chamber, rifled through a notebook on a senator’s desk and joined other rioters in shouting and chanting at the Senate dais,  prosecutors said . “Moynihan did not leave the Senate Chamber until he was forced out by police,” they wrote. In 2022, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper convicted Moynihan of a felony for obstructing the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s victory over Trump in  the 2020 presidential election . Moynihan also pleaded guilty to five other riot-related counts. ___ Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at  https://apnews.com/hub/hakeem-jeffries ."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-karofsky-stalker-emails-aff2859b5230e3b9e5595f008f193dc3","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"18:53:27Z","title":"Wisconsin Man Charged with Stalking After Sending Threatening Emails to Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofsky","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Wisconsin man, Ryan Thornton, has been charged with stalking after sending nine threatening emails to liberal Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofsky between August and October 2025.

(AP) — Prosecutors have charged a Wisconsin man with stalking after he allegedly sent liberal state Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofsky a series of intimidating emails. Ryan Thornton, 37, of Racine was charged Monday with one felony count of stalking. He faces up to 3 1/2 years in prison if convicted. His attorney, listed in court records as public defender Britney Dickey, declined to comment on the case when reached at her office Tuesday. According to a criminal complaint, Thornton sent Karofsky nine emails between the beginning of August and the beginning of October accusing her of being manipulative, telling her to “eject” herself from office and asking for her home address.  In one message he told her to call the Capitol Police Department. “What a democrat idea, tho,” he wrote, according to the complaint. In another message he asked if she wanted to be part of his helicopter videos, which police took to mean that Thornton believed helicopters were watching him. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Karofsky told investigators she has received numerous threats since she became a judge in 2017, but Thornton’s messages frightened her to the point that she was afraid to leave her house to get her mail and asked police to escort her to her seat during a Milwaukee Brewers game and a Wisconsin Badger game.  \n\n \n     \n        \n \n    \n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n             \n                                   \n                        \n                            Related Stories\n                        \n                     \n             \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n\n\n\n     \n            \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Steelers lose special teams ace Miles Killebrew to season-ending knee injury \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 St. John’s tops Big East preseason poll for 1st time since 1991 \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n             \n                \n                    \n                         \n   \n    \n        \n            \n     \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n \n\n\n        \n    \n\n     \n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n    \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n  \n    \n         \n             \n                \n                 Green Bay’s LaFleur focusing on entire Steelers team as Packers get ready to face Aaron Rodgers \n             \n         \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n        \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n\n\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n     \n\n    \n \n                    \n                 \n        \n     \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n\n Thornton made profane remarks about Karofsky and said she was “going down” during an interview with investigators, according to the complaint.

she underlined her commitment to boosting Japanese defense as she prepared to host visiting U.S. President Donald Trump next week.  Takaichi replaces outgoing Shigeru Ishiba after the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered disastrous losses in July elections for parliament’s upper house and lost its majority in the lower house last year. Her election comes a day after the LDP struck a deal in a fragile coalition with a new partner expected to pull her governing bloc further to the right.  “I’m determined to build a strong Japanese economy and protect Japan’s national interest with diplomacy and security,” said Takaichi, a security hawk who was elected head of the LDP on Oct. 4 after Ishiba resigned to take responsibility for the latest election defeat.  Takaichi cited the Japan-U.S. alliance as a “cornerstone” of Japanese diplomacy and stressed that Japan is an indispensable partner for America in its strategy to provide counterweights to China in the Indo-Pacific region. Trump is scheduled to visit Japan next Monday to Wednesday. \n    \n     \n         \n             \n                 \n    \n     \n\n\n     \n     \n        \n     \n \n             \n         \n     \n    \n A first, but not a feminist While Takaichi made history by becoming the first female leader of a country where men still largely hold sway, she has not promoted gender equality or diversity.  An admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is among the Japanese politicians who have stonewalled measures for women’s advancement. She supports the imperial family’s  male-only succession , and opposes allowing separate  surnames  for married couples.  And despite a pledge to drastically increase the number of women in the Cabinet, she appointed only two woman ministers — Satsuki Katayama as finance minister and Kimi Onoda as economic security minister. Takaichi also opposes  same-sex marriage.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n “The birth of Japan’s first female prime minister is epoch-making, but she casts a dark cloud over gender equality and sexual minority rights,” LGBTQ+ rights activist Soshi Matsuoka said, adding that Takaichi’s “extremely conservative” views could be a “serious setback” for the rights of sexual minorities. However, some Japanese feel that her breaking the glass ceiling in politics is an important marker of progress in itself. Takayuki Eguchi, a 62-year-old Tokyo resident, said he had doubted that a woman would even be able to get enough votes in parliament. He celebrated Takaichi’s achievement by collecting a free special newspaper edition distributed on Tuesday.  “I really hope she serves for a long time, and that the political stagnation we’ve been seeing finally starts to move, and that things improve in Japan and in the eyes of the world,” Eguchi said. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n A fragile governing alliance The LDP’s alliance with the Osaka-based right-wing Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, is short of a majority in both houses, but Takaichi was still able to win the premiership because the opposition is not united.  Her alliance’s lack of a majority will mean that it will need to court opposition groups to pass any legislation — a risk that could make her government unstable and short-lived. Takaichi on Tuesday stressed the need to cooperate. “Without political stability, we cannot achieve strong economic policies, diplomacy, security or anything,” she said.  Her coalition’s two parties signed agreement on policies underscoring Takaichi’s hawkish and nationalistic views. Their last-minute deal came after the Liberal Democrats lost the party’s longtime partner, the Buddhist-backed  Komeito , which has a more dovish and centrist stance. The breakup threatened a change of power for the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Her challenges  Takaichi is preparing for a major policy speech later this week,  talks with Trump  and regional summits during which she also needs to ensure stable ties with China and South Korea. She needs to quickly tackle rising prices and compile economy-boosting measures by late December to address public frustration. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe , Takaichi is expected to emulate his policies, including a stronger military and economy. With her potentially weak grip on power, it’s not clear how much Takaichi will be able to achieve. Developing friendly ties with Trump might be a challenge, but her close ties and admiration of Abe, who apparently had won Trump’s trust, may help her. “At first, I hope to develop relations of trust between the two leaders through candid exchange of views about the challenges that Japan and the United States face,” Takaichi said. Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993 and has served in senior posts including as minister of economic security and internal affairs, but her diplomatic background is thin. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Concerns about her nationalism When Komeito left the governing coalition, it raised concern about Takaichi’s view of Japan’s wartime past. She has taken part in regular prayers at the  Yasukuni Shrine  despite protests from Beijing and Seoul, which see the visits as a sign of lack of remorse for Japanese aggression. Some of Takaichi’s remarks have also been denounced as xenophobic. Takaichi, who is pro-Taiwan, has toned down her hawkish rhetoric. On Friday, she sent a religious ornament to Yasukuni instead of going there herself. On Tuesday, she said she wants stable ties with Seoul and hopes to meet with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. “There may be worries, but I love Korean seaweed, I use Korean cosmetics, and I watch Korean dramas too.” China, South Korea and EU react South Korea’s president congratulated Takaichi and said he hopes to hold a summit with her during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in South Korea this month. He said South Korea-Japan relations are more important than ever as global uncertainty deepens. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, said that he hoped Japan would “honor its political commitments on major issues including on history and Taiwan, maintain the political foundation of bilateral relations and advance the China-Japan strategic relations of mutual benefit.” China considers Taiwan, a former Japanese colony, its own breakaway province to be annexed by force if necessary.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Takaichi and pledged to work with her on behalf of the 27-nation European Union. “As Japan’s first female PM, you’re making history,” von der Leyen wrote. “I look forward to working closely together to take the unique-EU Japan partnership to the next level.” ___ AP journalists Mayuko Ono and Reeno Hashimoto in Tokyo, Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, Simina Mistreanu in Taipei, Taiwan and Sam McNeil in Brussels contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/angels-manager-kurt-suzuki-794c1e9110e21f5fd41135e3ee058153","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"17:46:27+00:00","title":"Los Angeles Angels Hire Kurt Suzuki as New Manager","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Los Angeles Angels have hired former catcher Kurt Suzuki as their new manager, marking the fifth full-time manager in the team’s past eight seasons.

(AP) — The Los Angeles Angels hired former major league catcher Kurt Suzuki as their next manager on Tuesday. Suzuki has spent the past three seasons as a special assistant to Angels general manager Perry Minasian, who didn’t have to look far to find the fifth person to serve as the Halos’ manager during Minasian’s five years in charge. Suzuki played 16 seasons in the major leagues for five teams, earning an All-Star selection with Minnesota in 2014 and winning a World Series with Washington in 2019. Suzuki finished his career with two years in Anaheim, retiring after the 2022 season. Suzuki also won the College World Series while playing for Cal State Fullerton, located a few miles from Angel Stadium. The 42-year-old Suzuki replaces Ron Washington,  who wasn’t brought back to the Angels’ dugout  after two losing seasons. Washington missed the second half of the current season after undergoing quadruple bypass heart surgery, with Ray Montgomery filling in while Los Angeles finished in last place in the AL West. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The Angels pivoted to Suzuki and fellow special assistant to the GM Torii Hunter as their top candidates after talks with  former slugger Albert Pujols  broke down in recent days.

Meanwhile, vaccination rates  continue to fall , allowing the infectious diseases  measles  and  whooping cough  to make comebacks as Kennedy has sought to broadly remake federal policies on public health matters including  fluoride  and  vaccines . \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Kennedy’s allies dispute that their agenda is anti-science or driven by conspiracy theories, but many experts disagree.

AP searched 2025 legislation in all 50 states, analyzing bills collected by the  National Conference of State Legislatures  and the  bill-tracking software Plural  for whether they undermined science-based protections for human health. Anti-vaccine bills – at least 350 of them – were by far the most common. Most haven’t passed, but at least two dozen anti-vaccine laws have been adopted in 11 states this year. AP found more than 70 bills that would roll back access to fluoride or make it easier to sell or consume raw milk products. Many fluoride bills would prohibit its addition to water systems outright. Most of the bills that were enacted were supported by at least one of four national groups connected to Kennedy: MAHA Action, Stand for Health Freedom, the National Vaccine Information Center and the Weston A. Price Foundation. The groups also opposed dozens of science-driven bills. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n These groups are part of a well-organized effort with a clear strategy to change policies The groups AP tracked send out alerts, organize phone campaigns, flood lawmakers’ inboxes and social media, hold Zoom calls with activists nationwide, and send members to testify in statehouses. Their work reflects the small anti-vaccine movement’s growing clout, said Northe Saunders, president of American Families for Vaccines. Advocates know how to raise money for candidates and create anti-vaccine champions and use legislative maneuvers to hold up some bills and help others past hurdles, he said. “They’re really a sophisticated political operation as opposed to just a couple of parents that don’t want to vaccinate their kids,” Saunders said. The groups defended their advocacy, and some leaders said they were gratified by their success. NVIC’s leader said the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic was heavy-handed and a wake-up call in state legislatures, where “lawmakers understood the danger to liberty posed by vaccine mandates.”  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n One MAHA leader who has joined the Zoom calls said his positions “are rooted in credible scientific literature and the public’s right to make informed choices,” while the current leader of MAHA Action said the point of the calls is to educate people. He objected to the term anti-science, saying, “It’s just an inflammatory statement meant to get millions of people to think something bad is happening.”  The president of Weston Price told AP the benefits of raw milk are immense and the risks minimal, denying that such beliefs are conspiracies. Stand for Health Freedom did not respond to emails. A spokesman for Kennedy and the Department of Health and Human Services would not comment to AP for this story.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Many people involved in groups pushing anti-science bills have built lucrative careers on their anti-science stance Powerful anti-vaccine advocates and people selling potentially harmful goods such as raw milk are profiting from the push to write anti-science policies into law across the U.S.  Whether by advancing their careers or selling more products, these leaders are finding ways to benefit. One way activists promote those ideas is through state legislation. Supporters argued that making money or increasing sales for businesses — such as dairy farmers — was a reason to pass some of the bills that would remove consumer protections, AP found. In at least one case, that reasoning was spelled out in the text of the bill. Rising anti-science sentiment has a human cost and is already taking a toll For example, vaccination rates are continuing to fall, allowing making it easier for infectious diseases to spread. Ashlee and Erik Dahlberg of Lowell, Indiana, lost their 8-year-old son, Liam, to a vaccine-preventable disease in April. “I thought having the vaccines would protect our children,” Erik Dahlberg said. “Unfortunately, it did not because other kids, other adults, need to be vaccinated as well in order for it to work.” \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Liam was particularly vulnerable because he had severe asthma and allergies. He was vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae type b, or Hib, but the disease still caused his brain to swell and killed him less than two days after he complained of a headache. Hib is transmitted by respiratory droplets, often spread by coughs and sneezes. Doctors said Liam’s case likely stemmed from someone who was unvaccinated, Ashlee Dahlberg said. With two other children, the Dahlbergs worry about living in one of the many U.S. communities with low immunization rates. State statistics show one in five kindergartners in their county don’t meet vaccination requirements. “There’s no pain that is worse than the pain of losing a child,” said Ashlee Dahlberg. “I do not – and can’t – live through the loss of another.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

YORK (AP) — A former Amazon delivery driver has filed a lawsuit accusing a federal civil right agency of abruptly and unlawfully abandoning her sex discrimination case and others like it following an executive order from President Donald Trump. The lawsuit filed by the former Colorado driver demands that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission resume investigating her claims that Amazon discriminates against female drivers by failing to provide adequate bathroom breaks.  The lawsuit is the latest example of workers and others scrambling to find recourse as  federal agencies abandon their cases  in response to Trump’s shake-up of the country’s civil rights enforcement infrastructure.  The EEOC, which enforces civil rights laws in the workplace, decided last month to discharge any complaints based on  “disparate impact liability,”  which holds that policies that are neutral on their face can be discriminatory if they impose unnecessary barriers that disadvantage different demographic groups.  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n The EEOC’s decision came in response to an executive order in April directing federal agencies to deprioritize the use of disparate impact liability.

Separately, the agency has dropped  lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers  and subjected new complaints to a higher level of scrutiny, following Trump’s executive order declaring that the government would only recognize two unchangeable sexes. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n It’s unclear how many worker complaints involving disparate impact liability or LGBTQ+ workers have been sidelined by the EEOC. In her lawsuit, Cross demanded that the EEOC, which handled more than 88,000 discrimination charges in 2024, give the court a list of the disparate impact liability charges it has shut down.  The EEOC referred questions about the lawsuit to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment. Cross, who worked as a driver from August to November 2022, filed her EEOC charge two years ago, arguing that the company’s delivery schedules make it nearly impossible for drivers to find time to use bathrooms. An EEOC investigator told her lawyers last month it was closing her case because of the disparate impact rule, according to the lawsuit. Amazon declined to comment on Cross’ case but referred The AP to its policies around its drivers, who deliver packages in Amazon-branded vehicles but work indirectly for the company through third-party companies called Delivery Service Partners. Amazon says its technology builds routes that ensure time for two 15-minute rest breaks and a 30-minute meal break. The company also said its Amazon Delivery app provides a list for drivers to see nearby restroom facilities and gas stations. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n But in an interview with The AP, Cross said it was so hard for to her stop for breaks that she had to pack a Shewee — a portable urination device for women — as well as a change of pants “in case I ended up accidentally urinating on myself.” Cross’ lawsuit against the EEOC argues that the agency is legally obligated to investigate all charges based on disparate impact liability, which Congress codified in the 1991 Civil Rights Act. The EEOC “isn’t allowed to throw away an entire category of charges without looking into their facts just because the president doesn’t like the type of discrimination those charges are based on,” said Karla Gilbride, an attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Gilbride was the EEOC’s general counsel until she was fired in January along with two Democratic commissioners  in a purge that cleared the way  for the Trump administration to root out diversity and inclusion programs, roll back protections for transgender workers and elevate religious rights. ________ The Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

But in the wake of  his death in September at age 89 , those ideas took on a new significance.

2025-10-21T17:56:11+00:00\n\nIn his 500-page memoir, “Born to Run,”  Bruce Springsteen  spends less than three pages on the making of his 1982 album “Nebraska.” Moving on, folks, nothing to see here, he seems to be saying. The first authorized biopic of his life —  “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”  — disagrees, delving deep into the inner turmoil The Boss was dealing with during its recording and then surfacing with an endearing, humbling portrait of an icon by a soulful  Jeremy Allen White. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n With heavy-lidded eyes and his head nearly almost cocked at an angle, White gives us a wretched Springsteen, open-mouthed in ecstasy when playing live but sunken in his leather jacket while roaming the streets. He sucks on his harmonica as if it could release him from pain itself. To be honest, White hasn’t stepped much out of his hangdog, tortured sweet spot. He’s the chair of the Tortured Poets Department. \n          \n             \n                \n                \n \n     \n        \n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     Jeremy Allen White in a scene.

We all need someone like Landau — endlessly encouraging, creating creative space for his client and beating back the suits. The record executives are, naturally, aghast at “Nebraska,” which is called a “highly unorthodox career move.” They want radio hits not acoustic doodles of felons. “It sounds like an accident. It sounds unfinished,” record honcho Al Teller declares. The movie — built from a book by Warren Zanes and featuring vocals that mix White’s and Springsteen’s — is a meditation on creativity in battle with commerciality, the yearn to run from home and also the inescapable pull of family. “I’m lost here. I’m buried here,” Springsteen wails. Though grounded in the weeks during the making of “Nebraska,” the script moves back in time to show scenes from Bruce’s early life. A drive to his old house dissolves into black-and-white memories of Springsteen’s father (“Adolescence” creator-star Stephen Graham, fearsome) being violent and drunk. Their complicated relationship is thoughtfully handled. (The movie is dedicated to Cooper’s dad.)  \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n As if that’s not enough, Springsteen’s love life is explored through a composite character, Faye, a single mom and waitress who falls for a guy incapable at this time of settling down. Odessa Young is astonishing — half tough Jersey chick, half melting when The Boss stops by. “I know you’re scared,” she tells him. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n There are also special moments for true Springsteen fans, like the time a young Bruce visits a graceful old house that will, of course, be the inspiration for “Mansion on a Hill.” Or the moment when Springsteen edits his “Nebraska” lyrics, changing “he” to “I.” \n             \n                 \n                    \n \n     \n        \n     \n\n\n        \n\n        \n      \n   \n\n     \n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n\n    \n         \n\n    \n \n \n\n\n        \n\n        \n         \n             \n                     White and Odessa Young as Faye.

In many ways, this movie is, then, a mirror of “Nebraska” itself — unexpected, complicated and very American gothic. “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” a Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures release that’s in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for thematic material, some sexuality, strong language and smoking.

intervened to take effective control of technology group Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese group Wingtech Technology.\n\nThe decision comes amid a growing rift between China and the West over the development of technology such as computer chips and semiconductors, which are essential components for the manufacture of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere is more about what the Dutch government announced, why and what happens next.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs said it had invoked the “highly exceptional” Goods Availability Act to intervene and take control of Nexperia on September 30.\n\nThe Goods Availability Act allows the Netherlands to intervene in privately owned companies in exceptional circumstances, such as if the government perceives a threat to the country’s economic security or if it is necessary to ensure that critical goods remain available.\n\nThe move followed an emergency hearing by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber on October 7, which concluded that there may be “valid reasons to doubt sound management at Nexperia under the leadership of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng”, a statement from the company said.\n\nThe Dutch Enterprise Chamber is a special division of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, which hears corporate law cases and other matters that could have major social or financial consequences.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the intervention had been carried out “due to serious administrative shortcomings” at Nexperia, which “posed a threat to the continuity and safeguarding on Dutch and European soil of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities”.\n\nIt claimed that the intervention would ensure Nexperia’s finished and semi-finished products would remain available in case of an emergency.\n\nThe ministry added that “losing these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.”\n\nFollowing this intervention, it said, “the company’s regular production process can continue.”\n\nHowever, it added, “Based on the order, decisions within the company can be blocked or reversed if they are (potentially) harmful to the company’s interests, its future as a Dutch and European company, and/or the preservation of this crucial value chain for Europe.”\n\nThe statement said that “involved parties” can appeal the decision in court.\n\nNexperia is a global semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It emerged as a result of electronics group Philips’ purchase of London-based Mullard Radio Valve Company and Hamburg-based Valvo in the 1920s, ultimately forming Philips’ semiconductor operation. In 2006, Philips spun off its semiconductor division, which became NXP Semiconductors, and this was later sold to a consortium of investors led by Beijing Jianguang Asset Management (JAC Capital). Wingtech acquired Nexperia from that consortium for $3.63bn in 2018.\n\nAccording to its website, Nexperia employs 12,500 people in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nNexperia’s manufacturing site spans more than 80,000 square metres (861,000dsq feet) and has the capacity to build more than 50 billion components annually. It also has sales offices and research-and-development sites in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nexperia announced that it had suspended Zhang, founder of Wingtech, as a director and removed him as chief executive officer (CEO). It has appointed Stegan Tilger, chief financial officer (CFO), as interim CEO.\n\n“Due to the same serious managerial shortcomings, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs observed that Nexperia’s operations in Europe were being compromised in an unacceptable manner. This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry,” Nexperia’s statement said.\n\n“The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act.”\n\nThe statement added that the government’s order has also prohibited Nexperia from relocating company assets, firing existing executives or making important decisions without explicit government approval for one year.\n\nNexperia said it is confident its daily operations will continue as usual.\n\nOn October 9, China  tightened export controls  for critical rare-earth metals, citing national security interests. Foreign companies must now obtain approval from Beijing before they can export the named rare-earth metals or any products that contain them. Exporters must tell the government how the products will be used.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare-earth metals, which are critical for its defence industry. Following China’s announcement about new export restrictions, US President Donald Trump responded by  threatening to impose a new 100 percent trade tariff  on China.\n\nBesides being used for the manufacture of smartphones, electric cars and weapons, rare-earth metals are also used in the manufacture of semiconductors, which are essential for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe US and its Western allies in Europe have, in recent years, passed regulations restricting China’s access to Western semiconductor technology, fearing that China could reverse-engineer and manufacture the technology, moving ahead in the technological race.\n\nIn 2022, former Democratic US President Joe Biden  restricted China’s access  to US semiconductors. The new rules extended restrictions on chipmaking tools being sold to industries which support the semiconductor supply chain. They blocked these industries from accessing US technical expertise, as well as the key components required to build the machines that produce microchips.\n\nThe US further tightened these restrictions in October 2023 and, again, in December 2024.\n\nOn September 29, 2025, the US Bureau of Industry and Security extended US export control restrictions to all groups which are at least 50 percent-owned by one or more entities on the US Entity List, a list of foreign organisations and companies believed to be participating in, or are at significant risk of participating in, activities that go against US national security or foreign policy interests. These entities are subject to sanctions, export restrictions or licensing requirements. While Nexperia itself is not on the list, Wingtech was added in December 2024.\n\nThen, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced export controls preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished components and sub-assemblies made in China.\n\n“Nexperia is actively engaging with the Chinese authorities to obtain an exemption from these restrictions and has deployed all available resources to that end,” the Nexperia statement said.\n\n“While Nexperia has made sufficient preparations to ensure business continuity – and as the BIS rule provides for a 60-day grace period – we are confident that a solution will be found,” Nexperia said in its statement on Tuesday.\n\nCompounding all this, earlier in the year, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with a tariff of 125 percent on US goods. Both countries then reduced their tariffs for 90 days in  May  to allow for trade talks. In August, the two agreed to another 90-day pause, with the most recent round of talks taking place between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nBut the US has also imposed restrictions on most Chinese cars from being sold in the US. These include high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition to its standard 10 percent car import duty, the EU announced last year that it would impose a range of additional tariffs on electric vehicles, from 7.8 percent for Tesla vehicles to 35.3 percent on China’s state-owned SAIC [Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation] vehicles.\n\nWingtech released a social media statement saying it “firmly opposes the politicisation of commercial matters”.\n\nIn the post, it deemed the Dutch government’s move “an excessive intervention based on geopolitical bias rather than a fact-based risk assessment” that is based on the “unfounded pretext of national security”.\n\nShares in Wingtech have plummeted by 10 percent on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since the announcement. As a result, Wingtech was forced to explain the situation to the exchange, saying that the Dutch government’s decision “temporarily restricts” its control over Nexperia.\n\nBeijing “consistently opposes the overstretching of national security concepts and discriminatory practices targeting companies from specific countries”, Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday.\n\n“Relevant countries should genuinely uphold market principles and avoid politicising economic and trade issues.”\n\nThe European Union has been closely coordinating with Dutch officials and will now work with the Netherlands to decide what to do next to protect important tech capabilities in Europe, according to European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-10","timeOfPublication":"11:47:27+00:00","title":"China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"China has tightened export controls on 12 of the 17 rare-earth metals, including five new additions, and restricted the export of specialized refining equipment.

2025-10-10T11:47:27+00:00\n\nTitle: China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters\n\nChina tightened export controls for critical rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nThe new restrictions, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, come in advance of an expected meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month.\n\nThe world’s two largest economies have been locked in trade negotiations aimed at calming tensions, after their tit-for-tat tariffs against each other earlier this year, before agreeing to pull back some of those duties.\n\nRare-earth metals are one of China’s major levers of influence with the US.\n\nIn “announcement number 61 of 2025”, China said it was increasing export controls for five rare-earth metals in addition to the  seven it announced in April this year .\n\nThe five metals added to the list are holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium.\n\nThe seven minerals China placed export restrictions on earlier this year are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nThere are 17 rare-earth metals in total – the 15 lanthanides (metallic elements) on the periodic table, as well as scandium and yttrium. China now has export restrictions on 12 of them.\n\nAdditionally, China also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday. Most of these restrictions will come into effect on December 1.\n\nThe announcement means that foreign companies will need to obtain special approvals from Beijing if they wish to export rare-earth magnets and certain semiconductor materials that have at least 0.1 percent heavy rare-earth metals from China.\n\nTo obtain the licence, foreign companies must explain the intended use of the product they wish to make using Chinese rare-earth metals.\n\nChina cited national security interests as the reason for these new restrictions.\n\n“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use properties for both civilian and military applications. Implementing export controls on them is an international practice,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters.\n\nThe spokesperson added that “certain” foreign organisations and individuals have been directly transferring – or processing and then transferring – controlled rare-earth materials originating from China to “relevant organisations and individuals directly or indirectly for military and other sensitive applications”.\n\n“This has caused significant damage or posed potential threats to China’s national security and interests, adversely affected international peace and stability, and hindered global non-proliferation efforts.”\n\nRare-earth metals are essential for the production of technological equipment such as electric cars, lithium-ion batteries, LED televisions and camera lenses.\n\nThe metals are crucial for the US defence industry. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank, rare earths are used to manufacture components of F-35 fighter jets, Virginia and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs.\n\nAdditionally, rare earths are used to create semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThis is a strategic move on the part of China, analysts say.\n\nChina is the largest producer of these rare-earth metals. It mines at least 60 percent and processes about 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth metals, CSIS reported in 2024.\n\nThe new restrictions have been announced just three weeks before Trump visits South Korea to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October.\n\nDuring his visit, Trump is expected to meet Xi. The leaders last met in person in 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump imposed tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports to the US. China retaliated with 125 percent tariffs. After reducing their tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, the two sides struck a truce in August, agreeing on a 90-day pause to allow time for trade talks. That pause has since been renewed twice as talks continue – most recently between US and Chinese officials in Spain last month.\n\nChina’s new restrictions on rare-earth metals, which Trump is known to want badly, give it more leverage for these talks.\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program, explained that the US defence industry is facing significant challenges caused by its limited production ability to meet rising defence technology needs. By restricting exports, China may be able to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the US.\n\n“The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening the capability gap,” Baskaran said.\n\n“The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting US efforts to bolster its industrial base at a time where Indo-Pacific tension is climbing,” she said.\n\n“Most [restrictions] don’t go into effect until December 1, 2025, leaving close to 2.5 months for these negotiations.”\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson told reporters on Thursday: “China is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation through bilateral and multilateral export control dialogue mechanisms, promote compliant trade, and ensure the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.”\n\nKristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, said Beijing’s latest moves are about leverage. She said this is a part of “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi during the APEC summit in South Korea.\n\n“China hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on export restrictions, but it’s reminding Washington that it could. This move signals that Beijing is willing to weaponise its dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, especially as both governments prepare for a potential Trump-Xi meeting at APEC. It’s a classic signalling manoeuvre designed to strengthen China’s negotiating hand.”\n\nThe US will be especially hit hard. In 2023, it was the largest importer of Chinese rare-earth minerals and products, importing $22.8m worth of products from China, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In total, China exported $117m in rare-earth metals and products that year.\n\nThe US sourced 70 percent of its rare-earth compounds and metals imports from China between 2020 and 2023, according to a US Geological Survey report.\n\n“On the defence side, we’re talking about inputs for fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and more. On the civilian side, everything from smartphones and medical imaging equipment to electric vehicles depends on rare earth magnets. In other words, this isn’t just about defence but touches the everyday technologies that enable our modern life,” Vekasi said.\n\nHong Kong ($12.1m), Russia ($12.2m) and Japan ($9.42m) also import significant amounts.\n\nThe US restricted China’s access to its semiconductors in 2022 under the administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden. Some US lawmakers have pushed for greater restrictions, warning that China could reverse-engineer or independently develop advanced semiconductor technologies, overtaking the US in the industry and securing a military advantage.\n\n“China’s move shows it can make life very difficult for US manufacturers – but doing so would also hurt its own economy, since many of these supply chains run both ways. It’s a reminder that the US-China economic relationship isn’t a clean decoupling story; the two markets are still very much intertwined,” Vekasi from the University of Montana said.\n\nYes.\n\nThe Commerce Ministry spokesperson said exports pertaining to emergency medical needs, in response to public health emergencies or for disaster relief, will be exempt from the restrictions."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/19/pakistan-launches-its-first-hyperspectral-satellite","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-19","timeOfPublication":"10:16:08+00:00","title":"Pakistan launches its first hyperspectral satellite","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan has successfully launched its first hyperspectral satellite, H1, from China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, marking a major step in its national space program.

overheating world will add 57 superhot days a year\n\nA new study by World Weather Attribution and United States-based Climate Central has calculated the increase in dangerous “superhot days” – defined as warmer than 90 percent of comparable days between 1991 and 2020 – due to climate change.\n\nThe report, which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution, was released on Thursday. It highlights the significant effect of the  Paris Climate Agreement .\n\nBefore the 2015 accord, the world was on track for a catastrophic 4C (7.2F) of warming by the end of the century, which would have resulted in an additional 114 superhot days per year.\n\nBy fulfilling current commitments to curb emissions, the world is now heading towards 2.6C (4.7F) of warming. Under this scenario, the Earth will still add 57 superhot days annually by 2100 – nearly two months of dangerously high temperatures – but this is half the increase of the worst-case scenario. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average.\n\nPotsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who was not part of the research team, said people should not be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth”.\n\nThe report does not say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but coauthor Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less”. She noted that thousands die in heatwaves each year already.\n\nThe study also underscores the profound unfairness of the impact of climate change across the world, showing a massive disconnect between carbon pollution and expected heat exposure.\n\nThe 10 countries that will experience the biggest increase in dangerous heat days are almost all small, ocean-dependent nations like Panama, the Solomon Islands, and Samoa. These countries are expected to see the largest spikes, with Panama projected to face 149 extra superhot days a year. These 10 nations collectively produce only 1 percent of global heat-trapping gases.\n\nIn stark contrast, the top carbon-polluting countries – the United States, China, and India – are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. Despite being responsible for 42 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide, they will face less than 1 percent of the additional superhot days.\n\nUniversity of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who was not part of the study team, said this heat inequality drives “yet another wedge between have and have-not nations”, potentially sowing seeds of geopolitical instability."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/20/un-pushes-for-worldwide-disaster-alerts-as-extreme-weather-spirals","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-20","timeOfPublication":"12:35:15+00:00","title":"UN pushes for worldwide disaster alerts as extreme weather ‘spirals’","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency, has issued a global call to action for improving early-warning systems for extreme weather, citing that nearly half of all countries lack adequate systems, with 90% of weather-related deaths occurring in developing nations.

countries lack early-warning systems for extreme weather events, leaving millions – especially those in developing nations – vulnerable.\n\nAs it released a new report on Monday, the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) called for gaps in global monitoring and forecasting networks to be plugged. Timely alerts are crucial to saving lives as extreme weather events multiply due to climate change, it warned.\n\n“Many millions of people lack protection against dangerous weather, which is inflicting an increasing toll on economic assets and vital infrastructure,” said a statement by the WMO, noting that disaster-related deaths are six times higher in countries without early-warning systems.\n\nThe organisation said weather, water and climate-related hazards have killed more than 2 million people in the past 50 years. It added that 90 percent of those deaths occurred in developing countries.\n\n“Impacts are spiralling as weather becomes more extreme,” it said.\n\nThe WMO acknowledged that there has been “huge progress” in climate monitoring over the last decade. The number of countries using some form of multi-hazard early warning systems has jumped from 52 to at least 108.\n\nHowever, it continued, an assessment of 62 countries showed half of them possess only basic capacity and 16 percent have less than basic capacity.\n\n“The situation is worst in fragile, conflict and violence-affected contexts,” the organisation said.\n\nNevertheless, the WMO is seeing progress in Africa, with more countries having functioning websites and issuing standardised alerts.\n\n“Early warning means early action. Our goal is to not only warn the world; it is to empower it,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a speech as the UN institution opened its annual conference in Geneva on Monday.\n\nThe world has been rocked by numerous weather-related disasters in 2025. Huge  flooding has rocked countries including Pakistan ,  Nigeria  and  South Korea . Wildfires have devastated large areas in  southern Europe , as well as  the US .\n\nThe head of Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, Elisabeth Baume-Schneider, told delegates at the conference that no country or region was spared from the effects of climate change and extreme weather.\n\nShe pointed to the example of how the regular monitoring of a mountain glacier allowed scientists to warn about its imminent collapse in May 2025, allowing for the evacuation of the Swiss village of Blatten.\n\n“Permafrost melt will inevitably lead to more glacier collapses and rockfalls,” making early warning systems vital, she said."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/nba-season-milestones-a7300c8ca99d910cfa263e394172453c","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"10:00:09+00:00","title":"NBA Season Opens With Record International Players, Global Expansion Talks","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 NBA season opens with a record 135 international-born players, the most in league history, from 43 countries, with 71 from Europe — the highest number from that continent.

At this point, every time Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James plays he updates league records. He’s the NBA’s all-time leader in points and minutes and has a few more milestones in his sights this season. — His first game of the year will officially make this his 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the most in NBA history by a player. — If he plays in 50 games, he’ll break the record of 1,611 (regular season only) held by Robert Parish. — If he makes 350 field goals, he’ll break Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s mark of 15,837. Milestones on the way — James Harden of the Los Angeles Clippers has 27,687 points in his career and needs 603 more points to pass Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony for 10th on the NBA’s all-time list. — Sacramento’s Russell Westbrook needs 75 assists to become the eighth player in NBA history with 10,000. — Indiana coach Rick Carlisle is seven wins shy of 1,000 in his career. He’ll be the 11th coach to get it and probably the last for at least a few more years; Miami’s Erik Spoelstra enters this season with 787 wins. — Spoelstra is nine wins shy of passing Red Auerbach for the most wins coaching one team. Auerbach won 795 with the Celtics; only Gregg Popovich (1,390 with San Antonio) and Jerry Sloan (1,127 with Utah) had more wins with one franchise. — Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers has been on the sideline for 1,978 games, which is eighth-most — for now — in league history. If he coaches the full season, he’ll climb to No. 4 on the all-time games coached list, passing Bill Fitch (2,050), Jerry Sloan (2,024), Larry Brown (2,002) and George Karl (1,999). No. 1 on that list is Lenny Wilkens (2,487), No. 2 is Don Nelson (2,318) and No. 3 is Gregg Popovich (2,214). \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n — Denver, Brooklyn, Indiana and San Antonio will all play their 4,000th all-time NBA game this season. Denver will get there against Brooklyn on Jan. 29, Indiana’s milestone game comes Feb. 2 at home against Houston, while San Antonio and Brooklyn will both get there on Feb. 5 — the Spurs doing so in Dallas, the Nets doing so in Orlando. — Atlanta is 33 wins away from becoming the sixth franchise with 3,000 regular season wins, joining Boston, the Los Angeles Lakers, Philadelphia, New York and Golden State. — Indiana is 20 wins from 2,000 regular season wins. 14 million coming The league enters this season about 46,000 points shy of someone scoring the 14 millionth point in NBA history. Based on last year’s average of about 228 points per game being scored, it’ll take somewhere around 200 games this season for someone to reach the milestone.  That means it’ll happen somewhere around Nov. 17, give or take a day or two either way. \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n Name game Among the name highlights in the NBA this season, based on the opening night rosters: — There are seven Jordans (Boston’s Jordan Walsh, the Los Angeles Clippers’ Jordan Miller, New Orleans’ Jordan Hawkins and Jordan Poole, New York’s Jordan Clarkson, Phoenix’s Jordan Goodwin and San Antonio’s Jordan McLaughlin). Combined, they’re about 10,000 points behind Michael Jordan’s career total. — There are five players named Nikola (Denver’s Nikola Jokic, Miami’s Nikola Jovic, Oklahoma City’s Nikola Topic, Atlanta’s Nikola Durisic and Chicago’s Nikola Vucevic). — There are five James (the Lakers’ LeBron and Bronny James, the Clippers’ James Harden, Indiana’s James Wiseman and Charlotte’s Sion James). \n     \n         \n     \n        freestar.queue.push(function () {\n            window.fsAdCount = window.fsAdCount + 1 || 0;\n            let customChannel = '/dynamic_' + fsAdCount;\n            let adList = document.querySelectorAll(\".fs-feed-ad\")\n            let thisAd = adList[fsAdCount];\n            let randId = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);\n            thisAd.id = randId;\n            let thisPlacement = fsAdCount == 0 ? \"apnews_story_feed\" : \"apnews_story_feed_dynamic\";\n            freestar.newAdSlots({\n                placementName: thisPlacement,\n                slotId: randId\n            }, customChannel);\n        });\n     \n \n — Orlando Robinson might be the only player in the league who’ll wear his first name on the front of his jersey and his last name on the back. He has a two-way deal with the Magic. — The Bucks have three Antetokounmpo brothers: Giannis, Thanasis and two-way player Alex. The Nets are young. Really young The Brooklyn Nets are young. So young, in fact, that they don’t have anyone on their roster who ranks among the league’s top 100 active scorers headed into this season. The numbers are wild when put into perspective. Players on the Nets’ opening night roster have combined for 21,708 points and 1,018 starts at this point in their careers. There are eight active players — LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, DeMar DeRozan, Chris Paul and Damian Lillard — with more points than the Nets’ roster starts this season with. James, Paul, DeRozan, Mike Conley, Durant, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook, Brook Lopez and Stephen Curry all have more starts. James, Andre Drummond and Nikola Vucevic have more rebounds than everyone on the Nets roster. Curry — the NBA’s all-time 3-point king — leads a group of six players with more 3s than the Nets, while there are 10 players with more steals and 26 players with more assists. The leading scorer on the Nets’ roster right now is Michael Porter Jr., with 5,597 points in his career to this point. ___ AP NBA:  https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/15/is-your-beef-linked-to-amazon-deforestation-a-report-highlights-loopholes","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-15","timeOfPublication":"13:18:36+00:00","title":"Is your beef linked to Amazon deforestation?

The investigation highlights a critical gap in supply chain traceability: Brazil’s animal transit permit (GTA) system tracks only group-level data, not individual animals, making it impossible to verify cattle origins. Cattle from deforested zones are reportedly moved through a 'laundering' system that hides their illegal origins before reaching JBS slaughterhouses.

JBS acknowledged in its 2024 SEC filing that it cannot guarantee the legality of its cattle sources and has failed to meet past commitments to trace indirect suppliers. While Brazil has introduced traceability mandates in Pará (by 2026) and at the federal level (by 2032), experts argue these timelines are too slow and voluntary corporate actions are insufficient.

A report highlights loopholes\n\nThe world’s largest meat company, JBS, has allegedly fuelled illegal deforestation, land grabs and human rights abuses in the Brazilian Amazon by sourcing cattle from ranches operating inside protected areas, according to a new Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the nonprofit issued an 86-page report focusing on the state of Pará, where the United Nations will hold its annual climate change summit, COP30, next month.\n\nThe report highlights a gap in JBS’s supply chain: Human Rights Watch claims the meat company does not track its indirect cattle suppliers.\n\nInvestigators found that cattle raised on illegally deforested land were moved through a “laundering” system that concealed their origins before they reached JBS.\n\nThat, in turn, means JBS cannot guarantee that its beef or leather products are not contributing to deforestation and related abuses.\n\nWithout a better system for tracing livestock, JBS will continue to be “unable to root out illegal cattle ranches”, according to Luciana Téllez, a senior environment researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd what JBS does not know could make it responsible for bankrolling illegal ranches that clear-cut the Amazon, she explained.\n\n“We cannot say with 100-percent certainty that the cattle that JBS purchased from its direct suppliers are the same ones that are coming from illegal cattle ranches, but neither can JBS,” Téllez told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That’s a problem, because they are responsible for what they are procuring.”\n\nWednesday’s report is part of an ever-growing body of literature delving into the impact agriculture has had on the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThe construction of ranches and farmland is considered the single biggest direct cause of deforestation in the world’s tropical regions.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is no exception. In recent years, cattle ranching has emerged as a primary culprit in the levelling of its tangled, biodiverse jungles.\n\nThe northern state of Pará is key to the fight against further loss. It has consistently recorded the highest levels of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2016.\n\nIn 2024 alone, 17,195 square kilometres (6,639 sq miles) of forest in the state were degraded, a 421-percent increase over the previous year, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe state also reports the second-largest number of land conflicts in Brazil, with illegal ranchers, farmers and criminal groups seeking to invade protected land.\n\nFor Indigenous and traditional communities that consider the Amazon home, these invasions have been devastating. Residents have seen their crops destroyed, the forest burned, and their lives displaced.\n\nIn some cases, community members have even been threatened, attacked or killed after denouncing the land grabs.\n\nThough federal law prohibits such activity, some land-grabbers have succeeded in fraudulently registering protected rainforest as private properties.\n\nWednesday’s report documented encroachments in two protected areas: the Cachoeira Seca Indigenous territory and the Terra Nossa sustainable development area.\n\n“The level of violence and intimidation by land grabbers in Terra Nossa is truly frightening, and the absolute impunity they’ve enjoyed for years is astonishing,” Tellez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said that Pará’s state animal health agency, Adepará, had registered ranches in both tracts of land. It also authorised the transportation of cattle in and out of the two areas.\n\nAccording to the report, Adepará claimed that it has not historically been tasked with observing environmental criteria when authorising livestock movements.\n\nBut with the state agency’s approval, Human Rights Watch said cattle were raised illegally inside the protected rainforest zones and then transferred out to other ranches.\n\nFrom there, they could reach major slaughterhouses, including JBS facilities.\n\nEach transfer helped obscure the cattle’s illegal origin, effectively laundering the animals into the meat trade.\n\nPart of the problem, according to Human Rights Watch, is Brazil’s system for tracking livestock.\n\nBrazil does not keep full histories of individual animals. Instead, their movements are documented with “animal transit permits”, known as Guias de Trânsito Animal or GTAs.\n\nThose permits collect information about overall shipments of animals: the number of cattle involved, plus data about the sex and the age of those in the group.\n\nBut without an individual record for every cow, calf and bull, it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace their origins.\n\nIn an April filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, JBS acknowledged the loopholes in how the GTA system traces cattle.\n\n“As a result, there can be no assurance that available monitoring procedures can ensure that the origin of any head of cattle was in full compliance with applicable laws,” JBS wrote.\n\nThe company has promised to require its suppliers to declare their suppliers by 2026. Yet, Human Rights Watch says it remains unclear how such information would be verified or enforced.\n\n“The best solution is for the federal government itself to institute a traceability mechanism for cattle across Brazil,” Tellez said. “The Brazilian government is moving towards that, but it’s moving extremely slowly.”\n\nJBS also made a similar commitment more than a decade and a half ago. In 2009, the company signed the G4 Cattle Agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, pledging to identify all its indirect suppliers by 2011. It failed to meet that deadline.\n\n“It’s unacceptable that companies such as JBS have not fulfilled the promises that they made in the past,” Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Brazil, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s something that now governments need to reflect upon and regulate in a more stringent way, because only believing in voluntary corporate commitments is not going to deliver.”\n\nJBS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by publication.\n\nBut reform may be on the horizon. In 2023, Pará’s governor introduced a decree requiring all animal movements in the state to be fully traceable by the end of 2026.\n\nAt the federal level, the Ministry of Agriculture announced a similar plan in December 2024, mandating that all states implement tracking systems by 2032.\n\nHowever, Human Rights Watch warns that this timeline is too slow and could allow illegal ranching to persist for years.\n\nExperts and advocacy groups say that Brazil should take immediate steps, including by making GTA data publicly accessible. Such measures would help law enforcement agencies identify fraudulent movements and trace cattle back to illegal ranches.\n\n“Companies struggle with traceability, firstly because they have minimal access to public data on the production chain,” said Lisandro Inakake, an agronomist with the Brazilian environmental nonprofit Imaflora.\n\nHe added that the struggle is compounded “because there are no universal market requirements covering all of the companies’ operations”.\n\nWhile Human Rights Watch has called on JBS to voluntarily start tracing the lifespan of its cattle, Mazzetti, the Greenpeace campaigner, believes more decisive action is necessary if deforestation is to be stopped.\n\n“It’s not time for new promises,” she said. “It’s time to be held accountable for all the impacts that their supply chain generated in the Amazon, in other ecosystems, and also on the climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/bus-collision-on-highway-near-ugandas-capital-kampala-kills-63-people","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"08:30:44+00:00","title":"Collision on highway in Uganda kills 46 people","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A severe road accident on the Kampala-Gulu Highway in Uganda, near Kiryandongo, resulted in at least 46 deaths after two buses attempting to overtake a truck and car collided head-on.

capital amid protests\n\nPeru’s Interim President Jose Jeri has declared a state of emergency in the capital, Lima, to stem a  wave of protests  that contributed to the recent downfall of his predecessor.\n\nIn a televised message on Tuesday, Jeri said the emergency in the city would last 30 days.\n\n“Wars are won with actions, not words,” the president said, adding that he is planning a new approach to fighting crime that he described as going “from defence to offence”.\n\nUnder the state of emergency, the government can send the army to patrol the streets and restrict freedom of assembly and other rights.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Mariana Sanchez, reporting from Lima, said the announcement comes after six days of uncertainty over whether the interim government would push ahead.\n\nIn the decree formally declaring the emergency, the government did not mention how it intended to gather critically needed intelligence to curb extortion cases, which are estimated at 18,000 this year, up 30 percent from last year, Sanchez said.\n\nThe rise in extortions has also led to an increase in killings in recent years. Between January and September, police authorities reported 1,690 homicides, compared with 1,502 during the same period of 2024.\n\n“The state of emergency will lift constitutional rights and people will not be able to protest,” Sanchez said.\n\nDina Boluarte was removed as president by Peru’s Congress on October 10 after an impeachment during which lawmakers said she had been unable to tackle the crime wave. Jeri, the parliament speaker, replaced her immediately and will serve as interim president until July next year.\n\nPeru has been roiled by weeks of antigovernment protests over corruption and organised crime led by Gen-Z activists.\n\nOn Thursday, protests to demand Jeri’s resignation turned violent. One person was killed and about 100 were injured, including police officers and some journalists.\n\nJeri has said  he will not resign .\n\nEarlier, Boluarte had declared a  30-day state of emergency in March  following the murder of a famous musician, but the move did little to reduce crime.\n\nPaul Flores , a well-known cumbia singer, was killed when assailants attacked the bus he was travelling on in an apparent attempt to extort the operator."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/pariss-louvre-museum-reopens-after-102m-jewel-heist","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:36:55+00:00","title":"Paris’s Louvre Museum reopens after $102m jewel heist","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre Museum in Paris reopened three days after a high-profile heist in which thieves stole an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) in jewels, including a Napoleon-era necklace and a diadem from Empress Eugenie.

2025-10-21T02:23:04+00:00\n\nTitle: What caused Amazon’s AWS outage, and why did so many major apps go offline?\n\nA  major outage  at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday disrupted a large portion of the internet, taking down apps, websites and online tools used by millions of people around the world, before services were eventually restored.\n\nThe hours-long  breakdown  of the cloud system that supports a portion of the internet revealed just how much of modern-life depends on the infrastructure – from banking apps and airlines to smart home devices and gaming platforms.\n\nHere is what we know:\n\nAt about 07:11 GMT, Amazon’s cloud service experienced a major outage, meaning some of its systems stopped working, which disrupted many popular apps and websites, including banks, gaming platforms and entertainment services.\n\nThe problem started in one of AWS’s main data centres in Virginia, its oldest and biggest site, after a technical update to the API – a connection between different computer programmes – of DynamoDB, a key cloud database service that stores user information and other important data for many online platforms.\n\nThe root cause appears to have been an error in the update that affected the Domain Name System (DNS), which helps apps find the correct server addresses. A DNS works like the internet’s phone book, turning website names into the numeric IP addresses that computers use to connect to servers.\n\nBecause of the DNS issue, apps could not find the IP address for DynamoDB’s API and were unable to connect.\n\nAs DynamoDB went down, other AWS services also began to fail. In total, 113 services were affected by the outage. By 10:11 GMT, Amazon said that all AWS returned to normal operations, but there was a backlog “of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours”.\n\nAt the time of publication, Downdetector, a website that tracks internet outages based on user reports, was still showing problems with platforms such as OpenAI, ESPN and Apple Music.\n\nUpdated look at the total impact of the AWS Outage up to this point! https://t.co/Bgpm1fFGtf   pic.twitter.com/TAAxjagNl6\n\n— Downdetector (@downdetector)  October 20, 2025\n\nA cloud is a way of storing and using data or programmes over the internet instead of on your computer or other physical storage devices.\n\nWhen people say something is “in the cloud”, it means the files, apps or systems are running on powerful computers (called servers) in data centres owned by companies like Amazon (AWS), Google or Microsoft, not on your personal device.\n\nIn this case, AWS allows companies to rent computing power and storage. It supplies the technology that runs websites, apps and many online services behind the scenes.\n\nOne of AWS’s core services is DynamoDB, a database that stores important information for companies, such as customer records. On Monday, Amazon reported that customers were unable to access their DynamoDB data.\n\nAWS is the biggest cloud service provider in the world.\n\nCloud outages are not rare, but they have become more noticeable as more companies rely on these services every day.\n\n“The fallout impacted people across a number of different spheres,” Joshua Mahony, the chief market analyst at Scope Markets, told Al Jazeera. [But] of course this kind of comes with the territory with tech companies; the key is they can resolve it quickly, and it doesn’t cost them a lot of money.”\n\nHe said Amazon would likely weather the storm from the incident.\n\n“You’re looking at something that is relatively contained,” he said. “Amazon Web Services has cornered 30 percent of the market alone. Their users are not going to suddenly jump ship. Their businesses are deeply ingrained.”\n\nThe outage affected dozens of websites, including Snapchat, Pinterest and Apple TV, according to Downdetector.\n\nOther communication apps were also affected including: WhatsApp, Signal, Zoom and Slack; gaming services such as Roblox, Fortnite and Xbox; and places like Starbucks. Etsy also experienced issues.\n\nIn the United States, people were having issues with financial apps too, including Venmo.\n\nSome users said their Ring doorbells and Alexa speakers stopped working, while others could not access the Amazon website or download books on their Kindles.\n\nThe language app Duolingo and creative tool Canva were among those reporting errors on their websites, and several media organisations were hit, including the Associated Press news agency, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBanks, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and AI firm Perplexity also reported issues, along with US airlines Delta and United.\n\nWhen AWS had its outage, it was not just Amazon’s tools that were affected. Thousands of other companies that use AWS for storage, databases or web hosting were also hit. These companies include many major apps that rely on AWS to run key parts of their systems.\n\n“Whenever we see these headlines, the first thought that goes through everybody’s mind, that sends a shiver up the spine, is, ‘Is this one of those cyberattacks? Is this a military or intelligence-led thing that has led to this disruption?’ And in this case, it’s not,” Bryson Bort chief executive of the cybersecurity company Scythe told Al Jazeera.\n\n“In fact, most of the time, it isn’t. It’s usually human error.”\n\nAWS  acknowledged  the outage and said engineers were “immediately engaged” to fix the problem.\n\nAWS said it worked on “multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery”. It also reported that the main issue had been fully resolved, though some users continued to face minor delays as systems recovered.\n\nThe company also said it would publish a detailed post-event summary explaining what happened."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/is-jd-vance-right-in-blaming-left-for-political-violence-in-the-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:44:36+00:00","title":"Is JD Vance right in blaming left for political violence in the US?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk in September 2025, U.S. Vice President JD Vance claimed that political violence is a bigger problem on the left, citing a short-term study from the first six months of 2025.

About a minute later, he added, “Right now that violent impulse is a bigger problem on the left than the right.”\n\nA Vance spokesperson did not answer our questions. When referring to  left-wing  violence, a White House spokesperson recently pointed to a September 28 Axios article about a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a nonprofit policy research organisation.\n\nDemocrats, calling your political opponents Nazis has consequences.\n\nStudy: Left-wing terrorism climbs to 30-year high https://t.co/30NvIj9nzC\n\n— Abigail Jackson (@ATJackson47)  September 28, 2025\n\nThe study found that “2025 marks the first time in more than 30 years that left-wing terrorist attacks outnumber those from the violent far right”. The study also showed that for the 30 years before 2025,  right-wing  attacks had outpaced left-wing violence.\n\n“The rise in left-wing attacks merits increased attention, but the fall in right-wing attacks is probably temporary, and it too requires a government response,” the authors wrote in the study.\n\nVance’s statement oversimplified political violence and drew from part of one study of a six-month period. The federal government has no single, official definition of “political violence”, and ascribing ideologies such as the left wing and the right wing is sometimes complicated. There is no agreed upon number of left- or right-wing politically violent attacks.\n\nResearch before 2025 largely points to higher levels of right-wing violence over longer periods of time.\n\nTrump has used the administration’s statements about rising left-wing violence to label antifa as a domestic “terrorist threat”, and administration officials also said they will investigate what they call left-wing groups that fund violence.\n\nAlthough political violence is a small subset of violent crime in the US, it “has a disproportionate impact because even rare incidents can amplify fear, influence policy and deepen societal polarisation”, sociology professors at the University of Dayton, Arthur Jipson and Paul J Becker, wrote in September after Kirk’s assassination.\n\nIn an email interview with PolitiFact, Becker said the report in question “indicates there MAY be a shift occurring from the Right being more violent but 5 vs 1 incidents in 6 months isn’t enough to completely erase years of data and reports from multiple sources showing the opposite or to dictate new policies”.\n\nThe CSIS, a national security and defence think tank, published a September report examining 750 “terrorist” attacks and plots in the US between 1994 and July 4, 2025.\n\nThe report defined “terrorism” as the use or threat of violence “with the intent to achieve political goals by creating a broad psychological impact”.\n\nThe authors wrote that it is difficult to pinpoint some perpetrators’ ideologies, which in some cases are more of what former FBI Director Christopher Wray called a “salad bar of ideologies”. For example,  Thomas Crooks , who allegedly attempted to assassinate Trump in 2024, searched the internet more than 60 times for Trump and then-President Joe Biden in the month before the attack.\n\nThe full CSIS report gave a more complete picture of politically motivated violence:\n\nStudies have not uniformly agreed on some attackers’ ideological classifications. The libertarian Cato Institute categorised the person charged in the shooting deaths of two Israeli embassy staffers in May 2025 as “left-wing”, while the CSIS study described the motivation as “ethnonationalist”. Ethnonationalism is a political ideology based on heritage, such as ethnic identity, which can create clashes with other groups. The Cato study counted only deaths, while the CSIS analysis was not limited to deaths.\n\n“While Vance’s statement has a factual anchor for that limited timespan, it selectively emphasises one short-term slice rather than the broader trend,” Jipson, of the University of Dayton, told PolitiFact. “In that sense, it can be misleading: It may give the impression that left-wing violence is generally now more dangerous or prevalent, which is not borne out by the longer view of the data.”\n\nThe Cato analysis, published after Kirk’s death, said 3,597 people were killed in politically motivated US “terrorist” attacks from January 1, 1975, through September 10, 2025.\n\nCato found right-wing attacks were more common than left-wing violence. This research has been highlighted by some House Democrats.\n\nWrong again, JD. The data is clear: for decades, right-wing extremism has been the greater threat. https://t.co/TkxBZ08Xjg   https://t.co/PCWv4EuP4H\n\n— House Homeland Security Committee Democrats (@HomelandDems)  October 15, 2025\n\nCato wrote that during that period, “terrorists” inspired by what it called “Islamist ideology” were responsible for 87 percent of people killed in attacks on US soil, while right-wing attackers accounted for 11 percent and left-wing “terrorists” accounted for about 2 percent. Excluding the September 11, 2001 attacks showed right-wing attackers were responsible for a majority of deaths. Measuring homicides since 2020 also showed a larger number by the right than the left.\n\nVance said, “Political violence, it’s just a statistical fact that it’s a bigger problem on the left.”\n\nHe did not point to a source, but a White House spokesperson separately cited an article about a study that examined political violence from 1994 to July 4, 2025. It found that, in the first six months of 2025, left-wing attacks outnumbered those by the right. It is based on a small number of incidents: four attacks and one disrupted plot.\n\nThe study also showed that for 30 years before 2025, right-wing attacks had outpaced left-wing attacks.\n\nThe study detailed that the left wing “remains much lower than historical levels of violence carried out by right-wing and jihadist attackers”. Research before 2025 largely points to higher levels of right-wing violence over longer periods of time.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth because left-wing violence rose in the first six months of 2025. However, it ignores that right-wing violence was higher for a much longer period of time.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n\nChief correspondent Louis Jacobson contributed to this fact-check."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/jewels-stolen-from-louvre-museum-in-paris-valued-at-102m-prosecutor","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:45:55+00:00","title":"Jewels stolen from Louvre museum in Paris valued at $102m: Prosecutor","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Royal jewels from 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense, along with the crown of Empress Eugenie, were stolen in a brazen daylight robbery at the Louvre museum in Paris.

2025-10-22T12:07:56+00:00\n\nTitle: Why planned Trump-Putin talks collapsed, and what it means for Ukraine\n\nPlans for  an in-person meeting  between United States President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in the next two weeks in Budapest, Hungary,  fell apart  on Tuesday, after Trump proposed “freezing” the Russia-Ukraine war with a ceasefire along the current front lines.\n\nApparently signalling that no meeting would take place anytime soon, Trump told the media at the White House on Tuesday: “I don’t want to have a wasted meeting. I don’t want to have a waste of time, so I’ll see what happens.”\n\nThe latest derailing of peace talks to bring an end to Russia’s 42-month-long war on Ukraine comes just two months after Trump and Putin met at a hastily arranged  summit in Alaska  in August this year that also did not yield any results.\n\nThe largest and deadliest war in Europe since World War II has killed tens of thousands of people on both sides.\n\nSo, why have plans for talks collapsed yet again, and what will it take for Russia to end the war?\n\nDuring his presidential campaign last year, Trump  boasted  that it would take him just “24 hours” to end the  war between Russia and Ukraine . More than a year later – and 10 months into his second term as US president – he is now growing increasingly frustrated about the lack of progress.\n\nPutin has called for the complete disarmament of Ukraine and for Russia to keep any territory it has seized during the war if it is to agree to a ceasefire. Ukraine has baulked at the notion of ceding land, and Trump has been unable to make any headway between the two positions.\n\nLate on Sunday, Trump called on Russia to, instead, “freeze” the war along current battle lines, adding that the two sides could aim to resolve the “details” over territory at future talks.\n\n“What I say is they should stop right now at the battle lines, go home, stop killing people and be done,” the US president said.\n\nThe current front line runs through the Donbas region, an industrial hub which has endured most of the fighting. On the region’s future, Trump said: “Let it be cut the way it is. It’s cut up right now – I think 78 percent of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is right now. They can negotiate something later on down the line.”\n\nYes. A statement signed by European leaders, including Zelenskyy, on Tuesday said they “strongly” supported Trump’s proposal to stop the fighting immediately, and that “the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations”.\n\nThe leaders accused the Russian president of stalling the peace process. “Russia’s stalling tactics have shown time and time again that Ukraine is the only party serious about peace,” the statement said. “We can all see that Putin continues to choose violence and destruction.”\n\nThe leaders also pledged to “ramp up the pressure on Russia’s economy and its defence industry, until Putin is ready to make peace”.\n\nOn Monday, before plans for a Trump-Putin meeting collapsed, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made clear that the Russian leader would not acquiesce to the latest proposal to “freeze” the war. He said “the consistency of Russia’s position doesn’t change”, referring to its insistence on hardline demands to end its war, including a complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the eastern regions that Moscow has laid claim to.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Reuters news agency reported that Russia had also sent a private communique to the US “over the weekend”, demanding control of all of Ukraine’s Donbas region – not just the parts it has already seized.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also spoke with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio by telephone on Tuesday, and later told reporters in Moscow that he had conveyed that Moscow “has not changed its position compared to the understandings that were reached during the Alaska summit”.\n\nLavrov reiterated Putin’s Alaska summit position, noting that Russia would agree to end the war only after eliminating the “primary causes” of the conflict – meaning the disarming of Ukraine and the ceding of territory lost to Russia during the war.\n\nThat is unacceptable to Kyiv.\n\nYes. Trump has  repeatedly shifted his position  while attempting to mediate a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nWhile the previous US administration, under President Joe Biden, expressed unflinching support for Ukraine, the Trump administration took a hard line with Zelenskyy during a  meeting at the Oval Office  in Washington, DC, in February this year. During a fiery exchange, Trump and Vice President JD Vance admonished Zelenskyy for not expressing enough gratitude to the US for the help it has already provided.\n\nIn March, Trump threatened sweeping secondary tariffs and sanctions against Moscow – and repeated this threat in August. But when he later met Putin in Alaska in August, he appeared to be pressuring Zelenskyy to accept a deal, even as the Kremlin demanded that Ukraine cede territories and keep away from NATO.\n\n“There’ll be some land swapping going on,” Trump told reporters, insisting that both sides would need to cede territories.\n\nSwitching tack yet again the following month, Trump appeared to again back the Ukrainian president, when he stated that Kyiv could win back its territories – or “maybe even go further than that”.\n\nMostly, more uncertainty. The collapse of the planned summit means that, for now, there is no end to the Russia-Ukraine war in sight.\n\nLast week, Zelenskyy was again at the White House, as he pressed his demand for the supply of US Tomahawk missiles, hoping it would equip Kyiv to hit targets deep inside Russian territory. He did not secure that agreement.\n\nTrump had expressed openness to the idea previously; however, he backtracked from that possibility during the meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday.\n\nZelenskyy has also been pressing the White House to increase military support generally, but Trump has previously signalled that Ukraine’s European allies in NATO should be the ones to take a more proactive role."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/22/live-gaza-palestinians-say-no-change-with-ceasefire-as-israel-blocks-aid?update=4052272","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:00:22Z","title":"Israel kills one in Gaza, adding to dozens killed since ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US Vice President JD Vance is visiting Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing optimism that the ceasefire in Gaza is progressing better than expected, despite ongoing Israeli attacks and ongoing civilian casualties.

detained healthcare workers currently held in appalling conditions in Israel.\n\nThe protest comes just days after an Israeli court extended Abu Safia’s arbitrary detention for another six months under the widely condemned Unlawful Combatants Law.\n\nA further five healthcare workers have died or been killed while in Israeli detention, and five more are missing, their whereabouts unknown. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, at least 1,722 healthcare workers have been killed in Israeli strikes in the past two years.\n\nAccording to HWW, most healthcare workers were abducted by the Israeli military from their hospitals or ambulances while they were on duty. Testimonies collected by HWW and other organisations catalogue the torture and abuse that Palestinians endure in Israeli detention.\n\nDr Rebecca Inglis, an intensive care doctor and co-founder of Gaza Medic Voices, says: “Israel’s continued detention of nearly one hundred healthcare workers is in clear contravention of International Humanitarian Law. We are gravely concerned for their welfare given the extensive evidence that Palestinian detainees are being tortured while in Israeli detention.”\n\nAbu Safia , the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza, was arrested by Israeli forces on December 27, 2024, after troops raided the hospital, which at the time was one of the last functioning medical facilities in the region.\n\nAmnesty International says that the hospital director has been held without charge or trial under an Israeli security law.\n\nDespite relentless bombardment and the tragic death of his own son in an Israeli air strike, Abu Safia remained on duty, caring for patients and leading his team through unimaginable conditions.\n\nSince his detention, credible reports have emerged of torture, physical abuse and degrading treatment, including suffering significant weight loss and the denial of adequate medical care, hygiene and timely access to legal counsel – in clear violation of international law.\n\nAt least 94 percent of hospitals in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, with many no longer operational. In addition to this, skilled doctors and healthcare workers have been killed, and paired with the detention of healthcare workers – most of whom were detained while working within hospitals and healthcare facilities – it has added to the immense pressure on Gaza’s vulnerable health system.\n\nBetween October 7, 2023, to October 20, 2025, HWW documented a total of 431 cases of detained Palestinian healthcare workers.\n\nAs of October 20, 2025:\n\nHWW has said it has not yet received an update from the families of 22 detained healthcare workers, who are not included in the “confirmed detained” or “confirmed released” figures.\n\nThe healthcare professionals still detained by Israel have spent an average of 511 days in detention, with some held captive since the early weeks of the war.\n\nOf the 95 being held, 80 are from Gaza, while the remaining 15 are from the occupied West Bank.\n\nFrom Gaza alone, 31 nurses have been detained, followed by 17 physicians, 15 hospital support and management staff, 14 paramedics, two pharmacists and one medical technician. Twenty-five held senior positions, 50 occupied mid-level positions, while five were junior healthcare workers.

earlier this year. The speaker, who sounded just like Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, had a special request: Please send money to help us free kidnapped Italian journalists in the Middle East.\n\nBut it was not Crosetto at the end of the line. He learned about the call only when several of the targeted businessmen contacted him about it. It eventually transpired that fraudsters had used artificial intelligence (AI) to fake Crosetto’s voice.\n\nAdvances in AI technology mean it is now possible to generate ultrarealistic voiceovers and soundbites. Indeed, new research has found that AI-generated voices are now indistinguishable from real human voices. In this explainer, we unpack what the implications of this could be.\n\nSeveral Italian entrepreneurs and businessmen received calls at the start of February, one month after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had secured the release of Italian journalist  Cecilia Sala , who had been imprisoned in Iran.\n\nIn the calls, the  “deepfake”  voice of Crosetto asked the businessmen to wire approximately 1 million euros ($1.17m) to an overseas bank account, the details of which were provided during the call or in other calls purporting to be from members of Crosetto’s staff.\n\nOn February 6, Crosetto posted on X, saying he had received a call on February 4 from “a friend, a prominent entrepreneur”. That friend asked Crosetto if his office had called to ask for his mobile number. Crosetto said it had not. “I tell him it was absurd, as I already had it, and that it was impossible,” he wrote in his X post.\n\nCrosetto added that he was later contacted by another businessman who had made a large bank transfer following a call from a “General” who provided bank account information.\n\n“He calls me and tells me that he was contacted by me and then by a General, and that he had made a very large bank transfer to an account provided by the ‘General’. I tell him it’s a scam and inform the carabinieri [Italian police], who go to his house and take his complaint.”\n\nSimilar calls from fake Ministry of Defence officials were also made to other entrepreneurs, asking for personal information and money.\n\nWhile he has reported all this to the police, Crosetto added: “I prefer to make the facts public so that no one runs the risk of falling into the trap.”\n\nSome of Italy’s most prominent business figures, including late fashion designer Giorgio Armani and Prada cofounder Patrizio Bertelli, were targeted in the scam. But, according to the authorities, only Massimo Moratti, the former owner of Inter Milan football club, actually sent the requested money. The police were able to trace and freeze the money from the wire transfer he made.\n\nMoratti has since filed a legal complaint with the city’s prosecutor’s office. He told Italian media: “I filed the complaint, of course, but I’d prefer not to talk about it and see how the investigation goes .  It all seemed real. They were good. It could happen to anyone.”\n\nAI voice generators typically use “deep learning” algorithms, through which the AI program studies large data sets of real human voices and “learns” pitch, enunciation, intonation and other elements of a voice.\n\nThe AI program is trained using several audio clips of the same person and is “taught” to mimic that specific person’s voice, accent and style of speaking. The generated voice or audio is also called an AI-generated voice clone.\n\nUsing natural language processing (NLP) programs, which instruct it to understand, interpret and generate human language, AI can even learn to understand tonal features of a voice, such as sarcasm or curiosity.\n\nThese programs can convert text to phonetic components and then generate a synthetic voice clip that sounds like a real human.\n\n“Broadly speaking, we can train an AI model with thousands and thousands of hours of recordings of human voice, so the model can learn what human voices in general sound like,” Nadine Lavan, a senior lecturer in psychology at Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“That is then for model from which you can create AI-generated voices, either by just asking the model to go and generate a voice that has no real human counterpart or by giving the model an example of a voice and telling it to clone that voice, to create an AI-generated version of that specific voice or a deepfake,” Lavan, who is one of the coauthors of the recent research on AI voice, said.\n\nThe term  “deepfake”  was coined in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, director of machine learning at Apple Special Projects Group. It combines “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to highly realistic AI images, videos or audio, all generated through deep learning.\n\nResearch conducted by a team at Queen Mary University of London and published by the science journal PLOS One on September 24 concluded that AI-generated voices do sound like real human voices to people listening to them.\n\nIn order to conduct the research, the team generated 40 samples of AI voices – both using real people’s voices and creating entirely new voices – using a tool called ElevenLabs. The researchers also collected 40 recording samples of people’s actual voices. All 80 of these clips were edited and cleaned for quality.\n\nThe research team used male and female voices with British, American, Australian and Indian accents in the samples. ElevenLabs offers an “African” accent as well, but the researchers found that the accent label was “too general for our purposes”.\n\nThe team recruited 50 participants aged 18-65 in the United Kingdom for the tests. They were asked to listen to the recordings to try to distinguish between the AI voices and the real human voices. They were also asked which voices sounded more trustworthy.\n\nThe study found that while the “new” voices generated entirely by AI were less convincing to the participants, the deepfakes or voice clones were rated about equally realistic as the real human voices.\n\nForty-one percent of AI-generated voices and 58 percent of voice clones were mistaken for real human voices.\n\nAdditionally, the participants were more likely to rate British-accented voices as real or human compared with those with American accents, suggesting that the AI voices are extremely sophisticated.\n\nMore worrying, the participants tended to rate the AI-generated voices as more trustworthy than the real human voices. This contrasts with previous research, which usually found AI voices less trustworthy, signalling, again, that AI has become particularly sophisticated at generating fake voices.\n\n“One likely explanation for why state-of-the-art AI voice generation has become much more sophisticated recently might be that the models are now trained on vast, high-quality training data sets,” Lavan said.\n\n“That just means that the models get much more information about how voices work, such that it can build up a more detailed picture,” Lavan said. She explained that AI can create more realistic voices by mimicking different accents, intonation, speaking patterns, even breathing sounds and speech errors.\n\nWhile AI-generated audio that sounds very “human” can be useful for industries such as advertising and film editing, it can be misused in scams and to generate fake news.\n\nScams similar to the one that targeted the Italian businessmen are already on the rise. In the United States, there have been reports of people receiving calls featuring deepfake voices of their relatives saying they are in trouble and requesting money.\n\nBetween January and June this year, people all over the world have lost more than $547.2m to deepfake scams, according to data by the California-based AI company Resemble AI. Showing an upward trend, the figure rose from about $200m in the first quarter to $347m in the second.\n\n“If it only takes a few minutes [or even a few seconds] of recording of a voice to clone it in a reasonably convincing manner, one obvious concern for highly realistic AI-generated voices is identity theft,” Lavan said.\n\nHowever, Lavan added that there are positive ways AI-generated voices are being used.\n\n“Beyond risks, though, one of the most promising and compassionate applications of AI-generated voice technology is its potential to restore voices for individuals who can no longer speak, or who have limited control over their physical voice,” Lavan said.\n\n“Today, users can choose to recreate their original voice, if that’s what they prefer, or design a completely new voice that reflects their identity and personal taste.”\n\nAlarmingly, yes. AI programs can be used to generate deepfake videos of real people. This, combined with AI-generated audio, means video clips of people doing and saying things they have not done can be faked very convincingly.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish which videos on the internet are real and which are fake.\n\nDeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media, estimates that about eight million deepfakes will have been created and shared online by the end of this year – a huge increase from the 500,000 that were shared online in 2023.\n\nBesides the phone call fraud and fake news, AI deepfakes have been used to create sexual content about real people. Most worryingly, Resemble AI’s report, which was released in July, found that advances in AI have resulted in the industrialised production of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which has overwhelmed law enforcement globally.\n\nIn May this year, US President Donald Trump  signed a bill  making it a federal crime to publish intimate images of a person without their consent. This includes AI-generated deepfakes. Last month, the Australian government also announced that it would ban an application used to create deepfake nude images."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/why-us-soya-bean-farmers-are-upset-with-trumps-20bn-argentina-bailout","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:56:56+00:00","title":"Why US soya bean farmers are upset with Trump’s $20bn Argentina bailout","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, has provided a $20 billion currency swap facility to Argentina to stabilize its struggling economy, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from U.S. soybean farmers and lawmakers.

soya bean farmers are upset with Trump’s $20bn Argentina bailout\n\nCritics of President Donald Trump have zeroed in on a hefty financial aid package for Argentina that comes as Argentinian soya bean farmers have taken market share from United States producers.\n\n“The frustration is overwhelming,” American Soybean Association president Caleb Ragland said on September 24.\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley from Iowa summed up the concerns in an X post: “Why would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers’ biggest market???”\n\nWhy would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers’ biggest market??? We shld use leverage at every turn to help hurting farm economy Family farmers shld be top of mind in negotiations by representatives of USA\n\n— Chuck Grassley (@ChuckGrassley)  September 25, 2025\n\nOn October 19, a reporter asked Trump why he decided to aid Argentina despite concerns among US soya producers.\n\n“Argentina is fighting for its life,” Trump answered. “Young lady, you don’t know anything about it. … They have no money. They have no anything.”\n\nUS aid to Argentina didn’t directly harm US soya producers – they have been hurt by a separate Trump policy, his  trade war  with China. But the timing of the aid and the soya bean export troubles pose a problem of optics for the White House.\n\nAt the same time, Trump is taking heat from Democrats over the scale of the financial aid package in relation to the cost of expiring subsidies that make the cost of Affordable Care Act marketplace plans more affordable. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Adam Schiff of California are among those who have made this argument.\n\nHere’s a guide to what’s going on.\n\nArgentina’s far-right President Javier Milei’s alliance with Trump is key to this story.\n\nMilei, who was inaugurated in December 2023, won the presidency on a platform of slashing government spending as well as other libertarian ideas, a political ideology that emphasises individual liberty and advocates for a limited government.\n\nMilei, whom Trump has called his “favourite president”, presented a chainsaw, a symbol of his aggressive spending cuts, to then-Trump ally Elon Musk at March’s Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nAmid high inflation back home, however, Milei has faced challenges. The Argentinian currency, the peso, is weak, meaning it takes more pesos to buy foreign goods. This has worsened Argentinians’ economic standing and posed a political challenge to Milei.\n\nAhead of key legislative elections in Argentina, the Trump administration offered a $20bn rescue package, known as a currency swap facility, to help stabilise the peso. This is an agreement between two central banks to exchange debt under set terms. The agreement was officially signed on October 20.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent framed the  $20bn  in assistance as support for an ally in need. If Miliei loses the legislative elections, he won’t be able to continue his so-called “chainsaw economics” that have seen drastic cuts in social and welfare spending.\n\n“It’s hope for the future,” Bessent told reporters on October 14. “I think that with the bridge the US is giving them and with the strong policies, that Argentina can be great again.”\n\nCritics say this could involve buying Argentinian bonds at above-market prices, with a risk of monetary losses for the US.\n\n“Buenos Aires’ path back to economic stability requires more than a balanced budget,” wrote Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n“The country’s economy has historically suffered from a shortage of foreign exchange. Its export base is small and commodity heavy. Its external debts are relatively large, and its foreign exchange reserves are low.”\n\nUS Senator Ruben Gallego in an X post on October 15 said that “Trump is DOUBLING his bailout for Argentina. Meanwhile your health care premiums are about to DOUBLE.”\n\n🚨Trump is DOUBLING his bailout for Argentina. Meanwhile your health care premiums are about to DOUBLE.\n\n$40 BILLION to help Trump’s elite friends. $0 to lower costs for American families.  https://t.co/Q6rLeWV6gz\n\n— Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego)  October 15, 2025\n\nA doubling of the Argentina  assistance  hasn’t happened yet, but officials are considering it.\n\nBessent said on October 15 that he was looking for ways to increase US assistance to Argentina by another $20bn, “adjacent” to the initial $20bn. The additional $20bn could come from the private sector rather than taxpayers, he said.\n\nSeparately, at least one subset of Americans – those who receive enhanced subsidies for health insurance purchased on Affordable Care Act marketplaces – could see their health premiums double.\n\nIf Congress and Trump do not extend certain subsidies before they expire at the end of this year, enrollees will have to pay 114 percent more out of pocket on average for their marketplace coverage, according to analyses by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare think tank.\n\nChina  is typically the United States’s largest purchaser of soya beans, importing large amounts from October through March. But US farmers have long worried about heightened competition from South America — and Trump’s high-tariff trade policy “amplifies the issues,” said Chad Hart, an Iowa State University economist who specialises in agriculture.\n\nAfter Trump levied tariffs on China earlier this year, China chose not to purchase US soya beans, sourcing them instead from Argentina and Brazil.\n\n“The South American soybean crop was good this year and is expected to grow next year,” said Todd Hubbs, an Oklahoma State University assistant professor of crop marketing. The soybean crops from Argentina and Brazil are “large enough to meet Chinese needs in the short-term,” Hart said.\n\nMilei temporarily removed export tariffs on many agricultural goods in order to increase the amount of foreign currency flowing into Argentina and offset the peso’s weakness. With that added incentive, China bought approximately 7 million tonnes of soya beans almost immediately, Hubbs said.\n\nSo while the US and China were already at odds over soya when Trump offered assistance to Argentina, it couldn’t have come at a worse time from the perspective of US soya producers. To them, the aid to Argentina seemed to reward a rival country that was taking their business.\n\nTrump promised US aid to farmers hurt by his tariff policies, but that aid has been stalled by the government shutdown.\n\nSenator Brian Schatz connected the scale of the Argentina package to the cost of a key Democratic goal from the ongoing government shutdown: extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced subsidies.\n\n“For the cost of the Argentina bailout we could cover the ACA tax credits for a year,” Schatz posted on October 14 on X.\n\nCounting the initial $20bn in assistance to Argentina, and not the second tranche, Schatz is in the ballpark. The Congressional Budget Office, Congress’s nonpartisan number-crunching arm, projected that for fiscal year 2026, the credits in question would total $24.6bn.\n\nWhile the two expenditures are similar in size, it’s worth noting that the funds to support Argentina couldn’t be shifted to pay for healthcare credits. The US Treasury has a pool of funds, known as the Exchange Stabilization Fund, dedicated to US intervention in foreign exchange markets."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/10/22/live-gaza-palestinians-say-no-change-with-ceasefire-as-israel-blocks-aid","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:00:22+00:00","title":"Israel kills one in Gaza, adding to dozens killed since ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US Vice President JD Vance visits Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing optimism about the ceasefire despite continued Israeli attacks and restrictions on humanitarian aid.

officially kicked off with the first award for physiology or medicine announced, setting the stage for a week of global anticipation.\n\nScientists Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi on Monday were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for “their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”.\n\n“Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.\n\nThe full schedule, spanning through October 13, maps out a rapid succession of announcements: medicine, followed by physics, chemistry, literature, peace and finally the economics prize.\n\nHere are details of the schedule and what to expect from this year’s Nobel Prizes:\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are the most prestigious international awards, established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist best known for discovering dynamite.\n\nIn his 1895 will, Nobel left the bulk of his fortune to fund the annual prizes, recognising those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” in the preceding year.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 for outstanding achievement in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\n\nIn 1968, Sweden’s central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, expanding the categories to six.\n\nThe prizes are awarded by different institutions: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (for physics, chemistry and economics), the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet (for medicine), the Swedish Academy (for literature) and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (for peace).\n\nEach laureate receives a gold medal, a diploma and a cash award funded by the Nobel Foundation, which manages Nobel’s endowment. This year’s prizes amount to 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.2m) each.\n\nThe prizes are formally presented on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896.\n\nThe announcements began on Monday and will end a week later on October 13.\n\nMonday, October 6:  physiology or medicine\n\nAnnounced by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, Wallenbergsalen, Nobel Forum, Solna, near Stockholm\n\nTuesday, October 7:  physics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nWednesday, October 8:  chemistry\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThursday, October 9 : literature\n\nAnnounced by the Swedish Academy, Stockholm\n\nFriday, October 10:  peace\n\nAnnounced at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, Oslo, by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\nMonday, October 13:  economics\n\nAnnounced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm\n\nThe nomination process is designed to preserve secrecy and independence. Each year, the Nobel committees invite selected experts, past winners and academics to submit nominations by January 31.\n\nThe nominations are not made public, and committee members are forbidden from discussing their decisions for 50 years. Only nominators may choose to reveal their own submissions.\n\nA person cannot nominate themselves, but they can be nominated multiple times by others.\n\nAfter the deadline, committees spend months reviewing hundreds of entries, consulting specialists and narrowing the list to a few candidates.\n\nEach prize has its own rhythm. The Peace Prize, which often recognises work from the past year, tends to be responsive to current global events.\n\nThe science prizes usually take decades to confirm after judges observe that discoveries have stood the test of time and can gauge their impact.\n\nThe world is fraught with conflict, including an ongoing genocide in Gaza, a war in Ukraine, and civil wars and political repression in numerous countries.\n\nHowever, the headlines and debates about this year’s Nobel Peace Prize are rather outsized and focused on United States President Donald Trump for his relentless self-promotion – at times, claiming to deserve it for “ending seven wars”.\n\nAt the United Nations, Trump told delegates, “Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.” On Tuesday, Trump reiterated that he “deserved” to win the prize for the possibility of ending an eighth war, Israel’s two-year-long war on Gaza.\n\nHowever, experts have noted that his chances are slim. The Norwegian Nobel Committee typically focuses on the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals, experts argued.\n\nAmong this year’s nominations for Trump were those from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Pakistan’s government although both were made after the deadline for the 2025 award.\n\nOne of the Nobel-awarding bodies has also warned that academic freedom is under threat from the political interference by the Trump administration.\n\nYlva Engstrom, vice president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the Trump administration’s changes were reckless. “I think in both the short and long term, it can have devastating effects,” she told the Reuters news agency in an interview. “Academic freedom … is one of the pillars of the democratic system.”\n\nHowever, Engstrom is not herself on any of the three committees that will award the prizes for chemistry, physics or economics.\n\nEvery year, the Nobel Prizes are formally awarded in twin ceremonies held in Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nThe Stockholm ceremony is attended by Sweden’s royal family, and the laureates in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and economic sciences receive their medals and diplomas from the king.\n\nIn Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize is presented by the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee at the Oslo City Hall, honouring Nobel’s wish that the Peace Prize be awarded in Norway.\n\nLaureates are individually called to the stage, where they receive the Nobel medal, diploma and the monetary award. The ceremony also features speeches by committee chairpeople highlighting the significance of the discoveries and contributions.\n\nThe event is broadcast worldwide and followed by a Nobel Banquet at Stockholm’s City Hall for more than 1,000 guests, including royalty, diplomats, scientists and past laureates.\n\nVictor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun were awarded the 2024 prize for medicine for discovering microRNAs, tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene expression after transcription.\n\nIn physics, John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton received the prize for research that laid the theoretical and computational foundations of modern machine learning and artificial neural networks. While Hopfield’s models in the 1980s linked neuroscience and computation, Hinton’s work revolutionised deep learning, enabling advances in image recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence systems.\n\nIn chemistry, the prize was shared by David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for breakthroughs in predicting and designing protein structures using computational models. Baker was honoured for developing algorithms that enable scientists to design new proteins with specific functions while Hassabis and Jumper from Google’s DeepMind were recognised for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that predicted nearly all known protein structures with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nIn the literature category, the prize went to Han Kang, a South Korean novelist known for her haunting explorations of violence, identity and collective memory. Best known internationally for the novels The Vegetarian and Human Acts, Han was cited “for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life”.\n\nIn the peace category, the prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations, honouring its decades-long campaign to abolish nuclear weapons and preserve the testimonies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors.\n\nIn economic sciences, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson shared the prize for their analysis of how institutions shape long-term economic growth and inequality. Their collaborative research, including the seminal work Why Nations Fail, demonstrated that inclusive political and economic institutions rather than geography or culture determine prosperity."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/18/thousands-evacuate-philippine-coast-as-tropical-storm-fengshen-approaches","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-18","timeOfPublication":"06:05:43+00:00","title":"Thousands evacuate Philippine coast as Tropical Storm Fengshen approaches","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of residents in the Philippine island of Catanduanes evacuated their homes as Tropical Storm Fengshen approached, bringing heavy rainfall and a risk of coastal flooding from waves up to 1.2 meters.

reduce shipping emissions\n\nMembers of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to postpone approving a plan to curb shipping emissions, after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on countries that supported the measure.\n\nThe vote on Friday set back plans to regulate the shipping industry’s contributions to climate change by at least 12 months, even though the Net Zero Framework (NZF) had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body,  in April .\n\nThe decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”\n\n“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.\n\nWashington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.\n\nIn advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.\n\nFollowing Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.\n\nThe IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.\n\nSince returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for  clean energy projects  and promising businesses to  “drill, baby drill”.\n\nA spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.\n\nThe International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.\n\n“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” the

doesn't make your hair shiny and other haircare myths debunked\n\nWe all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands.\n\nIn an industry worth £5.8bn in the UK , there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics.\n\nThe truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right.\n\nTrichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair.\n\nEver shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair?\n\nWell luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair.\n\n\"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in.\n\nShe does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin.\n\nIf you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution.\n\nProudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it.\n\nWalker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair.\n\n\"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\"\n\nShe says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution.\n\nProudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue.\n\n\"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\"\n\nYou may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all.\n\nBut Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\"\n\nWalker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too.\n\nNot washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\".\n\nProudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.\n\nLaura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it.\n\nFinding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower.\n\nProudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes.\n\nThe problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out.\n\n\"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says.\n\n\"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\"\n\nUltimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.\n\nSign up here  to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable

against climate change\n\nSkardu, Pakistan  – When Wasiyat Khan was woken up by a loud explosion in the middle of the night, he thought “the mountains had burst” and a landslide was on its way.\n\nAccompanied by his family, Wasiyat, a shepherd from Roshan valley of Ghizer, in northern Pakistan’s mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region, had taken his livestock to elevated land for grazing on a sojourn during the warmer months.\n\nSoon enough, as the family sought immediate safety, he realised the explosion was the sound of a glacier bursting. As their temporary accommodation was being swept away by the floodwaters, Wasiyat thought of the villages which lay in the water’s path.\n\nAt more than 3,000 metres in the darkness of the night, outside help was impossible to get. He immediately jumped across boulders and reached a designated spot where he could get mobile phone signals and alerted the villagers, who numbered about 300.\n\n“Within 30 minutes, we got a call back saying the villagers had evacuated safely and no lives were lost,” Wasiyat told local media. “While they were safe, we were left with nothing, not even a matchstick to keep us warm near the glaciers. It was very cold and we were suffering.\n\n“When we were rescued hours later and taken back to the village, we found out that all our houses and land were covered by mud, but no lives were lost.”\n\nThe glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a common occurrence in northern Pakistan, home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers. As global warming worsens, the effect of more glaciers melting is “likely to be significant” this year, Pakistan’s disaster management authority, NDMA, had said in March.\n\nIn its latest assessment, the NDMA says snowfall across Pakistan in the coming months is projected to be less than average, particularly in areas like Gilgit-Baltistan, reducing overall snow accumulation. A reduced snow cover, it fears, would accelerate glacier retreat by exposing ice earlier in the season, making high-altitude regions more vulnerable to GLOFs.\n\nTo prevent such occurrences, the government mainly relies on its early warning systems (EWS), which help in reducing loss of life and injury, economic losses, protecting critical infrastructure, and enhancing climate resilience.\n\nAn EWS functions through an interconnected process made up of sensors and gauges that collect real-time data monitored by meteorologists and experts to not only warn of a current hazard, but also predict a disaster. Dozens of EWS sites across the most climate-vulnerable valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are currently transmitting real-time data to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nBut residents in northern Pakistan say they are more reliant on Indigenous human knowledge instead of the EWS technology.\n\nMohammad Hussain, a shepherd in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu Valley, told Al Jazeera about an incident when he was inside his stone hut during the summer. After nearly an hour of rainfall, he witnessed strong lightning followed by an unusual roaring sound.\n\nAs he stepped out of the hut to gather his cattle, he saw a powerful flash flood, carrying enormous boulders and uprooting large trees. Acting quickly, he alerted the villagers, which ensured safe evacuation before the floodwaters reached.\n\nHe recounted stories shared by his grandfather, who said people relied on large signal fires, gunfire or specific sound patterns to alert others. Natural signs such as sudden heavy rainfall, cloud formations, unusual animal behaviour, and distinct roaring sounds are still being used to predict flash floods in the absence of the EWS.\n\nIn one incident, he attempted to light a fire to alert villagers below, but, due to daylight and heavy rain, it was ineffective. He then fired his gun three times, a pre-agreed signal indicating danger. Villagers who heard the gunfire raised alarms through the mosque’s loudspeaker, initiating a rapid evacuation.\n\nAlthough there were significant economic losses, there were no casualties, demonstrating the effectiveness of this “human EWS”.\n\nPakistan ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable nations, even though it contributes less than 1 percent of global emissions. The World Bank said in 2023 that the mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change.\n\nThe country’s climate change minister, Musadiq Malik,  recently told Al Jazeera  that “when these [glacial] floods hit, they cause immense mortality, morbidity and widespread displacement,” adding that “it’s a harsh reality we face.” Pakistan faced nearly 90 such floods between 2019 and 2022.\n\nDespite spending millions on EWS and its implementation, there has been widespread lack of trust placed in it by a number of communities, due to frequent reports of malfunctioning of equipment and lack of follow-ups by the concerned agencies.\n\nA report in Pakistan’s Friday Times in June this year said “despite launching the $37m GLOF-II project in 2017, with new gauges, sirens, and local training, no real-time link connects human sensors in villages to official rescue teams.”\n\nThe report warned that “technology alone won’t save lives if SOPs sit buried, rescue checklists gather dust, and trust is missing on the ground.”\n\nSome villagers Al Jazeera spoke to in Gilgit-Baltistan echoed that sentiment, speaking of their lack of trust in the equipment, questioning its effectiveness, and sharing concerns that these systems have not worked. They also slammed officials for falsely taking credit for the system’s effectiveness in saving lives.\n\n“Residents say the EWS in Gilgit-Baltistan have been installed without taking the local authorities and communities into confidence, which was the reason they could not play an effective role,” Zaki Abbas, an Islamabad-based journalist who writes on climate change, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Last year, I was told by a local activist that up to 20 systems had been installed at various spots, but they had not been operational for different reasons. This controversy surrounding this issue had also echoed in the GB legislative assembly, with the opposition leaders in the region most recently demanding an investigation into the failure of these systems. However, no such probe was ordered.\n\n“Their ineffectiveness can be gauged by the fact that warnings about GLOFs have come from people, most recently a shepherd whose timely call saved an entire village, instead of these systems on which billions of rupees have been spent.”\n\nAddressing the challenges remains a task for the government and partners involved in the implementation of EWS. The UNDP said in February this year that “limited financial resources, technical capacity, data gaps and uncertainties, communication barriers, weak institutional capacities, and complex and evolving climate risks” are just some of the issues facing EWS globally.\n\nWhen Wasiyat and two other shepherds from Ghizer were given $28,000 each in August by Pakistan’s prime minister as rewards for saving hundreds of lives, they were told that “this act of courage and responsibility will be written in golden words.”\n\nAs unpredictable rains, snow patterns and melting glaciers continue to affect Pakistan, especially the northern areas, it seems residents are more likely to rely on these “heroes” in the absence of widespread EWS and the community’s trust in them.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0exgrvw9gyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:10:52.858+00:00","title":"Louvre reopens three days after French crown jewels stolen","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Louvre Museum in Paris reopened three days after a shocking daylight robbery in which four masked thieves used power tools to break into the Apollo Gallery, stealing valuable French crown jewels including a necklace from Napoleon and a tiara from Empress Eugenie.

The study by King's College London and the University of Oxford is the first to produce a ranking so the effects of medicines can be easily compared.\n\nThe team analysed 151 studies of 30 drugs commonly used in depression, involving more than 58,500 patients.\n\nNot everybody develops side effects but, on average, the results  published in the Lancet medical journal  showed:\n\n\"Clearly no two antidepressants are built the same,\" said Dr Atheeshaan Arumuham, from King's College London.\n\nThose differences can stack up in ways that become clinically important, including an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.\n\nIt means even people with the same diagnosis could be better suited to different antidepressants depending on their own preferences and other health conditions.\n\nDr Toby Pillinger told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The majority of the studies we looked at were relatively short. We're looking at eight weeks' duration and still within that duration we were seeing large changes in physical health parameters which we would argue have clinical relevance.\n\n\"The last thing I want is for this story to be scaring people,\" he added.\n\n\"I want to see this as empowering individuals to take the initiative and to engage  in shared decision-making with their practitioner.\"\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, Sarah, 32, John, 44, and Jane, 56, have all received the same depression diagnosis and have been recommended antidepressants.\n\nBut they each want to avoid different side effects.\n\nFor Sarah, the priority is avoiding weight gain, while John already has high blood pressure and Jane has raised cholesterol.\n\nDr Pillinger, who worked through the examples for the BBC, says each would be recommended a different medicine.\n\nDr Toby Pillinger says:  Sarah should have an antidepressant that avoids weight gain, such as agomelatine, sertraline or venlafaxine rather than amitriptyline or mirtazapine which are more likely to increase weight.\n\nDr Toby Pillinger says:  John should avoid drugs such as venlafaxine, amitriptyline or nortriptyline which raise blood pressure, and would be better suited to citalopram, escitalopram and paroxetine.\n\nDr Toby Pillinger says:  For Jane, some antidepressants are linked to higher cholesterol, including venlafaxine, duloxetine and paroxetine, so she might steer clear of those. Citalopram or escitalopram are more neutral on cholesterol and could suit her better.\n\nIt is too simplistic to say there are good and bad antidepressants, the researchers say. Even though amitriptyline increases weight, heart rate and blood pressure it also helps with pain and struggling to sleep.\n\nOverall, the most prescribed class of antidepressants - SSRIs such as paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline - tended to have fewer physical side effects.\n\nFluoxetine - an SSRI that is also called Prozac - was linked to a drop in weight and higher blood pressure, in the study.\n\nProf Andrea Cipriani from the University of Oxford said it was \"impossible\" to say how many of the millions of people being prescribed antidepressants should be on a different drug.\n\nHowever, he said there had been a push for \"generic, cheap medications\" that meant 85% of antidepressant prescriptions in the UK were for just three drugs: the SSRIs citalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine.\n\nHe said implementing the findings of this report would see \"the 85% reduce dramatically\" with \"more people accessing better treatments\".\n\nThe researchers are developing  a free online tool  to help doctors and patients choose the right drug.\n\nHowever, that would still require a significant change in culture within the NHS.\n\nThe study also only analysed what happened eight weeks after starting treatment. Dr Pillinger said \"complimentary data\" meant they expected the short-term changes \"will persist\" but this still needs to be properly tested.\n\nDr Prasad Nishtala, from the University of Bath which was not involved in the study, said the findings were \"novel and valuable\".\n\nHe said: \"In a real-world setting, where patients often receive antidepressants for months or years, the cumulative risks are likely to be higher, particularly among those with chronic depression.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c397n3jl3z8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:58:17.709+00:00","title":"Why supermarket prices really became sky high in the UK","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Supermarket prices in the UK have surged dramatically, particularly for orange juice, which has risen from 76p per litre in 2020 to £1.79, a 134% increase.

prices really became sky high in the UK\n\nThere has been more than a bitter twang in the glasses at British breakfast tables. Only five years ago, a typical supermarket own-label carton of orange juice could be bought for 76p for 1 litre. It now costs £1.79.\n\nThat's a rise of 134% since 2020, and it's up 29% just in the past year.\n\nIn cafes and restaurants it's a similar story - with £3.50 to £4 now a standard price point for a glass of basic OJ.\n\nOne colleague was outraged to be sent a bill for £9 for a glass of hangover-busting orange juice and lemonade at an unassuming little restaurant in Kent. Asked why so much, she was told that the orange juice - albeit freshly squeezed - accounted for £5.30 of the price.\n\nYet as costs have surged, the taste is changing too, with certain manufacturers substituting oranges for mandarins to cut costs.\n\nThe public is, if you like, being freshly squeezed.\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons for this: disease among crops, extreme weather, over-reliance on supply from a single nation, new rules for packaging and complexities around trade wars and Brexit.\n\nAll of this is compounded by grocery price inflation which, after hitting 17.5% in 2023, came down (to around 5.7% in August) but is rising once again.\n\nPlus new figures for overall inflation released today put it at 3.8% - marking the 12th month in a row it is above the Bank of England’s 2% target.\n\nIt is a perfect storm.\n\nYet the problem is not isolated to orange juice - track the prices of all sorts of other groceries in supermarket aisles and you'll see a similar pattern. And so understanding what has happened to orange juice offers a glimpse into how our overall grocery bills suddenly seem so expensive.\n\nIt all prompts the question: is this storm a passing one, or are prices set to remain stubbornly high - and should we brace for them staying that way permanently?\n\nWhere else to start but in the orange groves of Florida where the industrialisation of OJ began as an initiative of the US Army during World War Two.\n\nThe US government was seeking a source of transportable Vitamin C for troops that didn't taste like turpentine.\n\nOrange juice is nearly 90% water. So gently evaporating the water off the juice and freezing the concentrate allowed for transportability of a much-better-tasting product when water was later re-added.\n\nWW2 ended before the troops got to try it, but it ended up being commercialised by what became the American soft drink giant, Minute Maid.\n\nIt was popularised by Bing Crosby, who, as a significant shareholder, would sing in ads and radio show jingles about frozen orange juice being \"better for your health\".\n\nWestern consumption of orange juice surged.\n\nFlash forward to today and an estimated 2.5 billion gallons of orange juice are drunk each year - with about a tenth of that in the UK, where the market is still growing.\n\nAt an industrial unit in the Essex town of Basildon, green steel drums of frozen orange concentrate arrive from Brazil, overseen by Maxim McDonald.\n\nHis firm Gerald McDonald and Co is named after his great-grandfather, a pioneer who was importing orange concentrate as far back as the 1940s from what was then British-mandate Palestine.\n\nToday it produces juices and blends them, then sells them to supermarkets and restaurant suppliers.\n\nBut prices reached extraordinary heights in global markets, rising from $1(75p) to $1.50 (£1.12) per lb over the last decade, to a record $5.30 per lb by the end of last year.\n\nThis followed five years of poor crops, owing to severe drought and a disease called citrus greening (caused by bacteria spread by insects). Brazil had its worst crop since 1988. In some parts of its citrus belt, two thirds of orange trees are affected.\n\n\"Around September of last year the price shot up to crazy levels,\" Maxim tells me. \"At the worst time I was being offered $7 a kilo.\n\n\"For such a major commodity to go from $2 to $7 is insane, but it took a while to filter through to consumers.\"\n\nUntil 2023 the rise in orange juice prices was disguised among food inflation in general, explains Philip Coverdale, an industry expert at consultancy firm GlobalData.\n\nProducers have tried to look beyond South America but it's not easy - the supply of oranges has been sewn up by Brazil, even more so than, say, the Saudis have cornered the market for crude oil.\n\nMorocco, Egypt and South Africa grow oranges too but their supplies are more limited. Spain also grows them, but Valencia and Seville oranges are mostly exported as fruit, rather than concentrate. (Plus Spain too suffered from weather-related production slumps, including the floods in Valencia last October.)\n\nEven within Brazil the market is concentrated in the hands of huge industrialised conglomerates.\n\nIn a truly competitive market the price would settle again - but it hasn't, nor does the industry expect it to. This is a phenomenon that is common to many other ordinary groceries too whose prices have risen.\n\nFlorida is the other traditional exporter of oranges, but output from the Sunshine State over the past year has been the lowest since the Great Depression, amid a high number of hurricanes and long-term problems caused by citrus greening.\n\nOne problem with greening is that it reduces sugar content, making oranges less sweet.\n\n\"Not many are buying Florida oranges any more unless it is a requirement to label the juice 'Florida Orange',\" says Maxim McDonald.\n\n\"It's very difficult to get oranges out of Florida [because of the shortages] and it's too expensive.\"\n\nOne of the leading suppliers to Tropicana sold off some of its land earlier this year to build homes.\n\nTropicana itself, the marquee US brand for orange juice, had to restructure its debts this year. Pepsi has also sold most of its stake in it.\n\nOne of Tropicana's recent product innovations in the US has been to launch an \"essentials\" brand of orange juice \"blends\" - combining orange, apple and pear juice - at a lower price.\n\nSimilar trends can be seen on British shelves. Orange is being mixed with mango, mandarins and clementine juice. Mango purée is especially cheap right now, driven by a good harvest in India. Mandarin concentrate, meanwhile, is cheaper than its orange equivalent because there is less demand for it.\n\nThese developments save money, but also maintain the traditional sweetness of the taste.\n\nThen there is the added impact of the recent spike in trade tensions with the US since President Trump introduced new tariffs.\n\nOranges, it transpires, have been at the centre of it.\n\nUS exports of orange juice to Canada have slumped to a 20-year low after Canada put counter-tariffs on US exports. The former PM Justin Trudeau warned that Canadians might have to \"forgo Florida orange juice\".\n\nThe Trump administration has also settled on a 10% tariff on orange juice coming from Brazil, which will feed into US supermarket prices.\n\nIn 2024, the UK eliminated tariffs on some imports produced from fruit grown outside Britain. But tariffs on certain sweeter, cheaper varieties and blends were not part of this.\n\nAnd while the tariff cuts might have helped, they were vastly outweighed by the increase in the underlying price.\n\nThen there are new regulations around packaging, further adding to the pressures.\n\nThe rules, known as Extended Producer Responsibility, are aimed at improving recycling rates, with a weight-based fee. All juice producers will be impacted, especially those still using glass bottles.\n\nIn August a Bank of England report said that high food price inflation is driven partly - and among other things - by these regulations.\n\nIn Brazil, the orange harvest has recovered somewhat - this is the greatest hope for a return to normal prices. Yet it coincides with sinking demand: global consumption of orange juice is now down 30% from a peak two decades ago.\n\nThough this may be partly down to the high prices, in certain parts of the world there has also been a shift in perception about the sugar content and health benefits or otherwise of fruit juice.\n\n\"When young children are not regularly given juice from an early age, they are less likely to be regular juice drinkers in later years,\" suggests Philip Coverdale at GlobalData.\n\nDemand is increasing in countries with growing middle classes, such as China, South Africa, and India. But elsewhere other more exotic fruit juices such as mango, pear and pomegranate are growing in popularity.\n\nUltimately, however, orange juice is a staple that supermarkets have long been used to selling at low prices. And the price spikes to £2 a carton could, with for example better weather, simply reverse.\n\n\"The volatility in the harvest appears to have reduced,\" says Giles Hurley, UK CEO of Aldi, \"Our buying team are doing everything they can to ensure that that saving is passed on to consumers.\"\n\nOthers in the supply chain are less convinced, given that much of the frozen concentrate was bought at last year's high prices. Plus, the stranglehold of the small number of giant producers who control the market remains.\n\nAs for the citrus greening, some major commercial producers, including Coca-Cola, which owns Minute Maid and Innocent, have contributed to a project to Save the Orange, using artificial intelligence to find a way to combat it.\n\nIt's a long-term project - and even if fruitful, it may be some time before the effect - if at all - filters through to grocery bills.\n\nBut the story of orange prices does also show how an upward price shock gets transmitted around the world far more quickly than a downward one.\n\nOranges are not the only food that has seen a price spike, of course. The price of beef and veal is up almost 25% in a year. Butter is up almost 19%, and chocolate and coffee 15% and milk over 12%, all according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThis all suggests that, more generally, there may be something else at play. And that for all the food and drink spikes, the consumer was actually protected from the worst of it for a period - and now it is pay back time.\n\n\"It might be the retailers didn't full pass through the cost increase in the first place and therefore it's a way of recouping some of the margin they would otherwise have got,\" says Steve McCorriston, Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Exeter.\n\nUltimately, though, trying to unpick the precise reason for why our food and drink costs what it does is very difficult - other factors that influence price can go undetected.\n\n\"What we don't know much about is how these supply chains tend to work in practice. It's difficult to uncover relationships between retailers and manufacturers or farmers and the use of contracts.\"\n\nThere is also a broader question that goes well beyond orange juice: do consumers in the UK need to simply accept the fact that as a densely populated small country with limited agriculture, a changing climate means the UK will be increasingly exposed to food price shocks?\n\nA 2024 government report on food security noted: \"The UK continues to be highly dependent on imports to meet consumer demand for fruit, vegetables and seafood...\n\n\"Many of the countries the UK imports these foods from are subject to their own climate-related challenges and sustainability risks.\"\n\nAnd so it could be that this is only the start of a wild ride on what we pay for our food and drink.\n\nTop image credits: Daniel Grizelj/ Tetra Images/ Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

see progress in Mamdani, but policies win votes\n\nNew York City -  In the Bronx's Morrisania neighbourhood, you often hear a familiar refrain: “Mamdani, Mamdani, Mamdani”.\n\nHome to a fast-growing West African community - including many new-immigrant Muslims - Morrisania is among many areas where identity issues of race converge with the needs of the working class ahead of New York’s November 4 mayoral election.\n\nMany in this community are counting on 34-year-old candidate Zohran Mamdani to win.\n\nAfter all, a victory for Mamdani over  former Governor Andrew Cuomo  would mark a series of historic firsts for New York City - its first Muslim mayor, the first born in Africa, and the first person of South Asian descent to lead the largest city in the United States.\n\nIt is a fact that has sparked hope - and grim reminders of entrenched Islamophobia and xenophobia - across the diverse Muslim communities interwoven into the fabric of the city.\n\nBut for Aicha Donza, a shop owner in Morrisania, the Bronx, where annual incomes are half the city's average, it is the avowed Democratic Socialist's message of affordability - ambitious pledges for free buses, rent freezes on certain buildings, and universal childcare, paid for, in part, by increasing taxes on the wealthy - that has won her support.\n\n“He says he’s going to make things easier,” Donza told Al Jazeera, showing off the wares in her store: plantain powder from Ghana; Liberian palm oil imported from the country where she was born; traditional Islamic garb imported from Turkiye, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\n“The rent is so high, every day people come into the store, they say the prices are too high,” she said. “And free buses, if he can manage that, that would make a huge difference”.\n\nOutside of the nearby Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx, following afternoon prayers, Essa Tunkala, 60, ruminated over what the election could mean for the neighbourhood, a melting pot of both working-class trades - parking attendants, cab drivers, and store workers - and West African diaspora.\n\n“It’s almost like you’re in West Africa,” Tunkala grinned, listing residents from Senegal, Liberia, Ghana, Togo, and Mali, to name a few.\n\nHe pointed to several  serious questions  that continue to hang over Mamdani’s run: How will he actualise his vision? Will he be able to rise above the relatively limited ability of the mayoral position to build the kind of coalition with state officials and lawmakers needed to realise his marquee pledges?\n\n“But we need fresh ideas to create opportunities,” said Tunkala, who is originally from the Gambia and sells sporting goods from a table on the street. “This is a new generation with new ideas for development, that’s why I support him.”\n\nAhmed Jejote, a 55-year-old cab driver from Sierra Leone, echoed the sentiment.\n\n“We’ve experienced Eric Adams,” he said, referring to the corruption-plagued current city mayor, who  dropped  out of the race in September. “We’ve seen Cuomo.”\n\n“Mamdani is just starting out, and he wants to go forward,” he said. “So it’s not really about religion for me”.\n\nBlocks away, 46-year-old Mariam Saleh stood over steaming trays of food at Kumasi Restaurant: banku, a fermented mixture of maize and cassava; suya, a spiced meat skewer; kwenkwen, a type of jollof rice.\n\nShe was less circumspect about the historic nature of Mamdani’s run.\n\n“That he is Muslim, for us, is huge progress,” the 46-year-old, who is originally from Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It’s huge progress for the Muslim community in America, not just in New York.”\n\nSurging to a surprise victory in the June primary, Mamdani represents a kaleidoscope of the diversity that defines the city of more than 8.4 million, where an estimated 800 languages are spoken. Up to one million Muslims live in New York City, estimated to be a quarter of all Muslims in the US.\n\nMamdani is socially progressive, with a history of grassroots activism and staunchly pro-Palestine views. While they do not define his campaign, he has embraced his ties to his birthplace, Uganda, and his identity as a Muslim son of parents of Indian Gujarati and Punjabi descent.\n\nFor Asad Dandia, an urban historian, Mamdani’s success to date is a culmination of 400 years of Muslim history in the city, stretching back to the enslaved Africans brought to New York, about 30 percent of whom were Muslim.\n\nMuslim political power has been both inhibited and energised by waves of discrimination, including in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks and more recently, the genocide in Gaza.\n\nDandia was among the New Yorkers surveilled in the wake of September 11, when the New York Police Department (NYPD) and federal government reportedly spied on at least 250 mosques within a 160km (100-mile) radius of the city, as well as an unknown number of individuals. He launched a successful lawsuit in 2013 after he was targeted by a confidential informant.\n\nMamdani, who Dandia befriended last year, has also spoken about a classmate at his Bronx high school who was “pressured to become an informant”.\n\n“I honestly think some of us have forgotten how truly bad it was,” Dandia reflected, adding that US President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory further charged political action.\n\n“So the last 25 years, since 9/11, have really moulded the community into becoming this formidable force. And I think nothing demonstrates that better than this mayoral election cycle,” the 32-year-old added.\n\n“It's crazy that the same police department that surveilled me and [Mamdani’s community] and the rest of the Muslim community is now going to be under his command.”\n\nDandia’s home neighbourhood in Brighton Beach, where the outer edge of Brooklyn meets the Atlantic Ocean, is a study in the fickle nature of politics for communities that feel left behind.\n\nThe area hosts a Pakistani enclave served by four mosques, as well as a quickly growing Uzbek Muslim population. On Fridays, the city sometimes closes a portion of one of the main streets to accommodate the overflow from prayer.\n\nVoters here swung towards Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but went for the Democratic Socialist Mamdani over his opponents in June’s Democratic primary.\n\nErum Hanif, who heads a community centre launched after the neighbourhood was devastated by Hurricane Sandy, said the idiosyncratic shift indicates, in part, “that the current system is not working out”.\n\n“Many working-class New Yorkers are earning on a day-to-day basis - Uber drivers, grocery store workers, healthcare workers and the working professional, and they are struggling to afford to live. That made them shift towards Mamdani,” the 42-year-old said.\n\nAt a daycare for the elderly run by Hanif’s group - APNA Brooklyn Community Center, which as an organisation does not endorse any candidate - the aunties said they were all in for Mamdani.\n\nAmina Malik, from Lahore, Pakistan, said a top concern is the high price of rent and childcare, both issues that impact elderly residents in an outsized way.\n\n“A lot of seniors like me are struggling to get into rent-stabilised buildings and apartments,” she said in Urdu. “Families cannot afford childcare - Mamdani is going to work on that.”\n\nPerveen Zia, 66, who is also from Lahore, saw in Mamdani the type of representation she had not witnessed before in City Hall - someone who “understands our language and culture” and will ensure services are administered “equitably”.\n\n“Zohran is like my son,” she said.\n\nAbout 18km (12 miles) away, in the Queens neighbourhood of South Richmond Hill, the minarets of Masjid Al Abidin rise above the roti shops and garland-laden bridal stores selling saris and shalwar kameez in “Little Guyana”.\n\nThe area is a microcosm of the overlapping identities of the city’s vast patchwork of neighbourhoods, displaying Guyana’s mix of Indo-Caribbean and South Asian culture: a South American society where Christianity, Islam and Hinduism plait.\n\n“In this neighbourhood, everyone lives like they’re cousins,” said Annie Nazir, 46, who works in childcare and moved to the US from Georgetown, Guyana five years ago.\n\nBut the masjid or mosque also underscores the challenges facing the local population. Construction on the towering structure began in 2012, but has sputtered amid various stresses, including the economic toll of the COVID pandemic. The project relies almost solely on community donations, those familiar said.\n\nBecause of that, congregants currently pray in a nearby two-storey townhouse, with the women’s section located in a similar building across the street.\n\n“As working-class people, a lot of people think it’s time for a change,” Nazir, who attends the mosque, told Al Jazeera. She is a volunteer chapter leader for DRUM Beats, a political committee representing South Asian and Indo-Caribbean workers that is hoping to turn out the vote for Mamdani.\n\nThe upstart politician has maintained a commanding lead in the polls since the primary, but that has narrowed since current Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race in September.\n\nCuomo, meanwhile, has sought to make inroads in some of the communities that buoyed Mamdani.\n\nDuring a primary debate in June, the former governor struggled to name a single mosque he had visited during his 10 years in office. After losing the primary, Cuomo made his first visit of the campaign to a mosque in September, since visiting at least four in the Bronx and Queens.\n\nAt least one Muslim religious leader, Imam Qazi Qayyoom based in Jackson Heights, Queens, has endorsed Cuomo.\n\nMamdani jabbed Cuomo’s newfound approach during a debate on October 16.\n\n“It took me,” he said, “to get you to even see those parts of the city.”\n\nThe line of attack has resonated with some in the Guyanese community, who noted Mamdani visited Masjid Al Abidin back in May ahead of the primary. Other ties to the community predate the election.\n\nAs an assemblyman, Mamdani advocated for Prakash Churaman, a Guyanese immigrant who has maintained he was coerced into giving a false murder confession. He joined taxi workers in a 15-day hunger strike in 2021.\n\nClint Ally, who spoke to Al Jazeera following evening prayers at the masjid, said he hopes Mamdani’s community-oriented style - which has included eschewing corporate donations for small donors - resonates.\n\n“He could go down in history as the first Muslim mayor, but this is a very diverse city,” the 49-year-old said.\n\n“We need someone who understands everybody.”\n\nSitting in his office on 5th Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 71-year-old Zein Rimawi's eyes tear up as he watches a video of Palestinian prisoners being released as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.\n\nMamdani’s outspoken support for Palestinian rights and condemnation of the genocide in Gaza has been particularly resonant in the local community, dubbed “Little Palestine”, where cafes bear names like “Al Aqsa Bakery” and “Nablus Sweets”.\n\nRimawi said he has known Mamdani for about eight years, stretching back to when the then-20-something worked on a campaign in support of Khader El-Yateem, a Palestinian-American Lutheran pastor who launched an unsuccessful bid for New York City Council in 2017.\n\n“I always say to young people: run for any seat. If you win, we win,” he said. “If you lose, we win.”\n\n“Because for a Muslim to run for a seat by itself, it's not easy, but it matters,” he said. “So it’s a win-win situation.”\n\nBut Rimawi also saw Mamdani’s success - at least so far -  as the product of a widening wealth gap in the city, an issue particularly relevant in a neighbourhood like Bay Ridge, once a working-class stronghold where housing prices have skyrocketed in recent years.\n\n“When I got married in 1988, one week’s salary would cover the average rent. Now it costs most of your salary for a month,” said Rimawi, who is originally from the occupied West Bank. “The middle class here in New York is disappearing. If it keeps going like this, soon we’ll only have two classes: The rich and the poor.”\n\nNext door, Essa Masoud, 46, runs the Balady Market, selling products from across the Levant.\n\nThe Palestinian American, who was born and raised in Bay Ridge, was not surprised to see the Islamophobic tropes pushed by the far right in the wake of Mamdani’s June victory.\n\nTrump has threatened to revoke Mamdani’s citizenship. Cuomo has called him a “terrorist sympathiser\".\n\nMasoud saw those attacks as a carefully calibrated “political tool”.\n\n“It’s an effort to change the understanding of the general public, to make people fear that is not the person they should vote for,” he said.\n\nMasoud added that as a business owner and landlord, he does carry reservations about Mamdani’s policies, including his support for rent freezes and for a $30 hourly minimum wage in the city.\n\nHe’s not opposed to Mamdani’s vision, but hopes there “will be balance” if he is elected.\n\nDown the block, Marwa Janini, 34, heads the Arab American Association of New York, which does not endorse any candidate.\n\nFor her, the last two years have been defined by two words: pain and pride.\n\nPain over the atrocities in Gaza and an Islamophobic backlash fuelled in part by the Trump administration. Pride over the success of Mamdani and the message he carries.\n\n“As Muslim New Yorkers, our identities are not fixed; they’re fluid,” she said. “But for someone who grew up in post September 11 New York, with all the fear that created, this is huge.”\n\n“It is a big win for a visibly Muslim woman like myself,” she said, adding that her organisation had been targeted with hate messaging over the last two years, including a death threat pushed under the door.\n\nShe hoped Mamdani’s victory could help to dispel some of those prejudices, especially if he shows he will be “mayor for all New Yorkers”.\n\n“To be in a city where we are possibly - inshallah - going to have a Muslim mayor,” she said, “it is a big deal.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv14jlm7dyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"02:02:05.793+00:00","title":"Australian PM defends ambassador to US after Trump run-in","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has defended his ambassador to the United States, Kevin Rudd, after former US President Donald Trump publicly stated he did not like Rudd, referencing past critical tweets Rudd wrote in 2020.

History of US trade measures against China\n\nChina has accused the United States of “double standards” after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nChina says its export control measures  announced  last week were in response to the US restrictions on its entities and targeting of Beijing’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats, which come weeks before the likely meeting between the US president and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, have the potential to reignite a trade war, months after Washington lowered the China tariffs from 125 to 30 percent.\n\nThe actions by the world’s two largest economies threaten to ignite a new trade war, adding further uncertainty to global trade. So what’s the recent history of US trade measures against China, and will the two countries be able to resolve their differences?\n\nOn October 9, China expanded export controls to cover 12 out of 17 rare-earth metals and certain refining equipment, effective December 1, after accusing Washington of harming China’s interests and undermining “the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks”.\n\nChina also placed restrictions on the export of specialist technological equipment used to refine rare-earth metals on Thursday.\n\nBeijing justified its measures, accusing Washington of imposing a series of trade curbs on Chinese entities despite the two sides being engaged in trade talks, with the last one taking place in Madrid, Spain, last month.\n\nForeign companies now need Beijing’s approval to export products containing Chinese rare earths, and must disclose their intended use. China said the heightened restrictions come as a result of national security interests.\n\nChina has a near monopoly over rare earths, critical for the manufacture of technology such as electric cars, smartphones, semiconductors and weapons.\n\nThe US is a major consumer of Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for its defence industry.\n\nAt the end of this month, Trump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea, and experts speculate that Beijing’s move was to gain a bargaining advantage in trade negotiations with Washington.\n\nChina’s tightening of restrictions on rare earths is “pre-meeting choreography” before Trump’s meeting with Xi, Kristin Vekasi, the Mansfield chair of Japan and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn October 10, Trump announced the imposition of a 100 percent tariff on China, effective from November 1.\n\n“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position … the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 percent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that this would come into effect on November 1 or before that. Trump added that the US would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software”.\n\nEarlier on October 10, Trump accused China of “trade hostility” and even said he might scrap his meeting with Xi. It is unclear at this point whether the meeting will take place.\n\n“What the United States has is we have a lot of leverage, and my hope, and I know the president’s hope, is that we don’t have to use that leverage,” US Vice President JD Vance told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nChina deemed the US retaliation a “double standard”, according to remarks by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson on Sunday.\n\nChina said Washington had “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures” and “adopted discriminatory practices against China”.\n\n“We are living in an era of deeper intertwining of security and economic policies. Both the US and China have expanded their conceptions of national security, encompassing a range of economic activities,” Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Programme at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, India, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Both have also weaponised economic interdependence with each other and third parties. There are, in other words, no saints in this game.”\n\nKewalramani said China started expanding the idea of “national security” much earlier than others, especially with its “comprehensive national security concept” introduced in 2014.\n\nThrough this, China began to include many different areas, such as economics, technology, and society, under the term “national security”. This shows that China was ahead of other countries in broadening what counts as a national security issue.\n\nChina threatened additional measures if Trump went ahead with his pledge.\n\n“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n“Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the statement said.\n\n“US policy explicitly targets Chinese firms linked to the military or advanced technology sectors. Whether that’s justified national security screening or discrimination is a matter of framing, but the policy design is undeniably China-specific,” Vekasi said.\n\nA month after taking office for his second term, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on all imports from China, citing a trade deficit in favour of China. In this order, he also imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. China levied countermeasures, imposing duties on US products in retaliation.\n\nIn March, the US president doubled the tariff on all Chinese products to 20 percent as of March 4. China imposed a 15 percent tariff on a range of US farm exports in retaliation; these took effect on March 10.\n\nTrump announced his  “reciprocal tariffs” , imposing a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products. China retaliated, also announcing a 34 percent tariff on US products. This was the first time China announced export controls on rare earths.\n\nHours after the reciprocal tariffs went into effect, Trump paused them for all his tariff targets except China. The US and China continued to hike tit-for-tat levies on each other.\n\nTrump slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China to hit back with 125 percent tariffs. Washington and Beijing later cut tariffs to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in May, then agreed to a 90-day truce in August for trade talks. The truce has been extended twice.\n\nIn December 2024, Trump’s predecessor, former US President Joe Biden, tightened controls on the sale of microchips first introduced in October 2022.\n\nUnder the new controls, 140 companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore were added to a list of restricted entities. The US also banned more advanced chip-making equipment to certain countries. Even products manufactured abroad with US technology were restricted.\n\nBiden signed a bill into law that would ban TikTok unless it was sold to a non-Chinese buyer within a year. The US government alleged that TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance was linked to the Chinese government, making the app a threat to national security.\n\nByteDance sued the US federal government over this bill in May 2024.\n\nIn September this year, Trump announced that a deal was finalised to find a new owner of TikTok.\n\nIn October 2023, Biden restricted US exports of advanced computer chips, especially those made by Nvidia, to China and other countries.\n\nThe goal of this measure was to limit China’s access to “advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to [Chinese] military applications”, Gina Raimondo, who was secretary of the US Department of Commerce during the Biden administration, told reporters.\n\nPrior to this, Biden signed an executive order in August 2023, creating a programme that limits US investments in certain high-tech areas, including semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, in countries deemed to be a security risk, like China.\n\nBiden restricted China’s access to US semiconductors in October 2022. The rules further expanded restrictions on chipmaking tools to include industries that support the semiconductor supply chain, blocking both access to US expertise and the essential components used in manufacturing the tools that produce microchips.\n\nSemiconductors are used in the manufacturing of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US government placed these restrictions back then to limit China’s ability to acquire the ability to produce semiconductors and advance in the technological race.\n\nThe restrictions made it compulsory for entities within China to apply for licences to acquire US semiconductors. Analysis by the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace described these licences as “hard to get” back then.\n\nRecently, some US lawmakers are calling for even more restrictions, warning that China could quickly reverse-engineer advanced semiconductor technologies on its own, outpace the US in the sector, and gain a military edge.\n\nIn May 2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security intensified rules to stop Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, from using US technology and software to design and make semiconductors in other countries.\n\nThe new rules said that semiconductors designed for Huawei using US technology or equipment, anywhere in the world, would need US government approval before being sent to Huawei.\n\nTrump signed an executive order blocking Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei from selling equipment in the US. The Shenzhen-based Huawei is the world’s largest provider of 5G networks, according to analysis by the New York City-based think tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nUnder this order, Huawei and 114 related entities were added to a list that requires US companies to get special permission (a licence) before selling certain technologies to them.\n\nThe rationale behind this order was the allegation that Huawei threatened US national security, had stolen intellectual property and could commit cyberespionage. Some US lawmakers alleged that the Chinese government was using Huawei to spy on Americans. The US did not publicise any evidence to back these allegations.\n\nOther Western countries had also cooperated with the US.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump imposed sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth as much as $60bn. In June of 2018, Trump announced more tariffs.\n\nChina retaliated by imposing tariffs on US products. Beijing deemed Trump’s trade policies “trade bullyism practices”, according to an official white paper, as reported by Xinhua news agency.\n\nIn September 2018, Trump issued another round of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, which were hiked to 25 percent in May 2019.\n\nIn 2011, during US President Barack Obama’s tenure, the US-China trade deficit reached an all-time high of $295.5bn, up from $273.1bn in the previous year.\n\nIn March 2012, the US, European Union, and Japan formally complained to China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about China’s limits on selling rare earth metals to other countries. This move was deemed “rash and unfair” by China.\n\nIn its ruling, the world trade body said China’s export restraints were breaching the WTO rules.\n\nIn 2014, the US indicted five Chinese nationals with alleged ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army. They were charged with stealing trade technology from US companies.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet in South Korea on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which is set to begin on October 31.\n\nBut the latest trade dispute has clouded the Xi-Trump meeting.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, downplaying the threat: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, “President Trump said that the tariffs would not go into effect until November 1. He will be meeting with [Communist] Party Chair Xi in [South] Korea. I believe that meeting will still be on.”\n\nWhen it comes to which of the two players is more affected by the trade war, Kewalramani said he thinks “what matters is who is willing to bear greater pain, endure greater cost.\n\n“This is the crucial question. I would wager that Beijing is probably better placed because Washington has alienated allies and partners with its policies since January. But then, China’s growing export controls are not simply aimed at the US. They impact every country. So Beijing has not also endeared itself to anyone,” Kewalramani said, pointing out how Trump’s tariffs and China’s rare earth restrictions target multiple countries.\n\n“The ones affected the most are countries caught in the midst of great power competition.”\n\nVekasi from the University of Montana said both economies are absorbing real pain in different ways.\n\n“The US can cushion the shock better because of its large domestic consumer base and still-strong upper-end spending. Inflation has hit lower-income households, but overall consumer demand remains solid,” she said.\n\n“China, by contrast, relies more heavily on exports, and the US remains a key market. Sustained export restrictions or new tariffs could make it hard for Beijing to meet its growth targets.”\n\nOn Sunday, US VP Vance told Fox News about China: “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nKewalramani said so far, Beijing has been more organised, prepared and strategic than the US in its policies.\n\n“That said, it has overreached with the latest round of export controls. US policy, meanwhile, has lacked strategic coherence. The US still is the dominant global power and has several cards to play. What matters, however, is whether it can get its house in order.”\n\nVekasi said we are likely to see both the US and China keeping escalation tools in reserve, each claiming the upper hand. She added that how long that lasts will depend less on diplomacy and more on how the markets and broader global economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n“Neither side wants to look like it’s backing down. The rare earth regulations give Beijing flexibility – they can be implemented slowly, signalling resolve without fully cutting off exports. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be calibrating pressure (100% tariffs! Or maybe not!) to avoid spooking markets while still projecting toughness.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6zyq9vggno","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:01:55.827+00:00","title":"Milnerton high school: Eight pupils suspended after South Africa assault","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A video of a violent assault at Milnerton High School in Cape Town, South Africa, has sparked national outrage.

His post did not refer to the alleged text messages.\n\nThe BBC has asked the White House whether Ingrassia will continue in his role at DHS.\n\nThe news broke a day after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the top Republican in the chamber, cast doubt on Ingrassia's chances of swaying enough senators to vote to confirm him.\n\nWhen asked if the White House should withdraw his nomination, Thune responded: \"I hope so.\"\n\n\"He's not going to pass,\" Thune added.\n\nFlorida Republican Rick Scott also told reporters that he would not support Ingrassia.\n\nIn alleged messages published on Monday, Ingrassia reportedly denounced the Martin Luther King holiday, saying it should be \"tossed into the seventh circle of hell\".\n\nAccording to Politico, Ingrassia's texts - sent to a group of Republican operatives - also denounced other holidays celebrating black Americans, including Black History Month and Juneteenth - the newest federal holiday.\n\n\"I do have a Nazi streak in me from time to time,\" one text allegedly read.\n\nEdward Paltzik, a lawyer for Ingrassia, did not confirm whether the messages were authentic, and suggested they could have been AI-generated.\n\nIn a statement to Politico, he wrote: \"Even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humour making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters 'Nazis'.\"\n\nThe Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, condemned the alleged messages as \"foul and disqualifying\".\n\nRepublicans control the Senate by a 53-47, and have been mostly unwilling to vote down Trump's nominees. Two other high-profile nominees have also been pulled at the last minute amid doubts about their ability to win over senators."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2w3d2jjw0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"02:45:30.297+00:00","title":"Author Philip Pullman calls on government to act over 'wicked' AI scraping","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sir Philip Pullman, the acclaimed author of the His Dark Materials and Book of Dust series, has publicly urged the UK government to reform copyright laws to prevent the unauthorized scraping of writers' books by artificial intelligence systems.

scraping\n\nAuthor Sir Philip Pullman has called on the government to change copyright laws on \"scraping\", where writers' books are used to train artificial intelligence (AI) software to understand and generate human language.\n\nWriters whose work has been scraped don't get compensation or recognition, something authors including  Kate Mosse and Richard Osman have criticised , saying it could destroy growth in creative fields and amount to \"theft\".\n\nSir Philip, author of the hugely popular novels about Lyra Silvertongue, the heroine of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust trilogies, thinks writers should be compensated.\n\n\"They can do what they like with my work if they pay me for it,\" he told the BBC's culture editor Katie Razzall. \"But stealing people's work... and then passing it off as something else... That's immoral but unfortunately not illegal.\"\n\nLast December  a consultation on the UK's legal framework for copyright around the AI sector  and creative industries was launched, attracting 11,500 responses.\n\nThe government has set up expert working groups on AI and copyright. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has been contacted for a response to Sir Philip's comments.\n\nSir Philip said: \"As far as I know everybody's work has been stolen, scraped like a trawler... at the bottom of the sea. Prawns, oysters, starfishes, mermaids, whatever. You name it, it's all killed.\n\n\"It's a wicked system and I'm profoundly against it.\"\n\nSir Philip says he wants the government to act now, change the law and fight back.\n\n\"Of course they should change it at once,\" he said. \"Don't you steal anybody else's work.\"\n\nSir Philip's latest novel, The Rose Field, completes the second trilogy about Lyra. The first five books have so far sold 49 million copies globally.\n\nLyra lives in a universe parallel to our own, where people have a daemon - a companion spirit in animal form.\n\nEarly on she uncovers a conspiracy using kidnapped children, and uses a truth-telling device called an alethiometer.\n\n\"She's always curious and inquisitive,\" he says. \"I think it's a very important quality. We should praise people who are curious. We should encourage it in children.\"\n\nThe books see her grow from an 11-year-old girl into a woman in her early 20s, with her world ruled by the Magisterium, a shadowy religious and political organisation.\n\nIn The Rose Field, the Magisterium is waging war on imagination, which it calls a false, seductive and dangerous doctrine.\n\nFormer English teacher Sir Philip, 78, goes on to describe what he sees as real-life enemies of imagination.\n\nHe highlights \"the education policy of the government, which insists on learning things off by heart, sitting in rows and walking silently down corridors\", along with learning about the grammar of language \"before you can use it\", calling this \"nonsense\".\n\nThe writer, who is clearly a fan of using the imagination, as evidenced in his writing, calls it \"a form of perception\".\n\nHe explains that his final book in the trilogy is about the the realm of the \"Rose Field, in which things exist that you can only see with your imagination\".\n\n\"They're there but you can't see them if you don't imagine them, for example, ghosts, wishes, hopes, memories...\n\n\"Things you can't necessarily weigh, measure or analyse chemically, but which are there nonetheless, such as love, fear, hope. That's what Lyra has discovered in the course of this book.\"\n\nHe's also an outspoken critic of organised religion.\n\n\"The arguments I have are with people in power who use religion to make other people do things... religion gives them a sense of extra certainty when they do that because they believe that they're fulfilling the will of God,\" he says.\n\nDespite writing about other worlds, realms and creatures, he insists he is not a fantasy writer, unlike JRR Tolkien, the author of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books.\n\n\"I don't think there's any comparison at all between me and Tolkien. He was a writer of fantasy, and I'm not writer of fantasy.\"\n\nDespite his books containing magical objects, talking animals and mythical griffins, he insists he is \"writing about the real world through a little filter\".\n\nHe adds that after saying farewell to Lyra and all the other characters in his books, he will \"miss them a little bit\".\n\nBut for his millions of fans, there is a glimmer of hope.\n\nThis might not be the end of Lyra's story.\n\n\"I can't say that,\" he says. \"It might happen.\"\n\nHe is now writing a memoir about his \"unusual childhood\" and a picture of the world he grew up in.\n\nHis final thought is about the daemons in his books, and he muses over what animal form his own might take.\n\n\"I think she'd be a corvid,\" he says. \"I love ravens. They're not very well loved. I don't care.\n\n\"Their flying is extraordinary, their aerobatics turning upside down and zooming so close to the ground.\n\n\"They're wonderful birds to watch, they're very clever.\n\n\"And In some mythologies, the raven is the storyteller.\"\n\nThe Rose Field: The Book of Dust Volume Three will be published on 23 October, including the audiobook, which is read by actor Michael Sheen."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y9je4d3go","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"23:57:52.031+00:00","title":"Why Trump made breakthrough in Gaza but can’t with Putin over Ukraine","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines Donald Trump’s efforts to broker peace in Ukraine, contrasting his successful achievement of a Gaza ceasefire with his failure in Ukraine.

2025-10-21T23:57:52.031+00:00\n\nTitle: Why Trump made breakthrough in Gaza but can’t with Putin over Ukraine\n\nReports of an impending US-Russia leadership summit have been greatly exaggerated, it seems.\n\nJust days after US President Donald Trump said he planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest - \"within two weeks or so\" - the summit has been suspended indefinitely.\n\nA preliminary get-together by the two nations' top diplomats has been cancelled, too.\n\n\"I don't want to have a wasted meeting,\" President Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. \"I don't want to have a waste of time, so I'll see what happens.\"\n\nThe on-again, off-again summit is just the latest twist in Trump's efforts to broker an end to war in Ukraine – a subject of renewed focus for the US president after he arranged a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.\n\nWhile making remarks in Egypt last week to celebrate that ceasefire agreement, Trump turned to Steve Witkoff, his lead diplomatic negotiator, with a new request.\n\n\"We have to get Russia done,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the circumstances that aligned to make a Gaza breakthrough possible for Witkoff and his team may be difficult to replicate in a Ukraine war that has been raging for nearing four years.\n\nAccording to Witkoff, the key to unlocking a deal was Israel's decision to attack Hamas negotiators in Qatar. It was a move that infuriated America's Arab allies but gave Trump leverage to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into making a deal.\n\nTrump benefited from a long record of siding with Israel dating back to his first term in office, including his decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, to change America's position on the legality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, more recently, his support for Israel's military campaign against Iran.\n\nThe US president, in fact, is more popular among Israelis than Netanyahu – a position that gave him unique influence over the Israeli leader.\n\nAdd in Trump's political and economic ties to key Arab players in the region, and he had a wealth of diplomatic muscle to force an agreement.\n\nIn the Ukraine war, by contrast, Trump has much less leverage. Over the past nine months, he has swung between attempts to strong-arm Putin and then Zelensky, all with little seeming effect.\n\nTrump has threatened to impose new sanctions on Russian energy exports and to provide Ukraine with new long-range weapons. But he has also recognised that doing so could disrupt the global economy and further escalate the war.\n\nMeanwhile, the president has publicly berated Zelensky, temporarily cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine and suspending arms shipments to the country - only to then back off in the face of concerned European allies who warn a Ukrainian collapse could destabilise the entire region.\n\nTrump loves to tout his ability to sit down and hammer out deals, but his face-to-face meetings with both Putin and Zelensky haven't seemed to move the war any closer to a resolution.\n\nPutin may actually be using Trump's desire for a deal – and belief in in-person deal-making - as a means of influencing him.\n\nIn July, Putin agreed to a summit in Alaska just as it appeared likely that Trump would sign off on congressional sanctions package backed by Senate Republicans. That legislation was subsequently put on hold.\n\nLast week, as reports spread that the White House was seriously contemplating shipping Tomahawk cruise missiles and Patriot anti-air batteries to Kyiv, the Russian leader called Trump who then touted the possible summit in Budapest.\n\nThe next day, Trump hosted Zelensky at the White House,  but left empty-handed after a reportedly tense meeting .\n\nTrump insisted that he was not being played by Putin.\n\n\"You know, I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,\" he said.\n\nBut the Ukrainian leader later made note of the sequence of events.\n\n\"As soon as the issue of long-range mobility became a little further away for us – for Ukraine – Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy,\" he said.\n\nSo, in a matter of days, Trump has bounced from entertaining the prospect of sending missiles to Ukraine to planning a Budapest summit with Putin and privately pressuring Zelensky to cede all of Donbas – including territory Russia has been unable to conquer.\n\nHe has finally settled on calling for a ceasefire along current battle lines – something Russia has refused to accept.\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, Trump promised that he could end the Ukraine war in a matter of hours. He has since abandoned that pledge, saying that ending the war is proving harder than he expected.\n\nIt has been a rare acknowledgement of the limits of his power – and the difficulty of finding a framework for peace when neither side wants, or can afford to, give up the fight."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7j9z7e7no","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"07:19:17.489+00:00","title":"Nigeria's farmers on the frontline against Boko Haram: 'We fear for our souls'","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In northeastern Nigeria, particularly in Borno state, farmers face extreme fear and danger from Boko Haram and ISWAP insurgents, who have intensified attacks on agricultural communities, with violence surging in 2025.

frontline against Boko Haram: 'We fear for our souls' \n\nAs women water vegetables and uproot weeds in a rural corner of north-eastern Nigeria, men in uniform stand guard nearby holding huge rifles.\n\nThey are Agro Rangers - a special security unit set up by the government to defend farmers from militants from jihadist groups Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap), who can strike farms in Borno state at any time.\n\n\"There is fear - we fear for our souls,\" Aisha Isa, 50, tells the BBC as she tends to her crops.\n\nBecause it is no longer safe for her family to live in the home they fled 11 years ago, she and many others like her are bussed into Dalwa village from a pick-up point in the state capital, Maiduguri, early in the morning. It is less than an hour's drive away.\n\nShe now lives in temporary housing, and growing beans and maize remains the only way for her to feed her family, she says.\n\n\"We will take the risk and come even if the rangers are not coming.\"\n\nHere, the military has marked out a stretch of land, surrounded by clearly defined trenches, where people can plant their crops. If they venture beyond that border, the threat of Boko Haram looms large.\n\n\"We have been hearing people are being kidnapped,\" says 42-year-old Mustapha Musa. \"Some are killed. That is why I'm scared and don't want to come without security protection.\"\n\nThe father of 10 says he left his village, Konduga, 13 years ago and will not resettle there until the government brings about lasting security.\n\nIn the 15 years since the Islamist insurgency began in north-eastern Nigeria, thousands of people have died and millions have been forced from their homes.\n\nThe number of people killed in targeted attacks on farmers this year has more than doubled since 2024, according to research by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (Acled) monitoring group.\n\nYet the governor of Borno state is speeding up the reintegration of displaced people from camps back onto the land - as part of his stabilisation agenda, and to counter disruptions in food production.\n\nAlmost four million people face food insecurity across conflict zones in Nigeria's north-east, the UN warns. But some aid agencies say move to relocate farmers to boost agriculture has moved too fast.\n\nInternational Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation focused on resolving deadly conflict, says the policy is putting internally displaced people in danger -highlighting that militant groups extort farmers in areas that it controls to raise funds for its violent extremism.\n\nKidnapped along with nine other farmers and still terrified long after the ordeal, Abba Mustapha Muhammed has seen first-hand what happens when victims do not pay up.\n\n\"There was one that got killed because he couldn't pay the ransom. His family could not meet the time given,\" says Mr Muhammed. \"He was killed and thrown away. They asked the family to come and take the dead body.\"\n\nBeing held captive in dense forest for three days was \"unbearable\", he says. \"The small meals they prepared often left us feeling hungry and gave us diarrhoea. There was no clean drinking water.\"\n\nThe father-of-three tells the BBC he is too afraid to return to subsistence farming because \"the insurgents are still lurking. Just yesterday, they abducted over 10 people\".\n\nDespite stories like these, Mohammed Hassan Agalama, the commander who leads the Agro Rangers scheme in Borno, insists that the guards deter militants from staging violent assaults.\n\n\"We have not encountered more terrorists coming to attack the farmers because they know that we are fully on ground at the time of farming season,\" says Cdt Agalama, who operates under the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).\n\nJames Bulus, a spokesperson for the NSCDC, argues that the government is making gains in its fight against the insurgents, telling the BBC: \"The harvest alone is there to tell you that normalcy has returned, and farmers are doing their normal businesses in the farm.\"\n\nHowever, he admits that resources are inadequate.\n\nAgro Rangers is a small-scale project and not a long-term solution for widespread regional insecurity.\n\n\"We cannot be everywhere. We are not spirits. Can 600 armed Agro Rangers cover the whole of farms in Maiduguri? No.\"\n\nFor this reason, Nigeria's federal government says it plans to expand the Agro Rangers scheme.\n\nAcled's senior Africa analyst Ladd Serwat says this year has seen a surge in the number of reported civilian fatalities due to targeted attacks on farmers by armed groups.\n\nFurthermore, during the first half of 2025 reported killings by Boko Haram and Iswap reached their highest level in five years.\n\nOver in Maiduguri's city centre, a group of farmers gather in the home of Adam Goni, the chair of the Borno branch of the National Association of Sorghum Producers, Processors and Marketers.\n\nThe men sit on rugs beneath the wide boughs of a tree, while two women sit on mats in the shade of a nearby veranda, as goats and chickens roam the compound.\n\nThe entire group has had their lives irrevocably changed by violence.\n\nAmong them is Baba Modu, whose 30-year-old nephew was gunned down on his farm by Boko Haram.\n\n\"It pains me so much,\" he says. \"They killed humans like an ant, without remorse. The killings we've experienced have been devastating, but this year is the worst. When I go out to farm, there's a constant threat of being killed. I don't have peace of mind even at home - I often sleep with my eyes open, feeling like we might be attacked.\"\n\nMr Modu sinks into his chair at times, pausing in deep contemplation. He says the constant insecurity weighs heavily on him and the community.\n\n\"Even if you are starving and food is scarce, you can't go to the farm. When we try, they chase us away or even kill us. At first, they would demand a ransom when they abducted someone, but now they collect the money and still kill the person they have kidnapped.\"\n\nMany farmers, like Mr Modu, say the militants can outnumber and overpower the Nigerian army when they attack.\n\n\"Sometimes even the security operatives run away when they see the insurgents,\" he adds.\n\nOn one side of the compound, Mr Goni tends to a potato patch.\n\nHe tells the BBC that he has 10 hectares (24 acres) of land ready to be harvested 8km (5 miles) away, but he is terrified to gather his crops.\n\nThe owner of the neighbouring farm was killed on his land only weeks ago.\n\n\"There's no safety. We are just taking risks to go there, because when you go to farm these Boko Haram people are there,\" he says. \"If you are not lucky, they will kill you.\"\n\nMr Goni believes the military could do more to end the conflict.\n\n\"We are very angry. We are unhappy with what is happening. If the government is serious, within a month, Boko Haram will end in Nigeria.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the NSCDC's Mr Bulus says the military is addressing the wider conflict.\n\n\"Peace is gradual. You cannot do it in one day. It has to undergo so many processes.\"\n\nBut the process has taken too long for these farmers. More than 15 years on, insecurity continues to plague every aspect of people's lives.\n\nThe BBC asked the Nigerian military about the farming community's claims that it has not done enough to protect them, but it has not yet responded.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40lw22dyvo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"12:30:00.686+00:00","title":"Trump says White House renovation is 'music to my ears' as criticism mounts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has defended the demolition of part of the White House East Wing to build a $250 million, 90,000 sq ft ballroom, calling the construction 'music to my ears' and emphasizing private funding.

When I hear that sound, it reminds me of money.\"\n\nTrump, a former property developer, is spending $250m (£186m) on a new, 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) ballroom to host parties, state visits and other events.\n\nBut since work began on Monday, a number of critics have spoken out - among them his one-time rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the leader of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Washington non-profit organisation that protects historic US sites, wrote a letter to White House officials saying she was \"deeply concerned\" by the project.\n\nThe letter said the size of the new construction would \"overwhelm the White House itself... and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings\".\n\nThe trust asked Trump to pause demolition work, arguing that the White House was a national historic landmark and that officials needed to hold a public review process of the plan for the ballroom.\n\nAnother group, the Society of Architectural Historians, also said it had \"great concerns\" about the project, similarly calling for a review process because of the size of the planned construction.\n\nThe White House has hit back at its critics, writing in a news release that \"unhinged leftists\" were \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House - a bold, necessary addition\".\n\nTrump officials have also insisted that the renovation will not cost US taxpayers any money, and that there is nothing inappropriate about soliciting private donations to help pay for it, as Trump has been doing.\n\nMany Democrats have also lambasted the renovation, including Clinton, who ran against Trump for the U presidency in 2016.\n\nAddressing her followers on X, whe wrote that the White House was not Trump's house. \"It's your house. And he's destroying it.\"\n\nSince it was built in the late 1700s, the White House has undergone a number of renovations and restorations. In 1948, then-President Harry Truman gutted the inside of the White House as it was at risk of collapsing, adding a balcony to the exterior.\n\nOver the years, presidents have added swimming pools, bowling alleys and other touches - though critics have highlighted that Trump's additions appear to be the biggest alterations to the White House exterior in decades.\n\nWhite House officials have said the project does not require sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, an agency that oversees construction and renovations to government buildings in Washington and is chaired by a Trump aid.\n\nBut a former chair of the commission, L Preston Bryant Jr, told the Associated Press that previous administrations have worked closely with the agency on big construction projects, starting with an \"early consultation\" before the renovation began."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvezzdnmrno","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:11:28.058+00:00","title":"Gaza health crisis will last for 'generations', WHO chief warns","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The World Health Organization’s director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the health crisis in Gaza is a catastrophic, long-term disaster that will last for generations due to famine, destroyed healthcare infrastructure, and severe mental health impacts.

last for 'generations', WHO chief warns\n\nGaza is experiencing a health \"catastrophe\" that will last for \"generations to come\", the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.\n\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a massive increase in aid is needed to begin to address the complex needs of the Strip's population.\n\nIsrael has allowed more medical supplies and other aid to cross into Gaza since a ceasefire with Hamas came into effect on 10 October, but Dr Tedros said levels are below those needed to rebuild the territory's healthcare system.\n\nHis intervention comes as the US attempts to  shore up the ceasefire it helped to broker  following an outbreak of violence at the weekend.\n\nThe agreement has been described by the White House as the first phase of a 20-point peace plan that includes an increase to the amount of aid entering Gaza, and supplies distributed \"without interference\" from either side.\n\nDr Tedros told the Today programme he welcomed the ceasefire deal but said the increase in aid that followed has been smaller than expected.\n\nAsked about the situation on the ground, he said Gazans had experienced famine, \"overwhelming\" injuries, a collapsed healthcare system, and outbreaks of disease fuelled by the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure.\n\nHe continued: \"On top of that, [there is] restricted access to humanitarian aid. This is a very fatal combination, so that makes [the situation] catastrophic and beyond words.\"\n\nAsked about long-term health prospects in Gaza, he added: \"If you take the famine and combine it with a mental health problem which we see is rampant, then the situation is a crisis for generations to come.\"\n\nTom Fletcher, head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,  said earlier this week  that aid groups are \"turning the tide on the starvation crisis\" but that \"far more\" was needed.\n\nOn Tuesday, the UN's World Food Programme said lorries carrying more than 6,700 tonnes of food had entered since 10 October, but that was still considerably below its 2,000-tonnes-a-day target.\n\nSix hundred aid lorries a day need to be arriving in Gaza but the average is between 200 and 300, Dr Tedros said, as he called on Israeli authorities to \"de-link\" aid and the wider conflict.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel temporarily halted aid deliveries after it said two Israeli troops were killed in an attack by Hamas gunmen in Gaza. Hamas said at the time it was not aware of the clashes.\n\nThe Israeli military responded with a series of air strikes across the territory, killing dozens of Palestinians.\n\nThe aid deliveries resumed the following day after heavy international pressure.\n\nDr Tedros said aid should not be \"weaponised\" and called on Israel not to impose conditions on its delivery, including over the return of the remains of dead hostages still in Gaza, which has become a key point of contention during the ceasefire.\n\nHamas has committed to returning the bodies but so far has transferred only 15 of 28, saying it has not been able to retrieve the rest.\n\nTwenty living Israeli hostages were released by Hamas last week in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails.\n\nDr Tedros told Today: \"There should be full access, there should not be any condition, especially after all the living hostages were released, and a good part of the remains are transferred. I did not expect there would be additional restrictions.\"\n\nAsked about the role the US should play, Dr Tedros said \"since the US has brokered the peace deal it has the responsibility of making sure that all sides are respecting\" it.\n\nIsrael is currently operating two crossings - Kerem Shalom in the south-east, and Kissufim in central Gaza - but it has continued to face calls from aid groups for all the access routes it controls to be restored.\n\nDr Tedros said \"all available crossings\" were needed to get enough aid into Gaza, and called on Israel to allow aid groups previously been denied registration back into the territory, saying: \"You can't have a scaled up response without those who can deliver on the ground.\"\n\nHe also said supplies intended be used to restore Gaza's health system have been confiscated at the border because Israeli authorities say they could have a military use.\n\n\"If you are going to build a field hospital, you need the canvas and the pillars [for tents],\" he continued. \"So if the pillars are removed, because of an excuse that they could be dual-use, then you can't have a tent.\"\n\nThousands of Palestinians are waiting for weekly medical evacuation flights, Dr Tedros said, though none have taken off for two weeks due to religious holidays in Israel. He said 700 people have previously died while waiting for medical evacuation and called on the number of flights to be increased.\n\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.\n\nAt least 68,229 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nIn July, a UN-backed body  concluded that famine had occurred in Gaza , though Israel disputed the findings, saying there was \"no starvation\".\n\nThe UN has previously estimated it will cost $70bn (£52bn) to reconstruct Gaza. Dr Tedros said around 10% of that figure would need to be spent on its badly damaged health system.\n\nHe continued: \"We have been saying for a long time that peace is the best medicine.\n\n\"The ceasefire we have is a very fragile one and some people have died even after the ceasefire because it was broken a couple of times.\n\n\"What is very sad is many people were cheering in the streets because they were very happy there was a peace deal.

least seven people have been killed including two children during intense Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, officials say.\n\nA kindergarten was hit in Ukraine's second biggest city Kharkiv and there was widespread damage in Kyiv. Children were among the 27 people wounded.\n\nHours earlier, US President Donald Trump said his plans for an imminent summit in Budapest with Russia's Vladimir Putin had been shelved as he did not want a \"wasted meeting\".\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks proved Moscow had not come under enough pressure for its continued war.\n\nThe Kremlin has rejected calls for a ceasefire along the current front lines made both by Trump and European leaders.\n\nHowever, Russian officials said on Wednesday that preparation for a Trump-Putin summit was continuing, disputing the US president's assessment that it had been put on hold.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a date had yet to be agreed upon and careful preparation was needed.\n\nHe said a summit was \"the mutual desire of both presidents\" and most of the \"gossip and rumours\" surrounding it were untrue.\n\nRead more:   Ukraine hits Russian chemical plant with UK-made missiles\n\nUkraine's president arrived in Norway on Wednesday at the start of a European trip, days after talks with Trump in Washington last Friday,  when he failed to persuade the US president to provide long-range Tomahawk missiles .\n\nZelensky told reporters in Oslo that Trump's proposal to freeze the front line was a \"good compromise, but I'm not sure that Putin will support it and I said it to the president\".\n\nThe Ukrainian leader has directly linked the shelving of the planned Trump-Putin summit to his request for US Tomahawks: \"As soon as the issue of long-range missiles became a little further away for us, for Ukraine, then almost automatically Russia became less interested in diplomacy.\"\n\nRussia's drone and missile bombardment came shortly after Ukraine's military said it had attacked a Russian chemical plant in the Bryansk border region late on Tuesday with UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles.\n\nCalling the strike \"a successful hit\" that penetrated the Russian air defence system, military officials said the Bryansk plant \"produces gunpowder, explosives and rocket fuel components used in ammunition and missiles employed by the enemy to shell the territory of Ukraine\".\n\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and its attacks on the Ukrainian capital overnight were the first such strikes for almost two weeks.\n\nA couple in their 60s were killed when a drone hit their high-rise building in the city, and four people were killed in the wider Kyiv region.\n\nAmong the victims were a 36-year-old woman, a six-month-old baby and a girl, aged 12, when a Russian strike set fire to their house in the village of Pohreby, just to the north of the capital. A man in a nearby village later died of his injuries.\n\nOfficials in Kharkiv said later that a 40-year-old man was killed and seven other people were hurt in a drone strike on a kindergarten. Children were among the six people wounded, and dozens more were evacuated, they added.\n\nUkraine's air force said Russia had sent 405 drones and 28 missiles, 15 of which were ballistic.\n\nThe capital was under a ballistic missile warning for most of the night, and echoed to the sound of explosions. By morning rescue teams fought fires in residential buildings.\n\nAcross Ukraine, Russian attacks once again targeted energy infrastructure and emergency power outages were imposed in several areas.\n\nOne MP in Kyiv, Inna Sovsun, told the BBC's Newsday programme that the air raids had lasted throughout the night and were definitely an attack on the power supply: \"for the majority like myself it means we don't have electricity and we don't have water.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4d47r1wzo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:32:04.052+00:00","title":"Labubu: Australian man charged with stealing dolls worth $5,000","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An Australian man, aged 40, has been charged with four counts of burglary and two counts of theft after police allege he stole 43 Labubu dolls from a shopping centre in Melbourne during four separate incidents since July 2024.

outage: Are we relying too much on US big tech?\n\nThe Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage on Monday made global headlines after  knocking some of the world's largest sites offline for hours.\n\nFor users, the impacts ranged from the serious -  such as not being able to access vital banking, government or work services - to the not-so-serious, such as fears of losing long built-up streaks on Duolingo.\n\nBut the outage has also reignited the debate around whether countries, including the UK, are over-dependent on a handful of US tech firms.\n\nShould we worry that an issue occurring at the heart of Amazon's cloud computing operations in Virginia badly affected UK firms and services such as Lloyds Bank and HMRC - and what, if anything, can we do about it?\n\nAmazon has embedded itself within the very fabric of cloud-based computing, the infrastructure that underpins the delivery of the IT systems which are so much a part of all our lives.\n\nThe company and Microsoft's cloud services, Azure, have each cornered somewhere between 30 and 40% of the market in the UK and Europe, according to the UK markets regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nBut even that figure doesn't fully capture how significant they are.\n\nBecause even if a service itself is not hosted by one of these two giants - or the UK's third largest provider, Google - critical things it relies upon still might be.\n\n\"A cloud deployment is a complicated piece of infrastructure with many components, some invisible,\" said Prof James Davenport, Hebron and Medlock Professor of Information Technology at the University of Bath.\n\nBrent Ellis, principal analyst at market researcher Forrester, said the outage exposed what he called the \"nested dependency\" between popular digital platforms and the array of services providing the web's technical underpinnings.\n\nHe also said it underscored the risks inherent in that dependency.\n\n\"There's great appeal to using tech giants, but assuming they are too big to fail or inherently resilient is a mistake, with the evidence being the current outage and past ones,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a feature of a highly concentrated risk where even small service outages can ripple through the global economy.\"\n\nThose ripples are what millions of users felt on Monday.\n\nSo, if relying on a small number of US firms has its risks, why do so many companies do it?\n\nThe answer, experts say, is that inking contracts with household names such as Amazon, Microsoft or Google also has its upsides.\n\nIt means a company doesn't have to pay hefty costs to run its own servers, and can leverage the power of so-called hyperscalers to handle fluctuations in site traffic - as well as benefit from heightened cyber-security.\n\nVili Lehdonvirta, professor of technology policy at Aalto University in Finland, told the BBC that the sector, at its core, is \"driven by economies of scale.\"\n\nOr, put another way, reducing the current dependence on US tech giants and creating a more \"sovereign\" infrastructure would come with a high price tag.\n\nWith the likes of Amazon and Microsoft already embedded in many different aspects of digital operations, companies looking to migrate elsewhere or diversify may face challenges, said Stephen Kelly of Circata.\n\n\"The explosion of enterprise data now stored with a single provider like AWS makes the eventual cost of migrating to different vendors prohibitively high,\" he said.\n\nCybersecurity expert Thomas Hyslip, who currently teaches at University of South Florida,  said that there was another benefit to the dominance of US firms.\n\n\"Of all the places for it to be, I think it's best it's in the US because you don't have a lot of government interference,\" he said.\n\nStill, that concentration could invite government intervention, he added.\n\n\"If god forbid there was ever another war involving the US and some other countries, there could be the opportunity for the government to interject themselves and cause problems for whoever the enemy was at that point,\" he said.\n\nNonetheless there is unease about the status quo.\n\nThe dominance of a few small companies has come to define much of the tech industry at large - from social media to streaming\n\nAnd in the cloud sector, some believe this may mean smaller providers can be overlooked or ignored.\n\nNicky Stewart, senior advisor to the Open Cloud Coalition, has joined lots of other experts in saying Monday's outage showed \"the risks of over-reliance on two dominant cloud providers, an outage most of us will have felt in some way\".\n\nThe CMA  said in July  its investigation into competition in the UK cloud services market had found it was \"not working well\".\n\nThe regulator recommended it use its own recently-acquired powers to investigate whether to designate Amazon and Microsoft as having \"strategic market status\" - which would allow it to demand changes to boost competition.\n\nMs Stewart said events like the AWS outage demonstrate the need for \"a more open, competitive and interoperable cloud market; one where no single provider can bring so much of our digital world to a standstill\".\n\n\"Fair and open competition will enable the UK to diversify its cloud workloads, strengthen our national resilience and allow UK challenger cloud providers to bring their talent and innovation to this over-concentrated and unhealthy market,\" she said.\n\nMr Kelly, meanwhile, said the potential \"difficulty\" of diversifying cloud providers should not overshadow the urgent need for IT resilience.\n\nUltimately, he said, the solution was political.\n\n\"The UK government should also take the lead in mandating data resilience standards across key industries, including policy frameworks that require the use of two or more distinct cloud providers and promote continuous data replication,\" he said.\n\nLord Leong, speaking on behalf of the government in the House of Lords on Tuesday, said it was in contact with AWS about how it would mitigate outages in future.\n\n\"We are working to diversify the UK's cloud ecosystem and encourage greater participation by UK-based and European providers,\" he told peers.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ana Faguy\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

Pay Him $230 Million for Past Cases\n\nPublished: 2025-10-21T14:10:55-04:00\n\nPresident Trump is demanding that the Justice Department pay him about $230 million in compensation for the federal investigations into him, according to people familiar with the matter, who added that any settlement might ultimately be approved by senior department officials who defended him or those in his orbit.\n\nThe situation has no parallel in American history, as Mr. Trump, a presidential candidate, was pursued by federal law enforcement and eventually won the election, taking over the very government that must now review his claims. It is also the starkest example yet of potential ethical conflicts created by installing the president’s former lawyers atop the Justice Department.\n\nMr. Trump submitted complaints through an administrative claim process that often is the precursor to lawsuits. The first claim, lodged in late 2023, seeks damages for a number of purported violations of his rights, including the F.B.I. and special counsel investigation into Russian election tampering and possible connections to the 2016 Trump campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the claim has not been made public.\n\nThe second complaint, filed in the summer of 2024, accuses the F.B.I. of violating Mr. Trump’s privacy by searching Mar-a-Lago, his club and residence in Florida, in 2022 for classified documents. It also accuses the Justice Department of malicious prosecution in charging him with mishandling sensitive records after he left office.\n\nLawyers said the nature of the claims posed undeniable ethics challenges.\n\n“What a travesty,” said Bennett L. Gershman, an ethics professor at Pace University. “The ethical conflict is just so basic and fundamental, you don’t need a law professor to explain it.”\n\nHe added: “And then to have people in the Justice Department decide whether his claim should be successful or not, and these are the people who serve him deciding whether he wins or loses. It’s bizarre and almost too outlandish to believe.”\n\nEven the president seemed to acknowledge that point in the Oval Office last week, when he alluded vaguely to the situation while standing next to the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and her deputy, Todd Blanche. According to Justice Department regulations, the deputy attorney general — in this case, Mr. Blanche — is one of two people eligible to sign off on such a settlement.\n\n“I have a lawsuit that was doing very well, and when I became president. I said, I’m sort of suing myself. I don’t know, how do you settle the lawsuit, I’ll say give me X dollars, and I don’t know what to do with the lawsuit,” Mr. Trump said, adding: “It sort of looks bad, I’m suing myself, right? So I don’t know. But that was a lawsuit that was very strong, very powerful.”\n\nAdministrative claims are not technically lawsuits. Such complaints are submitted first to the Justice Department on what is called a Standard Form 95, to see if a settlement can be reached without a lawsuit in federal court. If the department formally rejects such a claim or declines to act on it, a person could then sue in court. Still, that is an unlikely outcome in this instance, given that Mr. Trump is already negotiating, in essence, with his subordinates.\n\nCompensation is typically covered by taxpayers. Two people familiar with the president’s legal claims said that he had not been paid by the federal government but that he expected to be.\n\nThe second claim accused Merrick B. Garland, then the attorney general, Christopher A. Wray, then the F.B.I. director, and Jack Smith, the special counsel investigating Mr. Trump at the time, of “harassment” intended to sway the electoral outcome. “This malicious prosecution led President Trump to spend tens of millions of dollars defending the case and his reputation,” the claim said.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department manual, settlements of claims against the department for more than $4 million “must be approved by the deputy attorney general or associate attorney general,” meaning the person who runs the agency’s civil division.\n\nThe current deputy attorney general, Mr. Blanche, served as Mr. Trump’s lead criminal defense lawyer and said at his confirmation hearing in February that his attorney-client relationship with the president continued. The chief of the department’s civil division, Stanley Woodward Jr., represented Mr. Trump’s co-defendant, Walt Nauta, in the classified documents case. Mr. Woodward has also represented a number of other Trump aides, including Mr. Patel, in investigations related to Mr. Trump or the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nA White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Justice Department. Asked if either of those top officials would recuse or have been recused from overseeing the possible settlement with Mr. Trump, a Justice Department spokesman, Chad Gilmartin, said, “In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.”\n\nIn July, Ms. Bondi fired the agency’s top ethics adviser.\n\nMr. Trump famously hates recusals. He complained bitterly after his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, withdrew from overseeing the Russia investigation that is now the subject of one of his demands for money.\n\n“The attorney general made a terrible mistake when he did this and when he recused himself,” Mr. Trump said in 2018. “He should have certainly let us know if he was going to recuse himself, and we would have used a — put a different attorney general in.”\n\nThe Justice Department does not specifically require a public announcement of settlements made for administrative claims before they become lawsuits. If or when the Trump administration pays the president what could be hundreds of millions of dollars, there may be no immediate official declaration that it did so, according to current and former department officials.\n\nSome former officials have privately expressed misgivings that the department’s leaders did not reject Mr. Trump’s legal claims in the waning days of the Biden administration. It has long been standard practice for civil litigation, including lawsuits against the government, to be paused until any criminal cases around the same facts have been resolved.\n\nAlan Feuer contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6n1w80z1zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"10:46:35.724+00:00","title":"Eurostar orders first double-decker trains","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Eurostar has announced a major expansion plan to introduce double-decker 'Celestia' trains through the Channel Tunnel, marking the first time such trains will operate in the UK.

double-decker trains through the Channel Tunnel for the first time.\n\nThe cross-channel rail operator has confirmed it will order up to 50 trains from manufacturer Alstom, eventually increasing the size of its fleet by nearly a third.\n\nThe expansion plans would include investing heavily in a crucial London depot, it said.\n\nBut questions remain over whether the facility has enough space for both Eurostar and potential rival operators to use it.\n\nIn the €2bn (£1.74bn) deal, confirmed on Wednesday, Eurostar has ordered 30 \"Celestia\" trains, with the option for 20 more.\n\nEurostar expects to start using the first six trains in 2031.\n\nEach train would be 200m long. If two were run together, as happens currently, the resulting 400m service would have about 1,080 seats.\n\nThese would be the first double-decker high-speed trains to run through the Channel Tunnel.\n\nThe only other double-decker passenger service to ever appear on Britain's railways was an experiment that began  in 1949 .\n\nEurostar's chief executive Gwendoline Cazenave said she was \"particularly proud to bring double-decker trains to the UK for the very first time\", adding they would bring \"exceptional comfort\".\n\nEurostar carried 19.5 million passengers last year. Ms Cazenove said the company aimed to grow this number to 30 million.\n\nThe firm said a fleet of new trains, some of which will replace older ones, will lead to a 30% increase in trains that service London.\n\nThe double-decker train deal comes after Eurostar  announced an expansion plan  in June that includes new routes to Geneva and Frankfurt from London.\n\nThe new trains will need to go through a years-long certification process for use in the Channel Tunnel, in all the countries where Eurostar operates.\n\nThey will be 4.33metres high, just 16cm higher than the E320 models currently in use.\n\nTony Miles, railway journalist and commentator, told the BBC that Eurostar selling more seats on double-decker trains could potentially lead to cheaper prices for passengers.\n\n\"It costs exactly the same to run the train whether it's got twice the number of seats or not,\" he said.\n\n\"You still have only one driver, still use the same track.\"\n\nMr Miles suggested Eurostar had pulled a \"cunning move\" by announcing the roll-out of larger trains in response to murmurings of increased competition from other rail companies.\n\nHe added they had \"seized an opportunity\" to make the move with some its fleet approaching retirement.\n\nWhile the high-speed line between St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel was built to European standards enabling it to be used by taller trains, as double-decker trains are common on the Continent, double-deckers becoming the norm across the Britain's rail network seems unlikely.\n\nPete Waterman, music producer and railway enthusiast, told the BBC's Today programme because Britain's railways were established two centuries ago, most the routes would not be able to cater for such large trains due to obstructions such as tunnels, overhead lines and bridges.\n\nSuch costs to adapt the network for double deckers would be \"absolutely astronomical,\" he said.\n\n\"Although Eurostar is to be applauded for announcing this, you can only get into St Pancras because most of British railways you can't put double deckers on because our railways were built 200 years ago, not just after the Second World War,\" he added.\n\nMark Smith, founder of international train travel website Seat61.com, added the Eurostar announcement was \"obviously good news for travellers\", saying upper deck seats offered the \"best views\" during journeys.\n\nEurostar also said it would invest €80m developing the Temple Mills depot in London, which is the only depot in the UK able to accomodate the larger trains used in continental Europe.\n\nThat depot, owned by the government's London St Pancras Highspeed organisation, is currently exclusively used by Eurostar.\n\nEurostar is also the only company currently offering cross-Channel rail services between London and Paris, but others want to set up rival services.\n\nThose companies include Spanish start-up Evolyn, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin and a partnership between Gemini Trains and Uber.\n\nThe Office of Rail and Road is reviewing proposals from these firms to use Temple Mills, as well as Eurostar's plans to increase services.\n\nThe regulator is expected to make a decision on access to the depot within weeks."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891yxgj44ko","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-21","timeOfPublication":"22:23:34.631+00:00","title":"Who is paying for Donald Trump's new White House ballroom?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The construction of a $250 million new White House ballroom is sparking widespread ethical concerns, with private donors—including corporations like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Blackstone, and individuals such as the Glazers and Woody Johnson—allegedly funding the project in exchange for recognition and access.

Trump's new White House ballroom? \n\nAs construction begins on US President Donald Trump's new $250m (£187m) White House ballroom, mystery continues to swirl around the identities of the wealthy donors and corporations paying for it.\n\nGroundbreaking for the ornate 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) project began on Monday, with excavators and construction workers tearing out portions of the East Wing.\n\nThe US president has said that he personally will pay for significant portions of its construction, and suggested that some still anonymous donors would be willing to spend more than $20m to complete the project.\n\nThe funding model has sparked concern among some legal experts, who say it may amount to paying for access to the administration.\n\n\"I view this enormous ballroom as an ethics nightmare,\" Richard Painter, a former chief ethics lawyer in the Bush White House between 2005 and 2007, told the BBC.\n\n\"It's using access to the White House to raise money. I don't like it,\" he added. \"These corporations all want something from the government.\"\n\nA dinner for potential donors held at the White House on 15 October included senior executives from prominent US companies including Blackstone, OpenAI, Microsoft, Coinbase, Palantir, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Amazon and Google.\n\nAlso present was Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets NFL team, and Shari and Edward Glazer, who, together with their siblings, own both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Manchester United.\n\nA pledge form seen by CBS News, the BBC's US partner, suggested that donors could be eligible for \"recognition\" for their contributions. While plans are still being finalised, that recognition could potentially take the form of names etched into the structure.\n\nThe White House had originally said that the gigantic structure would have a seated capacity of 650 people. This week, Trump said that it will be able to hold 999.\n\nOnly one contributor has so far been revealed.\n\nCourt documents show that YouTube will pay $22m towards the project as part of a settlement with Trump regarding a lawsuit over the suspension of his account following the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol.\n\nBut it is unclear how many of the rest of those in attendance may have pledged to donate, or how much. An official list has yet to be published, though White House officials say they plan to reveal the one.\n\nDocuments obtained by CBS indicate the donations will be handled by the Trust for the National Mall, a non-profit that works with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House.\n\nAt the event for potential donors, Trump said many of the attendees had been \"really, really generous\" and said that some had asked whether $25m was an appropriate donation.\n\n\"I said: I will take it,\" Trump remarked.\n\nThe White House has insisted there was nothing inappropriate about soliciting donations and that the ballroom will be used by future administrations. The renovation will not cost US taxpayers a cent, it has said.\n\nMartin Mongiello, a former White House executive chef and Camp David general manager who has worked under seven administrations, told the BBC that the money paid to the ballroom \"will eventually pay for itself and save costs\".\n\nThe tents sometimes set outside for events - which he described as \"elbow to elbow\" and \"embarrassing\", often cost $1m or more, not including other ancillary costs associated with having large-scale events.\n\nBut Mr Painter suggested it could be considered a \"pay-to-play scheme\", which has dogged previous White House administrations of both political parties.\n\nIn the 1990s, for example, then-President Bill Clinton came under scrutiny for allegedly selling overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom in exchange for campaign contributions.\n\nMore recently, Trump sought corporate sponsors for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll in April, which some said could amount to companies vying for the president's attention.\n\nTrump and administration officials have said that the new ballroom was a necessary renovation given the lack of large existing facilities to hold state dinners and other events. The White House often uses a tent on the South Lawn to fete foreign leaders and a larger guest list for a state dinner.\n\nBut the scale of the new ballroom, Mr Painter added, poses an \"enormous temptation\" to use the facility for political fundraising that was not the case before, even if presidents from both parties have invited supporters to events.\n\n\"The limited space [now] means that not everyone gets a White House invitation,\" he said. \"In my view, that's a good thing... The [current] size limits the 'pay to play' game, at least on White House premises.\"\n\nProving any wrongdoing, however, is unlikely.\n\n\"You can't prove a quid pro quo,\" Mr Painter said. \"But I think the Trump administration is pushing the envelope here.\""},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/value-of-higher-education-attainment-rates-graduation.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:11-04:00","title":"Colleges Face a Reckoning: Is a Degree Really Necessary?","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As student debt grows and job markets show that many positions do not require college degrees, Americans are questioning whether a degree is still necessary.

apart offered starkly different paths.\n\nA nonprofit group’s billboard promoted a way to earn money for college. The other, from Walmart, dangled pay exceeding $30 an hour.\n\nThe dueling choices underscored a fundamental tension for the nation’s teenagers and adults alike, one that has become vivid in the Trump era: Is college something all Americans need?\n\nFor decades, it was close to an article of faith among education leaders, scholars and politicians, regardless of political ideology, that most people should go to college. But in many places, most jobs do not require college degrees, and doubts over the value of higher education have metastasized as student debt has soared and the ranks of dropouts have grown.\n\nCollege has become a sharp dividing line in American life, and the disconnect between higher education’s promises and its sometimes-frustrating reality has helped fuel a conservative movement to upend academia. Over the last decade, though, nearly every state tried to get more people to earn a certificate or a degree after high school.\n\nWyoming, which has just one public university, was among the states that bought into the campaign to push more of its residents toward higher education. Like most others, it made headway, but far less than it had hoped. And an uncomfortable question still lurks after seven years of trying to entice more students, even for people like Joe Schaffer, the Laramie County Community College president who both championed the state’s ambition and warned of the siren song of Walmart’s wages.\n\n“How do we make education much more relevant to the student?”\n\nSeven years ago, Dr. Schaffer’s campus was where Wyoming’s governor came to sign an executive order to try to marshal the state toward completing more higher education.\n\nThe share of college graduates who are considered “long-term” unemployed has risen recently. But as Wyoming began its quest, researchers were projecting that most of the country’s workers would soon need more than a high school diploma. And while Wyoming had among the highest shares of people who had finished high school, less than half of the state’s working adults had any meaningful education beyond that.\n\nThat had worked just fine in a place where not even 40 percent of jobs demanded education after high school. But the economy hinged on the boom-or-bust cycles of energy, and young people were fleeing the nation’s least-populated state for metropolises like Denver and Salt Lake City.\n\nState leaders, hoping to attract industries that required more educated workers, envisioned an unusually unified approach that would encourage high school students to get degrees and also target adults. Officials calculated that if a quarter of the state’s working adults earned a post-high school credential for the first time, the rate of Wyomingites with one would rocket past 60 percent, from about 46 percent.\n\nSchools and policies would also need to change to cater to students who didn’t fit the traditional mold.\n\n“One of the biggest problems we have in education is inflexibility,” said Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican who took office about a year after Wyoming started its push. “We tend to know what we know, by God, and we just need to do it harder and stronger.”\n\nThe American right had been elevating voices that accused higher education of being hubs of liberal ideology and unnecessary for personal success.\n\nBut the governor argued that education could still be valuable — if it were more responsive and didn’t bog down students with high costs and a maze of requirements.\n\nIt is a theory with wide traction. In 2009, a philanthropic group, the Lumina Foundation, announced a goal for 60 percent of Americans to obtain some credential past high school by 2025, up from 38 percent. The foundation’s philosophy and largess helped fuel a stampede of state campaigns.\n\nWyoming set a goal of 67 percent by 2025, among the nation’s highest targets.\n\nLumina’s efforts started when Americans appeared optimistic about higher education. Between 1998 and 2008, enrollment increased by more than 30 percent.\n\nBut more than a third of students seeking a bachelor’s degree still were not finishing within six years. Community college completion rates were far worse. When Dr. Schaffer arrived in Cheyenne in 2012, for example, his school’s graduation rate was 14 percent.\n\nAs the number of people who dropped out of college surged over time to more than 40 million, doubts about higher education were also swelling. Recent polling by Gallup found that the share of people who view college as “not too important” has increased sixfold since 2010, to 24 percent.\n\n“What you hear in universities, all the time, for years, is, ‘We just have to tell our story better,’” Ed Seidel, the University of Wyoming’s president, said. “But I think we really have to look ourselves in the mirror and say, ‘We need a better story.’”\n\nStill, officials nationwide plowed ahead. They sometimes confronted stubborn skepticism. It often had little to do with the debates over diversity programs, “woke” policies and academic freedom that dominate the current political battle over higher education.\n\nInstead, many found that students who had dropped out had no interest in returning. Some feared costs. Some fretted over failing again. Many simply found themselves content in jobs that did not require additional education.\n\nJamie Merisotis, Lumina’s president and chief executive, said states still made notable progress. Roughly 55 percent of adults in the United States now hold an educational credential beyond a high school diploma.\n\nBut for most states, the moonshot goals remained elusive.\n\nDaryl Woody finished eight years in the Air Force and six more as a housing maintenance contractor at the base in the Cheyenne area. But married with four children, Mr. Woody worried about being economically left behind.\n\nHe went to Laramie County Community College, figuring he could learn how to become a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning technician. After all, “I’ve been turning wrenches for so long that it comes natural,” he said not long after this semester started.\n\nThen an academic adviser spoke with Mr. Woody about his interests and steered him toward the college’s cybersecurity programs instead. The school helped him chart his courses, talked through temptations of jobs in the oil fields or warehouses and mapped his potential long-term earnings.\n\n“The advice that I’ve been getting from all of the instructors has always been, ‘Do not let the good job take you from your education,’” he said. Without the guidance, he said, “I would have jumped on top of any number of those opportunities.”\n\nHe is on track to finish an associate degree next spring.\n\nHigher education leaders and policymakers point to modest progress — Wyoming’s percentage of people with some credential past high school now stands at 53 percent — and lessons learned. Financial aid matters enormously. So do factors like the ability to transfer credits from one school to another and job-friendly scheduling to accommodate working adults.\n\nAmanda Sorrell, a 30-year-old single mother who is studying business and accounting at the community college in Cheyenne, is part of a new scholarship program the state began for people at least 24 years old.\n\n“That scholarship is really what’s helping me stay afloat,” said Ms. Sorrell, who takes online courses while juggling a market research job.\n\nEncouraged by her advisers, she ultimately plans to pursue a bachelor’s degree. Laramie County’s graduation rate has risen more than 20 percentage points since Dr. Schaffer arrived.\n\nBut Wyoming, like other states that fell short of their goals, has also been working in recent years to tailor academic programs to society’s demands, reasoning that some students stay away because too little of the curriculum is relevant to their ambitions or interests.\n\nWestern Wyoming Community College started a substation technician program, the state’s first. Within the last decade, the University of Wyoming developed a major tied to tourism, one of the state’s biggest industries, along with a program in ranch management and agricultural leadership. Dr. Seidel, the university president, said schools should still make room for the liberal arts, but that higher education should have “a hard think” about what it offers.\n\nDuring a politically volatile moment, and as colleges look for any students they can find, schools may have little choice.\n\nIn a recent speech, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, laid out talking points for the Trump administration’s ongoing attack on the nation’s universities.\n\n“Attending these schools, for many students, feels like a burden. Or a waste. An obsolete and expensive credential,” she said, adding, “Don’t they realize? The alternatives to college are warming up in the dugout ready to replace the four-year diploma. This is not a time for dithering.”\n\nDr. Schaffer, of Laramie County Community College, acknowledges the nation’s higher education model needs to be reset, as difficult as it may be. The answer, he thinks, might in fact be less, or at least more targeted, higher education.\n\n“I don’t know that we’re going to find that next silver bullet,” he said. “So maybe it just takes a continued momentum and you keep whittling away, whittling away.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/world/middleeast/syria-massacre-druse.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:12:26-04:00","title":"Firing Squads and Forced Death Leaps: A Tipping Point in Syria","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s new government under Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist fighter, made bold promises to protect religious minorities and end sectarian violence.

The Oval Office is decorated from top to bottom in gold. The Rose Garden’s lawn is paved over. And on Monday, part of the East Wing was demolished as Mr. Trump’s 90,000-square-foot ballroom project forged ahead.\n\nHere is what we know about five key White House renovations:\n\nOne of the biggest renovations underway is Mr. Trump’s addition of a ballroom to the East Wing. First announced in July, Mr. Trump trumpeted its construction as necessary to host large events for world leaders. He has said it will cost more than $200 million to build and will hold “999” people.\n\nMr. Trump has said that personal contributions and private donations will cover the bill for the ballroom, not taxpayers or foreign contributions. But this has raised concerns among historians and government ethics experts.\n\nAccording to images released by the White House, the proposed design of the ballroom’s interior echoes features of the Grand Ballroom at Mr. Trump’s Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago. At 90,000 square feet, the East Wing Ballroom will nearly double the White House’s footprint. Demolition of part of the East Wing began in late October.\n\nOver the summer, Mr. Trump had the Rose Garden paved over with stone tiles, and tables with yellow and white striped umbrellas were added, mirroring the hard-surface patio at Mar-a-Lago. But the rose bushes are still there.\n\nMr. Trump recently hosted a dinner for Republican lawmakers in the renovated space, calling it the “Rose Garden Club.” The ceremony to posthumously award the conservative activist Charlie Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom was also held here.\n\nMr. Trump’s affinity for gold decor is perhaps most evident in the Oval Office. Portraits framed in gold are mounted on the walls, along with gold framed mirrors and gilded onlays. Even the presidential seal on the ceiling of the office is covered in gold leaf.\n\nThe Oval Office is the official working space of the president, and in his second term, Mr. Trump has often used it to meet with foreign leaders. The backdrop to these meetings is usually the fireplace mantle that Mr. Trump has adorned with historic items from the White House collection — all in gold.\n\nPresident Trump meeting with President Alexander Stubb of Finland on Oct. 9.\n\nPresidents often make changes to the Oval Office to reflect their priorities or the legacy they want to embody. But past presidents, including Mr. Trump in his first term, have typically decorated using a more subdued approach.\n\nIn his second term, Mr. Trump has even moved the White House ivy that has typically adorned the mantle to a greenhouse.\n\nMr. Trump’s gold theme extends to the Cabinet Room, where he often holds meetings with his staff and occasionally with international leaders. Golden onlays and trim have been added to the walls, and the mantle is also decorated with gold items.\n\nMr. Trump has also added more flags to the room, including flags for specific branches of the military, including the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force. Ornate chandeliers now light the room.\n\nIn September, Mr. Trump unveiled the “Presidential Walk of Fame” on the West Colonnade, which is the main walkway between the White House’s executive residence and the West Wing. The exhibit displays every president’s portrait, in chronological order, framed in gold with additional gold onlays above the portraits.\n\nBut in place of former President Joseph R.

Shen\n\nThe Chinese dream once followed a simple formula: move to a big city, work hard, and buy a home. That model, once a reliable engine of progress in China, is breaking down after the collapse of the housing market in 2021, which set off an ongoing economic downturn.\n\nToday, many workers are opting out of the old system and finding new careers in China’s digital gig economy — and in the process, redefining what work looks like.\n\nThe New York Times profiled some of these workers: a mother helping people navigate China’s bureaucratic hospital system; a lifestyle influencer who drives from city to city scouting the most affordable places to live; and a former retail manager who quit her office job to become a licensed electrician.\n\nTheir stories reflect some of the larger forces reshaping China’s economy. Across the country, young people are struggling to find the kind of lucrative office jobs that were once common after college, and some are rejecting the pressure to pursue prosperity at all costs, and instead choosing to do as little as possible. Meanwhile, China’s population is growing older, and blue-collar jobs are becoming increasingly attractive.\n\nThese shifts are playing out in surprising ways because of the Chinese internet. With a smartphone and social media, workers across the country are tapping into online trends and investing in themselves, creating a new generation of digital entrepreneurs who are making money and building careers on their own terms.\n\nAs China’s aging population navigates a complex public hospital system, a new industry of gig workers is stepping in to help.\n\nFor many young Chinese, the relentless pressure to succeed has given way to a new philosophy: “lying flat,” or doing the bare minimum.\n\nAn all-female repair business is challenging gender norms and catering to a growing population of single Chinese women seeking safety and comfort at home.\n\nProduced by Isabelle Qian, Cinematography by Qilai Shen, Edited by Ben Laffin, Graphics by Aaron Byrd, Additional Editing by Mark Boyer, Production Manager Caterina Clerici, Senior Producer Hanaan Sarhan, Executive Producer Sameen Amin, Design and Development by Michael Beswetherick.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/trump-election-deniers-voting-security.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:00:07-04:00","title":"Trump Empowers Election Deniers, Still Fixated on 2020 Grievances","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Trump administration, despite a clear electoral defeat in 2020, continues to promote and institutionalize false claims of election fraud.

Fixated on 2020 Grievances\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T05:00:47-04:00\n\nElection officials from nearly all 50 states gathered on a call last month with the Homeland Security Department’s point person on “election integrity,” eager to hear how the woman filling a newly created Trump administration position might help safeguard the vote ahead of next year’s midterms.\n\nBut many of them left alarmed.\n\nRather than offering assurances that the federal government’s election protection programs would continue uninterrupted, the new official, Heather Honey, instead used portions of the meeting to echo rhetoric that has infused the right-wing election activist movement that emerged since President Trump falsely claimed that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, according to five people with knowledge of the call.\n\nMs. Honey, a leader in that movement until her appointment in August as deputy assistant secretary for election integrity, complained that her department’s cybersecurity experts tasked with combating misinformation about elections had “strayed from their mission.”\n\nThe remark echoed a widespread view on the right that the agency had sought to silence supporters of Mr. Trump’s fraud claims. Ms. Honey also repeatedly mentioned a report often cited by election conspiracists to support their claims that voting machines were rigged to favor Democrats, according to the people familiar with the call.\n\nThe ascent of Ms. Honey reflects how Mr. Trump and his allies, despite a clear victory last year, remain consumed with the belief that the 2020 election was stolen — and how the president is using the powers of the government to upend an electoral system that he insists helped Joseph R. Biden Jr. take the White House.\n\nIn the past few months, Mr. Trump has elevated multiple proponents of his fraud claims into high-level administration jobs. Now, as government insiders, these activists could wield their newfound power to discredit future results or rekindle old claims to argue for a federal intrusion into locally administered voting systems.\n\nOn a call with right-wing activists in March, before her appointment to the Homeland Security Department, Ms. Honey suggested that the new administration could declare a “national emergency” and justify dictating new rules to state and local governments. She said this could be based on an “actual investigation” of the 2020 election if it showed there had been a “manipulation” of the vote.\n\n“And therefore, we have some additional powers that don’t exist right now,” she said in March, according to a recording reviewed by The New York Times from someone who joined the call, “and therefore, we can take these other steps without Congress and we can mandate that states do things and so on.”\n\nShe added, “I don’t know if that’s really feasible and if the people around the president would let him test that theory.”\n\nThe idea of reinvestigating the 2020 election gained steam recently with the White House’s decision to hire Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who has been tasked with examining the 2020 vote and other election matters, according to a White House official. The hiring of Mr. Olsen, who has worked closely for years with the pillow entrepreneur Mike Lindell to promote stolen-election theories, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnother activist, Marci McCarthy, who spread debunked claims about voting machines in Georgia when she was the chairwoman of the DeKalb County Republican Party, was named in May to be the director of public affairs at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which is housed at the Homeland Security Department.\n\nMs. McCarthy’s appointment comes as nearly all of the election experts at CISA have been placed on administrative leave or reassigned this year amid a large-scale downsizing of the agency, which had played a leading role in deterring attacks on elections systems and combating disinformation about voting.\n\nThe changes are unfolding as Mr. Trump takes steps to try to create more structural advantages for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterms, including pressuring G.O.P.-led states to redraw congressional district lines to maximize the party’s chances of keeping control of the House of Representatives.\n\nNow elections officials who have spent years trying to debunk false claims that the voting systems were tilted against Mr. Trump are assessing how to work with some of the most fervent proponents of those claims.\n\n“These people are not coming with an objective frame of mind to say let’s look at the facts and see where that takes us,” said Matt Crane, a former Republican elections official who is the executive director of the Colorado Clerks Association and served until earlier this year as a consultant for CISA. “They have their destination in mind and cherry-pick facts to help stand up their crazy theories, so there’s nothing objective about it.”\n\nMs. Honey and Ms. McCarthy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn response to questions from The Times, the Homeland Security Department declined to give specifics about the department’s election work. A homeland security spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement that CISA’s “mission is ensuring state and local election officials are cognizant of and utilize the most capable and timely threat intelligence, expertise, resources they need to defend against risks, and identify critical infrastructure security needs to maintain electoral functions.” She also said that the agency’s new hires “go through a rigorous vetting process.”\n\nCleta Mitchell, the Republican lawyer who helped Mr. Trump challenge the 2020 results and worked with Ms. Honey and Ms. McCarthy through the activist group she founded, the Election Integrity Network, praised the homeland security appointments.\n\n“These are the very kind of election integrity leaders every American can be proud to have at D.H.S.,” Ms. Mitchell said.\n\nThe moves by Mr. Trump to elevate election activists could portend escalating legal battles over how much power his administration wields over balloting across the country.\n\nAlready this year, courts have affirmed that the president has no legal authority over elections, which have long been the domain of state and local governments. Judges have largely blocked an executive order that Mr. Trump issued in March requiring, among other changes, documentary proof of citizenship to vote.\n\nBut the Trump administration has taken other aggressive steps to assert more sway over elections.\n\nThe Justice Department, for instance, is compiling the largest set of national voter roll data it has ever collected, an effort to try to prove unsubstantiated claims that large numbers of undocumented immigrants have voted illegally, The Times previously reported.\n\nAnd in a separate effort that also collects similar details, the Homeland Security Department has been soliciting election officials to upload voter information in bulk through a program it developed that checks immigration status, according to documents released in a recent lawsuit and other documents viewed by The Times. State election officials have long rebuffed attempts by the department to access state voter rolls, warning that sharing this data could expose sensitive information like Social Security numbers, or be used to gain an uneven political advantage.\n\nMs. Honey has traced the roots of her election skepticism to the aftermath of the 2020 election, in the wake of a widespread legal and public relations effort by Mr. Trump and his allies to push the false notion that he was the victor and to discredit results that showed otherwise.\n\nThere is no indication that Ms. Honey, a registered Republican, had been active in politics before 2020. She had worked as a private investigator for companies, hunting for stolen and counterfeit goods and scouring the social media accounts of potential employees, according to a person with knowledge of her background.\n\nShe has said that after casting a ballot in Lebanon, Pa., where she lives, she began researching the state election department’s website and saw numbers that she felt did not make sense. Eventually she hit on what she claimed was an apparent discrepancy between the number of voters recorded in one tracking system and the official tally of votes cast.\n\nThe claim has been repeatedly disputed by election officials who said she was misinterpreting and misusing a state database that tracks registered voters and whether or not they voted in previous elections.\n\nNonetheless, Ms. Honey shared her claim with Trump allies in her state. And soon Mr. Trump was repeating it.\n\n“So in Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters,” he said in his speech from the Ellipse on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before his supporters stormed the Capitol. “And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it’s a total fraud.”\n\nWhen Mr. Trump finally returned to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, his court challenges defeated, Ms. Honey was just getting started.\n\nIn 2022, she was a leading witness in an election challenge brought by Kari Lake, the losing candidate for Arizona governor. Mr. Olsen, the lawyer recently hired by the White House, served as one of Ms. Lake’s attorneys in the case.\n\nMs. Honey claimed that one county’s election procedures could have allowed false ballots to be counted, but under questioning she acknowledged that she had no evidence that this had occurred on a large scale.\n\nA judge found that her claim “would not come close to clear and convincing evidence that the election outcome was affected.”\n\nBy that point, Ms. Honey had become influential within the Election Integrity Network, the large coalition of pro-Trump election activists headed by Ms. Mitchell. She went on to run the network’s Pennsylvania group.\n\nIn 2023, Ms. Honey’s company was paid $121,284 from Ms. Mitchell’s organization for consulting work, according to I.R.S. records.\n\nMs. McCarthy, meanwhile, was an active contributor to the Election Integrity Network’s Leadership Council, according to a portion of her website that has since been deleted. She worked to place far-right activists on the local election board in DeKalb County, and was instrumental in forcing out a member of the Georgia State Election Board who voted against a rule to end mail voting in the state.\n\nMr. Trump’s victory in 2024 created a wave of momentum for the Election Integrity Network, as its members sought to capitalize on the new administration’s posture toward elections. The first step was to draft a list of demands that sought to provide something of a blueprint for the federal government.\n\nThe document, titled “US Citizens Elections Bill of Rights,” called for new restrictions on mail ballots and early voting, and included provisions that would make it easier to get people removed from voting rolls and challenge the certification of election results.\n\nThe efforts mirrored elements of Mr. Trump’s executive order on elections and a bill passed by the House but stalled in the Senate, known as the SAVE Act, which would require all voters in federal elections to show proof of citizenship.\n\nMs. Honey, Ms. Mitchell and other members of the Election Integrity Network watched from the public gallery in April as the House passed the elections bill, and then posted on social media a photo of the group posing afterward on the balcony off Speaker Mike Johnson’s office.\n\nThe meeting last month between Ms. Honey and election officials from all 50 states came as many election officials had begun to wonder whether the federal government would continue to be a reliable partner.\n\nAfter hearing about the Trump administration’s cuts to the cybersecurity agency, including the loss of around 25 staff members who had worked on election issues at the local and national levels, many were looking forward to hearing what the Homeland Security Department — and Ms. Honey — planned to focus on.\n\nBut the call, which lasted roughly an hour, left officials both confused and anxious about some of Ms. Honey’s responses, according to five people familiar with the call.\n\nWhen asked what her role entailed, these people said, Ms. Honey did not offer specifics. She said that she would also serve in an advisory capacity to CISA, but also added no further details.\n\nIn addition to questioning CISA’s adherence to its cybersecurity mission, Ms. Honey made unspecified claims of censorship at the agency, a common complaint among right-wing election activists that struck a number of officials on the call as misguided.\n\nShe said that the department would be working on issuing “best practices” for election machines, and made multiple references to a report that has been wrongly interpreted by right-wing activists as part of their claims that election machines had been hacked and could not be trusted.\n\nState election officials asked Ms. Honey about restoring funding for information centers that were previously run by CISA and were a critical element of election security. Ms. Honey said that they would not be returning, and that states should plan to use “fusion centers,” which are hubs for collaboration across intelligence and state, local and federal law enforcement, for election matters.\n\nThis caused some concern among election officials, who wondered how the fusion centers, which are often tasked with coordinating responses for major events like the Super Bowl, would have the bandwidth to help ensure election security, according to the people with knowledge of the call.\n\nMs. Honey’s direct involvement in the Election Integrity Network stopped after her appointment, but she participated in a national leadership call for the group a few weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the call. She apologized that she could no longer work closely with her former colleagues.\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs and Tyler Pager contributed reporting. Susan C.

Hours earlier, President Trump said he was putting off a planned meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to avoid a “wasted” effort toward ending the war.\n\nMr. Trump had said late last week that he would meet soon with Mr. Putin in Hungary to continue peace talks. But on Tuesday, after discussions between American and Russian officials, the White House said no summit meeting was planned “in the immediate future.”\n\nThe Trump administration announced the delay after Russian officials made clear that they would not budge from their maximalist demands to halt their invasion of Ukraine, again rejecting a proposal for a cease-fire that freezes the current front lines.\n\nOn Wednesday, video footage posted by officials on social media showed emergency workers carrying toddlers from a burning kindergarten in the northeastern city of Kharkiv. The strike on the kindergarten killed one person and wounded several others, officials said.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that the overnight assaults showed that “Russia clearly doesn’t feel enough pressure to stop prolonging the war.”\n\nThe Russian barrage prompted nationwide power restrictions for industrial consumers and emergency blackouts for civilians in several regions, including the capital, Kyiv. The strikes followed a pattern in which Russia has unleashed major attacks on Ukraine after significant moments in diplomacy with the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Zelensky reiterated on Tuesday that Ukraine needed more long-range weapons to give it leverage to pressure Moscow to stop its invasion. The Ukrainian leader met with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday but emerged from those contentious talks without a deal he was seeking to buy American long-range missiles.\n\nWhile publicly supporting Mr. Trump’s efforts at peacemaking, Ukrainian officials have consistently said that Moscow will halt its attacks only if Kyiv can retaliate sufficiently.\n\nUkrainian analysts said they were hopeful that Mr. Trump was beginning to recognize Mr. Putin’s tactic of stringing the Americans along by agreeing to high-profile meetings that produce little in the way of results. Russian officials welcomed the proposal for a summit in Budapest after Mr. Trump held a call with Mr. Putin on Thursday, a day before his meeting with Mr. Zelensky.\n\n“Trump realized that this meeting would be a catastrophe, and he would gain nothing but shame,” said Mykhailo Samus, director of the independent New Geopolitics Research Network in Kyiv. “But the question is, what is next? Will Putin be able to get him to such a meeting again?”\n\n“It is important for President Trump to understand that a Nobel Peace Prize is possible only by pressuring Putin, not by shouting at Zelensky,” Mr. Samus added.\n\nMr. Trump has shown remarkable deference to Mr. Putin. The American president has not followed through on his threats to punish Russia for refusing to end the war. And amid warnings from the Kremlin, he has so far not provided American Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv.\n\nBut seemingly emboldened by his role in securing a cease-fire in Gaza, and ever focused on his publicly stated desire to win a Nobel, Mr. Trump has pushed to restart a peace process for Ukraine that had stalled after his meeting with Mr. Putin in Alaska this summer.\n\nWhile Mr. Zelensky emerged from his talks last week with Mr. Trump without new weapons, he did secure continued U.S. support for Kyiv’s position when it comes to territory. Moscow has signaled that it is holding out for Ukraine to surrender the parts of the eastern Donetsk region still under Ukrainian control, a nonstarter for Kyiv.\n\nMr. Zelensky will meet on Thursday with European leaders in Denmark to seek additional support from European nations, which have become the primary backers of Kyiv’s war effort since Mr. Trump ended direct American aid. European leaders have joined with Ukraine in calling for an immediate cease-fire at the current battle lines.\n\nSince the spring of this year, said Mr. Samus, the analyst, Russia has entered talks with one primary goal: to delay any cease-fire and to block the United States from providing long-range weapons to Ukraine.\n\nWhile Mr. Putin has largely succeeded so far, the postponed meeting in Budapest showed that the Russian president may be losing his ability to rely on the same tactic again and again, Mr. Samus said.\n\nMr. Zelensky also called out the Russian tactic.\n\n“Russia continues to do everything it can to weasel out of diplomacy,” he said on Tuesday. “As soon as the issue of long-range capabilities for us, for Ukraine, became less immediate, Russia’s interest in diplomacy faded almost automatically.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/nyregion/cuomo-debate-mayor.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"03:00:17-04:00","title":"This Might Be Andrew Cuomo’s Last Debate.

What Can New Yorkers Expect?\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T03:00:17-04:00\n\nFormer Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo will step to the debate stage on Wednesday evening, perhaps for the last time in his decades-long political career, and try to make the most of his final chance to publicly challenge Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the race for mayor of New York City.\n\nThe math is against him. With early voting only three days away, he trails Mr. Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, by at least a dozen points in the polls. And he seems to stand little chance of catching Mr. Mamdani unless Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate, drops out of the race.\n\nAnd yet, Mr. Cuomo, who is running on an independent line, offered no hint that he planned to do much different from his debate performance last week, saying he did not anticipate making “dramatic changes” to his strategy.\n\n“It’s a balance,” he said at a news conference on Tuesday. “You don’t want to be too aggressive, because then, you know, everyone has a critique. You’re too aggressive, they saw you’re a bully. You’re not aggressive enough, they say you’re too soft.”\n\nSince last week’s debate, Mr. Cuomo has mostly centered his campaign messaging on two themes: Mr. Sliwa should drop out, and Mr. Mamdani would hurt the city if elected.\n\nThe latest attack against Mr. Mamdani came on Tuesday, when Mr. Cuomo’s campaign released an A.I.-generated video featuring former Mayor Bill de Blasio as Dr. Evil and Mr. Mamdani as his “mini-me” — repeating one of Mr. Cuomo’s zingers from last week’s debate.\n\n“If you thought my policies were evil, you’re going to freaking hate this,” says the de Blasio character, cuddling a hairless cat on his lap.\n\n“Sure will, boss!” the Mamdani character responds, in a high-pitched voice.\n\nThe stakes are high for Mr. Cuomo, a former New York attorney general who resigned as governor during his third term amid a sexual harassment scandal he describes as “political. He denies the accusations.\n\nHe barreled into the Democratic primary as the seemingly indisputable front-runner only to squander his lead and lose the June contest to Mr. Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist assemblyman from Queens.\n\nMr. Cuomo will turn 68 in December, at a time when the Democratic Party is under pressure to depose its gerontocracy. It is not clear what he would do should he lose. This summer he echoed the donor class when he said, apparently in jest, that he would move to Florida. In September, he did not rule out running for office again during an interview with The New York Times.\n\n“We’re not contemplating anything other than winning,” said Rich Azzopardi, Mr. Cuomo’s spokesman.\n\nA loss would close an ignominious chapter in a once formidable political career, one that at its height elicited political chatter about a presidential run. Mr. Cuomo ultimately saw his reputation consumed by a political firestorm after he directed nursing homes to accept Covid patients and was repeatedly accused of sexual harassment.\n\nThis run for mayor was supposed to be Mr. Cuomo’s post-resignation resurrection tour.\n\nNow, nothing less than “his political career” hangs in the balance, said George Arzt, a Democratic consultant who is unaffiliated with any of the mayoral campaigns.\n\nNearly every public poll puts Mr. Mamdani ahead of Mr. Cuomo by 10 to 20 points, followed by Mr. Sliwa. Even the former governor has acknowledged that the odds are against him, and he has spent much of the last week trying to change the race’s fundamental dynamics by pushing Mr. Sliwa out of it.\n\nIf Mr. Sliwa does not withdraw, it would be “very, very, very hard mathematically,” for him to win, Mr. Cuomo told conservative talk radio host Sid Rosenberg last week. A recent poll commissioned by AARP suggested that might be Mr. Cuomo’s only chance for electoral success.\n\n“If he dropped out, maybe Cuomo would have a little bit of a chance, but not much,” President Trump said on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Sliwa has remained adamant that he is going nowhere. And even if he were to stop campaigning, his name would remain on the ballot.\n\n“Let me say it for the 9,852nd time: I’m not dropping out,” Mr. Sliwa said this weekend on Fox News.\n\nThat leaves Wednesday evening’s debate, hosted by NY1, WNYC and The City, an online news publication, as perhaps Mr. Cuomo’s last chance to flip the script.\n\n“Local debates aren’t watched by most of the electorate, so the only way to make headlines is if something out of the ordinary or exciting happens,” said Jeff Leb, a Democratic political consultant managing a pro-Cuomo super PAC.\n\nAt least week’s debate, Mr. Cuomo tried and tried again to shift viewers’ focus to what he saw as his own government accomplishments and Mr. Mamdani’s flaws: His youth, his inexperience, his failed career as a rapper, his anti-Israel rhetoric, his work on a film directed by his mother, Mira Nair (which features prominently on his résumé from his pre-Assembly days).\n\nBut Mr. Cuomo’s own baggage preceded him, and the moderators turned to it again and again, as did his onstage rivals.\n\nDavid Greenfield, a former Democratic councilman who has not endorsed a candidate, suggested that this time, Mr. Cuomo could put forth a more proactive platform, rather than just revisit his past.\n\n“Every New Yorker knows his résumé, they want to hear his plans for the future,” he said.\n\nBut Donovan Richards, the Queens borough president who endorsed Mr. Mamdani in August, said he was not expecting anything new or election-altering.\n\n”What is he going to say that he hasn’t said already?” he asked. “He’s labeled him everything under the sun. I don’t think a debate is going to change the outcome of this election, barring a really explosive allegation or something.”\n\nMr. Arzt also wondered what precisely Mr. Cuomo could actually do on the debate stage that would truly affect the outcome. With less than two weeks to go before Election Day, the race to replace Eric Adams has begun to feel baked.\n\n“It sort of feels a monumental hill to overcome, a mountain,” Mr. Arzt said.\n\nSo where does that leave Mr. Cuomo?\n\nOn Monday, in response to a request for comment, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo shared a New York Post editorial urging Mr. Sliwa to get out of the race.\n\n“It stinks, but for the sake of the city you love so deeply, Curtis, please swallow this bitter pill,” the editorial board wrote.\n\nMichael Goldcontributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/health/health-insurance-costs-2025.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"06:43:54-04:00","title":"Workers and Employers Face Higher Health Insurance Costs","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that average family health insurance coverage for American workers reached $27,000 in 2025, with workers bearing a growing share of the cost through higher premiums and deductibles, contributing $6,850 annually.

Faces New Pressures\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T05:00:24-04:00\n\nWhen Dr. Marketta Blue bursts into an examination room, she greets her patients as long-lost friends, a whirl of energy in leopard-print Crocs: “Tell me what’s up!”\n\nDr. Blue is a family physician at Delta Health Center, the oldest federally funded rural community health center in the United States. The center sits in the Mississippi Delta, at the entrance to Mound Bayou, which was founded in 1887 as an all-Black town. Today, more than half of the town’s children live below the federal poverty line. Last year, the health center saw just over 14,000 patients, 36 percent of whom had Medicaid.\n\nDr. Blue, 38, grew up in the region and lived with her grandmother, who could not afford to take time off work for medical appointments. She saw a doctor only if she was “bleeding from the eyes, mouth and nose,” she recalled. That experience, she added, left her attuned to the many reasons that her own patients might struggle to come see her: Maybe they can’t afford the gas to drive there, can’t cover child care or have lost their health insurance.\n\nInsurance was on the mind of one patient, Johnie Williams, 64, who shifted uncomfortably in his wheelchair as Dr. Blue entered his exam room in early September. His wife, Carolyn Williams, sat nearby, cradling their granddaughter. He was having trouble sleeping at night, he told Dr. Blue. When he lay down in bed, his lungs felt like cement, like no air could pass through. He felt nauseated all the time, which made it hard to eat.\n\nAlso, he said, “Medicaid cut me off.” He had received a letter about the change in his coverage in July, although he noted that he still had health care coverage through Medicare. (He’d previously had both). “They said by me and my wife being in the same household, the same address, that our income was a few dollars over the limit,” he added.\n\nDr. Blue’s face twisted in alarm. “Oh my gosh,” she said.\n\nTheir conversation could well be a precursor to many similar ones to come. The health care provisions in the Trump administration’s tax and domestic policy bill, passed in July, mean that 10 million more Americans will become uninsured by 2034, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. Federal spending on Medicaid will be reduced by more than $1 trillion, the largest reduction to Medicaid since the creation of the program in 1965.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The next morning, Mr. Cuomo called Mr. Sliwa “a spoiler” whose continued candidacy would only help Mr. Mamdani.\n\n“He cannot win,” Mr. Cuomo said, referring to Mr. Sliwa, admitting that it would be all but impossible for him to mount a comeback if Mr. Sliwa remained in the race. “You vote for Curtis, save yourself the time, and vote for Mamdani. That’s what this is.”\n\nMr. Mamdani agreed with Mr. Cuomo’s assessment of his narrow path to victory. “What New Yorkers saw is the fact that it’s more of the same with Andrew Cuomo,” Mr. Mamdani said of the debate. “More of the same with the affordability crisis, more of the same style of politics.”\n\nMr. Sliwa, for his part, has refused to entertain the possibility of dropping out, telling voters this weekend, “I have earned the right to be on that stage.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/upshot/obamacare-health-prices-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"05:01:51-04:00","title":"Obamacare Is Expensive.

But So Is All Health Insurance.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T05:01:51-04:00\n\nAs next year’s Obamacare prices start to become public, Republican lawmakers have returned to a frequent critique of the health insurance marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act: The law made insurance just too expensive.\n\nPremiums for individual plans are on track to rise by an average of 18 percent compared with this year. And they already averaged more than $600 a month, before accounting for subsidies that help people pay the bill. Most Americans who buy this kind of insurance could not afford these plans without financial help.\n\nThe congressional fight over whether to extend generous subsidies that help people pay these premiums highlights two broader truths about health insurance in America: It’s expensive — and every other market is also subsidized by the government.\n\n“Health insurance in America is very expensive, because health care is very expensive,” said Katherine Baicker, a health economist who is the provost at the University of Chicago. “And that’s true in every market. What’s different is who is writing the check, and how easily perceived the full cost is to the individual who is being insured.”\n\nHere’s how the average annual cost of Obamacare insurance compares with the other large insurance programs in the United States for a single adult, when looking at the unsubsidized, full costs for 2025:\n\nObamacare: $7,428 over 12 months\n\nEmployer coverage: $9,325\n\nMedicaid: $8,527\n\nMedicare: $14,674\n\nThese comparisons aren’t perfectly apples to apples. The programs cover different populations, with very different medical needs, and some allow people to go to a wider range of doctors and hospitals than others. But insurance in the individual market doesn’t stand out as pricey when compared with other programs’ costs.\n\nIt also doesn’t stand out in offering taxpayer subsidies to help people pay the cost of their coverage. In Medicaid, which serves the poor, most beneficiaries pay no premiums at all, leaving the bill to federal and state governments. In Medicare, which covers older and disabled people, hospital care is financed through a dedicated payroll tax that nearly all workers pay. And the government also covers about 75 percent of the costs of patients’ outpatient care and prescription drugs.\n\nThe funding for employer insurance is perhaps the most convoluted, because the government’s role in paying the bill is the least transparent. But those premiums are also subsidized by taxpayers. Because employer coverage is excluded from payroll and income taxes, it is effectively purchased at around a 30 percent discount on average.\n\nAnd, of course, most employers pick up a huge share of the remaining tab — around 84 percent, on average, according to the latest survey from the health research group KFF, which published new numbers Wednesday. Those payments are not tax subsidies, but they do often disguise the full cost of insurance to workers.\n\n“The real problem with comparing Obamacare plans to employer plans is it’s a little like comparing the Leninists to the Troskyites,” said Michael Cannon, the director of health care studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Mr. Cannon believes that, if insurance were less regulated and subsidized, most Americans would choose leaner and cheaper coverage than what is currently available.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act prices tend to grab headlines because they are easy to see in online marketplaces, whereas very few Americans encounter the full prices of other types of coverage. (To construct the list above, we consulted reports from the Congressional Budget Office, the KFF employer survey and a government analysis.) But people in other insurance markets are also getting substantial government help paying for insurance.\n\nThe enhanced subsidies at the heart of the legislative fight this fall similarly insulate people in the Obamacare marketplaces from the insurance’s full costs. The poorest customers can currently obtain a plan without paying anything, and some people earning more than $100,000 can still get some financial help. On average, subsidies cover 89 percent of premiums this year, a high share that reflects the relatively low incomes of most people who are enrolled.\n\nDemocrats, who are withholding their votes on a government spending bill to get the extra subsidies extended, argue they are the only way to keep the coverage affordable for the people who need it.\n\nIf the extra Obamacare subsidies expire, people making more than $65,000 will have to pay the full cost of their insurance, meaning salaried workers at that income will get tax subsidies that aren’t available to entrepreneurs earning the same amount.\n\nIndividual insurance prices didn’t always look so similar to those for other kinds of insurance. Obamacare critics are correct that the law imposed extensive new regulations on the market, which raised prices.\n\nBut before those changes, individual insurance had huge holes that also made it very different from other kinds of insurance in what and who it covered. It often excluded benefits for common, expensive medical services, like obstetrics and prescription drugs. And insurers often just wouldn’t sell any coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nObamacare changed all that. Plans had to cover a standard set of benefits and offer them to every customer, broadly adjusting only for someone’s age and location. This made the market more like the employer market, in which insurance has long covered a wide range of medical services and is offered to all workers at the same cost. The shift meant that premiums for individual insurance jumped substantially in 2014, and have continued to climb over time. But they have not overtaken the cost of employer coverage.\n\nSome critics object to the costs associated with all the required benefits. The Affordable Care Act “prevents insurance from being insurance” by forcing even employer plans to be more generous, said Ge Bai, a Johns Hopkins accounting and health policy expert who says these changes have led to higher overall costs. The median price of an individual plan was $3,736 in 2011, adjusted for inflation, before Obamacare, nearly doubling to $6,233 in 2023.\n\nBecause the lawmakers who wrote Obamacare knew it would make individual insurance more comprehensive, and thus more expensive, subsidies were always part of the plan. Many Americans can’t afford high premiums, and if healthy people don’t buy insurance, the cost of covering the sick people who remain becomes very high. The subsidies — which have drawn in younger and healthier customers — have helped spread those costs over more people, as employer insurance does by covering a wide range of workers and benefits.\n\nThe extra subsidies that are set to expire have supercharged that effect. Actuaries for insurance companies, expecting some healthier people will drop coverage without subsidies, have estimated premiums will increase next year by an additional four percentage points.\n\nSince the pandemic, costs have begun accelerating, across all kinds of health insurance. And Obamacare, which also had provisions to tamp down health spending, has not succeeded in stopping that recent trend. Higher hospital prices, rising labor costs and expensive new medicines are all fueling the increased health care costs. “It’s a symptom of the broader cost and price challenges facing the system,” said John A. Graves, professor of health policy and medicine at Vanderbilt University.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/nyregion/mayor-sliwa-guardian-angels.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-22","timeOfPublication":"03:00:07-04:00","title":"Management of Guardian Angels Raises Questions About Sliwa’s Leadership","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article raises serious questions about Curtis Sliwa’s leadership of the Guardian Angels, a once-prominent citizens’ patrol group, due to the organization’s financial mismanagement, including the loss of its tax-exempt status in 2022 and inflated claims of international chapters.

He has at times doffed his trademark beret and swapped out his red bomber jackets for muted suits. And at a debate among candidates last week, he openly acknowledged his hope that New Yorkers would see him as someone who “exceeds all expectations and looks very mayoral tonight.”\n\nBuoyed by a warm reception of that night’s performance, and defying his low polling numbers, Mr. Sliwa has now dug in, refusing calls to drop out of the race and insisting that his experience leading a once-prominent citizens’ patrol group has prepared him to run America’s largest city.\n\nBut a look at the state of that group, the Guardian Angels, reveals an organization marred by mismanagement: It has lost its tax-exempt status but continues to solicit donations online, all while exaggerating its presence around the United States and the world.\n\nThe most recent tax returns on file for the group, formerly a nonprofit charity, are for the year 2019. As a result, the government revoked its tax-exempt status in 2022, for noncompliance.\n\nAnd although the Guardian Angels website claims dozens of chapters in cities like San Diego, Tucson and Milwaukee, as well as international branches in Spain, Italy, Mexico and South Korea, the reality is more complicated, records and interviews show. An email to the Tucson chapter bounced back. A phone number for the Los Angeles chapter had been disconnected, and, on its Facebook page, the San Diego chapter announced last year that it was no longer active.\n\nEven its presence in New York City, where it once boasted of having more than 1,000 participants, has been diminished in recent years. It now claims just 150 members in the city, and 50 junior members.\n\nMr. Sliwa has defended his stewardship of the organization but, in an interview, acknowledged its recent management troubles. He blamed the loss of its tax-exempt status on a previous accountant, Rafael Alvarez, who he said had duped the Guardian Angels into believing its paperwork was in order for years. Mr. Alvarez, a Bronx-based tax preparer known to some customers as “The Magician,” was charged last year in a $145 million fraud scheme, and sentenced to prison in May.\n\nThe Guardian Angels, Mr. Sliwa said, are now working with a new accountant and petitioning the I.R.S. to reinstate their tax-exempt designation.\n\n“We were not aware of it,” Mr. Sliwa said of the tax forms not being filed, adding that in 2020, 2021 and 2022, he had personally gone to the accountant’s office and reviewed and signed tax forms, which he said were never filed.\n\nMichael Bachrach, a lawyer for Mr. Alvarez, said in an email that he was not able to comment on Mr. Sliwa’s version of events.\n\nEven so, the group’s website still describes the organization as a tax-exempt nonprofit and prominently features a red button encouraging donations, potentially running afoul of the law and exposing donors to risk should they try to claim donations that are not legally tax-deductible, experts said.\n\nAs for any claims of a wide national and international presence, Mr. Sliwa also acknowledged that some information on the Guardian Angels site was out of date.\n\n“Some of those chapters did lapse,” he said, adding that, since the pandemic, some groups around the world had lost volunteers while others pivoted from crime-fighting to passing out blankets and water to the poor.\n\n“The kind of people that we attracted initially no longer seem to want to join because now we have become a group that is out there helping the homeless and emotionally disturbed,” he said.\n\nStill, patrols have continued in a variety of locations.\n\nIn Gothenburg, Sweden, a group of seven Guardian Angels runs weekend safety patrols; the group once had 25 members, Mikael Liljeroth, who founded the chapter in 2020, said, but members continue to make citizen’s arrests, distribute clothing to the homeless and run a sponsored minibus for women who might need help getting home after a night of drinking or celebrating.\n\nIn Turin, Italy, a group of 15 volunteers runs patrols on weekends, calling the police if they see a crime and distributing food and clothing to the homeless, said Angelo La Torre, who founded the chapter in 2017.\n\n“We’ve intervened in risky situations,” Mr. La Torre said of the group. “When we’re on duty, we’re always on high alert because something unexpected could happen at any moment.”\n\nHe said he had never met Mr. Sliwa in person but added that they had spoken several times on video calls. He said that he found Mr. Sliwa inspiring.\n\nAnd in Mexico, there are four separate chapters, with a total of 50 members, Christian Dominguez Alcántara, Mexico’s Guardian Angels national director, said. The 20-member Mexico City chapter, he added, was the most active. The Mexican Guardian Angels are more careful about intervening in crimes, he said, focusing on youth outreach and assistance to the homeless.\n\n“In Mexico, organized crime is in collusion with or part of the government, so it’s not safe to fight it directly because here they kill you just for speaking out about the issue,” he said. “But we have programs and campaigns to get young people off the streets and away from drugs and gangs.”\n\nIn the United States, some chapters, including ones in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, are smaller than they once were, but still hold frequent meetings.\n\n“I’ve stopped crime with the Guardian Angels. That’s what we do,” said John Ayala, commander of the Washington division, which currently has about 12 members, he said.\n\nMr. Ayala said he has known Mr. Sliwa since Mr. Ayala joined a street patrol of the New York City Guardian Angels in 1984, at the age of 14. He said he had moved to Washington in 1989. Since then, he said, it’s become more difficult to recruit new members, but they continue to attract a handful each year.\n\n“The Guardian Angels are a group of people who go out and if you snatch a purse, we will chase you,” he said.\n\nIf some claims on the Guardian Angels website stretch the truth, it would not be a first for the organization, or for its leader.\n\nDuring the 2021 mayoral race against Mr. Adams, voters were reminded of Mr. Sliwa’s past penchant for falsehoods. In the 1990s, after riding high on tales of the Guardian Angels returning a wallet full of cash to its rightful owner, and personally kicking a gun from the hands of a criminal on a subway platform, Mr. Sliwa confessed that reports of his heroism were greatly exaggerated. The wallet’s return had been staged. The man with the gun was a fiction.\n\nDecades later, he said, he told The New York Times in an interview that he regretted the falsehoods he told.\n\n“If I could do it again, I would never do it,” he said. “It has followed me everywhere.”\n\nStill, despite his long odds in the current race against the front-runner, Zohran Mamdani, and the former New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, Mr. Sliwa has remained upbeat.\n\n“I’m feeling very good,” he said after last week’s debate. “From the feedback I got, I did not wear my red beret, people felt I behaved — it looked and felt like I could be mayor.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/22/opinion/focus-group-wellness-mom-voters.html","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-11","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00+08:00","title":"China's New Cultural Movement Gains Momentum in April 2024","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new cultural movement in China, initiated by public interest and government support, is gaining momentum.

exposed to health and wellness influencers, debates over additives, microplastics and forever chemicals, and politicized questions about the food, medication and vaccines we put into our bodies. On the left, some of these questions and debates are influencing environmental and consumer policies in places like California and Colorado. On the right, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the “Make America Healthy Again” movement wield immense power to shape policy across the country.\n\nMuch of this attention is focused especially on parenting and childhood. So for Times Opinion’s latest focus group, we spoke with 14 mothers from across the country and across the political spectrum about parenting today, dealing with doctors and illness, vaccines, food, MAHA and Mr. Kennedy. For this conversation we cast a wider net than just Mr. Kennedy’s supporters, but specifically brought together people who said they had a particular worry about the food their families eat and an interest in doing some of their own research, not just deferring to doctors.\n\nWhile six of the 14 participants said they would describe themselves as “MAHA moms,” the others did not. The overall group included pro-Trump voters, anti-Trump voters, people with concerns about vaccines and people who approved of the Trump administration’s focus on chemicals or food but felt it was going too far on vaccines or Tylenol.\n\nWhat comes through in the conversation is how hard it can feel to be taken seriously by doctors and how hard it is to make choices — whether as a parent or as your own person — in the age of social media.\n\nBeing someone’s safe place and being her best friend.\n\nIt’s like watching your heart outside of your body.\n\nBeing able to be a kid again and have fun with them.\n\nI love watching my children achieve things and grow and be proud of themselves.\n\nWatching her grow and rise to the challenge of all the preteen stuff.\n\nWatching them grow into who they are becoming and seeing all their accomplishments.\n\nI’d say it’s rewarding and joyful just to be able to see it all and experience it all.\n\nThat I need to pay someone to watch her so I can make money.\n\nWatching them struggle when you see things that you can fix, but they need to work it out themselves.\n\nIt’s kind of a duality. I don’t want to do a half-good job at being an employee, and I don’t want to do a half-good job at being a mom. But I’m the only one running the show here.\n\nI spend more time researching health-related things. My daughter has some autoimmune neurological struggles, and I also have autoimmune struggles. I feel like I spend a lot of time researching supplements or different therapies or things that could help her to feel better.\n\nI have a couple of different bloggers that I follow to some degree, some influencer-type people on Instagram, although I’m a little picky about who I listen to there or really give my time to because I feel like a lot of them are very gimmicky or just trying to sell different things. I also rely on my daughter’s doctors. And so it’s kind of a plethora of different places.\n\nI’m a stepmom and we’re co-parenting, so I always look at like, OK, how do I not step on toes? With health problems, I have some friends that are doctors, and I’ll ask them questions about best approaches.\n\nAnd how do you know who to trust when you do research online?\n\nI don’t particularly trust influencers online. I do subscribe to The New York Times, so if there is a health article or parenting articles, I feel pretty good about them and how they’re researched and things like that. I also go to my friends with children who are now adults and who’ve turned out well.\n\nI get library books. If I like a certain author, their style, the recommendation, I’ll just get all their books.\n\nWe became a blended family four years ago. Before that, I got a lot of my family input on how to raise my girls from my faith, my church family. And then when we became a blended family, we had a lot of issues at the beginning. I found a blog that was really helpful in that the family was just like mine, and my pediatrician recommended other quality sites.\n\nI follow different Instagram people or on TikTok who are parents. I definitely don’t take everything they say word for word, but I get different ideas for things to do on holidays or gifts, and also appreciate the reminders about perspective they share. The days are long but the years are short, for example.\n\nHow easy or hard is it to find information about being a mom to your family?\n\nIt’s too easy. I feel like everybody wants to tell you how to parent, whether that’s the internet or your family.\n\nSeeking out the content is one thing. But if you just let content appear, there’s people who are telling you, oh, you’re doing it wrong. This shouldn’t be how it is. News articles tell you one thing. Others tell you the opposite. You're like, what’s reality?\n\nBreastfeeding. From the beginning. It starts at the beginning. They’re like, you’re doing that wrong. You should be doing it this way. You should be bottle. You should be breast. You should not do formula. You should do formula. It doesn’t matter. From the second you have a kid, everybody has something to tell you.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that no matter where you are on any level, the algorithm is going to find a way to see if you agree or disagree with a new thought. I think there’s a lot of mom-shaming that goes on social media. For stay-at-home moms versus working moms, that’s always been a huge battle on social media that is not anybody’s choice but a personal one. I guess it just tugs on your heart on social media sometimes. When you feel like you’re doing something wrong, you start seeing things that it’s kind of like: Yeah, you should have done this a little bit better.\n\nI definitely feel that way, though I do think my algorithm has changed and it’s gotten less overwhelming as my daughter’s gotten older, I guess. Still, it’s just a lot of unattainable high standards in every different aspect. Like, you should be baking your bread, and you should be doing your laundry this way, and your house should look a certain way. And for the most part, that’s unattainable or really difficult to get if it’s not your full-time job.\n\nI do feel like I’ve found ways to feel validated through social media. It just takes weeks for the algorithm to realize: Oh, this is what you’ve decided to do. And then you start getting content about that. And then I feel validated that, oh, other people are doing what I’m doing. Or I have people I talk to online, and so that helps me feel validated.\n\nI think there’s moments of validation and then moments of, oh, maybe I should do that different. But I think in the end it balances out, and I don’t let it affect me personally.\n\nMost people said harder. Kristy, you were one of them. Tell me why.\n\nI feel like when you get so many options thrown in your face, there’s so many people doing the same thing in so many different ways. It’s hard not to feel like you’re just comparing, and that comparison just invalidates. It’s just overwhelming. When you’re already kind of struggling with the job and the house and the marriage and the kids and all the things all the time, just trying to day to day, and then you’re looking at the comparisons. But if I hadn’t seen that, if it hadn’t been in my face, I wouldn’t be thinking about it. I think it’s too much for society. It’s too much for families. It’s too much for our kids. It’s just too much all around the board.\n\nLet’s switch gears a bit. When you’re looking for information online, how much of that information is related to health and wellness?\n\nWe do a lot less online research when it comes to health stuff. We try to do old school, dig out some books and things, because there’s a lot of controversial stuff that you’ll find online. And we try to stick to as natural as possible.\n\nMy in-laws are both doctors, so I would rather call them than Google something and get two different answers to the same question. Or call my pediatrician if it was my daughter, or my own doctor.\n\nI’d say health is more physical where wellness is more mental well-being. I focus more on keeping my son and daughter healthy, which I always hope helps their mental wellness out.\n\nWell, library. I have church people that I talk to and I go to meet-up groups. So I like a lot more one-on-one conversations. And I went to school for Chinese medicine in Minnesota, so I like to hear alternative voices a lot and just gather all my information from people’s firsthand experiences.\n\nI also have family. My church, very active in my life, my children’s lives. And I try to be careful with the information I listen to online versus what I apply to my life and my children’s lives. On vaccinations, for example, I had people come to me after the pandemic and share their opinions in person and say: I feel this is what you should do with yourself, with your kids. And I would spend time online and I would see different opinions. I go to my doctor. I go to our family pediatrician and I feel that sometimes I can’t always listen to what other people say, so I’ll go to a professional. I will do what feels best. And I pay attention to my children, and I listen to them above other people.\n\nWhat’s a health or wellness question that you had? How’d you find the answer to it, and did you think it was trustworthy?\n\nI’m always looking for alternative medicines for me and my family. Lately I have been going on TikTok and sometimes find a lot of helpful information. I find people that look like me, maybe in the same age range, and sometimes I look at the advice that they’re giving. I’ll try different vitamins or minerals because they are recommending it. You can read the comments and they’ll let you know, hey, this did work.\n\nI turn to a local mom’s group on Facebook. I really do not use Facebook for anything besides this group. Anytime we have a question about almost anything, I say: I’m going to go ask the Mommies. And almost every time they come up with answers or just things I hadn’t thought of. I feel a little more confident trusting women who, some of them I know personally, but also just knowing they live in the same area as me. We’re dealing with a lot of the same things and the same kind of demographics.\n\nWhen you do research, how do you feel about what you’re finding out?\n\nI become a down-the-rabbit-hole kind of a girl. I will stay up till one, two, three o’clock in the morning sometimes when I have my own time and just research and study and look at the NIH website or TikTok or Instagram or even the mommy groups also. Whatever is continuously repetitive across sources and has worked is what I’ll apply. Because even TikTok and Instagram, it’s kind of like even relationship advice, same thing with parental advice, you can’t take all of it and absorb all of it because you’d be divorced tomorrow if you take all of that advice.\n\nGive me an example of something you’ve cut loose.\n\nThey kept pressuring me while I was pregnant to get vaccines. But every time I would look at the ingredients list, I’m like, what’s this and what’s this and what’s this? And when you ask them straight up, they’re like, I don’t know. And I’m like, what do you mean you don’t know what this is? You’re the doctor. So then I would have to go do my own research. I feel like the health care industry has never been on my side personally unless I basically do all the work at it myself.\n\nI feel like doctors are quick to dismiss, like: Oh, what? Did you Google? That’s the worst thing you can do. And that was regarding a vaccine. So I felt like I was a little bit dismissed, where I just kind of ended the conversation. But it’s still something I feel strongly about.\n\nI found out I had Hashimoto’s because I looked online. I told my doctor that I had all the symptoms of Hashimoto’s. I asked him for a test. He was reluctant because my blood work looked normal, but more testing was done and I found out that I had severe antibodies to a point where it was Hashimoto’s. Had I not brought it up …\n\nI feel like I’ve been able to search out and cultivate a team of doctors for myself and my daughter who are all pretty willing and open to listen to information that I bring to them. Generally, I don’t feel like they just instantly dismiss me.\n\nMy experience has been, I usually get more of an attentive and analytical response from my female doctors. My male doctors tend to be a little bit more like: No, don’t worry, I know what I’m talking about. Trust me. Like: We’ll just wait for the lab work. Or: The lab work is saying this, so don’t worry about it.\n\nA lot of people in this group are pretty interested in health and wellness stuff. How long have you felt interested? Was there something specific that drew you to these topics, an inciting moment?\n\nMy daughter was diagnosed with plaque psoriasis. That’s when I began to look up what are the vegetables, what are the foods that she can eat without flaring up? Is she allowed to take dairy? Is she allowed to do this or that?\n\nI thought about health differently before I had kids. And immediately when I was pregnant and going through the immense amount of doctor’s appointments and ultrasounds and all of that is when I started thinking about everything and asking more questions, and then being dismissed because of certain questions or experiencing rudeness just because I was asking a question. That made me think more, like, I should be asking even more questions once you get that kind of experience. And then it just kind of stemmed from there. I never thought about vaccinating until I had kids. That was just where it all started for me and when I started questioning the medical health industry.\n\nParenting’s just so different now versus what it was previously. I just feel like there’s constantly new possible issues arising that you have to be extra vigilant with your kid to make sure they don’t text somebody the wrong thing or say the wrong thing.\n\nI took most of my parenting advice from my own mom, and it works for me. And so I try to just focus on knowing in myself what is working. And then, like we’ve been talking about, anything health-related I go to an actual doctor for because I’m just — I don’t want false information.\n\nI got some really strange symptoms after backpacking and it turned out to be Lyme disease. And I brought it to my doctor, who said there is no Lyme in Tahoe. And I’m like, all the same, would you test? And I had to convince her. And then she tested it and came back and was like: Oh, no, my bad. You do have Lyme. And afterwards is when I realized it’s just you have to advocate for yourself and your child and do at least a little bit of research. I still absolutely trust the doctors, but it’s easy to be dismissed.\n\nI didn’t go to school to do the doctor thing, and they did. And they had to do all the work, and so I trust them. But at a point it sometimes seems they’re in it for the money rather than helping people.\n\nFrom my past experience, even before having children, I’ve seen doctors treat patients like a number. In and out, in and out. I believe in doctors sometimes. But then I also do my homework, and I do my due diligence. I pay attention to myself, my children. And I’ve unfortunately seen doctors be wrong about certain things for elders in my family. And because of that, my answer is I’m neutral.\n\nJust as a whole, I feel like doctors are more treating symptoms than finding the root cause. Treating symptoms and getting new symptoms to treat with side effects of medication.\n\nWhat does “Make America Healthy Again” or MAHA mean to you?\n\nThe biggest focus in that movement is figuring out why chronic illness, especially in our children, is so high right now versus 20, 30 years ago. What has changed? What’s in our medicine? What are we being given? What’s in our food? It’s getting to the bottom of why we’re having all these health issues.\n\nIt means completely different things to me. It’s a great catchphrase that R.F.K. Jr. came up with. He just took a bunch of nonscientists that are making decisions on behalf of the American people. The things that he’s researching I agree with, the things that he’s focusing on. But how he’s going about it and what he’s coming out with makes zero sense, Tylenol being a very lovely example as of recently.\n\nI think some people, they’d rather just ignore it. And just because what Make America Healthy Again is associated with and their hate for that, they just bypass it. But I think it’s something that’s way overdue. And the fact that different ingredients are banned in all other countries, but here in America, where we’re supposed to be thriving and on top of everything, there’s bad things that are legally OK to go into our food.\n\nI want to call on people who weren’t so sure initially what MAHA stood for. Kristy, how about you?\n\nIt sounds familiar, but I feel like Robert Kennedy is just not somebody that I would rely on for healthy information. I feel like there’s just been so much skepticism around it all, and it’s just kind of a scary subject. I think social media kind of tends to gear us into that regard, too, or you’re leaning towards whatever the majority thinks. It’s just a slippery slope.\n\nI do, because people my parents’ age, they’re healthy people. I’m not healthy. My children are even worse than me, even though I feed them better than my parents fed me, and we weren’t allowed junk food in the house. And I believe that Make America Healthy Again is getting rid of those dyes that are causing the neuro problems.\n\nI agree with concerns about ingredients and what’s being pumped in our everyday foods, especially the multiple underlying names of sugar now in all of our products. And why are our health care inflation costs growing exponentially and much faster than our general?\n\nBecause everyone’s sick. Everybody’s getting sick and everybody’s relying on the pharmaceutical industry, which is getting money for people being sick and just fixing small problems and not getting to the root, because they need you coming through their doors for them to get paid.\n\nWhat, if anything, do you feel like MAHA goes too far on?\n\nTrying to link anything and everything to the amount of autism and A.D.H.D. diagnoses that we have now in our children and our young teens, in my opinion, goes a little bit too far. And it’s a little uncontrolled as far as the scientific sources that they’re using for it. To me, it plays on the fact that we have advancements now in technology and in science that we didn’t have back in the ’30s and the ’40s in order to diagnose.\n\nSo I would not consider myself a MAHA mom, but I feel like I’m kind of like an O.G. MAHA before there was MAHA. I have a lot of chronic illness, and so does my daughter. And we know that it’s linked directly to mold that is in our very old house that we are about to tear down and go on a journey of healing from the mold that has made us all very sick. So I feel like I have already kind of been doing all of the MAHA stuff for now like a decade, as far as avoiding all the sugar, avoiding all the dyes. I feel like I was already aware of the dangers of Tylenol way before. I don’t feel like MAHA is very genuine.\n\nIt just feels very put on and very showy, and I’m not really hearing a lot about actual scientific evidence, I guess, coming directly from the top of the movement. So I don’t have an issue with R.F.K. Jr. personally. He’s got some good things to say, I guess. But I just think the whole Trump White House in general is just too much for me.\n\nHas anybody changed a practice or a view because of something that R.F.K. Jr. said or did? OK. Well, we’re going to talk about that a little bit, but I don’t want to get there quite yet. I want to hear from some other folks. Doesn’t look like anybody — why not?\n\nLike it’s been mentioned, a lot of people already formed opinions before the last couple of years with the MAHA thing. And so for the ones who have already been questioning artificial dyes and G.M.O.s and sugar and all these things, it felt like: Oh, someone else is finally talking about it. But it didn’t change the way we thought because all of the red flags were already there.\n\nI was living in California, which has a disclaimer on anything that has carcinogens. As a kid, I never saw that outside of a Chick-fil-A, walking in and there’s a warning sign. So then I became more curious, and then that’s when I went down the rabbit hole of the dyes, the sugar, the this and that. And I was like, oh, my God, it’s so much. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it. And then you’re just kind of guiltily doing things. When I had my daughter, that’s when I became a stickler for whole foods, healthy eating.\n\nSo a lot of you were doing this stuff before but now there’s a name for it. How does that make you feel?\n\nFinally. Like, other people are saying it out loud.\n\nJoining a holistic moms network, I learned a lot from them. I’ve been on medications. I’ve gotten off all mine, and I would trust more surgical doctors than the experiences I’ve had with more primary care doctors because they don’t really — a lot of them just don’t really listen to you, and it’s hard to make that good connection. With MAHA, I think that they’ve gained a lot of momentum because people are really desperate for results.\n\nHaving children truly, truly changed my perspective on health. I see the impact that a movement can have in a very populated area. And if I see the schools start to implement healthier habits, I know that it’s going to affect the kids. I know it’s going to affect everybody long term if it continues in a positive direction.\n\nI really wasn’t following along with the healthy stuff, but I do agree that there needs to be some changes made with our foods. Some of the other countries don’t take our products. I’ll just say that I don’t feel like Mr. Kennedy is just putting on a show. I really do feel that he wants to make a difference in American foods. He just seems like the first person that has come out and said: Hey, we need to do something about this.\n\nSome people have mentioned food. Some people have mentioned chronic disease. Some people have mentioned vaccines. Do people feel like R.F.K. Jr. is focused right now on the right things, or are there things you’d prefer him to be focused more on?\n\nI’d like him to stay the hell away from vaccines. That would be great. I do like that he’s focused on fluoride in our water. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? It’s questionable. Additives, things that are legal here that are not legal in other countries, that type of stuff, perfectly happy if he focuses on that.\n\nI feel like the seed oils issue is a major thing that we haven’t talked about in the country. And so that, to me, is something I’d love to see more action being done around. Avoiding them has completely changed my health, and I’ve seen it change the health of so many people.\n\nI think it’s going in the right direction. I feel like literally every week there’s a new food brand in the news, saying, oh, they’re taking this dye out of this product. Companies are actively making the changes on their own.\n\nHe should focus more on neurotoxins, what’s actually a neurotoxin, what’s not, and how does that link to autism.\n\nDo you feel the idea of MAHA is more of a Democratic thing or a Republican thing?\n\nI saw this funny thing that was like, if you described the list of what MAHA is working on, it was a super liberal thing to do like five, 10 years ago. And now it’s like everyone’s associating it with the Trump administration, so it’s super Republican. So I think it’s both.\n\nI agree. And I know you’re asking if we think it’s one side or the other, but it really shouldn’t be. Everyone should care about what they’re putting in their body. But I absolutely agree that it used to be liberal, and now it’s seen more as Republican because it’s coming from more of the Trump administration.\n\nI think it has actually nothing to do with Trump, really, but if Kennedy had not joined Trump, I don’t think it would be happening. And I don’t think we’d be getting red dye No. 40 removed from all these brands and this and that. So I think Trump adding Kennedy is why it’s happening.\n\nI tend to not want to associate myself with the MAHA thing because I don’t identify as a Republican. But I do agree with a lot of the things they’re doing, and that, to me, feels like this very conflicting place to be. But I agree it should be a bipartisan issue.\n\nHe’s just so divisive, and I feel like the division is causing a lot more trouble than it needs to be. Even blaming the shutdown on the Republicans and being associated with claiming that Tylenol is bad and all these off-the-wall things, I think it just creates diversity in division.\n\nI gave him an A. I’ve just always been a supporter every term, mainly for the business aspects, the things that are brought into light that most people don’t have the courage to bring to light.\n\nWell, a lot of people don’t like the attitude, the controversial topics, but I think it actually is a catalyst for change that we need. ICE, the economy, tariffs, you name it.\n\nI gave him a B. It’s because it’s a long time coming. I know that it’s been an issue when it comes to Tylenol, but he brought that up and made it come to light.\n\nI was a C. I got out of the whole watching the news because of the fact that everything was either we hate Trump or we like Trump. And there’s no middle ground anymore for anybody to sit there and just be like, OK, well, I don’t agree with him on these things, but I agree with him on these things. He’s just a puppet for Congress. I feel like all presidents are.\n\nI was a C, just middle ground. I don’t love anything specifically or hate anything specifically. I’m indifferent to how things are going. I’m not loving anything specifically or hating anything specifically.\n\nTo be honest, I was sort of a fan of Trump’s because I did like his boldness, and I like that he wasn’t afraid to say what he wanted to say. But I am disappointed in the divisiveness. I feel the president shouldn’t come down off of his perch to chirp back and forth with the little people. But I feel like he does, and I think that takes away from being the president. He would probably do a good job, but it’s like he’s so focused on getting back at people instead of focusing on bringing the country together.\n\nAmerica in Focus seeks to hear and understand the views of cross-sections of Americans whose voices are often not heard in opinion journalism.\n\nThis discussion was moderated by a focus group veteran, Margie Omero, and Katherine Miller, a staff editor in Opinion.

It Shouldn’t Be a Retirement Home.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T05:01:52-04:00\n\nA government shutdown grips Washington, leaving Americans frustrated once again with partisan squabbling. The endless stalemates and inability to find common ground are reflective of a deeper problem: The House and the Senate are dominated by career politicians, buoyed by re-election rates that routinely exceed 90 percent, who seem more concerned with clinging to power than serving the public.\n\nThe time has come to put term limits on members of Congress.\n\nIn that spirit, the two of us — one a Republican and one a Democrat — will be the co-chairs of a national campaign with the organization U.S. Term Limits aimed at restoring accountability, competition and common sense on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe idea of imposing term limits is hardly novel. Indeed, our founders anticipated this problem. The Federalist No. 57 notes that “limitation of the term of appointments” is the most effective method for maintaining a “proper responsibility to the people.” Some observers argue that our congressional elections already serve as de facto term limits — that if voters want to send their senators and representatives home, they can just vote them out. But the reality is that incumbents today build up overwhelming advantages, making them extremely difficult to defeat.\n\nIncumbents routinely out-fund-raise their challengers by nearly insurmountable margins. In the 2024 election, according to data collected by OpenSecrets, PACs contributed more than $11 to congressional incumbents for every $1 they sent to challengers.\n\nThere are additional advantages, like name recognition and the ability to send taxpayer-funded mailers, that help those already in power.\n\nMost members of Congress are, by any reasonable definition, career politicians. In that way, Congress too often can be a self-serving closed club of political insiders looking to protect their power rather than a true forum of ideas aimed at benefiting the American public.\n\nSome people see redistricting reform as a fix for what ails Washington. However, such reforms would do little to curb the advantages incumbents enjoy in primaries and safe districts, nor would they dismantle the seniority system that stifles innovation in Congress. Redrawing district boundaries would not erase things like name recognition and fund-raising advantages that allow incumbents to cling to power.\n\nWhile the Constitution didn’t include congressional term limits, the principle of rotation was woven into early American political culture. Starting with George Washington’s example of voluntarily stepping aside after two terms, no president served more than two terms until Franklin Roosevelt broke precedent with his four elections, leading to the passage of the 22nd Amendment.\n\nIf term limits are good for the presidency, why not for Congress? After all, members of Congress wield enormous influence over our lives. They write our federal laws, control our tax dollars and provide oversight of the executive branch. The concentration of power among career politicians fuels partisanship by empowering lobbyists who profit off longstanding relationships, and deepens public cynicism about government.\n\nAmerica has a ballooning national debt, for which both Republicans and Democrats are to blame. If you want to know why, look no further than politicians singularly focused on spending your tax dollars in ways that bolster their chances of re-election. Greater turnover would mean more politicians invested in the interests of their constituents — and the nation as a whole — over those of entrenched and influential advocacy groups. It would go a long way toward restoring trust in our political institutions and reducing the influence of money in our elections.\n\nSo how do we make this happen? There are two potential paths: Congress itself could pass term limits. In 1995, a majority of House members voted in favor of a term limits constitutional amendment, though they fell short of the required two-thirds supermajority. Members of both chambers should act again and vote to limit their own power.\n\nIf Congress refuses to act, states can take matters into their own hands through an Article V amendment-writing convention. This mechanism seems tailor-made for this scenario. It allows states to propose an amendment when Washington will not. Twelve states have already passed “single-subject” resolutions calling for term limits, more than a third of the way toward the 34 states necessary for that process to move forward, and nearly a quarter of the way toward the 38 states needed to ratify an amendment.\n\nNeither approach would be easy, but the threat of a convention would almost certainly compel Congress to pass an amendment, making the arduous trek down either path critical to creating a more representative government. At a time when the country feels increasingly divided, this effort at reform would bring people together.\n\nAmericans are best served when their representatives bring fresh energy, new ideas and their unique backgrounds to the table for robust debate on the challenges facing our nation. We believe reaching across the aisle and leading this effort together is the first step. But on this issue, it will ultimately be up to everyday citizens making their voices heard.\n\nWe are the greatest nation on Earth; we deserve a Congress that reflects that greatness, not one that serves as a retirement home for career politicians.\n\nRon DeSantis, the governor of Florida, represented the state’s Sixth Congressional District from 2013 to 2018.

That’s Also Its Weakness.\n\nPublished: 2025-10-22T00:00:10-04:00\n\nHow do you solve a problem like the Louvre? Perhaps you can’t.\n\nThe world’s most famous and most-visited museum started as a medieval military fortress, then became a palace. It took a revolution to turn it into a museum. Royals and rulers renovated it more than 20 times, satisfying their vanity but leaving behind an incoherent structure that sits on 25 different levels and stretches for half a mile. It exhibits over 30,000 of its 500,000 artworks in more than 400 rooms.\n\nAnd it is this convoluted history and identity that make the Louvre a structure that is so difficult to monitor, oversee and protect.\n\n“The Louvre is a palace that doesn’t have the logic of a museum,” said Gérard Araud, the president of the Society of Friends of the Louvre. “It is a universe unto itself.”\n\nThe brazen and seemingly effortless robbery Sunday morning of eight pieces from the collection of crown jewels at the museum has wounded its leadership and put a spotlight on the Louvre’s security protocols, which have been tested over the years by break-ins and thefts.\n\nNot since Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian who had worked as a glazier at the Louvre, stole the Mona Lisa in 1911 has the reputation of the museum been so damaged by a security blunder. Since Sunday, charges of lax protection at the Louvre have been so relentless that the French Senate has called Laurence des Cars, the museum’s director, to explain herself in a hearing on Wednesday.\n\nA confidential draft report by the Cour des Comptes, France’s highest-level auditing institution, faults the Louvre for an inadequate video surveillance system in all three of its wings, huge reductions and delays in spending for security in recent years and a flawed sense of overall priorities. The document indicates that spending on security in 2024 was far lower it was 20 years ago.\n\nIn the Richelieu wing, which holds paintings by Poussin, Dürer and Vermeer, as well as the ancient Persian and Mesopotamian collections, only 25 percent of 182 rooms are covered by surveillance cameras, according to the report.\n\nThere have been “considerable delays in the raising of the museum’s technical facilities to modern standards,” the report said, according to a partial copy seen by The New York Times.\n\nThe report blames the museum’s leadership for focusing on new projects rather than “indispensable work” needed at the museum. The Louvre “has abundant resources of its own that it should use as a priority for urgent work,” the report says.\n\nThe jewels under the Louvre’s care reflect the ups-and-downs of French history through the centuries that the building has endured. From François I to Marie Antoinette, Napoleon Bonaparte and the Empress Eugénie, French royals amassed a mountain of gems. They wore them in crowns, rings, brooches, bracelets, earrings and necklaces, placed them atop scepters and on thrones, or closeted them away. Through wars and royal rivalries and revolutions, tens of thousands of these jewels remained with the French state.\n\nThey have long been a target of thieves.\n\nThe most spectacular theft came in 1792, amid the chaos and violence of the unfolding French Revolution. For several nights, drunken brigands settled into the royal storehouse, near the palace that is the Louvre today, to drink, sing and carry off more than 10,000 precious stones and pearls.\n\nWhile most of the jewels were recovered, one that never came back was the French Blue, a flawless, rare steel-blue 69-carat diamond mined in India and sold to Louis XIV. It was recut to a smaller size — 45.5 carats — and resold more than once before the jeweler Harry Winston bought it and then donated it to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. It is displayed there today as the Hope Diamond, one of the largest blue diamonds in the world.\n\nFrance is unlikely to ever get it back.\n\nAs for thefts inside the Louvre, a break-in that was in some ways similar to the one last Sunday happened in December 1976 when three masked burglars broke into the museum at dawn. They climbed a cleaning crew’s scaffolding, smashed unbarred windows, clubbed two guards, broke a glass showcase, and grabbed a diamond-studded sword that had belonged to King Charles X, who ruled in the early 19th century, during a period when the monarchy was restored.\n\nThe sword has never been recovered. It is listed on the Louvre website as “not on display.”\n\nIn 1998, a thief removed “The Path of Sèvres,” a small landscape painting by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, from its frame in broad daylight. It hung in a room without a surveillance camera. The thief escaped; the painting, valued at an estimated $1.3 million, was never recovered.\n\nAs scores of investigators continue to search for the perpetrators of last Sunday’s heist, they are also struggling to understand what went wrong with the Louvre’s security.\n\nThe Louvre is protected by a double layer of human security: a staff of guards (almost 1,200 in 2024, according to the Louvre) and a permanent 52-member force of firefighters, who are part of the French military.\n\nThe security guards have long complained about their working conditions, and even senior Louvre officials admit the workers’ status and training could be improved.\n\n“Civil servants aren’t very well paid in France,” said Denis Fousse in an interview in 2022, before he retired as the Louvre’s director of visitor services and security. “You take the exam and then we train you. We are not a profession where there is a security guard school.”\n\nThe firefighters, on the other hand, are well-drilled and are the first line of defense against fire and floods, and the ones designated to remove artworks in an emergency.\n\nThe firefighter-soldiers run a round-the-clock operation. Some stay overnight in simple dormitories furnished with bunk beds, tables and chairs.\n\nSome of their tasks border on the frivolous. When pigeons zoom in through open windows, the firefighters must shoo them out. Other tasks are dead serious: The brigade is the first point of contact and care in all health emergencies. But they are not responsible for crimes like thefts.\n\nAmong the unanswered questions were how the thieves broke the glass cases that displayed the crown jewels. The Louvre has sealed the Mona Lisa in a custom-made climate controlled, bulletproof glass box, and the painting’s wooden reverse side is studded with sensors to detect even the tiniest change in shape.\n\nBut the glass in the display cases for the crown jewels was different. It had to be strong enough to resist criminals but flexible enough to be broken by the firefighters if the museum caught fire and the jewels had to be saved, said a former senior member of the unit, who was not authorized to speak publicly as a retired member of the French military.\n\nThe firefighters’ handbook shows how tools like axes and battery-powered angle grinders are used to break glass display cases.\n\n“To secure the jewels, you also have to be able to extract them in an emergency,” the former firefighter said. “We have tools that can open the cases. It takes time and training to do so.”\n\nThe theft on Sunday has depleted what was already a diminished collection of crown jewels. In the years after the founding of the Third Republic, the parliamentary government created in 1870 from the ashes of Napoleon III’s empire, an anti-monarchical republican fervor swept France. In 1887, France held a grand 11-day public auction of most of its crown jewels.\n\nGems were torn from their settings; jeweled ornaments were broken up.

2025-10-22T05:02:03-04:00\n\nBird flu is back. After a quiet summer, the virus has hit dozens of poultry flocks, resulting in the deaths of nearly seven million farmed birds in the United States since the beginning of September. Among them: about 1.3 million turkeys, putting pressure on the nation’s turkey supply in the run-up to Thanksgiving.\n\nReports of infected wild birds have also surged this fall, and three states — Idaho, Nebraska and Texas — have identified outbreaks in dairy cows.\n\nThe virus often flares up in the fall as wild birds begin migrating south; this year, the uptick is occurring during a government shutdown, as federal agencies that are typically involved in the response are working with skeletal staff.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks human cases, and the Department of Agriculture, which monitors animal outbreaks, have both suspended routine communication with states, leaving many officials without up-to-date guidance on how to detect and contain the disease, or a clear national picture of the surge.\n\n“Because of the government shutdown, I know less than I would normally know,” said Dr. Amy Swinford, director of the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, which is part of a national network of labs that conducts bird flu surveillance.\n\nThe agriculture department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Emily Hilliard, a spokeswoman for the health department, said the C.D.C. was maintaining its emergency operations center and its ability to detect and respond to urgent public health threats.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In another, he looks on as agents arrest Barack Obama. In a third, he stands atop a mountain, having conquered Canada.\n\nThe era of A.I. propaganda is here — and Trump is an enthusiastic participant. He has posted A.I. items dozens of times on his Truth Social account, according to a review by The Times. Over the weekend, he posted a video in which he flies a fighter jet and dumps excrement on protesters.\n\nThe fake imagery attacks his political rivals, depicts him flatteringly, mocks criticism, celebrates his administration and spreads falsehoods about his agenda. It’s a wild and often gleeful medium that matches his freewheeling populist style. Today’s newsletter looks at the way the president uses this new tech.\n\nTrump’s use of the tech has evolved alongside the tools, which have rapidly improved from producing obviously fake images in 2022 to more lifelike renderings — including video and audio — this year. The content is easy to create by typing descriptions of what you want into A.I.-generating tools. Some videos use multiple A.I. tools, such as a video of Robert De Niro that Trump shared last year: Someone replaced the actor’s lip movements with A.I.-rendered manipulations to match a voice sound-alike.\n\nPolitical experts say that even the most anodyne uses of A.I. by the president normalize these tools as a new type of political propaganda. “It’s designed to go viral, it’s clearly fake, it’s got this absurdist kind of tone to it,” said Henry Ajder, who runs an A.I. consultancy. “But there’s often still some kind of messaging in there.” It redefines — or in some cases discards — the idea of being “presidential.” In the posts, he does a TikTok dance with Elon Musk, depicts a political rival as fat or wins the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe White House has responded to questions over Trump’s use of A.I. imagery by describing it as part of his successful social media strategy. “No leader has used social media to communicate directly with the American people more creatively and effectively than President Trump,” Liz Huston, the White House’s assistant press secretary, said on Friday in an emailed statement.\n\nTrump’s use of A.I. began in earnest during his 2024 campaign. After his first debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, he claimed that Haitian immigrants in Michigan were eating cats and dogs — a racist conspiracy theory for which there was no credible evidence. A backlash followed. Trump responded by depicting himself embracing cats, ducks and dogs. His supporters shared the images widely online:\n\n“The more ridiculous the photo or video, the more likely it is to dominate our news feeds,” said Adrian Shahbaz, vice president for research and analysis at Freedom House, a nonprofit focusing on democracy and liberty around the world. “A controversial post gets shared by people who enjoyed it and people outraged by it. That’s twice the shares.”\n\nIn office, Trump’s use of A.I. became more sophisticated. It’s not clear whether Trump posts the imagery or lets his staff members do so. But he likes to joke about policy issues. When he appointed himself as the head of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, he published an image depicting himself as a conductor.\n\nTrump has also skewered opponents. During his campaign, he visualized the supposed effects of “open borders,” contrasting two A.I. images: one an idyllic scene, the other an overcrowded one with trash piled out in the open.\n\nThis month, he posted a video depicting the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, in stereotypical Mexican garb. The video used A.I. to make it sound as if the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, were disparaging the Democratic Party.\n\nAfter the government shut down over a funding fight this month, Trump cast his budget director as the Grim Reaper. The video was created by a guerrilla messaging outfit loyal to Trump. Its leader, Brenden Dilley, a podcaster and former congressional candidate, declined to comment. But during the re-election campaign, he wrote on X: “The truth no longer matters, all you have to do is go viral.”\n\nSee more of the images.\n\nPresident Trump wants the Justice Department to pay him $230 million as compensation for years of F.B.I. investigations.\n\nTrump’s demand could be decided by officials who were once his personal lawyers. (An ethics expert told The Times that the arrangement was “almost too outlandish to believe.”)\n\nPaul Ingrassia, Trump’s pick to lead the office of the special counsel, withdrew his nomination. Ingrassia lost the support of several Republican senators after Politico reported that he had sent a series of racist text messages.\n\nTrump has no immediate plans to meet with Vladimir Putin, a reversal after Trump said last week that the two would meet soon.\n\nTrump is remaking the White House with renovations to the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room, the Rose Garden, the West Colonnade and the East Wing. See what’s changing. (A story about the demolition was the most-clicked article in The Morning yesterday.)\n\nSomeone drove a vehicle into a security gate outside the White House last night. A man was arrested, and there was no threat to the president, the Secret Service said.\n\nRepublican state senators in North Carolina approved a new congressional map designed to help their party keep control of the U.S. House.\n\nA New York man pardoned by Trump after participating in the Jan. 6 attack has been charged with a new crime: threatening to assassinate Representative Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nMore than 50 federal agents descended on Lower Manhattan yesterday, brushing past confused pedestrians to detain several men near Canal Street. Protests ensued.\n\nThe Trump administration is relying on a 200-year-old legal precedent — stemming from the seizure of an old mare — to defend its deployment of National Guard troops.\n\nThe government shutdown means there is, in effect, no Education Department right now. It’s a glimpse of what schools may lose if Trump succeeds in eliminating the agency.\n\nAn elite Hawaii school’s admission policy gives preference to Native Hawaiians. A new lawsuit calls it “blood-based discrimination.”\n\nThe University of Virginia and the Trump administration are close to striking a deal. The school ousted its president in June as part of a monthslong standoff.\n\nVance went to Israel and expressed optimism that the cease-fire deal would hold. He declined to set a deadline for when Hamas must disarm.\n\nTrump’s peace plan in Gaza calls for an international security force, but countries that might send troops are wary of danger, an unclear mission and being seen as occupiers.\n\nPro-Palestinian activists welcome the truce in Gaza. But the backlash to their demonstrations, some told The Times, offered sobering lessons about power and politics.\n\nThe jewelry stolen from the Louvre was worth over $100 million, the Paris prosecutor said..\n\nThree British neo-Nazis were sentenced last week for “preparing acts of terrorism.” The case highlights a growing threat from right-wing extremism, experts said.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery — the owner of HBO, CNN and a movie studio — says it is considering a sale.\n\nA measles outbreak along the border of Utah and Arizona has sickened more than 100 people.
