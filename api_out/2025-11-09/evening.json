\n       \n  By Alison Main, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:19 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump has floated a proposal to put the billions of dollars that back Affordable Care Act tax credits directly in the pockets of Americans instead, as lawmakers have so far failed to find a solution to address the rapidly approaching expiration of the enhanced subsidies that is at the heart of the record-breaking shutdown stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  Trump urged Senate Republicans in a Truth Social post on Saturday to send the money used to offset the costs of ACA health care premiums “directly to the people” so they can “purchase their own, much better, health care.”\n \n\n   \n  The president did not provide any further details, though fiscal hawk GOP Sen. Rick Scott enthusiastically announced on X that he’s “writing the bill right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Currently, ACA enrollees who qualify for tax credits, also known as premium subsidies, never see the funds. They are sent directly to insurers to offset people’s monthly premiums.\n \n\n   \n  More than 90% of Obamacare enrollees qualify for the enhanced subsidies in 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have decried the subsidy system as enriching insurers, with some supporting sending the funds directly to Americans to give them more control over their health insurance decisions.\n \n\n   \n  Despite sparking widespread interest among Trump’s Republican allies, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the administration does not have a formal proposal before the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed by ABC News on why Trump was posting about the idea online, Bessent reaffirmed the president’s unwillingness to engage in real bipartisan health care talks until the shutdown ends.\n \n\n   \n  “We have got to get the government reopen before, you know, we do this,” he said. “We are not going to negotiate with the Democrats until they reopen the government. It’s very simple. Reopen the government, then we can have a discussion.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s appeal to Senate Republicans comes as Democratic lawmakers are digging in on their attempt to force the GOP to the negotiating table on extending the enhanced ACA subsidies that are due to expire at the end of this year.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer laid out a plan on Friday that would have provided the Democratic votes needed to reopen the government in exchange for a one-year extension, though Senate Majority Leader John Thune immediately poured cold water on it.\n \n\n   \n  While Democrats demand extending the ACA credits, Republicans have made clear that making major changes to former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law is a priority for them.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham called the ACA “the biggest scam on the planet,” touting Trump’s proposition to put money in the pockets of Americans to purchase their own insurance plans.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina Republican predicted a weekend “breakthrough” in funding talks on Capitol Hill, where negotiators so far have not presented a compromise deal that includes an ACA solution that would win over enough Democrats to back a short-term bill to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ll have a breakthrough today. Then we’ll talk about how to change Obamacare to give the money to the people rather than insurance companies,” he told “Fox Sunday Futures.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats so far have shown no appetite to seriously consider Trump’s proposal.\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries quickly dismissed the idea in an interview on Sunday as he slammed the GOP’s openness to negotiate a real fix to the health care system.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, there’s always opportunity to improve current policy that exists, but Republicans aren’t operating in good faith as it relates to doing anything to actually make health care more affordable,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a key progressive voice who’s been urging her Democratic colleagues to hold firm in their health care fight, warned that Trump’s proposal could be “just a Republican bait-and-switch to repeal Obamacare for the 70th time.”\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has indicated that his conference is working on a health care plan to address their concerns about the existing system under Obamacare, though GOP leaders have not divulged any details.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/sport/baseball-mlb-guardians-emmanuel-clase-luis-ortiz","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"16:14:00-05:00","title":"Feds Indict 2 Cleveland Guardians Pitchers for Alleged Sports Betting and Money Laundering Scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, pitchers for the Cleveland Guardians, have been indicted by federal prosecutors for allegedly conspiring to rig pitches in Major League Baseball games to facilitate fraudulent sports betting.

have been indicted for allegedly taking part in a scheme to rig bets placed on  Major League Baseball  games.\n \n\n   \n  Clase and Ortiz face charges on multiple counts of wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, money laundering conspiracy and more, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  “Ortiz was arrested earlier today in Boston, Massachusetts, and will make an initial appearance in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts on November 10,” said Joseph Nocella, Jr., United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.\n \n\n   \n  “Clase is currently not in U.S. custody,” Nocella added.\n \n\n   \n  A lawyer for Ortiz maintains his client’s innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning,”   attorney Chris Georgalis told CNN in an email. “Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Clase’s attorney for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Both players were placed on non-disciplinary leave during the 2025 MLB season in relation to a sports betting probe.\n \n\n   \n  “We are aware of the recent

Baseball says it has also been cooperating with the DOJ investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the

agreed in advance with their co-conspirators on specific pitches that they would throw in MLB games. The co-conspirators then used that information to place hundreds of fraudulent bets on those pitches.”\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s involvement in the scheme is alleged to have started in 2023. The three-time All-Star coordinated with corrupt sports bettors to rig proposition bets on particular pitches he would throw, prosecutors say.\n \n\n   \n  The bettors would then wager on the speed and type of Clase’s pitches, based on information they received in advance from Clase, sometimes even during games, per the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ says bettors won at least $400,000 using inside information on Clase’s pitches.\n \n\n   \n  Ortiz is accused of joining the enterprise in 2025, working alongside Clase to coordinate with bettors on rigged pitches he would throw.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Ortiz was paid a total of $12,000 to intentionally throw a ball instead of a strike in two MLB games. Clase allegedly received matching payments for his role in helping to arrange Ortiz’s rigged pitches, the feds say, with gamblers winning at least $60,000 in the process.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment, which was filed on Wednesday and unsealed Sunday, comes on the heels of a series of  similar indictments  involving Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones.\n \n\n   \n  The trio was arrested in October in relation to two separate federal gambling investigations, one involving rigged high-stakes poker games and the other involving insider trading in sports betting.\n \n\n   \n  Both the MLB and NBA cases are being handled by Nocella’s Brooklyn office.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted of all charges, Clase and Ortiz could potentially face decades behind bars.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Amanda Musa contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/media/resign-bbc-trump-speech-edit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:07:00-05:00","title":"BBC Executives Resign Amid Political Firestorm Over Trump Documentary Edit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The resignations of BBC Director General Tim Davie and BBC News Chief Deborah Turness in November 2025 were driven by a combination of political pressure and internal editorial challenges, including a misleading edit in a 2024 documentary about Donald Trump’s January 6 speech.

resignations \n       \n  Analysis By Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:07 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One word in  outgoing BBC boss  Tim Davie’s statement explains not just his resignation, but the political reality for media leaders in 2025: “Febrile.”\n \n\n   \n  To save you from Googling, Dictionary.com defines “febrile” as “a more formal way of saying feverish — having a fever.”\n \n\n   \n  Arguments over the BBC in recent days have certainly been fevered, but then again, those arguments are never-ending, owing to the broadcaster’s immense power and unique place in British public life.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, the job of BBC director general — though certainly prestigious —is also relentless and thankless. The current controversy over a misleading edit to a 2024 documentary about President Donald Trump illustrates the dynamic perfectly.\n \n\n   \n  In a vacuum, the more-than-a-year-old misstep by unnamed producers would not cause the very top heads of the organization to roll.\n \n\n   \n  But Britain’s right-wing press has been “feasting like vultures” over the bad edit, as a source at the BBC put it on condition of anonymity. And the corporation’s response to the row was feeble at best, enabling conservative critics to advance their long-running campaign against the broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  Trump celebrated the BBC shakeup on Sunday, but the political pressure over the documentary was just one of many factors at play.\n \n\n   \n  But in a politically poisonous atmosphere with near-daily disputes over coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza; the equally frequent attacks from the BBC’s rivals; and a looming review of the BBC’s license-fee model; it’s easy to understand why Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness both tendered their resignations. A sigh of relief was almost audible in their respective memos.\n \n\n   \n  “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,” Davie wrote. Turness similarly wrote that “mistakes have been made.”\n \n\n   \n  BBC Radio 4 host and former BBC News political editor Nick Robinson spoke for many both inside and outside the organization when he said, one day before the resignations, “It’s clear that there is a genuine concern about editorial standards and mistakes. There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organization.” Robinson’s point: “Both things are happening at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  This all contributes to the fever that Davie referenced on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  He said the BBC board had unanimously supported him throughout his “entire tenure, including during recent days,” indicating he was not forced out. And he said “the current debate around BBC News” was just one factor in his departure.\n \n\n   \n  Another factor: The government is currently reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, which is the contract that determines how the BBC is funded and run. The current charter, which expires at the end of 2027, has a license-fee system in which British households pay £174.50 ($230) a year for BBC shows and services. This license fee structure has supported a diverse array of programming for decades, but has also opened up the BBC to all sorts of criticism.\n \n\n   \n  Some conservative leaders have argued that the license fee system is anachronistic in the age of Netflix and Spotify. They have also lobbed countless complaints about perceived political bias.\n \n\n   \n  Davie said, “I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.”\n \n\n   \n    BBC faces politically charged media climate\n \n\n   \n  When Davie took charge in 2020, he said his No. 1 priority was “to renew our commitment to impartiality.”\n \n\n   \n  Most of the battles over the BBC relate back to that commitment in one way or another.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, for instance, the BBC removed “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone” from its streaming service amid intense scrutiny of the documentary. The narrator was the son of a Hamas official, a conflict that breached the BBC’s editorial guidelines. Davie issued an apology after a review of the matter.\n \n\n   \n  BBC officials have highlighted and defended the news organization’s exhaustive reporting about the war. Similarly, they have urged people to take stock of the BBC’s coverage in totality — from groundbreaking exposes about the civil war   in Sudan   to thoughtful pieces about Trump’s second term in office.\n \n\n   \n  But all of that risks getting flattened when a partisan media firestorm erupts.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is “blatant propaganda” and “total, 100% fake news,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Saturday in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper, fanning the proverbial flames against Davie and Turness.\n \n\n   \n  The trigger was a misleading edit in “Trump: A Second Chance?” In the documentary, portions of Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech to supporters at the Ellipse were stitched together to make it sound like he had said he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” It was edited together to sound like one threatening sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tone was certainly combative that day, but in the actual speech, his exhortations to “fight” were separate from his suggestion about walking to the Capitol to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  The edit apparently escaped scrutiny when the documentary aired on “Panorama,” the BBC’s flagship current affairs program, shortly before the 2024 US presidential election. But it was subsequently described in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former editorial adviser to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee.\n \n\n   \n    Trump celebrates Davie’s exit\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph, which has published anti-BBC commentary for years, reported on the existence of the memo on November 3, triggering days of controversy in the United Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph published daily follow-ups about the “growing crisis at the corporation,” and amplified many critics, including by interviewing Leavitt. Meanwhile, the producers of the documentary, which was made by an outside production company, remained silent.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his aides treated Sunday’s resignations like personal victories. The president wrote on Truth Social that the BBC executives were “caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no evidence that either executive was involved in the nitty gritty of the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also wrote “thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no indication that the edit was politically motivated. Furthermore, the documentary’s primary audience was in the UK, not the US.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt used the occasion to promote a right-wing upstart channel, GB News, that is sometimes described as the Fox News of the UK.\n \n\n   \n  To borrow Davie’s word, it is a “febrile” media environment, indeed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/health/byheart-infant-formula-outbreak-positive-bacteria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:15:00-05:00","title":"Preliminary Tests Find Germ That Causes Botulism in ByHeart Baby Formula","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Preliminary tests have found the presence of botulism-causing bacteria in two lots of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, prompting a recall and public health alerts.

The New York-based company this weekend recalled two lots of the powdered product.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know about the outbreak and infant botulism.\n \n\n   \n    Infant botulism outbreak\n \n\n   \n  The outbreak of infant botulism has sickened babies aged 2 weeks to 5 months since mid-August. All were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  The cases occurred in Arizona, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials agreed to recall two lots of the company’s Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The formula has a best-by date of December 2026.\n \n\n   \n  California health officials tested a can of the powdered formula that was fed to a baby who fell ill. The results “suggest the presence” of the type of bacteria that produces the botulism toxin confirmed in other cases. It can take several days to confirm the results.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials said that “more testing is needed” to know whether the type of bacteria that causes botulism is present. It comes from a large family of bacteria, many of which are found naturally in the environment and don’t cause illness, the company said.\n \n\n   \n  “We take this very seriously,” it said in a statement Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA is investigating reports of 83 cases of infant botulism reported since August including the cases linked to Byheart baby formula.\n \n\n   \n    Causes of infant botulism\n \n\n   \n  Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacteria that produces toxins in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.\n \n\n   \n  Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable and can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel “floppy” and can have problems swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.\n \n\n   \n  “This would be extremely rare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Infant botulism treatment\n \n\n   \n  The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.\n \n\n   \n  All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said.\n \n\n   \n    Potential impact on U.S. formula supplies\n \n\n   \n  There is no danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  That’s different that the crisis caused when formula produced by Abbott was linked to infant deaths and illnesses in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  That product was contaminated with a different germ that can cause severe illness and death in babies. Because Abbott is one of the top manufacturers of infant formula in the U.S., the closure of its manufacturing plant in Michigan triggered massive shortages of formula across the U.S.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company’s packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing “areas that still require corrective actions.”\n \n\n   \n    Reviewing infant formula ingredients\n \n\n   \n  Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul  the U.S. food supply  and are taking a new look at  infant formula .\n \n\n   \n  Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the Food and Drug Administration  to review  the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies.\n \n\n   \n  The effort, dubbed “Operation Stork Speed,” is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998.\n \n\n   \n  FDA officials are reviewing comments from industry, health experts and public to decide next steps.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/uk/bbc-leaders-resign-amid-scandal-over-trump-speech-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"16:07:00-05:00","title":"BBC Leaders Resign Amid Scandal Over Misleading Edit of Trump Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two senior BBC executives, Director General Tim Davie and News Division Chief Deborah Turness, resigned amid a major scandal over the BBC’s alleged misleading editing of a Donald Trump speech from January 6, 2021.

EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two top leaders at the BBC resigned on Sunday amid an escalating scandal over impartiality and bias that plunged Britain’s public broadcaster into one of its biggest crises in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s most senior executive, director general Tim Davie, and the chief executive of the news division, Deborah Turness, both quit after the leak of a deeply critical memo that, among other things, revealed that the BBC had misleadingly edited a speech by US President Donald Trump to make it appear that he had directly called for violence on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In a note to staff on Sunday afternoon, Davie said his resignation was “entirely my decision.” He added that as director general, he took “ultimate responsibility” for mistakes made by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  Turness said the controversy over a documentary made by the BBC’s “Panorama” series had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  The resignations come after the Telegraph newspaper published details of a leaked internal BBC dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines.\n \n\n   \n  In an internal whistleblowing memo, Prescott revealed that last year the BBC had broadcast a “doctored” Trump speech, making it seem that the president had encouraged Capitol Hill rioters, telling them he was going to walk with them to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Trump said in his speech in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, that “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump welcomed the news of the resignations and thanked the Telegraph for “exposing” corruption, which he called a “terrible thing for democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a presidential election,” he  wrote  on his Truth Social platform.\n \n\n   \n  The allegations led White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt to blast the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine.”\n \n\n   \n  British taxpayers are being “forced to foot the bill for a leftist propaganda machine,” Leavitt said in a recent interview with the Telegraph.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Leavitt posted a  brief response  to X, presenting the headline from the Telegraph article, followed by the BBC article announcing Davie’s resignation.\n \n\n   \n  After the report of the dossier emerged, Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., shared it on X, writing: “The FAKE NEWS ‘reporters’ in the UK are just as dishonest and full of s— as the ones here in America!!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Nandy, the British secretary of state for culture, media, and sport, thanked Davie for his work at the BBC after he announced his resignation.\n \n\n   \n  “He has led the BBC through a period of significant change and helped the organisation to grip the challenges it has faced in recent years,” Nandy said in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch applauded the resignation but said that there is a “catalogue of serious failures that runs far deeper” at the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  “The new leadership must now deliver genuine reform of the culture of the BBC, top to bottom - because it should not expect the public to keep funding it through a compulsory licence fee unless it can finally demonstrate true impartiality,” Badenoch  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is largely  funded  by a £174.50 ($228) license fee paid annually by every household in the United Kingdom that owns a television or watches its streaming content.\n \n\n   \n  As a public broadcaster, the organization is held to standards on its editorial independence and fairness.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC, whose charter  describes  its mission as providing “duly accurate and impartial news” in the public interest, has been pulled into controversy repeatedly over the years.\n \n\n   \n  BBC chairman Richard Sharp  resigned  in 2023 after a report found he failed to disclose his involvement in facilitating a loan of almost $1 million to former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC  faced a boycott  in 2023 after it suspended Gary Lineker from hosting the

\nUpdated: \n        7:49 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Lenny Wilkens, a three-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame who was enshrined as both a player and a coach, has died, his family said Sunday. He was 88.\n \n\n   \n  The family said Wilkens was surrounded by loved ones when he died and did not immediately release a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was one of the finest point guards of his era who later brought his calm and savvy style to the sideline, first as a player-coach and then evolving into one of the game’s great coaches.\n \n\n   \n  He coached 2,487 games in the NBA, which is still a record. He became a Hall of Famer as a player, as a coach and again as part of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team — on which he was an assistant. Wilkens coached the Americans to gold at the Atlanta Games as well in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  “Lenny Wilkens represented the very best of the NBA — as a Hall of Fame player, Hall of Fame coach, and one of the game’s most respected ambassadors,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Sunday. “So much so that, four years ago, Lenny received the unique distinction of being named one of the league’s 75 greatest players and 15 greatest coaches of all time.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was a nine-time All-Star as a player, was the first person to reach 1,000 wins as an NBA coach and was the second person inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and coach. He coached the Seattle SuperSonics to the NBA title in 1979 and remained iconic in that city for the rest of his life, often being considered a godfather of sorts for basketball in Seattle — which lost the Sonics to Oklahoma City in 2008 and has been trying to get a team back since.\n \n\n   \n  And he did it all with grace, something he was proud of.\n \n\n   \n  “Leaders don’t yell and scream,” Wilkens told Seattle’s KOMO News earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens, the 1994 NBA coach of the year with Atlanta, retired with 1,332 coaching wins — a league record that was later passed by Don Nelson (who retired with 1,335) and then Gregg Popovich (who retired with 1,390).\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens played 15 seasons with the St. Louis Hawks, SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers and Portland Trail Blazers. He was an All-Star five times with St. Louis, three times in Seattle and once with Cleveland in 1973 at age 35. A statue depicting his time with the SuperSonics was installed outside  Climate Pledge Arena  in June.\n \n\n   \n  “Even more impressive than Lenny’s basketball accomplishments, which included two Olympic gold medals and an NBA championship, was his commitment to service — especially in his beloved community of Seattle where a statue stands in his honor,” Silver said. “He influenced the lives of countless young people as well as generations of players and coaches who considered Lenny not only a great teammate or coach but also an extraordinary mentor who led with integrity and true class.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens twice led the league in assists but was also a prominent scorer. He averaged in double figures scoring in every season of his career, except his final one in 1974-75 with the Trail Blazers. His best season as a scorer came in his first season with the SuperSonics in 1968-69 when he averaged 22.4 points, 8.2 assists and 6.2 rebounds.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Wilkens was born on Oct. 28, 1937, in New York. His basketball schooling came on Brooklyn’s playgrounds and at a city powerhouse, then Boys High School, where one of his teammates was major league baseball star Tommy Davis. He would go on to star at Providence and was drafted by the Hawks as the sixth overall pick in 1960.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/usda-pauses-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"15:45:00-05:00","title":"USDA Orders States to Stop Issuing Full SNAP Benefits and to 'Undo' November Payments","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ordered states to halt the issuance of full SNAP benefits for November 2025 and to 'undo' any prior full allotment payments, following a Supreme Court directive that temporarily paused a lower court order requiring full benefit payments.

  \n  By Tami Luhby, Aileen Graef, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:25 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture ordered states to stop issuing full food stamp benefits for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments, after a Supreme Court justice on Friday paused a lower court order requiring the agency to pay Americans their full assistance.\n \n\n   \n  In the  Saturday directive , obtained by CNN, the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits that will provide recipients with 65% of their November allotments, as ordered by the same lower court judge earlier in the week.\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  States that fail to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over issuances of benefits, the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program. Over the past week, the USDA has issued guidance multiple times as lawsuits over the agency’s decision not to tap into a contingency fund to pay November benefits have worked their way through federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  The latest guidance follows   a memorandum  from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal lower court order, and that the process should be completed later that day.\n \n\n   \n  Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday that residents who should have already gotten their SNAP benefits this month will start getting their full payments on Friday. The next day, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that residents who received their benefits are able to spend them, but the state has paused issuing full allocations to additional people.\n \n\n   \n  Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that there’s “no clarity at all” in the guidance and that the administration is causing “intentional chaos.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once we decided to step up and say we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK … we’ve now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money,” Moore said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n \n\n   \n    Legal battles\n \n\n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover  full food stamp benefits , siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The ruling meant the USDA does not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s ruling followed one a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island that directed the agency to make the full payments, reversing his own order from earlier in the month requiring the USDA to tap into its $5.3 billion contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits for the month.\n \n\n   \n  His more expansive ruling mandated the agency shift tariff revenue meant for child nutrition programs to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling in recent weeks that the agency must at least pay partial benefits or, at its discretion, provide recipients with their full allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to provide partial payments — first saying states could issue 50% of the maximum benefit and then revising the figure to 65%. But the USDA warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell last week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n    Providing full benefits\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to the Department of Justice’s filing to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to the USDA’s demand that states should undo any steps taken to issue full benefits, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said on Sunday, “No.”\n \n\n   \n  The state loaded November benefits onto the cards of nearly 700,000 residents on Friday prior to the Supreme Court’s pause, he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump Administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, the filing said.\n \n\n   \n  These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, according to the DOJ. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “In accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina, which issued partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday, said it was pausing the issuance of full benefits in light of the Supreme Court decision. It had hoped to issue them over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “The hard-working people and families who rely on SNAP benefits deserve certainty, not confusion about whether they’ll be able to put meals on the table this weekend and the rest of the month,” North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement Saturday. “I am urging for a swift resolution by the courts and some humanity from the Trump administration so North Carolina families can receive the support they need.”\n \n\n   \n  In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said that residents should continue spending the benefits on their EBT cards, noting the state funded them in accordance with USDA’s Friday guidance before the Supreme Court’s pause.\n \n\n   \n  “If President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court,” Healey said in a statement Sunday, adding that state officials will continue to work to “make sure everyone gets the full benefits they are owed.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is reaching out to other states to ask the status of their SNAP programs.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/science/new-glenn-rocket-launch-mars-escapade","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"16:58:00-05:00","title":"Landmark Mars mission and first big test for Jeff Bezos’ New Glenn rocket is delayed by weather","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, designed to compete with SpaceX, has been delayed for its second launch due to weather conditions, specifically cloud cover that increases lightning risk.

Landmark Mars mission and first big test for Jeff Bezos’ New Glenn rocket is delayed by weather \n       \n  By Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:58 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New Glenn, the towering orbital rocket that  Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin  designed to compete with SpaceX’s dominant Falcon rockets, is back for its second launch ever — this time with a job to send twin spacecraft on a long, winding trip to Mars.\n \n\n   \n  The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket was set to take off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida during an 88-minute launch window that opened at 2:45 p.m. ET on Sunday. But Blue Origin revealed during  a livestream  that cloud cover rolled into the area, preventing liftoff. (Rockets often seek to avoid clouds because flying through one that is electrified can actually trigger a lightening strike.)\n \n\n   \n  “We’re reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt based on forecasted weather,” the company said in a social media post.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin officials previously indicated they have the ability to try again during a launch window on Monday. The weather forecast for that opportunity, however, appeared “somewhat consistent” with Sunday’s conditions, noted Laura Maginnis, New Glenn’s vice president of mission management, during a Saturday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Aviation Administration recently said that it would be  putting a stop  to commercial rocket launches between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. ET, beginning Monday, to ease the burden on air traffic controllers amid the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working really closely with both our partners at the FAA and with the NASA team to ensure that we’re, of course, honoring and respecting the airspace expectations,” Maginnis said.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin’s launch window on Monday would run between 2:40 and 4:08 p.m. ET, according to a news release.\n \n\n   \n    Blue Origin aims to reuse rocket boosters\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin is also attempting to land and recover New Glenn’s first-stage booster, which is the bottommost portion of the rocket that gives the initial burst of power at liftoff, on a seafaring barge called Jacklyn. Much like Blue Origin’s  chief competitor, SpaceX  — which has long been a dominant force in the commercial launch business — Blue Origin rockets are designed to be partially reused in order to drive down costs.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin had hoped to nail its first attempt at landing a booster on New Glenn’s inaugural orbital flight in January, but engines failed to reignite properly, causing the rocket to veer off course.\n \n\n   \n  However, the primary mission of Blue Origin’s January launch — delivering a test satellite called the Blue Ring Pathfinder to orbit — went off without a hitch, prompting the company to declare the flight a success.\n \n\n   \n  But Blue Origin does view safely recovering and reusing its rocket boosters as crucial for its business model.\n \n\n   \n  Maginnis said during the Saturday news conference that working to pinpoint why the booster did not stick its landing in January, and implementing fixes to help it succeed this time around, were the primary reasons Blue Origin waited nearly 10 months to attempt a second New Glenn launch.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve incorporated a number of changes to our propellant management system, some minor hardware changes as well, to increase our likelihood of landing that booster,” Maginnis said.\n \n\n   \n  But, she added, “if we don’t land the booster — that’s OK. We have several more vehicles in production.”\n \n\n   \n  Maginnis declined to specify how many boosters Blue Origin has in production.\n \n\n   \n  The next New Glenn flight, which had been slated for this year but does not currently have a target launch date, is expected to deliver a Blue Origin-designed lunar lander called Mark 1 to the moon’s surface.\n \n\n   \n    NASA Escapade’s Mars mission\n \n\n   \n  After taking flight, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket will set twin satellites on a path into deep space. The orbiters are expected to linger in a holding pattern before heading for Mars next year when the red planet is better aligned for a less fuel-intensive journey.\n \n\n   \n  The mission, called Escapade — short for Escape and Plasma Acceleration Dynamics Explorers — is a low-cost planetary science project funded by NASA and spearheaded by the University of California, Berkeley, with support from commercial companies Advanced Space and Rocket Lab.\n \n\n   \n  If all goes to plan, the vehicles will arrive in Martian orbit in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  Once there, the spacecraft will work in tandem to investigate why the planet began to lose its atmosphere billions of years ago — and to study how its harsh climate may affect future explorers.\n \n\n   \n  “We will be making the space weather measurements we need to understand the system well enough to forecast solar storms whose radiation could harm astronauts on the surface of Mars or in orbit,” said the mission’s principal investigator, Robert Lillis, of UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/americas/brazil-rio-deadly-raid-criminal-gangs-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"17:27:00Z","title":"Behind Rio’s deadly raid: Brazil’s billion-dollar criminal networks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on the violent 'Operation Containment' conducted in Rio de Janeiro on October 28, 2025, targeting the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) gang in the Complexo da Penha and Complexo do Alemão favelas.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Armored vehicles rumbling through narrow alleys. Rifle shots cracking in heavy crossfire. Helicopters and weaponized drones firing from above. Soldiers in military gear engaged in violent combat. Bodies scattered on blood-slicked streets.\n \n\n   \n  These could be scenes from a war zone.  But on October 28, they unfolded not on a desolate battlefield but on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro — a postcard city better known for its breathtaking coastline and lively bossa nova music scene.\n \n\n   \n  “Operation Containment” brought 2,500 police officers, soldiers and snipers up the slopes of Rio’s Complexo da Penha and Complexo do Alemão favelas, home to roughly 110,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  Their target was the Comando Vermelho (CV), or Red Command, a criminal organization that has ruled these hillside shantytowns for decades. During the operation, at least 117 suspected gunmen and four police officers were killed, and about 100 people were arrested. Authorities said they seized 118 weapons, including 91 rifles and 14 explosive devices, as well as a ton of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  The raid followed a year-long investigation into the Red Command and was triggered in part by the gang’s expansion into new territories, a recent surge in violence and an effort by authorities to reassert state control.\n \n\n   \n  Officials called the raid a success. But with at least 121 dead, and early reports putting the toll at 132, the operation drew sharp criticism from local and international human rights groups. It also laid bare a deep divide over how to confront Brazil’s entrenched organized crime syndicates.\n \n\n   \n    Life in a crossfire\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the first time we see blood being spilled for a ‘greater good,’” said Thainã de Medeiros, who lived in Complexo da Penha for 35 years. “But this ‘good’ never comes.”\n \n\n   \n  Now a community organizer and member of an anti-violence collective who works in the favela, Medeiros is no stranger to how the Red Command instills fear in its territories. “You walk around and see people carrying big rifles on every corner, standing by your door with grenades and pistols,” he said. “No one feels safe. And there is always the risk of instability — of another operation like this.”\n \n\n   \n  The gangs also “determine who gets in and operates inside the communities,” said Rafael Alcadipani, a member of the Brazilian Forum on Public Security, a nonprofit civic group. “Internet companies, for instance, need to pay them a fee to offer service in the area. They issue permits for people to build houses — not the government.”\n \n\n   \n  The rise in violence, weaponry and gang control in the favelas has made it increasingly difficult for government officials and police to access these areas.\n \n\n   \n  “The state abandons these communities, and then gangs end up gaining even more control,” Alcadipani said.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s criminal organizations have also extended their reach from the illegal economy to politics through such means as vote-buying, violence, intimidation and the funding of political candidates, as studies and police investigations have found, helping them to become one of the most powerful gangs in South America.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A necessary operation’\n \n\n   \n  Luiz Lima, a right-leaning congressman representing Rio, defended the October 28 raid as unavoidable.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a necessary operation,” Lima told CNN. “What happened that day — 117 criminals killed — happens every day in Brazil. With more than 38,000 homicides last year, “that’s 106 deaths a day,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lima insisted that the public backs a tougher stance and that the vast majority of favela residents supported the operation.\n \n\n   \n  “The people living there are extorted,” he said. “Their shops are extorted. Women are raped by traffickers. It’s unbearable.”\n \n\n   \n  But Daniela Fichino, deputy director of the human rights group Global Justice, blames “a state policy that defines an entire population as disposable.” She added: “Brazil doesn’t have the death penalty, and yet the state acts as if it does — simultaneously finding, prosecuting and executing young, Black, poor residents under the banner of public security.”\n \n\n   \n  The result, Fichino said, is “a perpetual cycle of war that reinforces the very criminal structures it claims to dismantle.”\n \n\n   \n  The debate over lasting solutions reveals the complexity of how criminal organizations have grown so powerful, weaving themselves into nearly every layer of Brazilian society over time.\n \n\n   \n    A faction born from dictatorship\n \n\n   \n  The Red Command was founded in 1979 inside an island prison off the coast of Rio, the Cândido Mendes Penitentiary, where common criminals were locked up alongside leftist political prisoners opposed to the Brazilian military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. In the harsh conditions there, what began as an informal alliance for protection soon became an organized network.\n \n\n   \n  One of its founders, William da Silva Lima, spent more than 30 years behind bars after being convicted of armed robbery, extortion and kidnapping. In prison, he became a spokesman for other inmates and negotiated with authorities.\n \n\n   \n  The deplorable conditions inside the nineteenth-century Cândido Mendes — long known among inmates as the “Cauldron of Hell” — pushed prisoners to organize in resistance, da Silva Lima wrote in his 2010 book, recounting the origin of the Red Command and his part in creating the Brazilian organized crime group.\n \n\n   \n  When political prisoners were released in 1979, da Silva Lima wrote, members of what was then called the Falange Vermelha  or Red Phalanx, began orchestrating mass prison breaks and investing in the burgeoning cocaine trade.\n \n\n   \n  By 1985, the Red Command controlled roughly 70% of all drug-selling points in Rio — and the city’s deadly turf wars with other factions began.\n \n\n   \n  According to Márcio Sérgio Christino, a São Paulo state criminal prosecutor and author of a book on the gangs, while the Red Command is Brazil’s oldest faction, it is not the biggest — although its recent expansion shows it aims to achieve that goal. Its main obstacle is not the police or the government, he said, but a competing faction: bigger, better organized and highly influential in South America.\n \n\n   \n    Brazil’s biggest underground empire: The PCC\n \n\n   \n  Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), or First Capital Command, is a criminal organization created in 1993 that also has its genesis in a prison — the Taubaté Penitentiary in São Paulo. Its founders were survivors of the Carandiru massacre the year before, when 111 inmates were killed by military police.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until February 2001 that the group revealed its full reach. In what became known as the “big rebellion,” PCC members coordinated uprisings in 29 prisons simultaneously. About 27,000 inmates were involved, leaving at least 16 killed and 77 injured, among those incarcerated and police officers. At the end of the 27-hour uprising, the flag of the PCC — black and white, some accompanied by handmade signs reading “peace and justice” — was raised across São Paulo’s penitentiaries. The message was clear: the state had lost control.\n \n\n   \n  “At first, their focus was … controlling the prison environment,” Christino explained. “Then they began to grow, to organize, and one of their main pillars became the drug trade.”\n \n\n   \n  To obtain a higher-quality supply of cocaine, the PCC expanded into Brazil’s border states with Bolivia and Paraguay — two of South America’s main cocaine sources. With the US market already dominated by Mexico and Colombia, cocaine producers in landlocked Bolivia focused on reaching Europe, and a deal was struck.\n \n\n   \n  “Bolivia agreed to sell only to the PCC,” Christino said. “In return, the PCC handled transport, logistics and sales — to Europe, Africa, and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n    From friends to rivals\n \n\n   \n  Until then, the Red Command and PCC were not enemies. But their fragile coexistence collapsed once the Red Command, blocked from Bolivia, turned to Peru and built a cocaine trade that operates almost entirely within Brazil. Notably, the gang came to dominate supply routes through the northern part of the country, using the major rivers and their tributaries of the Amazon region.\n \n\n   \n  Competition over these routes ignited a series of prison riots and massacres across northern Brazil, Christino said.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at those uprisings — dozens, sometimes hundreds of deaths, even cannibalism — that was all about the routes,” he said. “It was a territorial war.”\n \n\n   \n  The syndicates now clash for control of Brazil’s highways, rivers and prisons as they branch out into other criminal realms.\n \n\n   \n  A 2025 study by the Brazilian Forum on Public Security found that gangs such as the Red Command and PCC generated 146.8 billion Brazilian reais ($27 billion) in 2022 through the illegal trade of gold, fuel, alcohol and cigarettes — nearly 10 times more than from cocaine trafficking, which was estimated at 15 billion reais ($2.8 billion).\n \n\n   \n  They also engage in money laundering and invest in construction firms, transport companies, fuel distributors and even crypto markets to wash billions of reals in illicit profits.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the command centers: An ongoing battle\n \n\n   \n  Investigations by the Public Ministry of Rio de Janeiro show that gang leaders continue to issue orders from behind bars — through coded messages, letters and encrypted apps.\n \n\n   \n  While high-risk inmates have been isolated in individual cells, the flow of information never truly stops, said Christino. “There’s no such thing as absolute isolation,” he said. “Cellphones still get in, and when they don’t, messages travel through lawyers or visitors. There’s always a way.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, the Federal District’s Secretariat of Penitentiary Administration said that “intelligence units operate in close coordination with other security forces and the judiciary to monitor faction-linked inmates.” They work to determine an inmate’s position in the hierarchy and isolate leaders “to prevent them from issuing orders,” the secretariat said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite these measures, investigators acknowledge that Brazil’s penitentiaries remain the backbone of command and communication for its largest criminal organizations — a paradox that the state struggles to contain.\n \n\n   \n  “The state’s militarized response only strengthens the factions,” Alcadipani said. “Each operation kills dozens, but the leadership remains. For every man who dies, another fills the gap … What we have now is reactive — a war without an endgame.”\n \n\n   \n  “We were about to launch a partnership with UNICEF” to help favela youth enter the job market, said Medeiros, the community organizer. Career fairs were scheduled for the day after the deadly operation in the Rio favelas. “We had to cancel everything,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I thought today I’d be finalizing the details for that beautiful day,” he said. “Instead, we were cleaning bodies from the streets. And now, we’re bracing for what’s next.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/asia/philippines-typhoon-fung-wong-uwan-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:05:00Z","title":"Nearly a million people flee and at least two killed as second typhoon in a week slams into the Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong (Uwan), the second typhoon to hit the Philippines in a week, made landfall in Dinalungan, Aurora province, killing at least two people and prompting the evacuation of nearly one million residents across 11 regions.

Caitlin Danaher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:05 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A second typhoon in a week has made landfall in the Philippines and killed at least two people, with nearly one million residents fleeing the looming destructive winds and life-threatening storm surges.\n \n\n   \n  Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan, follows on the heels of  Typhoon Kalmaegi , which killed almost 200 people in the central part of the archipelago nation, as well as five people in Vietnam.\n \n\n   \n  The eye of the typhoon made landfall on Sunday night, barrelling over the coastal municipality of Dinalungan, in the northeastern Aurora province, according to the country’s weather service.\n \n\n   \n  Civil defense reported that one person drowned in Catanduanes province and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris of a collapsed home in Catbalogan City, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Almost 920,000 residents were evacuated from 11 regions on Sunday, according to the country’s Presidential Communications Office.\n \n\n   \n  “People are a little shellshocked,” Butch Meily, president of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF), told CNN, noting this marks the country’s fourth major typhoon, in addition to  two earthquakes , within the past seven weeks.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re getting ready but this is starting to test our level of experience.”\n \n\n   \n  Fung-wong is forecast to strike eastern and northern areas, including Luzon – the nation’s most populous island, home to Manila – as well as the Visayas islands and Siargao, known as the country’s surfing capital.\n \n\n   \n  Its destructive winds have already caused damage in Catanduanes province on its approach, according to Meily.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re in red alert,” the Philippines’ Social Welfare Secretary, Rex Gatchalian, told CNN Newsroom.\n \n\n   \n  Thousands of families are sheltering in gymnasiums, theaters and government facilities and the government is providing food and essentials, Gatchalian said.\n \n\n   \n  ﻿“For families who are still in their homes, they’re being forcibly evacuated already,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Recovery efforts have been interrupted in Kalmaegi-stricken Cebu and Davao to the south, to concentrate all available resources on preparing for Fung-wong, including a 24-hour operation center near the capital Manila, said Meily of the PDRF, a major private-sector coordinator for disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  “But our funds are starting to get exhausted because of the number of emergencies,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s meteorological agency PAGASA has upgraded Fung-wong to a super typhoon on its intensity scale, recording maximum wind speeds of 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of 230 kph (143 mph). However, it remains below the super-typhoon threshold on more widely used scales like that of the US Joint Typhoon Warning Center, which requires winds exceeding 240 kph (150 mph).\n \n\n   \n  The typhoon’s massive circulation, spanning 1,800 km (1118 miles), is enough to cover the entire country, exceeding Typhoon Kalmaegi, PAGASA weather specialist Benison Estareja told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s much stronger, but the casualties and the damages all depend on the preparation of the Philippine government. And we’ve actually learned from the previous Typhoon Kalmaegi as to how we can prepare for the incoming super typhoon,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Landslides and severe flooding are expected along Luzon’s east coast, with more than 200 mm of rainfall in the next 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n  Manila is also forecast to face heavy rain and a high risk of flooding, with up to 200 mm, according to the country’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.\n \n\n   \n  More than 300 domestic and international flights have been canceled, according to the Philippines’ Civil Aviation Authority.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is no stranger to typhoons, and Fung-wong is the 21st named storm to impact the country this year, according to local officials.\n \n\n   \n    No pause for relief\n \n\n   \n  Its predecessor Kalmaegi left a trail of death and devastation as it tore through the central Philippines on Tuesday, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and displacing tens of thousands of people. At least 188 people were killed, most in Cebu province, a tourist hotspot, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  Though not the strongest storm to hit, Kalmaegi was slow-moving and dumped huge volumes of water over highly populated areas. Officials said most people died from drowning.\n \n\n   \n  Its impact was worsened by clogged waterways in an already flood-prone area, and an apparent lack of understanding of early warnings, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV, deputy administrator for the Philippines Office of Civil Defense, told local media.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is one of Asia’s most flood-prone countries but this year it has also been mired in a massive corruption scandal involving flood control projects that have brought thousands of protesters onto the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of legislators, senators and construction companies have been accused of receiving kickbacks with money intended for thousands of flood control projects.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have  long warned  the human-caused climate crisis – for which industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility – has only exacerbated the scale and intensity of regional storms that disproportionately impact populations in the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is one area where the weather is changing, with more intense storms and severe tropical storms with a wide rain band, Meily said.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past, we used to focus on where the storm would make landfall. But now we have to consider the rain band because it’s so wide in scope that areas far away from where the storm makes land are getting flooded.”\n \n\n   \n  The western Pacific is the most active tropical basin on Earth but global ocean temperatures have been at record levels for each of the last eight years.\n \n\n   \n  Hotter oceans, fueled by  human-caused global warming , provide ample energy for storms to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  The climate crisis is supercharging rainfall events as warmer air can hold more moisture, which it then wrings out over towns, cities and communities, as it already has this week in Southeast Asia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/government-shutdown-reopen-deal-senate","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"19:53:00-05:00","title":"Senate reaches deal to extend government funding in major sign shutdown is poised to end","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A critical group of eight Senate Democratic centrists reached a bipartisan deal with Republican leaders and the White House to end a historic government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — by extending federal funding until January.

It is unclear whether that bill would pass the Senate, let alone make it to the House floor.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate is expected to vote on the deal beginning between 8:30 and 9 p.m. ET Sunday, according to a GOP aide.\n \n\n   \n  At least eight Senate Democrats have agreed to vote for the deal, which was brokered Sunday night between three former governors — Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Angus King of Maine and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire — along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House.\n \n\n   \n  One of those Democrats is Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who represents thousands of federal workers in the state and who said he supports the GOP’s promise for a future vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said of GOP senators who choose not to support extending the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  And importantly for Kaine, Democrats also secured an agreement from the White House to reverse its mass firings of federal workers during the shutdown, as well as protections against them happening the rest of this fiscal year. It also guarantees all federal workers will be paid for time during shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democratic leaders have not yet said whether they support the deal, with the caucus engaged in a closed-door meeting for several hours on Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  But some liberal senators have fiercely opposed the plan, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s no deal without health care,” Blumenthal said, voicing a widespread sentiment in the Democratic caucus. “So far as I’m concerned, health care isn’t included, and so I’ll be a no.”\n \n\n   \n  Even some centrist-leaning Democrats, like Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, were voicing concerns with the idea on Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  “I was involved for many weeks, and then over the last couple of weeks, it changed — last week it changed,” Slotkin said, noting that she was no longer involved in talks in recent days. “But I always said, like, it’s got to do something concrete on health care, and it’s hard to see how that happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Across the Capitol, House Democratic leaders sharply condemned the deal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his caucus “will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” adding: “We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives.”\n \n\n   \n  House Democrats plan to have their own caucus huddle on Monday, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislation would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture. That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate would first vote to take up the House-passed stopgap measure, which means eight Democrats would need to support it for it to advance. Then, the Senate would amend that bill with the larger funding package negotiated between the two parties.\n \n\n   \n  If the bill passes the Senate, it will have to go back to the House for final passage to send it to President Donald Trump’s desk in order to reopen the government. The process could take several more days.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s not clear whether the Senate’s plan can survive the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson has extremely narrow margins and Democrats  —  led by Jeffries  —  have already vowed to oppose it.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who has voted on the GOP funding plan throughout the shutdown and criticized his own party’s stance, said Sunday that it is time to ”take the win.”\n \n\n   \n  Vote yes, he said, “and then we can find a way to lower our costs about health care.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/flight-delays-cancellations-tracker-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"13:02:00-05:00","title":"Tracking US flight delays and cancellations in charts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Airlines across the U.S. have cut domestic flights by 4% at 40 of the busiest airports following a directive from the Federal Aviation Administration, amid concerns over a prolonged government shutdown.

Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier killed more than a decade ago in Gaza, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed in the final days of the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas and his body has been held in Gaza since then.\n \n\n   \n  “We brought Lt. Hadar Goldin - our son, a fighter - to be buried in Israel,” his father, Simcha Goldin, said in a televised statement outside their home in Kfar Saba on Sunday evening. “We do not abandon soldiers on the battlefield, because this is a value and we don’t compromise on values. Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.”\n \n\n   \n     Following the burial ceremony in Israel on Sunday, his mother, Leah Goldin, said, “The first is the value of friendship and comradeship, the second is the right to burial in Israel, and the third is human dignity. Sadly, we faced many disappointments. We cannot give up on who we are, and we will prevail through our values.”\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s return “provides some measure of comfort to a family that has lived with agonizing uncertainty and doubt for over 11 years,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, “I know the anguish that his family has endured. I know the pain and the solidarity that have united the entire people of Israel. And today, we are united in the knowledge that we have finally brought him back to his parents and to his family.”\n \n\n   \n  As with previous hostage returns, Hamas handed what it said was Goldin’s body to the the International Red Cross, which then transferred it to the Israeli military. The handover was part of the ceasefire agreement that brought the worst of the fighting in Gaza to an end a month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s family has spent years campaigning for his return, citing Israel’s commitment to the principle of leaving no one behind in conflict. The international campaign for the return of hostages taken during the Hamas-led terror attack on October 7, 2023, put a new spotlight on their fight.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed on August 1, 2014, just days before Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza. He was 23 years old, one of 68 Israeli soldiers killed during the month-and-a-half-long war.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in that conflict, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire, Hamas was required to return all hostages, including the bodies of those who had been killed.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has previously assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The return of Goldin’s body leaves four deceased hostages still in Gaza. Three are Israelis who were killed on October 7, 2023, and whose bodies were taken to Gaza. The fourth is a Thai citizen who was kidnapped during the attack. The Thai government said in May 2024 that he was presumed dead.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/sport/football-nfl-former-commissioner-paul-tagliabue-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"13:30:00Z","title":"Longtime NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue Dies at 84","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Tagliabue, the former commissioner of the NFL from 1989 to 2006, has died at the age of 84 from heart failure.

who helped bring labor peace and riches to the  NFL  during his 17 years as  commissioner  but was criticized for not taking stronger action on concussions, died Sunday from heart failure at 84 years old.\n \n\n   \n  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Tagliabue’s family informed the league of his death in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue, who had developed Parkinson’s disease, was commissioner after Pete Rozelle from 1989 to 2006. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of a special centennial class in 2020. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell succeeded Tagliabue.\n \n\n   \n  “Paul was the ultimate steward of the game — tall in stature, humble in presence and decisive in his loyalty to the NFL,” Goodell said in a statement. “I am forever grateful and proud to have Paul as my friend and mentor. I cherished the innumerable hours we spent together where he helped shape me as an executive but also as a man, husband and father.”\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue oversaw a myriad of new stadiums and negotiated television contracts that added billions of dollars to the league’s bank account. Under him, there were no labor stoppages.\n \n\n   \n  During his time, Los Angeles lost two teams and Cleveland another, migrating to Baltimore before being replaced by an expansion franchise.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue implemented a policy on substance abuse that was considered the strongest in all major sports. He also established the “Rooney Rule,” in which all teams with coaching vacancies must interview minority candidates. It has since been expanded to include front-office and league executive positions.\n \n\n   \n  When he took office in 1989, the NFL had just gotten its first Black head coach of the modern era. By the time Tagliabue stepped down in 2006, there were seven minority head coaches in the league.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue certainly had his detractors, notably over concussions. The issue has plagued the NFL for decades, though team owners had a major role in the lack of progress in dealing with head trauma.\n \n\n   \n  In 2017, Tagliabue apologized for remarks he made decades ago about concussions in football, acknowledging he didn’t have the proper data at the time in 1994. He called concussions “one of those pack-journalism issues” and contended the number of concussions “is relatively small; the problem is the journalist issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously,” he said on Talk of Fame Network, “I do regret those remarks. Looking back, it was not sensible language to use to express my thoughts at the time. My language was intemperate, and it led to serious misunderstanding. I overreacted on issues which we were already working on. But that doesn’t excuse the overreaction and intemperate language.\n \n\n   \n  “Bottom line, it sounded like I was shooting the messenger, which was the concussion issue. My intention at the time was to make a point which could have been made fairly simply: that there was a need for better data. There was a need for more reliable information about concussions and uniformity in terms of how they were being defined in terms of severity.”\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue is survived by his wife Chandler, son Drew, and daughter Emily.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/trump-washington-commanders-stadium-name-nfl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"14:16:00-05:00","title":"White House says Washington Commanders stadium bearing Trump’s name would be ‘beautiful’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The White House has endorsed the idea of naming the Washington Commanders’ new stadium in Washington, D.C., after President Donald Trump, calling it 'beautiful' due to his role in enabling the stadium’s rebuilding.

originality transformed celebrity interviews \n       \n  By Yahya Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:48 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Woody Harrelson, the acclaimed actor known for his mellow and jovial energy, was breaking down, barely able to string together coherent sentences because his mouth was on fire from the ludicrously spicy hot sauce that coated his fried cauliflower. Of course, the pain is what you order by coming on Hot Ones, the beloved hot wings YouTube show.\n \n\n   \n  Once it was over, Harrelson still coughing, admitted to  host Sean Evans , “You nearly killed me, dude … and I say that with all due respect, because I know you nearly kill people on the daily.”\n \n\n   \n  Harrelson said that he never thought he’d do the show because he used to think he didn’t have what it took to get to the end of the  poultry gauntlet . “And now, here we are,” he said, victorious.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment, while proclaimed in jest, captures a current appetite among many celebrities and fans alike to break away from conventional interviews in favor of more authentic and flavorful content.\n \n\n   \n  And what else like breaking bread – or chicken wings or, you know,  yeast extract  – has the ability to break that artifice, foster trust and entice celebrities to lower their guards for a playful exchange to which audiences can relate.\n \n\n   \n  “The hardest part of the interview is penetrating all of that artifice to get something real,” Evans told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  Ollie Kendal, one-half of the food content creator duo, JOLLY, put it even more succinctly in a separate conversation with CNN: “It’s the language everyone speaks: Food…Everyone’s got to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  And trust that people eat up the chance to see Gordon Ramsey serenade Evans with his trademark colorful language while chugging bubblegum-pink stomach soother on what has become Hot Ones’ most watched episode, or John Cena stoically brave the potent musk of British Black pudding (blood sausage) with JOLLY as he declares it a sign of sophistication.\n \n\n   \n  Hot Ones, JOLLY and Amelia Dimoldenberg’s  Chicken Shop Date  – with billions of combined total views and tens of millions of subscribers – are some of the most visible examples of the genre’s popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Many descendants have followed, including traditional media companies that are still trying to find new spins on the concept. (See: The NYT’s launch of “The Pizza Interview,” which asks press-touring celebrities to toss some dough while trying not to get their likely borrowed outfits covered in sauce.)\n \n\n   \n  In what is arguably the boom of the feed-the-famous frenzy, a natural question has emerged: Is it reaching the point of being bloated or is there more to feast on?\n \n\n   \n    Spicing up the press tour\n \n\n   \n  Food’s place within entertainment has never been a gimmick. In fact, it’s an interviewing tradition that dates back decades and has taken many forms.\n \n\n   \n  Jessa Moore, a media specialist with experience in food and tech, points out that culinary hosts like Martha Stewart and Ina Garten have featured celebrities on their shows since the nineties and early aughts. Even  I Love to Eat , the first network TV cooking show to air in the US back in 1946, featured famous designer and actress, Elsie de Wolfe.\n \n\n   \n  Morning shows, too, have for decades welcomed celebrities into their set kitchens for early-morning meal-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is entertainment, it’s something you bond over,” Moore told CNN, “Food is culture. People want to interact with each other, and food provides the glue for that.”\n \n\n   \n  In the mid-2010s, the format saw a new iteration of the approach emerge with a gourmet of YouTube shows featuring hungry celebrities – a disruption to what Evans called a “boring,” “PR-driven flight pattern.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hot Ones” mixed up the media blitz. Ten years after its first episode, it is now a desired destination for megastars such as Jennifer Lawrance, Idris Elba,  Lady Gaga  and Shaquille O’Neal, whose reactions to the exponential Scoville levels have been immortalized in internet lore.\n \n\n   \n  “What these food-driven formats reveal is that adding a slice of real life to the interview process (a meal, a drink, or any shared activity) invites authenticity, connection and unexpected honesty,” Lindsay Colker, founder of Elevate Communications, a Los Angeles-based public relations and consulting boutique, told CNN. “And that’s where the magic and the viral moments tend to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Colker highlighted the format’s ability to blur the lines between “press appearance and personality showcase,” which is aided by hosts who are “often culture-shapers in their own right - disarming, conversational and curious.”\n \n\n   \n  “They know how to draw out personality instead of polished talking points,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But she emphasized that food-themed interviews – and the wave of new media at large – are complementary and not a replacement to traditional celebrity coverage.\n \n\n   \n  What’s remarkable about these YouTube food-themed interviews is the fact that the ingredients to their success aren’t concealed in secret family heirloom or fabled recipes; no 11 herbs and spices kept away from the other online creators. It’s a straightforward blend of originality, ingenuity and accessibility.\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY had already invested years in creating food content prior to featuring celebrities in their videos. Josh Carrott, the other half of JOLLY, and Kendal said that getting celebrities to share food and culture away from the “sterile, sanitized junket world,” is not a fading gimmick they’re squeezing for views.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is like the great connector,” Carrott said. “I think over the years, our content has evolved into sharing culture through food.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Like’ and subscribe\n \n\n   \n  Evans likens the growth of food-themed interviews to that of podcasts, which were once relatively obscure but are now omnipresent.\n \n\n   \n  “The landscape is going to shift,” said Evans, “But, overall, if you like interview shows, you have certainly tons of options, and I think at a higher quality now than 10 years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Evans celebrates the growth of the niche from “barren, empty shelves” to a marketplace filled with great offerings, but he also acknowledges the concerns that it might be too much, conceding that audience fatigue is plausible in the midst of what he described as the “boom times” of the genre.\n \n\n   \n  Moore said that no matter how famous a host or a guest is, or how elaborate and slick a production is, an unauthentic product will not resonate with audiences.\n \n\n   \n  Colker echoed the sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  “These types of appearances only fatigue clients when they start to feel repetitive or disconnected from their story,” Colker said. “The sweet spot is where creativity meets comfort and when it feels natural, not performative.”\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY’s approach to content creation has always centered the fans as its North Star, which they try to follow through endless trial and error, as well as excruciating analysis of audience metrics. This includes an examination of the kinds of brands and celebrities JOLLY looks to associate with, the best platforms to reach their audience and even the lengths of videos.\n \n\n   \n  “The focus for us has been: Can we make good content that people want to see?” Kendal said, “We’re not really interested in doing content for content’s sake.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether food-themed interviews have reached their inflection point, let alone oversaturation, is yet to be determined. For now, the proof is in the pudding as more online creators and legacy media outlets continue to add to the loaded pantry of this genre.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, Vogue revived an infrequent online cooking segment under a new title,  Now Serving.  YouTuber Quenlin Blackwell’s rebranded her FEEDING STARVING INFLUENCERS series to now feature celebrities. And across the pond, broadcaster Nick Grimshaw and Michelin star chef Angela Hartnett launched  Dish,  where celebrities enjoy conversations over one of Hartnett’s acclaimed creations.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, other creators and outlets have seemingly started to  abandon the concept. Harper’s BAZAAR’s online series,  Food Diaries , was abruptly discontinued in 2023 after a six-year run, and internet personality, Joey Camasta, concluded his raunchy take on the concept after only one season of  Could I Get in Your Pantry?  \n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Hearst and Camasta for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But as long as the media climate provides the perfect temperature for these shows to grow and expand, and until audiences are satiated to the point of nausea, creators will continue to cook up fresh ideas.\n \n\n   \n  Carrott and Kendal are already manifesting their dream episodes: southern biscuits and gravy versus English tea and biscuits with Matthew McConaughey, and going through the Waffle House menu with Prince Harry.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of a perfect example of what we want to achieve,” said Carrott. “Sharing culture and authentic passion over a meal with someone.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/newsom-democratic-party-prop-50-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00-05:00","title":"Newsom Says Democrats’ Tuesday Wins, Including Prop 50, Represent ‘A New Moment’ for Party","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California Governor Gavin Newsom describes the Democratic Party’s sweeping victories in the November 2025 elections — including the approval of Proposition 50, which adds five Democratic-leaning U.S. House seats in California, and wins by Zohran Mamdani (New York City mayor), Abigail Spanberger (Virginia governor), and Mikie Sherrill (New Jersey governor) — as a 'new moment' for the party.

Newsom says Democrats’ Tuesday wins, including Prop 50, represent ‘a new moment’ for party \n       \n  By Kaanita Iyer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:52 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Democrats’  sweeping election victory  on Tuesday, including the approval of a  redistricting ballot measure  in his state, “represents a new moment” for the Democratic Party as it debates its path forward.\n \n\n   \n  “Clarity, conviction, purpose, energy. On our toes, not on our heels. A resurgent Democratic Party, and it’s a party that understands what’s at stake for our democracy,” Newsom said during a wide-ranging interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in Houston on Saturday.   \n \n\n   \n  Along with the approval of California’s Proposition 50, which creates five US House seats more favorable for Democrats, the party won in high-profile races across the country on Tuesday.  Zohran Mamdani  was elected mayor of New York City, while  Abigail Spanberger  and  Mikie Sherrill  won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom traveled to Houston on Saturday for a rally, during which he touted the win and also credited Texas Democrats for inspiring the push for Proposition 50.\n \n\n   \n  “I think just the energy that the delegation from Texas brought to the Democratic Party, to democracy as a whole, when they stood up and pushed back against (Texas Gov.) Greg Abbott and Donald Trump’s overreach … in many ways that was the beginning of this comeback,” Newsom said to Tapper following the rally.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Texas Republicans moved to redraw the state’s congressional maps to shift five US House seats to the right at President Donald Trump’s behest. The move sparked outrage among state legislative Democrats, who left Texas to avoid a vote. They  ultimately returned , and the maps were passed and  signed into law .\n \n\n   \n  In response, Democrats in California began the efforts to redraw the state’s congressional maps. Newsom, who is widely expected to be a 2028 presidential candidate,  made himself the face  of California’s redistricting efforts and nationalized the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom acknowledged criticism that California made the redistricting process partisan, including from  Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , and told Tapper that he supports “independent redistricting.”\n \n\n   \n  “But you can’t do it state by state with one arm tied behind your back,” he said. “You can’t unilaterally disarm as other people are not playing by the rules.”\n \n\n   \n  After the GOP win in Texas, Republicans have also redrawn seats in their favor in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, and they are attempting to do the same in other states, including Indiana and Kansas.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, following California’s lead, Democrats are seeking changes to maps in at least three other states: New York, Virginia and Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not screwing around. They’re consolidating power,” Newsom said of Republicans’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also weighed in on attending the COP30 climate summit this week in Brazil as the Trump administration has decided not to send a  high-level delegation .\n \n\n   \n  When asked what his role will be at the summit and whether he’s standing in for the president, Newsom said he’ll be “standing in for my kids and grandkids, for common sense, for, you know, our economic future.”    \n \n\n   \n  During the interview, Newsom also reiterated his warnings of the threat he says Trump poses to democracy.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, Newsom claimed, “it’s not about the rule of law. It’s about the rule of Don.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not normal times,” he later added. “The rules have changed and we need to change.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Eric Bradner, Arit John and David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/zohran-mamdani-democrats-online-videos","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"How Democrats Are Emulating Mamdani’s Style Online","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani’s 2025 Democratic campaign in New York City introduced a visually striking, fast-paced online style featuring saturated colors, quick cuts, and dynamic gestures, which has now been widely adopted by other Democratic candidates such as Abdul El-Sayed and Mallory McMorrow.

They might walk and talk through a busy street or store. There’s a warm camera filter, and quick cuts, as they move rapid-fire through a list of talking points and policies.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at how some Democrats are producing content echoing the Mamdani style.\n \n\n   \n    The Mamdani aesthetic\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s videos are instantly recognizable by the saturated colors that help them stand out on social feeds crowded with content.\n \n\n   \n  The videos are also characterized by quick cuts and big gestures — a tendency Mamdani joked about in one spot: “My team says I move my hands too much,” he  says .\n \n\n   \n  It’s an aesthetic that’s worked for other Democrats, including a pair of progressives in Michigan’s Democratic Senate primary.\n \n\n   \n  Former Detroit public health official Abdul El-Sayed scored a hit with a video using burgers to illustrate billionaire excess, similar to a Mamdani video that used mango lassis to explain New York’s ranked choice voting system. And state Sen. Mallory McMorrow earned her own viral moment with a video highlighting grocery prices, calling to mind Mamdani’s bodega tours.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Mamo, a Democratic strategist advising McMorrow and Texas state Rep. James Talarico, another 2026 US Senate contender, underscored the importance of visually engaging content.\n \n\n   \n  “Understand that you’re not just competing against the other Democrats in the primary. You’re not just competing against the Republicans,” Mamo explained. “You are competing against dog videos and sports highlights and Netflix on your other television and someone FaceTiming you and your group chat for attention on your phone and on your laptop and on your iPad.”\n \n\n   \n    The substance: affordability\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s campaign insists that its relentless focus on affordability was equally important to the success. “The style is downstream from the substance,” said Andrew Epstein, a top campaign aide.\n \n\n   \n  “Unless you have a message and an agenda that is directly relevant to people’s lives that speaks to the economic conditions in this country, that credibly presents itself as an alternative to this incredibly broken status quo and the alienation that so many people feel from mainstream politics — it’s not going to work,” Epstein said.\n \n\n   \n  Roxie Richner, El-Sayed’s communications director, echoed the Mamdani team’s emphasis on the issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I think at the end of the day, what resonates with people is the substance,” Richner said, pointing to one of El-Sayed’s  videos  in which “he explained the privatization of the Bay City bridges in Bay City, Michigan, in a way that people understood and that maybe folks in other parts of the state weren’t aware of it.”\n \n\n   \n  And while many politicians have taken to addressing voters’ concerns about affordability, strategists pointed to the importance of getting specific, exemplified by Mamdani’s focus on everyday pressure points like rents and bus fares.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the affordability crisis in this country — it’s, ‘I need new deodorant and it’s $13.99, when did deodorant get to be $13.99?” Mamo said. “If you’re sitting in a bar, that is how you would say that. And if you’re on video, you should say it the same way, if you’re explaining it to your neighbor or a stranger at the bar, it’s the same way you should talk on camera.”\n \n\n   \n    Emulation, not imitation\n \n\n   \n  Soon after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary this summer, rival Andrew Cuomo began producing videos in which he was walking and talking in soft-filter video. Mamdani’s team noticed.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, I want to say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but in Andrew’s case, I think it’s a lot more pathetic than that, frankly,” Epstein said.\n \n\n   \n  Other strategists underlined the importance of authenticity in campaign communications, with candidates across the country from different backgrounds facing a diverse array of issues.\n \n\n   \n  “It has to be real to you,” Mamo said, pointing to the example of California Sen. Adam Schiff. “He’s a lawyer, a professor and an explainer. So their videos are lawyer-professor-explainer, Adam Schiff, lawyer-professor- explaining what’s going on in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  And Richner with El-Sayed’s campaign in Michigan said  Tuesday’s election results  demonstrated the party’s need for talented communicators.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether it was bringing down utility prices in New Jersey, or it was making buses faster and free in New York, I think people are suffering in this moment, and they want to believe that things can be better, and they need leaders and messengers that can show them that,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/syrian-migrants-germany-repatriation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"08:39:00-05:00","title":"Syrian Migrants in Germany Face Uncertain Future as Government Floats Repatriation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany, once a symbol of open immigration under Angela Merkel, is now facing a political shift under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has proposed repatriation of Syrian migrants as part of a broader anti-immigration stance.

floats repatriation \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:39 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Germany opened its doors to refugees escaping war in the Middle East, more people arrived from Syria than any other country – finding homes, getting jobs, starting families.\n \n\n   \n  A question mark now hangs over their future, after Germany’s government – which has  hardened its stance  on immigration amid a surging far right – suggested it could be time for some to return home, voluntarily or not.\n \n\n   \n  Some 1 million Syrians arrived in Germany at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015-2016,  under former chancellor  Angela Merkel. Approximately 1.3 million live in Germany currently, including 25,000 who were born there.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Chancellor Friedrich Merz and other conservatives in his coalition cabinet are calling for their repatriation.\n \n\n   \n  Merz this week said that Berlin would approach the issue in a “very concrete matter,” as he signaled that there are “no longer any grounds for asylum in Germany, and therefore we can also begin with repatriations.”\n \n\n   \n  While the German government will first and foremost encourage voluntary repatriation, Merz said those who refuse “can, of course, also be deported in the near future,” as he said that the return of Syrians to their homeland would be key to rebuilding the war-torn country.\n \n\n   \n  The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President  Ahmad al-Sharaa  to Berlin to discuss the issue.\n \n\n   \n  What’s changed in Syria is that the Assad government  is no more , bringing an end to years of civil war. And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right  Alternative for Germany (AfD)  party.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Merz’s rhetoric, it remains unclear at this stage how wide-reaching deportations would be. Germany has so far only announced plans to deport Syrians with criminal records.\n \n\n   \n  Since the collapse of Assad’s regime, around 1,300 Syrians – or 0.1% - have voluntarily returned to their homeland, according to Germany’s interior ministry.\n \n\n   \n  Syrians live in Germany under varying legal statuses – some have been granted German citizenship, while others hold permanent residence permits. Over 160,000 Syrians had obtained German citizenship by the end of 2023, Deutsche Welle reported. Those who fall into these categories will not need to leave Germany, CDU politicians said during a coalition debate on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands more hold temporary residence permits, which they are granted after receiving a protection status, such as asylum, refugee or subsidiary protection, which applies when neither of the former can be granted and serious harm is threatened in the country of origin.\n \n\n   \n  Temporary residence permits allow foreigners to live and work in Germany, as well as receive government benefits, but mean their ability to remain there is uncertain.\n \n\n   \n  The issue of repatriation is contentious and comes with significant legal hurdles. Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.\n \n\n   \n  “Merz’s comments are heading in a direction that fuels right-wing desires to deport anyone who doesn’t fit their so-called idea of who belongs in Germany and that’s terrifying,” said Rafif Dawoud, a 33-year-old architect living in Berlin, who migrated from Syria over 12 years ago and is now a German citizen.\n \n\n   \n  Dawoud said that while she knows people who have willingly returned, “talking about sending back people who have been trying to integrate, who see Germany as their second or even first and only home, who actively contribute to this society and economy, well that’s an absolute disgrace.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are concerned about a volatile political situation back home. A retired engineer, who currently lives in Germany but does not hold citizenship, described the overthrow of Assad’s government as a “historical necessity” while questioning its replacement.\n \n\n   \n  “We must ask whether the country is moving toward a state that mirrors European and specifically German values, respecting freedoms and human principles, or whether dictatorship and a new totalitarian religious system are simply being reproduced under a different name,” the man, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Since Assad’s ousting, Syria has  seen flare-ups  of deadly sectarian violence, with clashes erupting between security forces and those loyal to the former president, including in Syria’s coastal Latakia region in March.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN, Akram al-Bunni, a Syrian political activist who was jailed under Assad’s regime, said the German government must take into consideration the nature of the country’s new authority, which he believes could expose many Syrians to new persecution. The security situation must also be considered, al-Bunni said, stating that weapons remain “uncontrolled in the hands of extremist factions.”\n \n\n   \n  Johann Wadephul, Germany’s foreign minister and a politician in Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), hinted at some of the problems awaiting Syrians on a recent visit to  Damascus , when he compared the country’s devastation to “images we saw from Germany in 1945 after World War II” and expressed doubt that large numbers of Syrian migrants would return voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  But after receiving backlash from within his own party over the comments, Wadephul has sought to stress that his overall view remains in alignment with his party.\n \n\n   \n  Other politicians, particularly on Germany’s left, have criticized the plans. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Lamya Kaddor, of Germany’s Green Party, said “to believe that mass deportations (to Syria) are now possible underestimates the reality on the ground.”\n \n\n   \n  The Association of German-Syrian Aid Organizations has spoken out against the government’s plans, with its chairman Nahla Osman saying the debate represents a huge blow for Syrians who have integrated into German society, including skilled workers, in a recent interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.\n \n\n   \n  Germany’s health sector, for example, employs over 6,000 Syrian doctors, according to official figures – making them an integral part of the country’s healthcare system. Late last year, then-Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned “whole areas” in Germany’s healthcare sector would fall away if the Syrians who worked there currently were to leave.\n \n\n   \n    Countering the far right\n \n\n   \n  Despite the opposition, it is clear that the days of “Wilkommenskulture” or “welcoming culture” regarding immigration to Germany under Merkel are gone.\n \n\n   \n  The  AfD  came second in Germany’s federal election in February, securing an unprecedented number of votes after campaigning on an anti-migration platform and a manifesto that states that “Islam does not belong in Germany.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the collapse of the Assad regime, the AfD has been calling for Syrians in Germany to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the party has continued to enjoy strong popularity, even temporarily surging ahead of the CDU in some polls, leaving Merz’s government fighting to retain ground.\n \n\n   \n  Merz – who had long been a critic of Merkel’s open-door policies – has taken a tougher stance on migration, in part to counter the AfD.\n \n\n   \n  While his predecessor welcomed migrants into Germany under the slogan “Wir schaffen das” – “We’ll manage it,” Merz and his government  announced sweeping revisions  to migration policy after taking office.\n \n\n   \n  “We clearly did not manage it. That is exactly why we’re trying to fix it,” he said of the situation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/ups-crash-fleets-grounded-investigation-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"08:05:00-04:00","title":"FAA halts flights of MD-11 cargo planes and requires inspections after UPS plane crash leaves community in mourning","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS cargo plane operating a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft crashed during takeoff at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky on November 4, 2025, killing at least 14 people and injuring many others.

Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    MD-11s grounded ‘out of an abundance of caution’\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, the cargo plane’s engine and the pylon, which supports the engine, fell off the left wing of UPS flight 2976 as it accelerated for takeoff, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have yet to determine why it happened, but operators are erring on the side of caution until answers emerge.\n \n\n   \n  “Out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of safety, we have made the decision to temporarily ground our MD-11,” UPS said in a statement. “Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.”\n \n\n   \n  McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft are used exclusively for cargo operations and make up about 9% of the UPS fleet. The company said it had contingency plans to temporarily operate without them.\n \n\n   \n  FedEx, the only other major US airline to operate the MD-11, will also ground them for “a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The decisions come after recommendations from Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS freighter that crashed was a  34-year-old jet.  While that may be considered old for a passenger plane, that’s not so unusual in the world of air cargo and there are no initial indications that the age of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was in any way a factor in the  fatal crash .\n \n\n   \n    NTSB is still investigating the cause\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB will release a preliminary report within 30 days, but it could be 18 to 24 months before the investigation concludes, according to  Jim Brauchle , an aviation attorney with law firm Motley Rice and former US Air Force navigator.\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorders and the engine and pylon that fell off the airplane’s wing have been moved to a secure facility, where they are being examined, NTSB investigator Todd Inman said during a news conference Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The  engine was found lying on the ground  and will help investigators determine what may have caused the crash, according to CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a huge clue and does give the (NTSB) a pretty good idea of what started this all off,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  The  engine coming off the plane  before the final impact and the fireball that followed suggest an “uncontained engine failure, meaning the engine spews out parts,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible pieces flying off of one failing engine could have impacted other key parts of the plane, and the engine likely ruptured the wing fuel tank when it ripped from the plane, she added.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have also recovered two hours of clear cockpit audio from the UPS cargo plane that confirmed the crew completed standard checklists and takeoff briefings, Inman said, before what he described what began as an “uneventful” takeoff roll.\n \n\n   \n  The transcript of the recording will be released to the public in several months, once most of the agency’s reports are completed, Inman said.\n \n\n   \n  Inman also confirmed the aircraft had recently undergone a heavy maintenance check in San Antonio, and clarified earlier reports of the plane reaching 475 feet were inaccurate. Data now shows the jet only climbed to about 100 feet above ground level before crashing.\n \n\n   \n  “The maintenance will be the big issue — what exactly was done to the aircraft, who did it, what parts were replaced, what procedures were followed, and who inspected the work,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators will be particularly interested in which engines or other parts may have been removed or replaced during maintenance, she added.\n \n\n   \n    A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of impacted victims and businesses\n \n\n   \n  Residents living near the crash site and local businesses facing significant economic losses who suffered emotional distress have filed a lawsuit against UPS, Boeing and General Electric.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs accuse the companies of recklessness and negligence, which “upended the lives and livelihoods” of many in the Louisville community, according to the complaint, filed in US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges the Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-11 crash was preventable and the defendants must be held accountable for the “trauma, fear and uncertainty” their actions have caused, according to the complaint, filed by the law firm Morgan & Morgan.\n \n\n   \n  A Boeing spokesperson told CNN the company has no comment about the lawsuit but said it is supporting NTSB’s investigation and extends its condolences to the families and friends of the victims.\n \n\n   \n  “Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved,” a UPS spokesperson told CNN. “We do not comment on pending litigation.”\n \n\n   \n  General Electric did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “This tragedy has needlessly shattered the lives of many in the Louisville community,” attorneys Mike Morgan, Rene Rocha, and Tanner Shultz said in a statement. “We are committed to uncovering the truth and will stop at nothing to achieve justice.”\n \n\n   \n  The suit also highlights the troubled safety record of Boeing’s MD-11 aircraft, calling it one of the most accident-prone commercial planes still in service. The filing cites past crashes, including a fatal 2009 FedEx MD-11 crash in Tokyo, and alleges similar design flaws or defects in Boeing’s MD-11 may have caused or contributed to the November 4 crash.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs argued UPS’ own modifications to convert the plane into a cargo model could have played a role. The complaint further points to GE’s CF6 engines, which have been involved in multiple catastrophic incidents, as another potential factor in the disaster.\n \n\n   \n    Loved ones of missing victims are losing hope\n \n\n   \n  The fire came first with a plume of red flames and black smoke twisting through the sunset. Then came the screams.\n \n\n   \n  Officials don’t believe it’s likely there are any more survivors, and the number of fatalities linked to the crash is expected to stand at 14, Mayor Craig Greenberg announced Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Search and rescue teams have located 13 victims, matching the number of missing persons reports related to the crash filed with police, Greenberg said in a video posted to  X . The 14th victim died at the hospital Saturday, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The plane crashed into Grade A Auto Parts, an automotive part and recycling facility, where three employees  are still unaccounted for. \n \n\n   \n  “It looked like really hell’s fury around her,” CEO Sean Garber recalled, describing a video he saw showing a “huge fireball” engulfing his business as his employees screamed and ran from the flames.\n \n\n   \n  Among the missing employees is John Loucks, a 52-year-old beloved uncle who worked on and off at Grade A Auto Parts for at least a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s scary really,” his nephew Justin Loucks told CNN. “Did he die on impact? Did he land in the woods somewhere?”\n \n\n   \n  “We were told (DNA testing) could take weeks or even longer,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Three crew members aboard the freight plane are believed to be among those found dead, Kentucky officials said. UPS identified them Thursday as Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Aaron Cooper, Lauren Mascarenhas, Isabel Rosales, Dalia Faheid, Jason Morris and Taylor Galgano contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/climate/paris-agreement-anniversary-cop30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"09:05:00-05:00","title":"It’s been a dangerous decade since the Paris Climate Agreement, but there’s still reason for hope","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reflects on the past decade since the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, acknowledging both significant setbacks and emerging hope.

Sutter\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:05 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A decade ago, the world got together and decided to fix the climate crisis by adopting the Paris Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  I remember it like yesterday. This was December 2015 at the UN climate talks in Paris. I was standing in front of a CNN camera as the news came through an earpiece: Nearly every country on Earth agrees to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 — holding warming short of catastrophic levels. A hilariously on-the-nose green gavel hit a desk. The convention center erupted in applause. Diplomats wept and hugged. Even Al Gore managed to not look all that wooden.\n \n\n   \n  My column the next morning trumpeted this headline: “ This is the end of fossil fuels .”\n \n\n   \n  Somehow, it doesn’t feel like 10 years and some 300 gigatons of carbon have floated by since then.\n \n\n   \n  Paris was not the end of fossil fuels, of course. From the perspective of the atmosphere, the last decade could accurately be described as a slow-moving fever dream — one in which pollution from fossil fuels has continued to rise year after year. All those emissions drive global heating and make the planet more dangerous.\n \n\n   \n  And in this dangerous decade climate disasters have continued to intensify — from the massive hurricane that  walloped Puerto Rico in 2017 , to Jamaica this October where  the most powerful Atlantic storm  on record came aground.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a decade in which  new fossil fuel projects continued to be approved  by the very governments that had promised to slash emissions; and one in which the United States twice elected a climate-denier to the nation’s highest office. This fall, US President Donald Trump, after  cancelling billions toward clean energy projects  and  moving to open a swath of the Arctic for oil extraction , bucked the scientific consensus on global warming again by falsely stating that climate change is the “ greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world. ”\n \n\n   \n  Ironic, then, that this has also been a decade during which scientists realized that, if anything,  they underestimated some of the threats of climate change .\n \n\n   \n  Just last month, for example, researchers reported that Earth had crossed one of  its first climate tipping points , with such a massive percentage of coral reefs struggling amid warning that we’re entering a “new reality” in which those reefs won’t be able to recover.\n \n\n   \n  One key goal of the Paris Agreement was to prevent this sort of thing, by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. A group of especially climate-vulnerable countries, calling themselves the  High Ambition Coalition , banded together to push for that target. In Paris, delegates carried the rhyming theme over to wearing buttons that said, “1.5 to stay alive,” a reference to the existential threat warming poses, especially to low-lying areas that are flooding as ice melts and oceans rise.\n \n\n   \n  That “1.5 to stay alive” target, we now know, is almost certainly out of reach. Either  we’ve crossed that line already  or  we’re well on the way . Does that mean we’re “dead”? That we’ve failed to “stay alive”?\n \n\n   \n  No — thankfully, the world doesn’t burst into flames at 1.51 degrees of warming.\n \n\n   \n  We do know that every ton of heat-trapping pollution makes the world more dangerous. But, conversely, every ton of it we save makes the world safer for future generations. Yes, by many metrics, we’ve backslid in the years since Paris. Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org and director of Fossil Free Media, told me that if climate action is  Star Wars  then “I think we’re in the  Empire Strikes Back  episode of the trilogy” — where it all falls apart.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s still possible to adjust the lens and bring other storylines into focus.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve come an incredibly long way since Paris,” said Jean Su, energy justice director and senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. Of note, Su told me, is the fact that world leaders in 2023, at the COP meeting in Dubai,  added language to the Paris Agreement  that calls for moving away from fossil fuels. At that meeting, “we really reached a pinnacle in terms of addressing the root causes of the climate emergency,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Just because Trump thinks climate change is a scam, doesn’t mean the rest of the world agrees.\n \n\n   \n  Henn, the climate activist, pointed to renewable energy as a bright spot. In the first half of 2025,  renewables overtook coal  as the world’s top energy source for the first time. Wind and solar power — which don’t produce the heat-trapping pollution of coal and gas — are  expected to meet 90% of new electricity demand  this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The transition is moving  even faster than people predicted back in 2015 ,” Henn said.  Fifteen times faster , in fact, if you’re looking at solar power installations, according to the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, it continues to be crystal clear how the public feels about this issue: 89% of the global public  surveyed in a 2024 study  favored stronger political action on climate change.\n \n\n   \n  “That is a supermajority,” said Mark Hertsgaard, executive director of Covering Climate Now, the group behind a media collaboration called the  89 Percent Project . “And it’s a [super]majority that doesn’t know that it’s a majority. People in that majority think that they’re 29% of the population. They think they’re a minority.”\n \n\n   \n  But even in the United States, positive trends hold: 79% of registered voters  surveyed in May 2025  said they support the US being part of the Paris Agreement and 75% support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant.\n \n\n   \n  Climate advocates are planning new efforts to make use of this supermajority. Among them is a push for a  Fossil Fuel Nonproliferation Treaty . Alex Rafalowicz, executive director of that initiative, told me the idea for a treaty builds on an  International Court of Justice decision earlier this year  that held nations legally responsible for curbing climate-heating pollution.\n \n\n   \n  “The economics do demonstrate that the transition [to clean energy sources] has an inevitability about it,” Rafalowicz said. “But the question is whether it is fast enough, and whether it is fair enough. That is part of the problem we’re trying to solve.”\n \n\n   \n  A meeting about that treaty is likely to happen next spring in Colombia, he said. Meanwhile, the UN is prepping for COP30, in Brazil, which begins November 10. Plenty of the delegates there will remember that green gavel moment from Paris. I’ll be thinking of it as I watch news from the summit, too.\n \n\n   \n  On the day the Paris Agreement was adopted, I spent hours with the delegation from the Marshall Islands, a nation of low-lying islands in the Pacific that fears being subsumed by rising seas. I’d visited the country earlier in 2015 for a CNN article. I’ll never forget a woman telling me that the sound of the ocean, which used to lull her to sleep, had become threatening after waves crashed through her home and flooded it. Her family had decided to move to Arkansas to get far away from the water and that sound.\n \n\n   \n  The Marshallese delegation in Paris gave me a palm frond ribbon to remember them by. I kept it in my pocket as I relayed news of the agreement to viewers around the world.\n \n\n   \n  It’s sitting on my desk as I type this, 10 years later.\n \n\n   \n  It reminds me that the optimism and the urgency of that moment have not been forgotten.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/europe/ukraine-russia-power-attack-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"06:17:00-05:00","title":"Millions of Ukrainian Face Dark and Cold After One of Russia’s Largest Attacks on Energy Infrastructure","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Millions of Ukrainians are facing extreme cold and darkness following one of Russia’s largest attacks on energy infrastructure, which included over 450 drones and 26 ballistic missiles targeting key regions like Kyiv, Poltava, and Dnipropetrovsk.

Ukrainian face dark and cold after one of Russia’s largest attacks on energy infrastructure \n       \n  By Daria Tarasova-Markina and Tim Lister, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:17 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Millions of Ukrainians are enduring cold temperatures and darkness after a wave of Russian attacks against energy facilities caused widespread power outages across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian authorities have warned that the large scale of the damage means it will take time to restore energy flows. Electricity supplies across the country are being rationed – with people in the capital Kyiv set to be without power for 10-12 hours on Sunday, according to schedules published by energy companies.\n \n\n   \n  Svitlana Grynchuk, Ukraine’s energy minister, said the attack on Saturday was “one of the largest direct ballistic attacks on energy facilities” since the start of the war.\n \n\n   \n  She said that emergency power cuts were implemented across almost all regions to stabilise the network. “We then switched to hourly power cuts, so that consumers could more easily plan their activities around the outages,” Grynchuk said.\n \n\n   \n  The attack over the weekend came just as temperatures in Ukraine began to drop to single digits degrees Celsius. Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on numerous occasions since it launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, usually stepping up attacks around this time of the year.\n \n\n   \n  These frequent disruptions have forced Ukrainians to adapt – diesel generators have become a common sight across the country and people have become accustomed to scheduling their lives around planned outages.\n \n\n   \n  Many families are now scheduling cooking and homework time around the power schedules, and elderly people not leaving their homes in fear of getting stuck without an access to the lift.\n \n\n   \n    Russia strikes when people are asleep\n \n\n   \n  Nine Ukrainian regions came under attack overnight into Saturday, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n \n\n   \n  At least 15 civilians have been killed by Russian strikes over the weekend, according to Ukrainian local authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed and 12 injured when a Russian drone struck a nine-story apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro.  Video captured  the moment the drone struck in the darkness.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s nothing here, just ordinary buildings,” said a woman who gave her name as Maia.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how I survived, because all the shrapnel flew onto the bed where I was sleeping,” said Larysa, another resident of the building.\n \n\n   \n  “We gathered quickly and started to go downstairs. People were screaming. You could already hear screams from the street,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Of the 45 missiles fired by Russia overnight Saturday, some of which were ballistic weapons, the Ukrainian air force said only nine had been intercepted. Some 450 drones were also launched.\n \n\n   \n  “26 missiles and 52 strike UAVs (drones) have been recorded hitting 25 locations,” it said, with many of the attacks occurring in the central regions of Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk as well as Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  “It is extremely difficult to counter ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles,” Zelensky said in his daily address later Saturday. “Only a few systems in the world are capable of intercepting such missiles effectively – and to protect our entire territory, we need far more of these systems and far more of the missiles for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian president said Kyiv was working with the US to purchase additional Patriot air defense systems, which have proved capable in intercepting Russian missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has requested more help from allies to replenish its air defenses, as well as longer-range missiles to attack Russian energy and military facilities. Its request for US Tomahawk missiles was turned down by President Donald Trump last month.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s defense ministry said the strikes had come in response to Ukrainian attacks, and had included Kinzhal ballistic missiles and other weapons in strikes against “enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex and gas and energy facilities of Ukraine that supported their operations.”\n \n\n   \n  The frequent attacks on energy have seriously damaged Ukrainian gas production. Ukrainian officials have said they’ll have to turn to expensive imports of European gas to make up the shortfall.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the enemy’s plans, Ukraine will have light and heat this winter,” said energy minister Grynchuk.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military and security services  have also stepped up  drone and missile attacks against Russian refineries and other infrastructure such as pipelines and pumping stations in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, Ukrainian drones carried out what one Russian official described as a “massive attack” on energy facilities in the Volgograd region, a frequent target of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  A substation was hit, according to Andrey Bocharov, the regional governor, who said power was restored several hours after the strike.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/asia/malaysia-thailand-migrant-boat-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"04:38:00-05:00","title":"Migrant vessel sinks off Malaysia-Thailand border, hundreds missing","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A migrant vessel sank off the Thailand-Malaysia border on November 9, 2025, after carrying approximately 300 people from Buthidaung, Myanmar, including Rohingya, Bangladeshi, and other ethnic groups.

That name got it roasted. \n       \n  By Chris Lau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A Chinese coffee chain has apologized and changed its name after state media roasted it for misusing a word revered by the nation’s communist government.\n \n\n   \n  People’s Cafe decorates most of its branches in bright red, often with a star on their storefront, evoking a very Chinese Communist Party aesthetic – as well as using a typeface inspired by the calligraphy of China’s first communist leader, Mao Zedong.\n \n\n   \n  The company issued an apology Saturday, days after state media singled it out for riding on the “gimmick economy.”\n \n\n   \n  As in many officially communist states, the term “people” – or “renmin,” in Mandarin – is deployed liberally but earnestly by the Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s official name is the People’s Republic of China, with many authoritative institutions also deploying the prefix, including its military, the People’s Liberation Army; its currency, the renminbi; and even the Communist Party mouthpiece that criticized the cafe.\n \n\n   \n  The term “carries a distinct public character and profound political connotations, embodying specific social sentiments and public interests,” the People’s Daily wrote in an opinion article Thursday, adding that the term “must not be profaned, nor can it be misused.”\n \n\n   \n  “Marketing can be creative, but it must not cross the bottom line,” it wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Pictures circulated on Chinese social media show the cafe’s patrons being served drinks sprinkled with “China” on the top. The slogan “Tell China’s story with coffee” adorned the walls and facades of some branches.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, Yao Chao People’s Cafe, which has about 30 outlets across the country, according to state media, issued an apology on social media.\n \n\n   \n  “We extend our sincerest apologies to every consumer who has been hurt,” it said, adding that after “deep reflection” it had taken “proactive steps” to rectify the situation.\n \n\n   \n  The chain said it would add “Yao Chao” back to the name of all shops in mainland China to reflect its legally registered moniker, although branches overseas will remain People’s Cafe, as well as in the semi-autonomous cities of Hong Kong and Macao.\n \n\n   \n  The chain also faced a chiding on social media. “Not a very smart move,” one user wrote on X-like platform Weibo.\n \n\n   \n  Another wrote: “Isn’t that in breach of the law? Shouldn’t it be suspended and reorganized?”\n \n\n   \n  The chain’s rapid expansion in recent years – alongside bigger local coffee makers such as Luckin Coffee – highlights rising demand for a brew in the nation of 1.4 billion people, traditionally dominated by tea.\n \n\n   \n  The market has also become increasingly cut-throat with cheaper options from local makers squeezing foreign chains such as Starbucks, once a symbol of status and Western influence in a more affluent China.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, the Seattle-founded coffee giant  announced  that it would sell the controlling stake of its more than 8,000 outlets in China to a local investment firm.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/economy/stephen-miran-fed-perspective","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"03:00:00Z","title":"The Fed’s newest governor brings a Trump perspective on the economy.

Is anyone buying it? \n       \n  Analysis by Bryan Mena, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Federal Reserve’s newest policymaker has an unconventional perspective on the US economy that’s proving tough to sell.\n \n\n   \n  In September, President Donald Trump appointed Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to temporarily fill a vacated seat on the Fed’s powerful Board of Governors. So far, Miran has participated in two Fed meetings — and broken ranks with the vast majority of Fed officials each time.\n \n\n   \n  At the central bank’s October policy meeting, Miran dissented from Fed officials’ decision  to lower interest rates by a quarter point , backing a larger, half-point cut instead, just as he did in September.\n \n\n   \n  He hasn’t wasted any time to leave a first impression in other ways, too.\n \n\n   \n  In his first month as a central banker, Miran spoke publicly about the US economy at more than a dozen events and media interviews. Fed officials typically do only about a handful of public engagements in their first month.\n \n\n   \n  Like Trump, Miran has  repeatedly called for aggressive interest rate cuts . He has argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that there’s “substantial disinflation” coming down the pike — views Miran proclaims as “out of consensus.”\n \n\n   \n  He reiterated his stance in a Wednesday interview with Yahoo Finance.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone is sold on Miran’s takes on the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “I certainly wouldn’t characterize anything that he’s saying as ridiculous,” David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura, said in an interview with CNN after he moderated a discussion with Miran in Washington, DC. “It’s more of a debate on the inputs that he’s putting into his economic modeling, which are controversial.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think only time will tell if he ends up being right,” Seif said.\n \n\n   \n    Miran’s takes\n \n\n   \n  Miran’s rationale for significant rate cuts is mostly based on how he views Trump’s sweeping economic policies and  his expectation that Trump’s tariffs won’t stoke inflation. \n \n\n   \n  In his first big speech after being sworn in as a Fed governor, Miran explained how Trump’s policies may be contributing to a lower “neutral rate of interest,” which is a theoretical level of borrowing costs that neither stimulates nor dampens the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  Miran specifically pointed to the administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration, the president’s signature tax and spending bill passed by Congress earlier this year, and Trump’s widespread tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  In Miran’s view, that means the Fed has a lot of catching up to do to bring rates back to a more neutral level, and he believes time is of the essence.\n \n\n   \n  “If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” he told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. “I don’t see a reason to run that risk if I’m not concerned about inflation on the upside.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, Miran has said the ongoing mass deportations should take some pressure off the housing market, further lowering rates and resulting in “substantial disinflation.” He has also frequently downplayed the potential impacts of tariffs on consumer prices.\n \n\n   \n    Some pushback\n \n\n   \n  Miran, who earned a PhD in economics from Harvard University, is still widely seen as a serious economist, but his ideas have had some pushback.\n \n\n   \n  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was critical last month of Miran’s debut speech as a Fed governor.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot remember an analytically weaker speech given before the New York Economic Club or given by a Fed governor,” Summers told Bloomberg. “If this was the best case for the radical reduction in interest rates that President Trump has been advocating, then that case is even weaker than I had previously supposed.”\n \n\n   \n  Some Wall Street economists also haven’t been impressed by Miran’s takes.\n \n\n   \n  “We find some of his arguments questionable, others incomplete and almost none persuasive,”Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients in late September.\n \n\n   \n  Miran’s distinct economic reasoning also doesn’t seem to have gained traction with his colleagues on the Fed’s rate-setting committee.\n \n\n   \n  Like other Trump appointees, such as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, Miran agrees that a weaker labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff. But neither Waller nor Bowman have voted for a half-point rate cut, nor have they suggested that the neutral rate is lower than widely understood.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Lisa Cook, in  her first speech since Trump said he fired her ,  was asked last week how she views the interaction between lower immigration and housing inflation, which is a cornerstone of Miran’s economic views.\n \n\n   \n  She subtly rejected that premise, stating “when I’m thinking about immigration, I’m typically thinking about the labor market.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think that that’s the major role that I see in immigration policy,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/aca-enrollment-premiums-increase-impact","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"Skyrocketing ACA Premiums Force Enrollees to Make Tough Decisions","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) policies expire at the end of 2025, millions of Americans face soaring premiums—up to three times their current cost—leading to life-altering decisions.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Late last month, Elizabeth Wick got the email she had been dreading. Her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, told her that the monthly premiums for her Affordable Care Act policy  would soar  to $1,380 next year, up from $862.\n \n\n   \n  Wick, 57, currently gets $400 in  federal premium subsidies , which makes the monthly cost of her health insurance more manageable. But the Arlington, Texas, resident is not counting on that assistance for next year since she also received a letter from the federal Obamacare exchange saying she likely won’t be eligible for any help in 2026 if the enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  The  rising health insurance rates  and lapsing subsidies could upend Wick’s life. A therapist who focuses on sexual assault survivors, she launched a full-time private practice earlier this year but depends on Obamacare coverage since she has preexisting medical conditions. However, having to pay three times her current tab is unaffordable and could force her to give up her practice and find a job that offers health benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “Health insurance will determine what my life will look like, whether or not I can continue with my private practice,” said Wick, who ruminates over the situation before she goes to sleep and when she’s out for her daily walks.\n \n\n   \n    Agonizing tradeoffs\n \n\n   \n  Wick is among the millions of Americans with Affordable Care Act policies who must contend with the looming lapse of the enhanced subsidies. The increased cost of coverage can lead to agonizing trade-offs for many enrollees, including cutting back on other necessities, trying to avoid getting care or forgoing health insurance entirely.\n \n\n   \n  The issue is  at the center  of the stalemate on Capitol Hill, which has led to a record federal government shutdown. Democrats say they will only support a federal funding package for fiscal year 2026 if it also extends the more generous assistance, but Republicans say they will only negotiate after the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  The enhanced subsidies have enabled many lower-income Americans to obtain coverage with no or very low monthly premiums and broadened eligibility for assistance to many middle-class consumers. Obamacare’s original subsidies, which are part of the 2010 health reform law and are not expiring, are only available to those who earn less than four times the federal poverty level, or about $63,000 for an individual and $129,000 for a family of four.\n \n\n   \n  Enacted by a Democratic-led Congress during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, the extra assistance helped spur a record 24 million people to sign up for Obamacare policies this year, with many new enrollees hailing from states that voted for President Donald Trump in 2024. More than 90% of policyholders receive subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The expiring beefed-up subsidies, along with rising health care costs, contributed to insurers hiking rates by 26%, on average, for next year, according to federal data.\n \n\n   \n  But what enrollees will actually pay will be far higher because they won’t have the additional aid. Premium payments will more than double, on average, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  Certain policyholders will be hit harder than others. Those with incomes just above the poverty level will go from paying $0 or nearly $0 in premiums to being on the hook for a few hundred dollars a year, said Cynthia Cox, KFF’s director of the Program on the ACA. Nearly half of enrollees are in this group.\n \n\n   \n  “For them, it’s a lot of money,” Cox said. “It may be a big enough increase that they feel they can’t afford it.”\n \n\n   \n  Also, enrollees in their 50s and early 60s, who already pay a lot for coverage, will have to shell out even more. An older couple making $85,000 a year could see their premiums skyrocket by more than $20,000 a year, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to imagine that many of them will be able to afford to continue that coverage,” Cox said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the situation that Sunni Montgomery finds herself in.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I have fought this so hard. I want to live.’\n \n\n   \n  At 63, Montgomery is facing a relentless battle with lung cancer. Since 2022, she’s undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, relying on her ACA marketplace plan to cover the mounting costs. Thanks to enhanced subsidies, her premium this year was $541 a month — just manageable with Social Security Disability and a part-time job.\n \n\n   \n  But next year, without those subsidies, she says her premium is set to soar to $1,758 a month — far outside her budget.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to face the reality that I am probably going to become a late-stage cancer patient who’s uninsured,” Montgomery said. “I have fought this so hard. I want to live.”\n \n\n   \n  Now on daily oxygen and getting scans every three months, she says she’s at high risk for recurrence. Without insurance, those lifesaving treatments will be out of reach.\n \n\n   \n  “If I’m not getting scans and we don’t know if something’s recurred, then what that can mean is the end of me,” said Montgomery, who is racing to squeeze in every scan and checkup she can before her coverage expires.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Chris and Donna Vetter have made the agonizing decision to drop their health insurance, saying they simply cannot afford it.\n \n\n   \n  Chris, 62, is a retired federal worker, and Donna, 60, runs a small medical billing business. They relied on their ACA plan — reduced to $401 a month by the enhanced subsidies — to manage Donna’s asthma and Chris’ atrial fibrillation. But next year, their premium is set to skyrocket to $1,975 a month — nearly half their income.\n \n\n   \n  They pored over options on the ACA marketplace but say even the cheapest plans hovered near $1,000 a month. Yet those policies “have huge deductibles, big copays, and they don’t cover a lot, so effectively it’s like not having insurance anyways,” Chris said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Vetters, who live in rural Somerset County, Maryland, are bracing for a future without coverage — expecting to cancel appointments, forgo screenings, skip medications, and cross their fingers that disaster doesn’t strike.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just scared, and I don’t know what to do,” Donna said. “If anything should go wrong — God forbid a car accident, heart attack, cancer — we’ll have nothing.”\n \n\n   \n    Planning for the unexpected\n \n\n   \n  Soaring premiums have also left Alison and her husband, Chris, who live in Carson City, Nevada, debating over what to do about their Obamacare coverage. They began buying policies on the exchange three years ago, when Chris, a former police officer, had to retire after a serious injury.\n \n\n   \n  This year, they are paying only $183 a month after nearly $1,350 in subsidies. But next year, their policy will cost $936 after some subsidies. They are contemplating buying a less expensive plan with a much higher deductible, though that will force them to think twice about going to urgent care or the emergency room.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to even be in a situation where you have to think about, well, do I really need it? Do I really need that medication? Do I really need to go to the urgent care? God forbid, do I really need to go to the ER or can I, for lack of a better word, suck it up?” said Alison, who asked that only her first name be used because of her husband’s former profession. “I mean those are all decisions that we’re going to be forced to have to make.”\n \n\n   \n  Younger Americans are also grappling with the increased costs.\n \n\n   \n  Kris McKegney, 23, now pays $300 a month after subsidies for a higher-end plan with only a $3,000 annual deductible. Keeping the same plan would cost him $1,250 a month because he doesn’t expect to qualify for any assistance. That amount is out of the question, said the self-employed accountant.\n \n\n   \n  One option he’s considering is signing up for a $400-a-month catastrophic plan, which would require him to pay for all his medications, doctor visits and therapy appointments. Another is enrolling in a policy with an $850 monthly premium and a $10,000 deductible that would provide more coverage. But the latter would entail dipping into his retirement fund, pausing his efforts to save for a down payment on a house and raising rates on his clients, which are mostly nonprofit organizations.\n \n\n   \n  A Vermont resident, McKegney said health care is important to him because he is transgender. The battle on Capitol Hill over the enhanced subsidies, also known as advanced premium tax credits, makes him feel “degraded.”\n \n\n   \n  “The tax credits have helped millions of people access health care, and it seems very cruel to then take that away,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The enhanced subsidies’ looming expiration led Nolan LeRoux and Emily Clute to contemplate drastic measures to retain at least some assistance. The couple, both 35, were set to get married on Saturday but have considered not filing their license after the ceremony. That’s because they are more likely to qualify for Obamacare’s original subsidies as individuals than as a married couple — the income threshold for a couple is less than double that of a single person.\n \n\n   \n  Otherwise, the Bethlehem, New York, residents are looking at paying more than $1,360 per month next year for coverage, nearly double the total of what they’d pay as individuals for the same plan with some assistance. If the enhanced subsidies are extended, they would be eligible for more aid, even as a married couple.\n \n\n   \n  Since they aren’t comfortable going without insurance, the couple may end up working more to help cover the cost. He is a barber, and she is a tattoo artist. But they aren’t happy about having to spend more time apart as newlyweds to pay for higher premiums. What’s more, the higher tab would also weigh on their honeymoon plans, dampening any thought of going to California.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, though, the stress of not having health insurance would be greater than the concern of how to pay for it since anything could happen, like being hit by a drunk driver, LeRoux said.\n \n\n   \n  “There are not many things health care-wise that are particularly affordable,” he said. “It’d be a lot of stress because I don’t know exactly how we would pay for a medical bill that was in the five figures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/trump-foreign-leader-meetings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump meets with more foreign leaders as GOP grapples with election losses and a shuttered government","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is hosting multiple foreign leaders across Europe, Asia, Africa, and Central Asia during a period of political instability at home, including a government shutdown and poor electoral performance.

A day later, the 38th day of the government shutdown, Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister came for lunch. On Monday, Syria’s president will make an historic visit to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Among the topics the president spent time in public discussing last week: migration policies in Europe, commercial activity on the Caspian Sea, South Africa’s position in the G20, and the energy limitations presented by Hungary’s geography (“They don’t have the advantage of having sea,” he explained). He  hasn’t met  with congressional leadership about the record-long shutdown or offered any constructive solutions, instead digging in on the  filibuster elimination  that’s a nonstarter on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Ten months into his new administration, Trump has placed much of his attention on foreign affairs as he works to end conflicts, secure trade agreements and burnish a presidential peacemaking legacy. World leaders pass through the White House weekly, and the president has made three foreign trips just since September.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an approach that’s yielded successes, particularly in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire the president helped broker in Gaza. But as Republicans look to improve their prospects a year out from critical midterm elections, even some of Trump’s allies are beginning to wonder whether his attention abroad is obscuring the “America First” identity he’s spent years building.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re not going to convince them to go to the polls and vote by bailing out Argentina. And you’re not going to convince them to go to the polls and vote by continuing to fund foreign wars and foreign countries and foreign causes,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said last week on CNN. “You’re going to get them to go to the polls and vote, when you show up to work, and actually fix the problems that they face every single day.”\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia Republican has of late become more critical of some of Trump’s tactics, though she still describes herself as a stalwart supporter. Yet she is hardly alone in questioning whether his attention might be better focused at home, and in particular on the economy, rather than on his endeavors overseas.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s having a lot of success with world leaders, and they all respect him,” one Trump adviser said. “He’s focusing where he’s successful. But people know it doesn’t motivate anyone to vote.”\n \n\n   \n  Even Vice President JD Vance said last week that domestic matters should be a priority.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to focus on the home front,” he wrote on X the day after the election, adding: “We’re going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that’s the metric by which we’ll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House said Trump remained focused on cost questions.\n \n\n   \n  “Addressing Joe Biden’s inflation crisis has been a Day One priority for President Trump, who has already lowered prices for essentials like gas and eggs and cooled inflation to an annualized 2.5 percent rate — half the average inflation rate under Joe Biden,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “As the Administration’s robust economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can count on real wages continuing to increase, investments to make and hire in American continuing to flow in, and for Joe Biden’s lackluster economy to firmly become a distant memory.”\n \n\n   \n  A  CNN survey  released last week found only 1% of adult Americans named foreign policy as the most important issue facing the country; 47% said the economy and cost of living. Trump’s international efforts also did not receive high marks: 56% of respondents said his foreign policy decisions have hurt America’s standing in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the world stage has become something of a welcome respite for the president from the humdrum realities of governing in Washington. Last month in Asia, the president was met with extravagant welcomes, gold gifts and rapid-pace announcement of new trade and peace deals. It was a stark contrast to the atmosphere he left and returned to: gridlocked discussions to reopen the shuttered federal government and growing voter anxiety about an uncertain economy.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has argued Trump’s global efforts are intertwined with his domestic ambitions. His tariff regime, which forms the backbone of his foreign policy, is intended in part to restore American manufacturing and reduce the US trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  But in many ways, the criticism from the president’s allies is not about policy but about the impression Trump is spending far more time meeting foreign leaders or flying around the world than he is attending to economic problems at home.\n \n\n   \n  “Keeping him on nonstop tours around the world and nonstop meetings with foreign countries’ leaders is not America First. It’s just not,” Greene said. “I think domestic policy should be the most important issue that the president and the Republican-controlled House and Senate are working on, and that showed up in the election on Tuesday.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not uncommon for presidents, in their second terms, to turn attention to foreign policy. Without the burden of another reelection campaign, leaders often have a freer hand to focus on issues not necessarily front of mind for voters. Diplomacy can also be an easier occupation for a lame-duck commander in chief than sweeping domestic efforts, which often require congressional buy-in.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential legacies are often forged in the drama of the world stage, such as Ronald Reagan demanding Mikhail Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall or Barack Obama making a historic visit to Cuba. Trump, too, views his peacemaking efforts as critical to his place in the history books, according to aides, and he openly jockeys for a Nobel Peace Price.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, however, the dynamics of his second term are different. He ran for president last year not as an incumbent, but as a challenger seeking to oust the sitting commander in chief. His campaign focused heavily on promises of an economic turnaround for struggling Americans, not the pursuit of a Nobel prize.\n \n\n   \n  When the candidate did make promises about foreign affairs, he often set the bar unattainably high. His pledge to end the war in Ukraine within a day of taking office proved impossible to meet, and he later claimed it was made facetiously.\n \n\n   \n  Since returning to office in January, Trump has hosted at the White House the leaders of Hungary, Ukraine, Argentina, Finland, Canada, Israel, Turkey, Poland, Korea, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Philippines, Bahrain, Congo, Rwanda, Pakistan, Germany, South Africa, Norway, Italy, El Salvador, Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, India, Jordan and Japan. Some have visited multiple times.\n \n\n   \n  He’s also convened summits of leaders from Europe, Africa and Central Asia, and gathered Arab and Muslim leaders at the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  This year, he’s traveled abroad to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Israel, Egypt, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  While the pace of meetings and travel is steady, it does not put Trump on a more rapid pace than his predecessors, or even himself. During his first year in office in 2017, Trump received 35 heads of state for official visits. In 2013, the first year of Obama’s second term, 34 foreign leaders came to the United States for official visits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump visited 13 countries in 2017. And Obama visited 12 in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  President Joe Biden traveled at a slower pace during his first year in office, as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic lingered, and in his final year, as he tried to turn attention to his reelection campaign. But the intervening years saw him visit roughly the same number of countries as Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Biden, too, struggled to balance domestic matters with the two foreign conflicts that came to consume the end of his presidency. And one point in 2023, he estimated 75% of his job was spent dealing with foreign leaders and traveling the world. Aides later blamed intensive foreign travel for the disastrous debate performance that precipitated his withdrawal from the race.\n \n\n   \n  Other presidents have also found that focusing abroad — at the expense of addressing Americans’ economic pain — yields little political return. George H.W. Bush oversaw the end of the Cold War and the first Gulf War, but voters were more concerned with high unemployment and inflation — a disparity his rival Democratic Bill Clinton seized upon when he ran and defeated him.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/trump-administration-supreme-court-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court lets Trump pause full SNAP payments for now","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court, under Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, temporarily paused a lower court order requiring the Trump administration to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for November, citing the need for further review.

payments for now \n       \n  By Devan Cole, John Fritze, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:37 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover  full food stamp benefits  for tens of millions of Americans in November, siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The upshot is that the US Department of Agriculture will not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program by the end of the day. The decision, while temporary, could put at risk the full benefits for millions of Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to feed themselves and their families.\n \n\n   \n  The order does not resolve the underlying legal questions raised by the case – and the Trump administration has already committed to using the program’s contingency fund to partially pay benefits. Rather, Jackson’s “administrative stay” freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson is the justice assigned to handle emergency appeals from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  The legal fight over food stamps has emerged as a central pressure point between all three branches during the historically long government shutdown because it is one of the easiest to understand and most tangible impacts of that impasse so far. At stake is food assistance that nearly 42 million Americans rely on.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the case will ultimately impact the billions of dollars spent in federal SNAP funding.\n \n\n   \n    Complying with the lower court\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s emergency request to the justices came hours after the USDA told states that it was  working to comply with the ruling to fully fund the program  that was issued a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island.\n \n\n   \n  This latest legal move has injected more uncertainty into whether food stamp recipients would see their full allotments anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  The administration had made a similar emergency appeal to a Boston-based federal appeals court Friday morning, but the court had not yet weighed in by the time the USDA sent the guidance, which also said the process to make full funding for November available should be completed later on Friday. The appeals court, in a brief order Friday night, declined to put the payments on hold temporarily while it reviewed the case “as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the administration said, “Such a funding lapse is a crisis. But it is a crisis occasioned by congressional failure and one that can only be solved through congressional action.”\n \n\n   \n  “The district court’s ruling,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court, “is untenable at every turn.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration moved to appeal McConnell’s order after he ruled on Thursday that the government had to provide full SNAP benefits for November, instead of issuing only partial benefits as he had mandated days earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Rushing to fund full benefits\n \n\n   \n  Before the latest legal twist, several states had rushed to start issuing full SNAP payments to their residents. But that has caused problems, according to the administration’s filing to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Sauer told the court that Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards. But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, Sauer said.\n \n\n   \n  These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, he continued. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “Today, in accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.”\n \n\n   \n  Other states have also promised beneficiaries would start receiving their full allotments as soon as Friday or over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania residents who should have already received their SNAP benefits this month will start seeing their full payments hit their electronic benefit transfer cards on Friday, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced at a press conference earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that by this evening, by midnight or so, that all of those individuals who were owed money over the first week or so of this month, who hadn’t gotten it from the federal administration, are going to get their money,” Shapiro said.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that state officials continue to prepare for the Supreme Court’s ultimate decision.

The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell earlier this week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n  “People have gone without for too long,” McConnell said during a hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Under McConnell’s ruling, the government was required to transfer additional unused tariff revenue used to support child nutrition programs in order to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with more details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/russian-satellite-spying-explainer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"04:20:00-04:30","title":"UK and Germany Accuse Russia of Threatening Their Satellites","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany and the United Kingdom have jointly raised alarms over the growing threat posed by Russian and Chinese space-based surveillance and interference, citing repeated instances of Russian satellites stalking, jamming, and spying on Western communications satellites such as those operated by IntelSat.

Here’s what that means \n       \n  By Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Germany and the United Kingdom have warned of the growing threat posed by Russian and Chinese  space satellites , which have been regularly spotted spying on satellites used by Western powers.\n \n\n   \n  The countries have in recent weeks highlighted frequent instances of  Russia  stalking, jamming and interfering with their satellites in space.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s actions, especially in space, pose a fundamental threat to us all. A threat we can no longer ignore,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius  told a Berlin conference  of space industry leaders in September.\n \n\n   \n  Targeting communications satellites can impact things like satellite imagery, telecoms and broadband satellite internet access. Disrupting navigation and positioning systems can impact military operations as well as civil aviation, according to the global think tank RAND.\n \n\n   \n  The warnings come in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now well into its third year. Ukrainian officials say Moscow has increased its level of cooperation with China, with Beijing conducting satellite reconnaissance of Ukrainian territory on its behalf.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what officials and experts say about the satellite threats in space.\n \n\n   \n    What has Russia been doing?\n \n\n   \n  Pistorius noted that two Russian reconnaissance satellites were recently spotted tracking two IntelSat satellites, which are used by the German Armed Forces and its allies. IntelSat is a commercial satellite services provider whose fleet is used by governments and companies in the US and Europe.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia and China have rapidly expanded their space warfare capabilities in recent years: They can jam, blind, manipulate, or kinetically destroy satellites,” Pistorius added, announcing a multi-billion-dollar boost in funding for German space programs.\n \n\n   \n  The head of the UK Space Command also sounded the alarm, saying that Russian satellites are stalking British assets in space, as well as jamming them on a “weekly” basis.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve got payloads on board that can see our satellites and are trying to collect information from them,” Major General Paul Tedman told the BBC last month. Jamming is conducted using ground-based infrastructure. Russia has spent years developing electronic warfare capabilities amid the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte once again warned this year of Russia’s plans to develop  nuclear weapons in space  to disable and destroy satellites.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space. But Russia also vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for member states to not develop space-based nuclear weapons in 2024. China abstained from voting.\n \n\n   \n    How does satellite ‘spying’ work and how is it detected?\n \n\n   \n  In general, it’s relatively simple for space forces to detect and locate foreign satellites, but it’s difficult to determine their exact capabilities and intentions.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities make assumptions about the intent of Russian satellites based on where the satellite is in space, what else it’s near and historical patterns of what similar satellites have done, according to expert Clayton Swope, the deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  For example, if a Russian satellite lingers for a long period of time near a European communications satellite, authorities can infer that it’s there to spy.\n \n\n   \n  Experts believe the Russian satellites that got close to the two IntelSat satellites used in part by Germany were there to intercept signals.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in lower orbits, Russian satellites have previously tested “things that look like weapons and fired projectiles,” Swope told CNN. Authorities can identify satellites that look similar to those equipped with projectiles to determine that they are a physical threat to other countries’ assets.\n \n\n   \n  “The Russians have a history of having those types of satellites shadowing other satellites in a way that people might think it’s a sleeper cell, waiting to strike at a moment’s notice,” Swope said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to distinguish between a threat in the sense of a weapon and the threat in the sense of intelligence collection,” he added. “Sometimes you really are guessing a lot about what the capabilities of a satellite are as well as the intentions of the operator.”\n \n\n   \n  The Russian space agency has previously downplayed the danger of its weapons tests in space.\n \n\n   \n    How long has the threat from Russia existed?\n \n\n   \n  Germany and the UK are just the latest countries to sound the alarm. The United States and France first warned more than a decade ago that Russian satellites appeared to be spying and collecting information on their assets, including on commercially run satellites.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Defense said in 2015 that a Russian military satellite had parked itself near two Intelsat satellites, prompting the US to contact Moscow about its movements, which many at the time described as  “mysterious.” \n \n\n   \n  Then in 2017, after France and Italy jointly launched an intelligence satellite, Russian satellites were soon getting close to it to take a look, according to Juliana Suess, a security policy researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).\n \n\n   \n  “So, these kinds of behaviors are not entirely new, but I think also need to be seen in the context of Ukraine, and to be seen in the context of the  airspace violations  that we see Russia conducting with regard to NATO airspace,” Suess told CNN of the recent reports of satellite spying and interference. “All of these things ought to be seen in the broader context.”\n \n\n   \n    Is China also posing a threat?\n \n\n   \n  China is just as much of a threat as Russia, if not more so, experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Although the threats from Russia are more pressing for Europe due to their proximity, “the much bigger space power is obviously China,” Suess said. Analysts have noted some sophisticated Chinese maneuvers in space aimed at getting close to other satellites, “at just incredibly high speeds and with precision that I think has really raised some eyebrows in the West.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of China’s capabilities have raised international concerns, according to the SWP analyst. For example, China has tested a satellite with a robotic arm that can shift other satellites into a different orbit.\n \n\n   \n  China also has “a lot more money to conduct themselves in space,” Suess said. “We’re not going to see much more space growth out of Russia at the moment. Their resources are far too stretched for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s activities in space are very active and their objectives are more opaque, according to Swope, the CSIS analyst.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t always know what they’re doing, and they’re doing a lot of different things that leave a lot of people scratching their heads,” Swope added.\n \n\n   \n    Is the European response adequate?\n \n\n   \n  Germany said it will budget up to €35 billion ($40.2 billion) over the next five years for space projects.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a big number, for sure. I think it also reflects that there’s a sort of political will to now catch up and, you know, really get things going,” Suess said. But she also stressed that the space race is an ongoing process, with no finish line in sight. “Europe as a whole has a lot to catch up on. Germany certainly has a lot to catch up on.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defense told CNN that its procurement measures relating to space will amount to around €1.9 billion ($2.2 billion) in 2025, “but will grow significantly in the coming years.”\n \n\n   \n  The UK government also announced a commitment to increase defense spending this year and a  strategic review  of British capabilities outlined that “greater attention must be given to the space and cyber and electromagnetic domains.” The UK announced in October that it is testing sensors to detect laser threats in space as part of measures to protect British satellites.\n \n\n   \n  But an analysis from the London-based think tank  Chatham House argued  that even greater near-term investment is needed, and that the strategic review failed to recognize how urgent the threats in space truly are, putting the country at risk of falling behind.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, France has “been very vocal about the need to have what they refer to as ‘bodyguard satellites,’ so, satellites whose job it is to protect other satellites,” Swope said. What those satellites will look like is an open question, he added, with development ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  The US still has a historic advantage in space after investing much more in recent years, analysts said. But European allies may benefit from that through cooperation under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other alliances.\n \n\n   \n  NATO declared in 2019 that space is an “operational domain” for the transatlantic alliance and years later announced that Article 5 would apply in space.  Article 5  is the principle that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all members. Analysts at RAND have argued, though, that  NATO needs to “throttle up”  on its space enterprise or risk falling short at a critical time.\n \n\n   \n  While falling behind is a real concern, particularly compared to China’s advances, there is also evidence that the Russia has not integrated its satellite systems into its military infrastructure as well as many other space powers.\n \n\n   \n  Suess cited an example of a Russian fighter jet downed in Ukraine that was found with a built-in Russian navigation system but also a commercial GPS taped to the dashboard. Analysts have also seen evidence that Russia is procuring commercial satellite imagery from the private market – an indication that its own capabilities are not up to scratch.\n \n\n   \n  “We have seen from anecdotal evidence in Ukraine that Russia does not have some sort of level of confidence that one would typically expect in their own systems,” Suess added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/trump-oval-office-event","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"20:24:00-05:00","title":"Images of Trump Appearing to Close His Eyes During Oval Office Event Spread Across Social Media","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a public Oval Office announcement on November 4, 2025, images of President Donald Trump appearing to close his eyes and rubbing his eyes went viral on social media, prompting criticism from political opponents, particularly California Governor Gavin Newsom, who labeled the moment 'DOZY DON IS BACK.'

He rubbed his eyes at points.\n \n\n   \n  The images drew swift criticism from Trump’s critics. The press office for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the president’s top foils, posted images from the event and wrote: “DOZY DON IS BACK.”\n \n\n   \n  White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CNN that “the President was not sleeping; in fact, he spoke throughout and took many questions from the press during this announcement which represents a historic reduction in prices for Americans on two drugs that help Americans struggling with diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other conditions. This announcement by President Trump will save a significant amount of money and countless American lives, and yet the failing, liberal media want to push a garbage narrative instead of covering it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump appears in public regularly and participates in lengthy question-and-answer sessions with reporters. Aides and Cabinet members routinely praise his stamina and describe receiving phone calls or messages from him at all hours.\n \n\n   \n  A day before Thursday’s event, Trump traveled to Miami for an economic speech that lasted more than an hour. He also completed a three-nation swing through Asia at the end of last month.\n \n\n   \n  Still, questions about Trump’s health have persisted since he took office as the oldest man ever inaugurated to the job. The 79-year-old president said last month that  he received an MRI  during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center without saying why.\n \n\n   \n  Over the summer, the White House announced that doctors examined Trump for swelling in his legs and  diagnosed him  with chronic venous insufficiency. It’s a condition in which valves inside certain veins don’t work the way they should, which can allow blood to pool or collect in the veins.\n \n\n   \n  All presidents, at moments, have appeared tired in public. Even a much younger president like Barack Obama would occasionally rub fatigued eyes during long summits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has harshly criticized former President Joe Biden for a lack of vigor, labeling him “Sleepy Joe” in last year’s election and continuing to use the moniker. Biden, the oldest president in history, was also seen at moments closing his eyes during public events.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/weekend-travel-flight-cuts-government-shutdown-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"10:52:00-05:00","title":"Travelers Face Mounting Flight Delays Amid Government Shutdown and Air Traffic Controller Shortages","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As a result of a prolonged government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has mandated a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest U.S. airports, escalating to 10% by next Friday and potentially up to 15–20% if the shutdown persists.

Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Emma Tucker, Pete Muntean, Hanna Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:52 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Disgruntled travelers across the US will face more disruptions to their plans this weekend, as airlines cancel hundreds of additional flights and delays continue to mount due to air traffic controller staffing shortages amid a government shutdown with no end in sight.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,700 flights have been canceled from Friday through Sunday, data from Cirium shows, as airlines start to implement a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest airports mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n \n\n   \n  But the cuts – which officials say are aimed at keeping air travel safe while some of the air traffic controllers and federal security screeners missing paychecks are not showing up to work – haven’t prevented thousands of hourslong delays that have left flyers scrambling to figure out how to get to their destinations.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t want to be stranded at the airport sleeping on a bench,” Michele Cuthbert of Columbus, Ohio, told   The Associated Press , expressing concern about possible flight cancellations ahead of her trip to Dallas.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next week, airlines will ramp up flight cancellations to 10% by next Friday if the government shutdown remains unsolved. And the shutdown will likely disrupt holiday travel plans if no deal is reached after next week, plunging flyers into “uncharted territory,” said former FAA deputy administrator Dan Elwell.\n \n\n   \n  But travelers can still see flight cuts even if the government were to reopen next week, as the FAA’s order requires airlines to cancel flights days in advance.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know if you plan to travel by air in the coming days:\n \n\n   \n    Why is the FAA ordering flight cuts?\n \n\n   \n  An emergency order by the FAA on Thursday said airlines have to cut traffic by 4%, resulting in about 800 flight cancellations for Friday that increased to over 1,000 throughout the day, according to FlightAware.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, there were more than 1,500 flight cancellations and over 6,600 delays, according to the flight tracking website. More than 1,000 flights have already been canceled for Sunday and over 240 delayed, the data show.\n \n\n   \n  The disruptions are primarily caused by air traffic controller staffing and the FAA order, but also include unrelated flight cuts.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines will be required to cut 6% of their flights to those 40 airports on Tuesday, 8% Thursday and 10% next Friday if the shutdown drags on, the FAA says.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage could rise to 15-20% if the gridlock in Congress doesn’t end “relatively soon,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned in an interview with Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to very much disrupt their Thanksgiving travel plans, I’m sure,” Elwell said about the flight cuts. “And let’s just hope we don’t get there.”\n \n\n   \n  Elwell, who served in the first Trump administration, said flight delays caused by the second-longest government shutdown starting in 2018 “actually brought people back to the table and ended the shutdown back in 2019.”\n \n\n   \n    Why are some air traffic controllers not showing up to work?\n \n\n   \n  The effects of air travel disruptions resulting from the shutdown will likely linger even if Congress makes a deal to reopen the government, as the  transportation secretary says  air traffic controllers may not return to work right away.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA said air control facilities nationwide were short-staffed 42 times on Saturday, according to an operations plan. And problems continue despite the flight cancellations designed to relieve stress on controllers struggling to deal with the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Barker, an employee of the Transportation Security Administration and leader of the American Federation of Government Employees Union, said neither he nor his colleagues are able to make ends meet during the shutdown as controllers miss a second full paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now at the point where today would have been a payday for officers,” he told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on Saturday. “So now I have members who are coming — they’re being evicted. Some of them are already evicted. I have one family who I just learned was sleeping in their car with children.”\n \n\n   \n  More flight reductions – intended to reduce flow and maintain safety – mean the number of air traffic controllers not showing up for work will continue to rise, Elwell said.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to have to make hard financial decisions,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    What airlines have canceled flights this weekend?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines have announced further cancellations to hundreds of flights scheduled through the weekend after more than 1,000 were slashed on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines will cut 220 flights from its schedule through Monday, a spokesperson told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, United Airlines announced hundreds of cuts through early next week, including 168 on Saturday; 158 on Sunday; 190 on Monday and 269 on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Southwest Airlines will cancel about 100 flights Saturday and 150 Sunday to comply with the FAA order, saying in a statement the carrier has already reduced its schedule by 4% through Monday at 34 of the 117 airports it serves.\n \n\n   \n  The vast majority of Southwest flights, however, will not be disrupted, said the airline, which is contacting affected customers directly.\n \n\n   \n  More than 140 Delta and 140 Delta Connection flights have also been canceled. “Additional cancels for Sunday can be expected,” the airline said in a  news release .\n \n\n   \n    How can I get around flight disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  Major airlines like American, Delta, Southwest, United and Frontier are all waiving fees for passengers who want to change their tickets.\n \n\n   \n  Airline officials like Frontier’s CEO Barry Biffle are urging people to book a separate, backup ticket on another carrier if they don’t want to risk being stranded when their flight is canceled.\n \n\n   \n  Try to mitigate any headaches from delays and cancellations by avoiding booking flights with layovers, nonprofit  US Public Interest Research Group  says, and opt to make reservations directly with the airline rather than a third-party website.\n \n\n   \n  Other useful tips for travelers include proactively checking your flight status in case airlines don’t send out alerts; paying for flight disruption coverage or travel insurance with a credit card; and knowing you’re entitled to a full cash refund if your domestic flight is canceled or delayed over three hours, according to guidance from Brian Kelly, founder of travel website The Points Guy.\n \n\n   \n    What airports are seeing flight delays and cancellations?\n \n\n   \n  The nation’s busiest airports were hit hardest as the shutdown’s ripple effects spread across nearly every part of the air travel network on Friday – the first day of the Trump administration’s mandatory cuts to reduce US air traffic – and continue into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The three major airports servicing the New York City area are experiencing hourslong delays on Saturday due to staffing shortages, according to the FAA.\n \n\n   \n  A ground stop was temporarily issued for flights traveling to Newark Liberty International Airport Saturday after the FAA noted flights into the airport were delayed an average of over four hours earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  Flights coming into LaGuardia Airport were delayed nearly an hour, while departures were also delayed an average of 75 minutes and increasing. And those headed to John F. Kennedy International Airport are delayed an average of over 2.5 hours, while departures from the airport are currently delayed an average of 105 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, flights arriving at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport are delayed an average of five and a half hours, the FAA said.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Washington, DC’s Reagan National Airport faced the most severe disruption, with nearly 80 flights canceled and almost half of all arrivals delayed, according to tracking site  FlightAware .\n \n\n   \n  Chicago O’Hare, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International, Denver International and Dallas-Fort Worth also experienced dozens of cancellations and hundreds of delays, FlightAware data show. On the West Coast, Los Angeles International and San Francisco International reported similar issues.\n \n\n   \n  Other affected airports include Boston Logan, Phoenix Sky Harbor, Seattle-Tacoma and Orlando International, all reporting slowdowns heading into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Internationally, major hubs like Amsterdam Schiphol, Toronto Pearson and Tokyo Haneda, saw cancellations climbing into the double digits.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/louvre-heist-weak-password-blunders-hackers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Nuclear codes, voicemail hacks and businesses going bust.

These are some of the biggest password blunders \n       \n  By Charlotte Reck, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 2014 security report resurfaced this week showing that the password for the server managing the CCTV network at the Louvre – Paris’ art museum which suffered immense financial loss after a  heist team  successfully  targeted historical jewels  last month – was, in fact, just  “LOUVRE.” \n \n\n   \n  But predictable passwords like these are concerningly common.\n \n\n   \n  Logging into social media accounts, shopping apps and subscriber platforms can be a laborious task that leaves many launching devices across the room in frustration and asking why it’s necessary to hire a crack team just to access a personal account.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps it’s time to consider the demand for 16-character combinations of letters, numbers and symbols to be more method than madness, and learn from the mistakes of the weak-password-makers who’ve gone before.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some examples of technological mishaps and infamous faux pas(swords):\n \n\n   \n    Colonial Pipeline blunder:\n \n\n   \n  In May 2021, one of the largest fuel pipeline systems in the United States was  paralyzed  when a cyberattack brought operations to an abrupt halt. At the time, the FBI said the hackers responsible belonged to criminal group Darkside, believed to be based in Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Colonial Pipeline said its network had been accessed via a compromised password that was linked to a disused virtual private networking account used for remote access. The account was not guarded by an extra layer of security known as multi-factor authentication.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how the attackers obtained the compromised credential. But the company claimed the password in question was not easily guessable, with CEO Joseph Blount telling a US Senate committee in June 2021:”It was a complicated password, I want to be clear on that. It was not a Colonial123-type password.” The shutdown remained in place until the company complied with a ransom demand, paying $4.4 million to end the attack.\n \n\n   \n  By the following year, the FBI had  recovered millions  of dollars extorted from Colonial Pipeline by Darkside.\n \n\n   \n    Zero chance forgetting the nuclear launch code:\n \n\n   \n  According to Bruce Blair, a former Air Force launch officer and nuclear policy expert, between 1962 and the mid-1970s the most powerful digits on the globe were simple – eight zeros.\n \n\n   \n  In a twist as absurd as Peter Sellers’ president declaring the War Room a place where gentlemen must not fight in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 dark comedy “Dr. Strangelove,” Blair claimed just eight zeros separated the US from launching a nuclear attack.\n \n\n   \n  Blair said a “two-man-rule,” which required two qualified crew members to be present at the location of the launch code, was considered the primary human safeguard, but the measure wasn’t always reliable. According to Blair, the two members on shift would often organize alternative sleeping rotas that left just one individual with a straightforward password and all the power.\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, the Strategic Air Command amended the system to include a unique enable code that transmitted to the launch crew from a higher authority. The change added further security steps to the process and, as Blair  said , “It no longer sufficed just to flip one switch.”\n \n\n   \n  The nuclear expert’s shocking revelation came decades after it was decided that solely punching in eight zeros might be a little lax when it comes to initiating nuclear war.\n \n\n   \n    A 158-year-old business tanked by hackers:\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of jobs were lost when an unsuspecting transport company in eastern England was toppled by a hacking gang, British media reported.\n \n\n   \n  Northamptonshire business KNP was targeted in June 2023 by Akira, a group of hackers who gained access to the company’s system by guessing the password of an employee. Once inside, the hackers encrypted KNP’s data and locked its internal systems before demanding a ransom.\n \n\n   \n  Being unable to make the payment, the company’s data was lost, and the 158-year-old business went under.\n \n\n   \n  KNP’s director Paul Abbott admitted he never told the employee with the weak password that it was their information that was compromised and likely led to the company’s demise. “Would you want to know if it was you?” Abbott  told the BBC .\n \n\n   \n    Phone hacking scandal:\n \n\n   \n  Hugh Grant, Prince Harry and Sienna Miller were among the stars who fell victim to  phone hacking  during a scandal perpetrated by British tabloids that spanned several years.\n \n\n   \n  Formal inquiries began after complaints that personal information shared only in private realms was routinely exposed on the front pages of national newspapers, causing distress and compromising the safety of those targeted.\n \n\n   \n  Investigations found the voicemails of public figures were hacked by journalists and private investigators hired by publications who worked on the assumption that few people changed the default voicemail access code their handset came with. Simple combinations like 1111, 4444 and 1234 were used to gain access to the messages waiting in the inbox.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom’s phone-hacking scandal led to the closure of the News Of The World’s in 2011, followed by an inquiry into the practises and ethics of the British press.\n \n\n   \n    A one-time hacker now an opposition party leader:\n \n\n   \n  As head of the opposition, the UK’s Conservative Party leader  Kemi Badenoch  spends a lot of time critiquing the current British government. But her record isn’t squeaky clean.\n \n\n   \n  Back in 2018, the politician confessed to hacking the official website of Labour peer Harriet Harman a decade earlier and changing the content to be pro-Conservative.\n \n\n   \n  But this was no mastermind crime – the password required to edit Harman’s website was, indeed, “Harriet Harman.”\n \n\n   \n  Badenoch, who was not a lawmaker at the time of the hack, has since apologized for what she called a “foolish prank.”\n \n\n   \n    Personal data of millions of UK voters vulnerable:\n \n\n   \n  From August 2021 through to 2022, cyber attackers gained access to computers containing Electoral Registers – lists of names and addresses of millions of voters across the UK, the country’s data privacy watchdog discovered.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said hackers accessed the system by imitating a legitimate user account. The ICO determined this possible because appropriate security measures were consistently missed.\n \n\n   \n  Software designed to fix security holes was not installed, and the company failed to enforce a policy that ensured employees used secure passwords. During inquiries, the ICO found 178 active email accounts using passwords identical or similar to those set by the organization’s IT desk when the account was activated.\n \n\n   \n  The Electoral Commission was formally reprimanded for their negligence. No evidence of data misuse was reported.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/sport/college-football-indiana-penn-state-miracle-catch","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"17:35:00Z","title":"Miraculous late toe-tap touchdown keeps No. 2 Indiana’s perfect season alive","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a dramatic college football showdown at Beaver Stadium, No. 2 Indiana narrowly defeated Penn State 27-24 in a game that kept their perfect 10-0 season alive.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:35 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In need of a miracle, down four points with the clock quickly ticking down,  No. 2 Indiana  was looking their first loss of the season squarely in the eyes until wide receiver Omar Cooper Jr. played hero.\n \n\n   \n  The junior reeled in a seven-yard pass from quarterback Fernando Mendoza, just getting his foot in bounds to secure the 27-24 win over Penn State to keep their dream season alive in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, improving to 10-0 on the season.\n \n\n   \n  The late dramatics came after it seemed like Indiana would have no issues getting the program’s first-ever win in Happy Valley, up 13 points in the third quarter.\n \n\n   \n  But with the intense Beaver Stadium crowd behind the home team despite its struggles all season, the Hoosiers found themselves in unfamiliar territory after Penn State rallied to make it a close game down the stretch.\n \n\n   \n  In the fourth quarter, the Nittany Lions took a 24-20 lead after quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer connected with Nicholas Singleton for a 19-yard score.\n \n\n   \n  Mendoza, a front-runner for the Heisman Trophy, had his “Heisman moment,” orchestrating a 10-play, 80-yard drive that led to the Cooper Jr. touchdown.\n \n\n   \n  The 22-year-old former University of California, Berkeley transfer finished the game with 218 yards, one touchdown throwing, another on the ground and an interception. Cooper finished with six receptions for 32 yards along with the score.\n \n\n   \n  “It was late in the game, I threw a pick, that’s on me. The team still had belief. The defense still had belief. Special teams had belief. This guy believed, he was open and I missed him a couple times,” Mendoza told the Fox broadcast while standing alongside Cooper Jr.\n \n\n   \n  “But it all came around in the end. … With amazing teammates and coaches for being able to rally and get the win here in a hostile environment against a great team.”\n \n\n   \n  The Nittany Lions were unsuccessful in finding a miracle for themselves as a late second Hail Mary attempt fell short. The storied Penn State program now drops to 3-6 with a 0-6 record in Big Ten conference play this season.\n \n\n   \n  The Penn State program came into the season ranked No. 2 in the national with championship aspirations under then-head coach  James Franklin  following a semifinal appearance in the College Football Playoff last season.\n \n\n   \n  However, the school fired Franklin last month after early season struggles that found the program sitting at 3-3. Now, under interim coach Terry Smith, the Nittany Lions are riding a six-game losing streak with three games remaining on the season.\n \n\n   \n  Indiana will host Wisconsin next week while Penn State heads to East Lansing, Michigan, to take on Michigan State.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/americas/brazil-tornado-weather-parana-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"17:35:00-05:00","title":"Unprecedented tornado tears through southern Brazil, killing at least six","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An unprecedented tornado struck the town of Rio Bonito do Iguaçu in Paraná state, southern Brazil, killing at least six people and injuring over 750.

Only the University of Louisville Cardinals draw a larger pregame crowd.\n \n\n   \n  Surrounded by big-screen TVs and signs for the domestic beer buckets and other specials, the no-frills, family-owned watering hole near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport is popular among workers from the nearby United Parcel Service package handling facility and the Ford SUV assembly plant.\n \n\n   \n  For the Kentucky opener, Stooges was offering 59-cent shrimp all day.\n \n\n   \n  “I had just ordered my first beer and the lights went out,” Stooges regular Bryson Beck recalled.\n \n\n   \n  Kyla Kenady, working that afternoon, handed him a beer, turned around and looked outside to see “a plane in flames going down.”\n \n\n   \n  The  first report  of the “catastrophic” crash of a UPS MD-11 plane was at about 5:15 p.m. ET on Tuesday, according to state officials. The disaster killed  at least 14 people  and  destroyed nearby businesses  and buildings.\n \n\n   \n  “This plane barely missed a restaurant/bar,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told CNN. “It was very close to a very large Ford plant with hundreds, if not a thousand-plus workers.”\n \n\n   \n  The randomness of the disaster has left locals in a state of shock.\n \n\n   \n  Debbie Self, who, along with her late husband Rodger, opened Stooges more than 40 years ago, said firefighters told her the plane came down roughly 100 yards from her business.\n \n\n   \n  “It was close. They said, ‘We don’t know how you made it,’” said Self, who was having dinner elsewhere at the time of the crash.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS cargo plane came down after an engine detached during takeoff, officials said. Investigators clarified Friday that their earlier report the plane had reached 475 feet was inaccurate, noting data now shows the jet only climbed about 100 feet above ground level before crashing.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to three UPS crew members identified from the plane, nine members of the community have been reported missing, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. They were believed to be in the area at the time.\n \n\n   \n  The crash left a fiery trail of destruction and a half-mile-long debris field, devastating multiple small businesses, such as Grade A Auto Parts, where mangled, blackened remnants of buildings were set in the background of what a Kentucky official described as an “apocalyptic” ashy sky with an acrid smell in the air.\n \n\n   \n  As flames raged and doors melted shut,  people jumped from windows and ran,  some employees helping shield others from the growing inferno at the recycling plant, according to its owner.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene showed a mountainous plume of charcoal-colored smoke emanating from buildings that were set ablaze. In another video at the facility, a man yelled, “Did everybody make it out?” When another person responded, “No,” he screamed, “What do you mean no?”\n \n\n   \n  “I thought it was the end of the world,” Robert Sanders, a 50-year-old employee at the plant told CNN. He lived in a RV trailer on the site of the facility and believes it was destroyed along with all his personal belongings.\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the crash showed a towering wave of smoke and flames billowing skyward near the airport after the low-flying plane struggled to climb and then erupted into an enormous fireball on impact.\n \n\n   \n    Stooges’ parking lot is now a temporary morgue, owner says\n \n\n   \n  At Stooges, Kenady went into “fight or flight” response. The burning plane appeared to fly right over the volleyball courts in the parking lot.\n \n\n   \n  “I turned around, ran down the bar and screamed to everyone that a plane was crashing, grabbed my things, grabbed my phone, my purse, ran out the door as everyone, in panic, ran out at the same time,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  She got into her car and, across the street, felt the ground shaking and what she said was a terrifying rush of heated air.\n \n\n   \n  It was a horrific scenario Kenady said had crossed her mind before. The roar of the planes on takeoff is so loud that people normally have to pause their conversations in the bar.\n \n\n   \n  “We think that something like that would happen but you don’t ever think it would happen to you,” she said of the disaster.\n \n\n   \n  Beck, the bar customer, did not get past his first beer. The lights went out, then he heard “the biggest boom.” The building shook.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been in earthquakes in California before and it didn’t hold a candle to how this place shook,” he said. “Everybody started freaking out and then there’s more booms.”\n \n\n   \n  Beck ran outside. A thick cloud of black smoke enveloped the afternoon sky. “I thought that maybe a country was bombing us,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He ran into a friend, who wanted to rush to the crash scene to help.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not firefighters. We’re not first responders. We don’t have gear,” Beck told his friend. “We have to leave.”\n \n\n   \n  If the plane had gone down a few hundred feet from where it crashed, Beck said, “I would not be talking to you right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Stooges has been in operation since 1984, according to an  obituary  for Self’s husband, who co-founded the business with her.\n \n\n   \n  “Please join us in praying for the victims, their families, and all of the brave first responders,” Self wrote on the  bar’s Facebook page. \n \n\n   \n  “I do believe Rodger shielded that place and all inside, wrapping his angel wings around it,” a local commented on Facebook, referring to Stooges and Self’s late husband.\n \n\n   \n  Another Louisville bar has offered temporary jobs to Stooges employees who are now out of work, according to Self, who has also started a fundraising campaign for her more than 40 employees.\n \n\n   \n  “We were very fortunate. Others were not so fortunate,” Self said.\n \n\n   \n  At the time of the crash, Self said she was having dinner about three miles away from Stooges. She got a call from a worker and rushed to the bar but could not get close.\n \n\n   \n  “I thought it would be gone,” she said of Stooges. “I can’t believe it survived. From now on it will always be known as a place that was left intact in the middle of a war zone.”\n \n\n   \n  Stooges appears to be undamaged but Self said she is unsure when it will reopen. Its parking lot, usually a venue for wrestling matches and volleyball games, is now a temporary morgue.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/sport/baseball-mlb-vesia-dodgers-world-series","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"10:06:00-05:00","title":"After missing World Series for personal reasons, Dodgers’ Vesia says his baby daughter has died","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Los Angeles Dodgers relief pitcher Alex Vesia missed the World Series due to a personal family matter, which was later revealed to be the death of his infant daughter, Sterling, on October 26, 2025.

For these patients, a new experimental pill could offer some hope.\n \n\n   \n  Phase 3 trial data found that people who took the investigational drug enlicitide with their routine cholesterol-lowering regimen, like statins, saw up to a 60% reduction in their LDL or “bad” cholesterol after 24 weeks of daily treatment, according to a  news release  about the results.  ﻿ That was in comparison with people who took a placebo along with their routine cholesterol-lowering medications. All study participants had high levels of LDL cholesterol and a history of either a major cardiovascular disease event, or they were at an increased risk for one.\n \n\n   \n  The new results, which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, were presented Saturday at the  American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions .\n \n\n   \n  Having high cholesterol in the blood can lead to a buildup called “plaque” on the walls of the arteries, raising the risk of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease is the  leading cause of death  in the United States. It’s estimated that  one person dies every 34 seconds  from cardiovascular disease in the US.\n \n\n   \n  Merck, the pharmaceutical company behind enlicitide, plans to apply for US Food and Drug Administration approval of enlicitide early next year, said Dr. Puja Banka, the company’s associate vice president of clinical research and global clinical development.\n \n\n   \n  “We wanted to show what enlicitide can deliver on top of statins, because we know that  70% of patients  that are treated with lipid-lowering therapies still don’t reach their guideline-directed goals,” Banka said about the new data. “So, the idea is really to show what we can achieve with enlicitide on top of statins.”\n \n\n   \n    When statins alone are not enough\n \n\n   \n  The new Phase 3 trial included 2,912 adults, with an average age of 63, who either had a previous heart attack or stroke or were at intermediate or high risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. Data were collected across 14 countries between August 2023 and July 2025.\n \n\n   \n  All of the adults in the study had elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite being on a stable course of lipid-lowering therapy like statins for 30 days or more. About 97% of them were taking statins and 26% were also taking another type of medication to help lower cholesterol levels – and they all continued these therapies during the study.\n \n\n   \n  But as an additional treatment, some of the adults were administered a once-daily pill of enlicitide and others were given a placebo.\n \n\n   \n  Enlicitide is a type of cholesterol-lowering drug known as a PCSK9 inhibitor, which works by helping to clear “bad” LDL cholesterol out of the bloodstream. On the other hand, statins lower LDL cholesterol by blocking an enzyme in the liver, which then forces the liver to remove more LDL cholesterol from the body.\n \n\n   \n  “Thus, it might be expected that adding enlicitide that works by a different mechanism to statins could further reduce LDL cholesterol,” Dr. Kristin Newby, a cardiologist and professor at Duke University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  The researchers found that after 24 weeks, the adults taking enlicitide not only saw up to a 60% reduction in LDL cholesterol, but reductions were sustained through 52 weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The adults taking enlicitide also showed a 53% reduction in a combination of all other cholesterol except for “good” HDL cholesterol; a 50% decrease in ApoB, a protein that helps carry fat and various “bad” types of cholesterol throughout the body; and a 28% drop in a type of fat in the body known as  lipoprotein(a) .\n \n\n   \n  As for the safety of the drug, about 10% of the adults taking enlicitide experienced serious adverse events during the study and a similar share, about 12%, of those taking a placebo experienced adverse events in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “Ultimately, the side effects were balanced between the enlicitide arm and the placebo arm,” Banka said. “There wasn’t a particular adverse event that stands out as imbalanced between the two.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of the adverse events reported in the trial were gastrointestinal disorders and certain infections, but the occurrence of these events was similar across both groups.\n \n\n   \n  “This provides some reasonable assurance of no major or high frequency adverse events or side effects,” said Newby, who is an expert with the American Heart Association.\n \n\n   \n  “However, similar to other new therapeutics, larger outcomes studies and post-marketing surveillance will be needed to identify any low frequency adverse effects that might occur,” Newby said. “The major benefit that is clear from this study is that enlicitide is very efficacious at lowering LDL cholesterol (by about 55%) compared with placebo on a background of statin therapy, and secondarily, it helps more people reach their LDL cholesterol treatment goal than with statins alone.”\n \n\n   \n    Expanding options for patients\n \n\n   \n  For people with high LDL cholesterol who may not respond sufficiently to commonly used treatments like statins alone, there is already the option to take injectable cholesterol-lowering  PCSK9 inhibitor s that are currently on the market.\n \n\n   \n  But a key difference between the PCSK9 inhibitors already on the market and the experimental enlicitide medication is that those currently on the market are administered as an injection.\n \n\n   \n  “Whereas enlicitide is an oral medication taken daily. Thus, offering an option in route and frequency of administration that may be preferable to some patients,” Newby said.\n \n\n   \n  Banka described enlicitide as the “first oral PCSK9 inhibitor to complete Phase 3 trials.”\n \n\n   \n  One new study has demonstrated that a PCSK9 inhibitor already on the market can  reduce major cardiovascular disease events  in adults with no prior heart attack or stroke.\n \n\n   \n  Adding the injectable PCSK9 inhibitor  evolocumab  — sold as Repatha —   to a cholesterol-lowering treatment regimen was found to reduce the risk of a first-time major cardiovascular event among adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or diabetes, according to a separate study presented Saturday at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions.\n \n\n   \n  The trial was conducted across 33 countries between June 2019 and November 2021, and it included 12,257 adults, with an average age of 66. The adults were randomly separated into two groups. One group received evolocumab injections under the skin every two weeks while the other group received injections of a placebo every two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  The data showed that, after an average of 4.6 years, adults in the evolocumab group saw a 25% reduced risk of coronary heart disease deaths, heart attack or ischemic stroke, compared with those in the placebo group.\n \n\n   \n  In the United States, evolocumab injection already has been  approved by the FDA . The  medication is indicated  to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in adults with established cardiovascular disease as well as to be used as an  “add-on” treatment for certain forms of high cholesterol .\n \n\n   \n  The latest trial results represent “the first demonstration of improved cardiovascular outcomes with a PCSK9 inhibitor, or any non-statin for that matter, in patients without a previous heart attack or stroke who are already being treated with a high-intensity lipid-lowering regimen,” lead study author Dr. Erin Bohula, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Brigham & Women’s Hospital and an investigator with the TIMI Study Group, said in a news release on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “Together with data from genetic studies of PCSK9 variants and other PCSK9 inhibitor outcomes studies, our findings suggest that long-term lowering with PCSK9 inhibitors can help to improve cardiovascular morbidity and potentially mortality over time,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/nancy-pelosi-retirement-candidates-replace","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"10:50:00-05:00","title":"Pelosi’s retirement announcement could open floodgates for a wave of new candidates","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Nancy Pelosi’s decision not to seek re-election in 2026 has created a pivotal political opening in San Francisco’s congressional district, a seat she won with 81% of the vote in 2024.

announcement could open floodgates for a wave of new candidates \n       \n  By Arit John, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:50 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision not to seek reelection next year could open the floodgates on the race to replace her.\n \n\n   \n  Pelosi, who has served in Congress since 1987, already had two primary challengers ahead of her Thursday announcement: Saikat Chakrabarti, a former chief of staff to US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic California state Sen. Scott Wiener.\n \n\n   \n  Chakrabarti launched his bid to unseat Pelosi earlier this year as part of a wave of younger Democratic challengers who argued the party needed candidates with new ideas to reshape it in the wake of Republicans’ 2024 electoral wins.\n \n\n   \n  Wiener, who has represented much of the city in the state Senate since 2016, previously said he wouldn’t challenge the former House Speaker. But he argued that it was necessary to get in against Chakrabarti, a self-funder who made his millions in the tech industry.\n \n\n   \n  “I never wanted to run against Nancy Pelosi. I have enormous respect for her – I think she walks on water,” Wiener said in an interview. “But there are limits to how long you can wait. At some point, you need to get into the race and start making the case to the voters.”\n \n\n   \n  Other candidates are expected to announce their own bids. San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan has been floated as a potential candidate and former San Francisco Mayor London Breed told Politico Friday she is considering running.\n \n\n   \n  Already, the field of prospective and declared candidates has sparked discussions about what kind of leader the district should elect to represent a rare, solidly blue open seat. Pelosi won re-election to the San Francisco seat in 2024 with 81% of the vote.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re really seeking authentic and courageous leadership for working families across the country, and San Francisco deserves no less,” Jane Kim, the California director for the Working Families Party, told CNN. “It is a generational chance for a bold new voice in Congress for the city by the bay, and we look forward to a robust endorsement process.”\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how the field is shaping up so far:\n \n\n   \n    A tech millionaire and progressive activist\n \n\n   \n  Chakrabarti launched his campaign to unseat Pelosi in February, arguing that while he respected what she had accomplished during her career, the Democratic Party needed new leaders who could meet the current moment. He helped kick off a wave of young challengers who argued the party needs to be completely overhauled.\n \n\n   \n  He praised Pelosi for deciding not to seek reelection.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s a continuation of her leadership, to actually step down from power,” he said in an interview. “It’s a very rare act of leadership in Washington, DC.”\n \n\n   \n  A software engineer by trade, Chakrabarti made his fortune as a founding engineer at the payment platform Stripe. He went on to work on independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, helped found Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs primary challenges against centrist Democratic incumbents, and managed Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 congressional campaign. As her chief of staff, he helped author the Green New Deal, the left’s sweeping climate policy legislation.\n \n\n   \n  Chakrabarti has pointed to that resume as proof of his progressive bona fides after  facing criticism from some San Francisco progressives , particularly over his endorsement of a more centrist Board of Supervisors candidate who ousted a Democratic Socialists of America-backed incumbent last year. He said he’s been attacked from both the left and the right over the course of the campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “In San Francisco, I guess I’m in the center somewhere, and I hope that means the majority of the city is with me,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    A longtime state senator\n \n\n   \n  Wiener has focused on housing policy and LGBTQ rights during his nearly 10 years in the state Senate. He’s also set up a robust fundraising operation – his campaign announced that it had raised more than $730,000 on the day he launched his bid last month, before Pelosi announced her plans to retire.\n \n\n   \n  Wiener said the presence of a self-funder like Chakrabarti in the race, and a looming filing deadline, spurred him to jump in.\n \n\n   \n  Dan Newman, a San Francisco-based Democratic strategist, said that his decision to jump in early was “risky” but proved to be smart.\n \n\n   \n  “People understood that he couldn’t wait forever,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    A wide open field\n \n\n   \n  California’s congressional filing period doesn’t begin until early next year, at which point several Democrats and few Republicans could enter the race.\n \n\n   \n  Chan, who was first elected as a supervisor in 2020 and views Pelosi as a mentor, could garner support from progressives and labor leaders. Pelosi has not endorsed in the race, but political observers have noted the former Speaker and Chan worked together to pass Democrats’ redistricting push, Proposition 50.\n \n\n   \n  “This moment is about thanking Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi for her legendary public service, and honoring her and her family for their extraordinary commitment to San Francisco and to bettering our entire country,” Chan said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The latest congressional hopeful to signal interest was Breed. The former mayor led the city from 2018 until 2025, after losing her re-election bid to incumbent Mayor Daniel Lurie.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important that San Franciscans have options,”  Breed told Politico . “I want to explore whether I could potentially be one of those options.”\n \n\n   \n  Another open question is whether Pelosi’s daughter, lawyer Christine Pelosi, will enter the race. Newman said that, for years, conventional wisdom held that the younger Pelosi would pursue the seat when her mother retired. That certainty has faded, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Whoever Pelosi eventually backs would become a frontrunner.\n \n\n   \n  “If Nancy picked somebody off the street, then that gives them a little bit of instant credibility,” Newman said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/india/india-shah-rukh-khan-last-superstar-feature-intl-hnk-dst","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"19:53:00-04:00","title":"The last of India’s mythic superstars","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article chronicles the end of an era for India’s mythic superstars, with a focus on Shah Rukh Khan, who turned 60 in 2025.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The ritual begins, as it always does, with a pilgrimage.\n \n\n   \n  People pour in from the dense warrens of India’s financial capital and from dusty villages thousands of kilometers away, all flowing towards the fortified, sea-facing Mumbai home of actor Shah Rukh Khan.\n \n\n   \n  The crowd is a mix of teenagers angling for a glimpse of the icon inside; middle-aged women for whom he was a first love; grown men who see their own aspirations mirrored in his trajectory.\n \n\n   \n  Known as “SRK” by millions, and “King Khan” to his fans, he turned 60 last week, and the chaotic display of devotion outside his home is a testament to a level of stardom rarely seen elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  The air is thick with chants celebrating his milestone. Some have waited overnight. They don masks or T-shirts with his face on, or clutch posters of his movies. All are here for the same sacrament: to get a glimpse of the superstar and be included in the sweep of his signature open-armed embrace.\n \n\n   \n  “I have loved him for a long time so I have come here to wish him happy birthday,” one fan told a local news agency. “Happy, happy birthday Shah Rukh brother. Happy birthday to you.”\n \n\n   \n  Another said he comes here every year. “I’ve been a fan of him since I was born… I have watched all his films,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  This bond was forged in a bygone era. As India opened its economy to the world in the 1990s, Khan opened its heart. He was an outsider who stormed the dynastic gates of Bollywood with little more than wit, ambition, and dimples that could disarm a subcontinent.\n \n\n   \n  And while the adoring thousands gather outside his home to worship a film deity, they may also be witnessing the twilight of India’s cinematic gods.\n \n\n   \n  “As stars become more relatable and fandom less devotional, the star-fan contract is less sacrosanct today,” said a recent IMDb report analyzing the last 25 years of Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In today’s fractured attention economy of streaming, the barbed wire of polarizing politics, and the cacophony of social media, winning adoration on this scale isn’t just difficult; it might be impossible.\n \n\n   \n  As the IMDb report put it: “It’s time to stop searching for the next Shah Rukh Khan.”\n \n\n   \n  In 1991, the government dismantled the protectionist economic policies of its socialist past, cracking open the nation to the world. It was a policy shift that ignited a period of economic growth and industrial expansion that essentially reshaped the country. Satellite television brought a plethora of choice into the living room, Western brands began to appear in shops and, for a burgeoning middle class, the definition of success was suddenly rewritten.\n \n\n   \n  An exhilarating mantra became mainstream: Anyone can make it.\n \n\n   \n  Into this moment stepped Khan.\n \n\n   \n  A Muslim boy from a middle-class Delhi neighborhood, Khan says he was shaped by a household rich in intellect but often short on cash.\n \n\n   \n  His father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was a lawyer and Indian independence activist from Peshawar, in modern-day Pakistan, who ran a series of failed businesses. His mother, Lateef Fatima, was the family’s anchor, according to the younger Khan.\n \n\n   \n  “I come from a very normal lower-middle-class family. I saw a lot of failure,” he  said  during a 2012 speech at Yale University. “My father was a beautiful man and the most successful failure in the world… We were quite poor actually and let me tell you… poverty entails fear and stress and sometimes depression.”\n \n\n   \n  He began acting in school plays. By the age of 23, he was already on television in the successful series “Fauji” (Soldier). But just as his career was taking flight, his personal world fell apart.\n \n\n   \n  The death of his mother, years after he lost his father, prompted a move to Mumbai, the heart of India’s film industry.\n \n\n   \n  “I was sad in Delhi,” Khan told CNN in a 2008 interview. “I said to myself: OK, come (to Mumbai) for a change of scene. Maybe I’ll enjoy myself for a year and get over my depression of my parents’ death. But I just I couldn’t go back… I was never trying to be a movie star, I became one by chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Khan made his big-screen debut in the 1992 romantic drama “Deewana” (Obsessed) and soon became known for playing villainous, menacing characters in films like “Darr” (Fear) and “Baazigar” (Gambler). But it was his pivot to the romantic hero in the 1995 cult hit “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (The Brave Hearted Will Take the Bride, widely known as DDLJ) that catapulted him to superstardom.\n \n\n   \n  His character, Raj, presented a new model of masculinity that wasn’t the angry young man of the previous generation. He was the empathetic partner for the new one, offering a vision of modern love that felt safe and aspirational.\n \n\n   \n  Bollywood certainly has other megastars, like Deepika Padukone, who is among India’s most celebrated women actors; Aamir Khan, known for his versatility; and Salman Khan. Yet, their followings are distinct from the quasi-religious fervor thar surrounds Khan.\n \n\n   \n  It is a phenomenon of near-mythic proportions, engendering a devotion so profound as to lead to the scenes of mass pilgrimage outside Khan’s Mumbai home.\n \n\n   \n  Sher Mohammed had traveled 2,200 kilometers from his village in the eastern state of Jharkhand and waited 95 days for a chance to meet Khan. When Khan learned of Mohammed’s determined vigil, he came out to the street to personally greet his fan.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone told me I won’t be able to meet him… I got even more motivated to meet him,” Mohammed said. “I felt so happy.”\n \n\n   \n  Also present was Visharukh, Khan’s self-proclaimed “biggest fan,” whose home is plastered with posters of the actor, and whose children are named “Simran” and “Aryan” – after Khan’s love interest in “DDLJ” and his real-life son, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Visharukh’s shrine to Khan is just one thread in an intricate tapestry of fandom.\n \n\n   \n  In her book, “Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh,” author Shrayana Bhattacharya explores what he means to women as someone who challenged masculinity in a newly liberalized economy.\n \n\n   \n  “For 15 years, I thought I was talking to fans about Khan,” she said. “Eventually, he became a research device for hundreds of his female fans to use his icon to talk about their own frustrated attempts to assert economic and emotional independence in one of world’s most insidious patriarchies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Bhattacharya, there is no single explanation for his appeal.\n \n\n   \n  For a migrant tribal domestic worker, for instance, she found the appeal wasn’t rooted in grand romance. She most appreciated his characters’ willingness to participate in domestic life, Bhattacharya said, citing “simple gestures such as being in the kitchen in his films, helping with chores.”\n \n\n   \n  For the nation’s elites, Bhattacharya found Khan symbolized something entirely different. He was a living embodiment of the dream that hard work could lead to limitless success. He represented, as she put it, “the myth of meritocracy at a time when India started its love affair with GDP growth and consumer spending.”\n \n\n   \n  And for another crucial group – the first generation of women to ever work in their families – she found his films offered a vital refuge. Khan’s imagery became a “necessary entertainment and escape when their everyday rebellion of prioritizing a career over marriage caused heartbreak or exhaustion,” Bhattacharya said.\n \n\n   \n  “He is one person, but each fan has projected their aspirations and fantasies onto him in their own unique and deeply diverse ways.”\n \n\n   \n  But in today’s world of digital creators, those seeking fame face competition in a way Khan’s generation never could have imagined.\n \n\n   \n  This new reality is the daily grind for Shivam Khatri, an aspiring actor in Mumbai. He, too, left his small town for the city of dreams, but his hustle operates in a different universe. For him, the formula has been inverted: where Khan became a star and then a brand, actors now must become a brand first.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like someone gets picked up from the street,” Khatri said from the home he shares with several other people. “Social media, web shows, it’s changed everything.”\n \n\n   \n  The influence of stardom in India is immense. Cultivated over years through a series of box-office hits, it can define eras, create cultural touchstones, and command a loyal fanbase that transcends generations.\n \n\n   \n  But the very nature of the connection between stars and their audience is now evolving, according to the IMDb report.\n \n\n   \n  “What was once a carefully mediated connection, built through iconic characters and controlled narratives, has become more porous,” it said. “The closing of the metaphorical gap between the big screen’s larger-than-life star and the one on the (Instagram) reel you can hold in your hand has changed the equation between the star and the fan.”\n \n\n   \n  Khatri knows his follower count is as important as his headshot as he competes not just with actors but with food bloggers, comedians and dancers for screen time. “Everyone should have an online presence now,” he said, “and you have to constantly check it.”\n \n\n   \n  His struggle illustrates how the singular path to box-office fame has been replaced by a thousand algorithm-driven streams on social media apps like Instagram and TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  For Ibrahim Qadri, a Khan lookalike and social media influencer from Gujarat, it pays to trade on the existing fame of others, supplying a demand for connection that the real SRK could never sate.\n \n\n   \n  His Instagram feed is a meticulous recreation of Khan’s world: the signature arm-spread pose in a mustard field, a lip-sync to a classic song, a frame-by-frame remake of a famous movie scene. He is, in many ways, more accessible than the real Khan, making a living through brand deals with local businesses and paid appearances at weddings.\n \n\n   \n  “When I perform, I don’t think I’m imitating,” Qadri said. “I become him. I feel like I am him.”\n \n\n   \n  This profound devotion, which has garnered him more than 2 million followers, comes with a paradox: He might be the only person in India who doesn’t want to meet Khan.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve said that many times,” Qadri explains. “Because if I meet him, I feel my passion will end… what will be left to do in life?”\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t talk about Hindu-Muslim,” he once said in a 2020 interview in Hindi. “My wife is Hindu, I’m a Muslim, and our children are Hindustan (Indian).”\n \n\n   \n  But in today’s era of political polarization, defined by a new wave of Hindu nationalism, that same identity has been weaponized, transforming him from a unifying symbol into a cultural battleground.\n \n\n   \n  The 2023 release of his action film “Pathaan” (Warrior) served as a flashpoint. The brief appearance in a musical sequence of a female actor in a saffron bikini – a color associated with Hinduism – ignited a coordinated firestorm of outrage from far-right groups and politicians, who framed it as a deliberate insult to the religion.\n \n\n   \n  Calls for a nationwide boycott trended for weeks, and effigies of the actor were burned,  according  to local media reports. But the film’s eventual record-breaking success was a deafening rebuttal from his loyal fanbase.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if there will be another SRK or not,” said the author Bhattacharya. “What I do know is that we will need icons who unite us in conversation, not divide us into spiritual silos.”\n \n\n   \n  Back at the birthday congregation in Mumbai, a sea of fans surges outside Khan’s home. As the day wears on, the crowd swells to a formidable throng.

Elizabeth Wolfe, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:30 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s been a month since Ashlee Buzzard packed her 9-year-old daughter Melodee into a rental car and left their home state of California – only to return three days later with no child and plenty of unanswered questions in tow, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  As investigators  search for Melodee , they say their probe has uncovered a series of wigged disguises, a sprawling multistate road trip, and an “uncooperative” mother who has provided “no verifiable explanation” of her daughter’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  The case took an unexpected turn on Friday when  Buzzard, 40, was arrested  on a charge of false imprisonment – but not for the disappearance of her daughter. “This crime is not connected to the ongoing search for Melodee, however, detectives are unable to fully outline the crime as it would impede their ongoing investigation,” the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the case – and the many questions that still remain.\n \n\n   \n    A concerned school official noticed Melodee’s ‘prolonged absence’\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s disappearance was reported on October 14, not by her family but by school administrators who noticed she had not been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in.\n \n\n   \n  School district officials in the child’s hometown of Lompoc say Melodee was enrolled in August in an independent study program, which allows students to learn from home. That was  the last month  she was seen by the school, the sheriff’s office has said.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear whether the school last saw Melodee virtually or in person, but the sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  The school’s August sighting helped narrow detectives’ timeline at the beginning of the investigation, when authorities were working with outdated childhood photos and family members who said they had not seen Melodee for years.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years. The aunt said their extended family largely lost contact with the child after her father died in a motorcycle accident when she was a baby.\n \n\n   \n  When Melodee’s school asked for a welfare check on October 14, officers arrived at her mother’s home but only found Buzzard, who “provided  no verifiable explanation  for Melodee’s whereabouts,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found.\n \n\n   \n  The  sheriff’s office  said this week Buzzard “has remained uncooperative and has not confirmed Melodee’s location or welfare.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n    Melodee likely disappeared during a whirlwind multistate road trip\n \n\n   \n  Detectives have narrowed their investigation to a small but very eventful three-day window from October 7-10, in which they believe the mother drove Melodee more than 1,000 miles away – as far as Nebraska – crossing at least six states and trading license plates and disguises as they went.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the three-day trip, Buzzard returned home with the rental car, this time without Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Melodee was seen was on October 9 in an area around the Colorado and Utah state line. Here’s what  investigators say happened  on their trip:\n \n\n   \n  Finding Melodee now hinges on detectives unearthing what happened to the girl after she was last seen on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office released a  travel-route map  of where they believe the mother and daughter traveled between October 9 and 10, and is asking businesses, gas stations, hotels, rest stops and residents along the route to review surveillance camera footage that may catch a glimpse of the child.\n \n\n   \n    A series of wigs may have provided quick disguises, investigators say\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who came across the mother and daughter may not recognize them in some publicly released pictures, as authorities believe Buzzard may have taken steps to conceal their identities, including tucking her daughter’s ringlet curls under a smooth wig.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc on October 7 showed Buzzard and Melodee in what appeared to be wigs, the sheriff’s office said in a release that  shared a clip  of the video.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next three days, authorities say Buzzard appeared to swap wigs, trading fake, honey blonde curls for a darker wig closer to the style Melodee was seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel,” the release said.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s grandmother, Lilly Denes, told CNN affiliate  KSBY  that when she first saw the surveillance images, she was overwhelmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was totally numb and in shock. … This is just so shocking to me in that my granddaughter is dressed in a disguise,” Denes told the affiliate.\n \n\n   \n  “If she’s listening, we love you. We’re here for you, and we just want you to be happy,” the grandmother said. “Call me. There are numbers on the TV that you can call, and I will come pick you up.”\n \n\n   \n    Mother is accused of falsely imprisoning someone in unrelated charge\n \n\n   \n  In a sudden turn of events on Friday, the sheriff’s office  announced  while they were investigating Melodee’s disappearance, they learned her mother had recently “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  “Although this arrest occurred during the course of the missing person investigation, it is not directly related to Melodee’s disappearance,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard  was arrested Friday  on a charge of false imprisonment, a felony charge, and investigators have been reluctant to provide details about the incident while they search for Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard will be booked at a Santa Barbara County jail with bail set at $100,000, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest comes about a week after the  FBI served search warrants  at Buzzard’s home and a storage locker, as well as the rental car Melodee was last seen in.\n \n\n   \n  But the sheriff’s office declined to provide the identity of the victim of the alleged false imprisonment.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheriff’s detectives remain fully focused on locating Melodee and confirming her safety,” the Friday release said.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who has seen Melodee or may have information about her whereabouts is encouraged to call the sheriff’s office or leave  an anonymous tip .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/anti-trump-vote-virigina-new-jersey","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:00:00-05:00","title":"The anti-Trump vote appears as strong as ever","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 off-year elections in Virginia and New Jersey revealed a strikingly strong anti-Trump vote, with 41% of registered voters indicating opposition to Donald Trump, compared to only 21% who said they would support him.

I didn’t do a lot of support for the other candidate [in New Jersey]. They asked me about [New York City mayoral candidate Andrew] Cuomo, and I said, well, it’s a question – do you want a thug or do you want a communist?\n \n\n   \n  “So I wasn’t involved in that stuff too much.”\n \n\n   \n  But however you want to characterize Trump’s role in Tuesday’s  off-year elections  in Virginia and New Jersey, there is no question they were about him.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, the results appear to have been more of a direct rebuke to Trump than any previous election that didn’t actually feature him on the ballot.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps one of the biggest lessons of this week is that the anti-Trump vote appears stronger than ever. And, as notably, the pro-Trump vote appears as weak as ever.\n \n\n   \n  Even before the election, this was perhaps my biggest takeaway from the  CNN poll  released Monday.\n \n\n   \n  It showed 41% of registered voters said that if they were voting for Congress today, their vote would be meant to show opposition to Trump. Meanwhile, just 21% said their vote would be meant to show support for Trump.\n \n\n   \n  So about twice as many anti-Trump votes as pro-Trump ones.\n \n\n   \n  That’s not normal. While unpopular presidents are not exactly uncommon these days, that was actually the biggest such gap in CNN polling in nearly 20 years.\n \n\n   \n  The last time twice as many voters viewed their vote in a non-presidential election as opposing rather than supporting the president was in 2006. At the time, 36% of registered voters viewed their vote as against George W. Bush, while just 15% viewed it as pro-Bush. (Republicans got shellacked in that election.)\n \n\n   \n  The numbers weren’t quite as pronounced ahead of Trump’s first midterm election, in 2018, when 38% of voters described their votes as anti-Trump, versus 25% who were pro-Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Okay, that’s national polling. So, did this show up on Tuesday in the election? It sure did.\n \n\n   \n  While we didn’t have a nationwide election, the exit-poll data we do have from the key states suggests the anti-Trump vote was stronger than before.\n \n\n   \n  The gap between anti-Trump votes and pro-Trump votes in Virginia went from 17 points in 2017 (34%-17%) to 22 points on Tuesday (38%-16%).\n \n\n   \n  It grew even more in New Jersey, going from 17 points in 2017 (28%-11%) to 28 points this time (41%-13%).\n \n\n   \n  And 2017 was the worst-polling year of Trump’s first term.\n \n\n   \n  The gaps between anti- and pro-Trump votes in these states were also significantly larger than they were nationally in either the 2018 or 2022 midterms, when both measured at 12 points. (Trump was out of office in 2022, of course, but he still loomed large in American politics.)\n \n\n   \n  That’s not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, given Virginia and New Jersey lean modestly to the left. (Trump lost both states in 2024 by 6 points.) But it’s not like these are deep-blue states, either.\n \n\n   \n  And New Jersey is a state Trump and his allies have tried to pitch as a swing state in the making. Yet there were three times as many anti-Trump voters there Tuesday as pro-Trump ones.\n \n\n   \n  All of which suggests a couple things.\n \n\n   \n  The first is that the massive size of the  “No Kings” rallies  was no fluke. The anti-Trump movement appears as strong, motivated and robust as ever. Its adherents might not be keen on the Democratic Party these days, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t engaged and even prepared to vote.\n \n\n   \n  The second point hasn’t gotten as much attention. And that’s that, for all of Trump’s huge power grabs and his political domination of the Republican Party, his base actually doesn’t seem terribly enthused right now.\n \n\n   \n  Just 1 in 5 registered voters said in the CNN poll ahead of the election that their vote would be intended to support Trump. It was even less than that in New Jersey and Virginia on Election Day, according to CNN’s exit polls\n \n\n   \n  These are not the numbers of an all-powerful, domineering force whose actions are beloved by half the country and who can marshal voters to the polls when he decides to get more involved.\n \n\n   \n  And it suggests there’s something to the data we’re seeing where Trump’s base isn’t exactly gung-ho about some of his policies. I wrote about this back in July – the idea that there was  something of a “malaise” setting in on the right . It looks like that’s a real electoral problem for Trump and the GOP now.\n \n\n   \n  Whatever the case, these numbers are worth paying close attention to moving forward.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/europe/six-killed-fire-perfume-depot-turkey-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"08:09:00-05:00","title":"Six killed in fire at perfume depot in northwestern Turkey","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A fire broke out at a perfume depot in Kocaeli province, northwestern Turkey, on Saturday morning, killing six people and injuring one.

mode Thursday \n       \n  By Clare Duffy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:32 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  OpenAI, the world’s leader in AI and ChatGPT parent company, went into panic mode on Thursday over what it said was a very public misstatement.\n \n\n   \n  Two top executives furiously backtracked from an earlier comment that suggested OpenAI might need government support to cover the $1.4 trillion in chips and data center infrastructure it’s committed to buying.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how the situation unfolded and why the since-retracted comment was so controversial.\n \n\n   \n    What OpenAI’s CFO said\n \n\n   \n  OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar raised eyebrows on Wednesday when she suggested that the US government should “backstop” the company’s aggressive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  “The backstop, the guarantee, that allows the financing to happen, that can really drop the cost of the financing but also increase the loan-to-value, so the amount of debt that you can take on top of an equity portion,” she said  at a Wall Street Journal event .\n \n\n   \n  In other words: a federal government “backstop” for the debt AI companies take on to make chip investments.\n \n\n   \n  Friar quickly walked back the comments, clarifying in a  LinkedIn post  that the government needed to “play their part” in combination with the private sector to contribute to America’s AI growth. But OpenAI was “not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments.”\n \n\n   \n  But that may have confused matters even further and added to a chorus of questions that have been growing in recent weeks about how the not-yet-profitable startup plans to pay for its AI data center and chip commitments.\n \n\n   \n    Why was this so controversial?\n \n\n   \n  Friar’s initial comment took heat because it seemed to imply that the US government — and thus, taxpayers — should be on the hook if OpenAI can’t figure out how to pay for all the chips it has said it will buy. Like, how your parents who co-signed on your lease would be responsible if you didn’t pay your rent.\n \n\n   \n  And that didn’t sit well with many people, given that OpenAI is a private company valued at $500 billion, from which taxpayers wouldn’t be seeing any direct benefit if it succeeds.\n \n\n   \n  “Will there be a political movement to forgive AI chip loans like student loans? Can OpenAI wind up in conservatorship like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?” Jones Trading chief market strategist Mike O’Rourke wrote in emailed commentary Wednesday. “It is absurd that OpenAI insiders think the U.S. government should furnish them with preferential borrowing rates while they get to grow the value of their privately held shares on the backs of American taxpayers.”\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, the comments seemed to suggest — as many investors and Silicon Valley watchers have  worried in recent months  — that OpenAI isn’t quite sure how it will pay for its $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments without some creative maneuvering. That would be an issue for everyone, since it has been on a  dealmaking spree  with Nvidia, AMD, Amazon and others, helping to prop up the stock market.\n \n\n   \n    OpenAI CEO Sam Altman weighs in\n \n\n   \n  By Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stepped in to try to further clarify the company’s position on a government backstop. He revealed that the company expects to earn $20 billion in revenue this year and plans to grow to “hundreds of billions” in annual revenue by 2030 with investments in things like enterprise AI and consumer devices.\n \n\n   \n  Altman reiterated that the company “does not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.”\n \n\n   \n  “We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” Altman said in an X  post .\n \n\n   \n  The government could consider, however, investing in its own data centers and guarantee loans for building new US chip fabrication plants, he said. The White House has pushed tech giants to do just that to protect national security.\n \n\n   \n  “If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,” Altman said. “That’s how capitalism works and the ecosystem and economy would be fine.”\n \n\n   \n    How does Trump factor into all this?\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump has said that building new AI infrastructure and ensuring that America wins the global AI race are national priorities. His administration has  committed to  pulling back on AI regulations and streamlining permitting for new data centers and energy infrastructure.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s AI Czar David Sacks said on X Thursday that “there will be no federal bailout for AI,” adding that if one AI company fails, “others will take its place.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/cholesterol-gene-edit-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-05:00","title":"Scientists Edit Gene to Permanently Reduce Cholesterol in Pilot Study","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A pilot study led by Dr. Steven Nissen and Dr. Luke Laffin at Cleveland Clinic has demonstrated that using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to silence the ANGPTL3 gene in the liver can reduce LDL cholesterol by nearly 50% and triglycerides by 55% in patients with severe hyperlipidemia.

Scientists have edited a gene that may reduce high cholesterol permanently \n       \n  By Sandee LaMotte, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:56 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  With a snip of a gene, doctors may one day permanently lower dangerously  high cholesterol,  possibly removing the need for medication, according to a new pilot study published Saturday in the  New England Journal of Medicine .\n \n\n   \n  The study was extremely small — only 15 patients with severe disease — and was meant to test the safety of a new medication delivered by CRISPR-Cas9, a biological sort of scissor which cuts a targeted gene to modify or turn it on or off.\n \n\n   \n  Preliminary results, however, showed nearly a 50% reduction in  low-density lipoprotein , or LDL, the “bad” cholesterol which plays a major role in heart disease — the No.1 killer of adults in the  United States  and  worldwide .\n \n\n   \n  The study, which will be presented Saturday at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in New Orleans, also found an average 55% reduction in  triglycerides , a different type of fat in the blood that is also linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope this is a permanent solution, where younger people with severe disease can undergo a ‘one and done’ gene therapy and have reduced LDL and triglycerides for the rest of their lives,” said senior study author Dr. Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a dream come true,” Nissen said. “If you’d asked me 15 years ago if we could have done something like this, I would have thought you were crazy,”\n \n\n   \n  Today, cardiologists want people with existing heart disease or those born with a predisposition for hard-to-control cholesterol to lower their LDL well below 100, which is the average in the US, said Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, director of preventive cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n \n\n   \n  “There is evidence to suggest that the optimal cholesterol level is 40 to 50, which is very hard to do through diet and lifestyle,” said Natarajan, who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “Now, today’s medications can already lower LDL cholesterol to the levels found in the study — in fact, some medicines are a little more potent,” he said. “So we’re going to have to wait and see if this treatment works as well as this first study suggests.”\n \n\n   \n  While early, the findings are exciting due to the difficulty of remembering to take a daily medication — and sometimes three or four — to control high cholesterol levels, said preventive cardiologist Dr. Ann Marie Navar, an associate professor of cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “In spite of having a lot of available therapies, the majority of people do not have their LDL under control,” said Navar, who was not involved in the study.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re 20 and you have really high cholesterol, it may make a lot more sense to have a one-time treatment that doesn’t require you to have to take a pill every single day or shot every two weeks for the next 60 years,” she said. “The potential for this is just enormous.”\n \n\n   \n    A lucky mutation to reduce high cholesterol\n \n\n   \n  The idea for a gene-editing treatment came from an unusual source — a genetic mutation. In that scenario, the ANGPTL3, or angiopoietin-like protein 3 gene, which is responsible for regulating LDL and triglycerides is shut off.\n \n\n   \n  People with a nonfunctioning ANGPTL3 gene  — which Natarajan says applies to about 1 in 250 people in the US — have lifelong levels of low LDL cholesterol and triglycerides without any apparent negative consequences. They also have exceedingly low or no risk for cardiovascular disease.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a naturally occurring mutation that’s protective against cardiovascular disease,”  said Nissen, who holds the Lewis and Patricia Dickey Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “And now that CRISPR is here, we have the ability to change other people’s genes so they too can have this protection.”\n \n\n   \n  Various doses of the CRISPR-based drug were given to study participants by infusion: One set of people received a very tiny dose of 0.1 milligrams per kilogram, while others received levels from 0.3 to 0.8 milligrams per kilogram, said lead study author Dr. Luke Laffin, a preventive cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic’s Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute.\n \n\n   \n  “The average 55% decrease in triglycerides and nearly 50% in LDL cholesterol occurred at the highest dose,” Laffin said. “That’s exciting because there are no therapies available now that simultaneously lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.”\n \n\n   \n  There was a small decrease in HDL (high density lipoprotein), which is known as “good” cholesterol. However the drop in HDL is also found in people with the ANGPTL3 mutation and doesn’t appear to be harmful, Laffin said.\n \n\n   \n  “The most common disorder that we see in our prevention clinic is mixed hyperlipidemia —people who have trouble controlling both their LDL and triglycerides,” Nissen said. “So to be able to do this simultaneously is really an important development.”\n \n\n   \n    Long-term safety profile\n \n\n   \n  In people with the natural mutation, the ANGPTL3 gene is turned off in every cell in the body — muscles, heart, lungs and so forth. The new medication, however, targets only the liver, the organ responsible for synthesizing triglycerides and producing cholesterol while also removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n \n\n   \n  That’s reassuring for the long-term safety of the drug’s impact, Nissen said, making it less likely that genes in other parts of the body could also be edited.\n \n\n   \n  Side effects of the initial treatment were minimal, mostly irritation at infusion sites, according to the study. One person suffered a spinal disk herniation, and another had an increase in enzymes that could signal liver damage, but those levels resolved within two weeks.\n \n\n   \n  However, one person died six months after the infusion: “He had extensive, advanced cardiovascular disease, and he got the tiniest 0.1 dose, a dose that doesn’t do anything,” Nissen said.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t think that his death has any implications to the study at all,” he said. “In addition, the FDA has recommended these people be followed after the trials are all over for 15 years to see if there are long term adverse effects. That will be done, and it’s the right thing.”\n \n\n   \n  Phase 2 clinical trials will begin soon, quickly followed by Phase 3 trials, which are designed to show the effect of the drug on a larger population, Nissen said.\n \n\n   \n  “We hope to do all this by the end of next year,” Nissen said. “We’re moving very fast because this is a huge unmet medical need — millions of people have these disorders and many of them are not on treatment or have stopped treatment for whatever reason. That’s a huge under treatment issue here in the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, this is early days, and there have been similar drugs which looked promising at the beginning but were later rejected due to safety concerns, Nadar said.\n \n\n   \n  “The most important take home message is if you’re on a cholesterol lowering medication, stay on it,” she said. “All the data show the longer you lower your LDL cholesterol, the better your outcome. Someone who lowers their LDL from 100 to 30 for a only year is going to be far less protected than someone who lowered their cholesterol from 100 to 50 for a lifetime.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/europe/orban-trump-oil-sanctions-hungary-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"08:42:00-05:00","title":"Trump grants Hungary one-year exemption from Russian energy sanctions","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump granted Hungary a one-year exemption from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas following a meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, despite ongoing international criticism that such a carve-out undermines the credibility of sanctions meant to pressure Russia’s war in Ukraine.

EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump has granted Hungary a one-year exemption from US sanctions for buying Russian oil and gas, a White House official told CNN Friday, after Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met the US President in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  For months, Trump has berated European Union countries for continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia, saying this helps fuel the Kremlin’s war machine and prolong the  war in Ukraine  that he has been at pains to end.\n \n\n   \n  But when Orbán – whose country buys more Russian oil and gas than any other EU nation – showed up at the White House on Friday, Trump was full of praise for the “great leader” of a “great country,” claiming it has been “difficult” for Hungary to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels, since it is landlocked.\n \n\n   \n  For Orbán, a darling of the MAGA movement, the carve-out has spared Hungary from the violent economic shock it was facing after the Trump administration last month put sanctions on two Russian oil giants. Before those sanctions were announced, Orbán had told Trump, his longtime ally, that cutting Russian energy supplies would bring Hungary’s economy “to its knees.”\n \n\n   \n  The exemption for Hungary will raise questions about the Trump administration’s seriousness in enforcing its sanctions on Russia’s oil exports. Analysts warn that Trump’s cutting his allies some slack will embolden others to try to circumvent US sanctions, eroding their ability to inflict economic pain on Russia and hasten the end of its war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  “The US decision is a terrible and unnecessary mistake that will allow over 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to flow into the Kremlin’s war chest,” Isaac Levi, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), told CNN. “By carving out special treatment for Hungary, Washington is telling other buyers that they can keep handling Russian oil and still expect to be let off the hook.”\n \n\n   \n  Levi also questioned the Trump administration’s rationale for the exemption, pointing to how the Czech Republic, another landlocked country, manages without Russian crude oil and has lower fuel prices at the pump than Hungary. “This clearly shows that the oil flows that continue to finance Putin’s war in Ukraine are entirely unnecessary,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Orbán is also hoping that Trump might re-open the door to a summit with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, which the US president announced last month, but which was soon shelved. Trump said Friday that his team was talking with Orbán about meeting with Putin.\n \n\n   \n  In a press conference before the lunch with Orbán, Trump expressed sympathy for Hungary’s energy insecurity since “they don’t have ports, and so they have a difficult problem,” he said. The president added that he was “disturbed” that other European countries that “don’t have those problems” were continuing to buy “a lot of oil and gas from Russia.”\n \n\n   \n  But Hungary and neighboring Slovakia are the only EU countries still receiving oil from Russia, via the Druzhba pipeline. In the wake of Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, EU countries moved to phase out Russian oil, but granted an exemption to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three countries heavily reliant on Russian imports – to give them time to reduce their reliance.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Hungary upped its dependence on Russian crude oil from 61% pre-invasion to 86% in 2024. This year, Russia accounted for 92% of Hungary’s crude oil imports. Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on Russian crude oil, according to a  report  from CREA, and the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD).\n \n\n   \n  The report said phasing out Russian oil is “fully feasible” for Hungary and Slovakia, as the Adria pipeline in Croatia “can meet their combined needs.” Orbán, however, denied this, claiming that the Croatian government would need to enlarge the pipeline to meet Hungary’s needs.\n \n\n   \n  Although EU countries have continued to buy Russian gas, funneled via Turkey through the TurkStream pipeline, Russia’s share of EU gas imports fell from 40% pre-invasion to 11% in 2024. Last month, EU countries agreed to ban all imports of Russian gas from 2028. Hungary and Slovakia opposed the ban.\n \n\n   \n  In an analysis published before Trump’s meeting with Orbán, the Atlantic Council said the White House should be “clear-eyed about the fact that, despite Trump’s chumminess with Orbán, he has been the roadblock to the action the United States is demanding from Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  But, using talking points that have helped win him Trump’s affection in the past, Orbán claimed Hungary, as a “Christian” country that has taken a hard stance against immigration, is a “special island of difference in a liberal ocean in Europe.”\n \n\n   \n  Orbán praised Trump for repairing what he described as damage caused to the US-Hungary relations by the Biden administration, which imposed sanctions on Hungary largely to punish Orbán for democratic backsliding. The Trump administration has since removed some of those sanctions.\n \n\n   \n  “Now we are (in) quite a good position to open up a new chapter – let’s say a golden age – between the United States and Hungary,” Orbán said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/supreme-court-rastafarian-man-dreadlocks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"08:00:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court to hear case of Rastafarian man seeking to sue prison officials for cutting his dreadlocks","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian, was forcibly shaved of his dreadlocks when transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Louisiana in 2020, violating his religious beliefs and a Nazarite vow.

dreadlocks \n       \n  By John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:00 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two things went very wrong when Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian, was transferred to a prison in central Louisiana five years ago.\n \n\n   \n  The first is that prison guards handcuffed Landor to a chair and  shaved off the knee-length dreadlocks  he had grown over nearly two decades. The second is that, minutes earlier, guards took a court decision requiring prisons to allow dreadlocks for Rastafarians and tossed it into the trash.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court will hear arguments in an important religious rights case Monday that will decide whether Landor – and other prisoners whose beliefs are violated – may sue prison officials for damages.\n \n\n   \n  “In an instant, they stripped Landor of decades of consistent religious practice and a defining feature of his identity,” his lawyers said in written arguments this year. “That is shocking, offensive, and lawless.”\n \n\n   \n  Few cases arrive at the Supreme Court with a set of facts and a legal question more tailor-made for a conservative 6-3 majority that has in recent years consistently backed religious claims. Even the Louisiana officials opposing Landor’s case have condemned how he was treated.\n \n\n   \n  In a similar case just five years ago,  the court ruled 8-0  in favor of a group of Muslim Americans who said federal agents had placed them on a no-fly list because they refused to act as informants.\n \n\n   \n  But the question for the justices is not whether Landor’s head should have been shaved, but rather whether he can claim money damages.\n \n\n   \n  A panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals  ruled that Landor was not entitled to sue  under a 25-year-old law intended to protect prisoners’ religious interests.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative New Orleans-based 5th Circuit said that it “emphatically” condemned “the treatment that Landor endured,” but an earlier appeals court precedent settled the case against him. The full 5th Circuit ultimately  decided against  rehearing the case.\n \n\n   \n  “Religious liberty is deeply important, and Louisiana has laws on the books protecting it,” said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican. But, she said, “ten federal courts of appeals have held” that the law “does not allow prisoners to sue prison officials in their personal capacities for damages.”\n \n\n   \n  Landor, who began serving a five-month prison sentence in 2020 for drug possession, had previously taken a promise known as the Nazarite vow to not cut his hair.\n \n\n   \n  He had been incarcerated without incident at two other facilities before he was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center with only a few weeks left in his sentence. And he came armed with a copy of an appeals court ruling from 2017 that allowed prisoners to have dreadlocks.\n \n\n   \n  His guards were unpersuaded. The warden asked Landor to hand over documents from his sentencing judge to verify his religious beliefs. When Landor couldn’t immediately produce them, he was escorted into another room, according to court documents, and shaved.\n \n\n   \n  Landor’s prison ID photo taken that day, according to legal papers, shows him bald.\n \n\n   \n  Landor’s case at the Supreme Court rests on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA. Congress passed that law, and another that dealt with religious accommodation more widely, in response to a landmark but controversial 1990 precedent from the court. Five years ago, the  justices ruled that the other law , which has nearly identical language, does allow people whose religious rights have been burdened to seek damages against government officials acting in their individual capacity.\n \n\n   \n  But Louisiana counters that RLUIPA is a spending contract between the federal government, which provides funding for state prisons, and state officials. The individual officials involved in Landor’s forced shaving were not a party to that contract, Louisiana says, so they can’t be held personally liable.\n \n\n   \n  As much as the current Supreme Court has been receptive to religious claims, it has also been uncomfortable allowing people to sue state officials as a way to  enforce federal spending laws .\n \n\n   \n  State officials warned of “serious consequences” if Landor wins, claiming that staffing shortages in state prisons would “only grow worse if current staff and potential job applicants learned that they would be personally liable for money damages.” (States generally pay court-awarded damages against employees in those situations).\n \n\n   \n  Landor and his allies counter in court papers that without being able to sue for damages there’s no real way to enforce the federal law, and no consequences for those who violate it.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump’s administration is backing Landor’s claim, telling the Supreme Court that it believes he should be able to sue.\n \n\n   \n  That is a  departure from the position  the first Trump administration took five years ago in a related case, though the administration has noted it lost the case five years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Landor, who declined an interview request, will attend the Supreme Court arguments in person.\n \n\n   \n  As his case has worked its way up to the high court, his dreadlocks have regrown to just past his shoulders.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/business/online-charitable-contributions-fees-tips","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"What to Know About Fees and Tips When Donating to a Good Cause","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how online charitable donations, especially during the holiday season and around Giving Tuesday, involve hidden fees and optional tips that may not go to the charity but instead benefit the fundraising platform.

Take Giving Tuesday – which falls on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving in the United States. Last year it raised an estimated $3.6 billion in the United States. Roughly one-third of that came from online donations –- made either on a third-party online fundraising platform or through nonprofit organizations’ websites, which themselves may be powered by a third-party platform’s fundraising software.\n \n\n   \n  Such platforms have made it fast and easy to contribute to your favorite causes.\n \n\n   \n  With that convenience, though, may come fees and sometimes the option for donors to leave a “tip.”\n \n\n   \n  But who pays the fees? And what is a tip for, exactly?\n \n\n   \n    Fundraising isn’t free\n \n\n   \n  The answers will depend on each individual platform’s business model – and a charity’s decisions about what to ask of its donors when it decides to use a third-party provider.\n \n\n   \n  But one thing is true for all platforms: “They don’t run on air. Providing the service costs money,” said Laurie Styron, executive director of CharityWatch, an independent watchdog.\n \n\n   \n   Processing fees:  These are what platforms are charged by payment processing companies for each transaction. The fee on charitable donations is most typically 2.9% of your donation plus 30 cents.\n \n\n   \n  Some platforms will require the donor to pay the processing fee and will deduct it from your donation amount, while others will ask if you’d like to pay that fee on top of your donation – e.g., you donate $100 plus pay an extra $3.20 for processing – which, like your donation, is tax deductible if you itemize, said Tom O’Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Professionals. If you opt not to add the processing fee, the nonprofit or the platform will take it out of your donation.\n \n\n   \n   Platform fees:  Besides processing fees, some platforms may charge the nonprofit a fee for use of its services (eg, 3% of donations).\n \n\n   \n  Those services might include providing an easy way for nonprofits to raise funds, conduct online events and access clear records on donations; as well as provide the best encryption to  protect donors’ data .\n \n\n   \n  A big benefit with a percentage-of-donation fee is that “it means the nonprofit isn’t paying for donations they don’t get,” said nonprofit consultant Christina Tzavaras Edwards . \n \n\n   \n  And some platforms will give donors the option to cover both processing  and  platform fees to alleviate the financial burden on the nonprofit.\n \n\n   \n   Optional tips:  Sometimes fundraising platforms will waive their platform (and even processing) fees for nonprofits, and instead ask donors if they’d like to leave an “optional tip” – again, as a percentage of their donation.\n \n\n   \n  In that instance, Edwards said, “You’re tipping the tech company … not the charity.”   \n \n\n   \n  Why? Such tips, which are not tax deductible, are often explained as a way for the platform to continue offering free fundraising services to help hundreds or even thousands of nonprofits.\n \n\n   \n  Kathy Ruiz-Carter, who runs a very small nonprofit organization, said the Givebutter platform provides her organization with a lot of free robust fundraising options, including the ability to hold live events and auctions online, all of which help her organization grow.\n \n\n   \n  “They make it so easy. We don’t have to deal with creating the systems and making sure this connects to this and sending out receipts. Everything is built in. It’s very much plug-and-play,” Ruiz-Carter said.\n \n\n   \n  Some platforms prepopulate the tip field with a suggested percentage. This reporter saw a few with suggested percentages ranging between 15% and 17%. But the donor is offered a tip slider to adjust the percentage up or down – or even to select 0%.\n \n\n   \n  With GoFundMe, for instance, “The majority of donors adjust our tipping slider and, in many cases, do move it to zero,” a company spokesperson said, adding that doing so has “no effect on the amount the beneficiary – whether it’s a nonprofit or an individual – receives.” Should a donor unintentionally tip, the company will  refund  it.\n \n\n   \n  Ideally, though, donor advocates would prefer platforms not prepopulate the tip field. “As a watchdog we deeply dislike that,” Styron said. “People are busy and they’re just trying to do a good thing. … Make it something you have to opt in (to) rather than opt out (of).”\n \n\n   \n    What to consider when donating online\n \n\n   \n  How much you’re willing to pay in fees or tips should depend on:\n \n\n   \n   What you can afford:  If money is tight, only donate what feels comfortable,  and let the nonprofit work out the expenses.\n \n\n   \n   What you want to accomplish:  If your goal is to support a good cause, paying a fee or tip that you can afford is one way to make your chosen nonprofit’s job easier. If you make recurring monthly donations, know that the fee and/or tip may be assessed each time.\n \n\n   \n   What is transparent:  If a third-party platform’s explanation of fees or tips is confusing, contact the nonprofit you want to give to and ask for a better explanation. “Donor trust is incredibly important,” Edwards said.\n \n\n   \n  Or, if possible, try to donate directly on that nonprofit’s site and bypass the middleman, Styron suggested.\n \n\n   \n  (For more general questions about making donations online, CharityWatch offers guidance  here .)\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/211-food-assistance-hotline-snap","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-04:00","title":"211 Food Assistance Calls Surge Amid SNAP Benefit Delay, Highlighting National Need for Real-Time Public Health Monitoring","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In late October 2025, calls to the national 211 food assistance hotline surged from around 1,000 per day to over 4,200 per day—quadrupling in just a few days—due to uncertainty over the delivery of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which are vital for low-income Americans.

Kreuter and Rachel Garg, The Conversation\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Between January and mid-October 2025, calls to local 211 helplines from people seeking food pantries in their community  held steady at nearly 1,000 calls per day .\n \n\n   \n  But as the government shutdown entered its fourth week in late October,  states began to warn residents  that  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  benefits, sometimes known as food stamps, would likely be affected. Nearly  42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits  each month.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next several days,  calls to 211 from people seeking food pantries doubled  to over 2,200 per day. Then on Oct. 26, the Trump administration announced that SNAP benefits  would not be arriving  as scheduled in November. The next day, food pantry calls skyrocketed to 3,324. The following day, calls reached 3,870. By Wednesday, it was 4,214.\n \n\n   \n  We are public health scientists  specializing in health communication  and  unmet social needs . We and our colleagues have been working closely with the  211 network of helplines  across the U.S. for 18 years.\n \n\n   \n  Excluding disasters, sudden surges of this magnitude in requests for food or any other need are rare at 211s, and can signal both public worry and need, as happened in the  first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic .\n \n\n   \n    What is 211?\n \n\n   \n  Like 911 for emergencies,  211 is a national three-digit dialing code , launched in 2000, that connects callers to information specialists at the nearest local 211 helpline. Those specialists listen to callers’ needs and provide them with referrals to health and social service providers near them that may be able to help.\n \n\n   \n  Every call to 211 is classified by the need of the caller, such as shelter, rent, utilities or food – each of which has its own code.\n \n\n   \n  Callers are  disproportionately women , most of whom have children or teens living in their homes. Most don’t make enough money to make ends meet. They call 211 seeking help paying rent or utility bills, getting food to feed their family, or securing household necessities like a winter coat for a child, or a mattress.\n \n\n   \n   READ: Who gets SNAP benefits in 5 charts \n \n\n   \n  The hotline does not solve these problems for callers, but 211 information specialists use the most current local information available to refer callers to service agencies that are most likely to have resources to help.\n \n\n   \n  The 211 network is the closest thing the U.S. has to a real-time surveillance system of the needs of low-income Americans.\n \n\n   \n  There are roughly 200 state and local 211s in the U.S., and on an average day they will  collectively field between 35,000 and 40,000 requests  for help. Each request is coded using a taxonomy of over 10,000 need types, is time- and date-stamped, and is linked to the caller’s ZIP code. In addition to phone calls received by their helplines, 211s increasingly track requests they receive online, through their websites. The national network of 211s covers all 50 states and  99% of the U.S. population .\n \n\n   \n  It’s encouraging to us that with each passing year of giving talks and lectures about 211, more and more audience members raise their hands when asked if they’ve ever heard of 211. But it’s far from 100%. If you are one of those with your hand down, here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    Gaining local insights\n \n\n   \n  Our team aims to deploy the latest methods from data science, predictive analytics and artificial intelligence to detect trends in critical needs sooner and at a more localized level, increasing the speed and efficiency of getting needed help to local community members.\n \n\n   \n  Our research has described the  needs of callers  who reach out to 211,  community capacity to respond to callers’ needs , the ability of 211  to detect rapid changes  in community needs, and the benefits of  integrating health referrals  into 211s.\n \n\n   \n   READ: Nation’s most comprehensive report on food insecurity is scrapped \n \n\n   \n  When we saw food requests rising sharply in late October, we reached out to local leaders at 211 call centers to get insights into what they were hearing from callers.\n \n\n   \n  Robin Pokojski, vice president of 211 and community partnerships at United Way of Greater St. Louis, reported that with all the uncertainty around SNAP benefits, callers were initially “anticipating” a need for food pantries. Tiffany Olson, who directs essential services at Crisis Connections and its 211 call center in Washington state, shared that even callers who rely heavily on their SNAP benefits sometimes  need to use food banks as a supplement .\n \n\n   \n  Those callers know that pivoting to rely  solely on food banks probably won’t be enough  to meet their food needs in full. They realize that food pantries and food banks will be more heavily burdened if SNAP benefits are unavailable.\n \n\n   \n    Increasing the impact of 211 data\n \n\n   \n  The trove of daily data on the needs of U.S. callers to 211 at the ZIP code level is unparalleled. Yet for years it was virtually invisible to anyone who didn’t work at a 211 hotline.\n \n\n   \n  Even for people who work and volunteer within the 211 system, formal reporting on caller needs within a community was minimal, such as a one-page annual summary.\n \n\n   \n  That changed in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  Working with 211s across the country, our team created  211 Counts , a collection of user-friendly, public-facing data dashboards for local 211s across the U.S.\n \n\n   \n   READ: Work requirements are better at blocking benefits for low-income people than they are at helping those folks find jobs \n \n\n   \n  The dashboards allow users to explore the top needs in their community, see which neighborhoods are affected most and understand how needs are changing over time. The data can be sorted by legislative districts, school districts and counties to make the findings more relevant to different audiences.\n \n\n   \n  Data on 211 requests are updated each night. Now in its 12th year, 211 Counts includes data on over 90 million requests from 211 callers in all or parts of 44 states. The local dashboards have been visited millions of times.\n \n\n   \n    211 as an early-warning system\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time data collected through 211 hotlines has detected early signs of trouble for some Americans. Just weeks ago, we found that calls from people seeking assistance making car payments have been increasing steadily for five months, with daily calls peaking in October, at nearly twice the rate of May 2025.\n \n\n   \n  Before that, 211s were months ahead of news reporting in seeing public distress  associated with the 2022 baby formula shortage , the  2016 Flint water crisis  and the  2007 subprime mortgage crisis .\n \n\n   \n  When requests for major needs like food increase three- to fourfold overnight, every local 211 is likely to register this abrupt change.\n \n\n   \n  But when less frequent needs, such as car payment assistance, creep up slowly, with an extra call here and there over several months, it’s unlikely that any local 211 hotline would notice.\n \n\n   \n  That’s when the advantages of big data are greatest. By combining caller needs from 211s across the country, patterns emerge that would otherwise be missed. New data science tools are rapidly improving the speed and accuracy of detecting slight changes. When community and national leaders are made aware of potential rising threats, those threats can be tracked more closely and responses prepared.\n \n\n   \n  It’s easy to lose sight of the fact that each data point is a hungry child or a worried parent.\n \n\n   \n  Hotlines and food banks and food pantries need support in this moment to feed people. But most local safety net systems struggle to meet their community’s needs all the time. Data that documents the magnitude of need won’t fix the scarcity of local assistance, but it can help guide communities in allocating limited resources.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/travel/travel-news-airport-divorce-trend","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Why one man says the ‘airport divorce’ is the best way to start a vacation","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This travel article highlights several key trends in global tourism and culture in 2025.

week in travel: a secret garden is a secret no longer in Beijing, one of France’s classic pastries is the subject of a surprising debate, and why some couples are ditching each other at the airport.\n \n\n   \n    Divide and conquer\n \n\n   \n  He likes arriving four hours early for a domestic flight and then chilling in the lounge. She prefers to have a pre-flight cocktail and browse the duty free options. What’s a couple to do? Welcome to “ the airport divorce .”\n \n\n   \n  British travel journalist Huw Oliver coined the phrase to explain how he and his fiancee go through airport security together, split up for different airport activities (having a beer, trying out perfumes, obsessively watching the departures screen), and then reunite on board the plane.\n \n\n   \n  Some people might just call this “compromising,” but Oliver says the airport divorce has done wonders for his relationship — and it sets the tone for a happy vacation.\n \n\n   \n    Secret garden\n \n\n   \n  Many travelers love being able to say they’re among the first to go somewhere. Now, visitors to Beijing’s Forbidden City complex can access Qianlong, a secret garden  that has been closed for a century .\n \n\n   \n  Timed for the 100th anniversary of the Palace Museum’s opening, the Chinese attraction features rockeries, symbolic figurines believed to ward off fire and destruction, and a discreet entrance that gives you a sense of what it felt like to be the Emperor sneaking into his personal green space.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has been a surprisingly big year for opening up formerly secret places, both above and under ground.\n \n\n   \n  The Comodus Tunnel, a secret passageway used by Roman emperors to access the Colosseum,  just opened to the public  this fall.\n \n\n   \n  And in London, a mile-long tunnel complex used during World War II is being converted into an underground attraction, which will house a museum, an arts center, and — best of all —  the world’s lowest licensed bar . CNN got an exclusive look inside.\n \n\n   \n    Plush plus one\n \n\n   \n  A Japanese hotel group has launched a program to accommodate guests’ plus-ones. No, they don’t mean babies. Or pets. They’re talking about stuffed toys of your favorite characters.\n \n\n   \n  The Toyoko Inn chain has launched a “Sleepover With Your Plushie” program in 56 hotels across Japan, saying it wants to capitalize on the social media fad of taking plush toys and dolls (that means you, Labubu) and posting photos of them on vacation.\n \n\n   \n  “We noticed that some guests were using the bedside area like a stage, arranging their plushies and other “oshi” (fan) items to take creative photos,” a rep for Toyoko said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Under this program, plushies will get beds, PJs, pillows and comforters, all made of the same materials as the human versions — and it only costs an extra $2 per night. This really gives “plush hotel” a whole new meaning.\n \n\n   \n    Pastry problems\n \n\n   \n  Yes, it looks like a pain au chocolat, but don’t call it that in Bordeaux or you may find yourself in a shouting match.\n \n\n   \n  Most of France calls the beloved pastry pain au chocolat, but in the Bordeaux region they call it a chocolatine. Meanwhile, you’ll need to order a “couque au chocolat” in the Ardennes, a “petit pain au chocolat” in Hauts-de-France, and – possible sacrilege? – a “croissant au chocolat” in Grand Est.\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Richard Quest gets to the bottom of this ongoing linguistic debate.

Rare footage shows sucker fish as they whale-surf in the ocean’s wildest joyride \n       \n  Story by Associated Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:18 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  There are easier ways to cross an ocean, but few are as slick or stylish as the remora’s whale-surfing joyride.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists  tracking humpbacks  off the coast of  Australia  have captured rare footage that shows clutches of the freeloading fish peeling away from their host in what looks like a high-speed game of chicken, just moments before the whale breaches.\n \n\n   \n  As the humpback plunges back below the surface the remoras, also known as sucker fish, return to the whale, sticking their landings with the timing and precision of Olympic gymnasts. It’s elegant work for a hitchhiking fish that lives upside-down and survives on dead skin flakes.\n \n\n   \n  Remora australis spend their lives aboard whales or other large marine mammals, which they ride like giant cruise ships, breeding and feeding their way across stretches of ocean. The species has an adhesive plate on its head that helps to create a kind of vacuum seal, allowing the fish to grab a whale and hang on for the ride.\n \n\n   \n    On whale cams, clingy fish steal the show\n \n\n   \n  The marine scientist who recorded the accidental close-ups of the remoras’ high-speed whale surfing had placed suction-cup cameras on humpbacks during their annual migration from Antarctica to the waters off Australia’s Queensland state.\n \n\n   \n  Olaf Meynecke planned to study whale behavior, but his video feeds regularly filled with dozens of photobombing remoras, which rode in groups of up to 50 as they clung to the same spots where his cameras were attached.\n \n\n   \n  “Whenever the whale was breaching and doing in particular fast movements it appears that the sucker fish were responding very quickly to the movements,” said Meynecke, from the Whales and Climate Research Program at Griffith University.\n \n\n   \n  “They knew exactly when to let go of the body of the whale before it was breaching the surface of the water and then returned to the same spot only seconds later.”\n \n\n   \n    A hitchhiker with good instincts\n \n\n   \n  Remoras are harmless to the 40-metric-ton (44-U.S.-ton) giants of the ocean, feeding on the whales’ dead skin and sea lice in a mutually beneficial arrangement — or at least that’s what scientists say. Meynecke said his footage suggested the whales found their hangers-on annoying.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve had individuals with high numbers of these remoras and they were continually breaching and there were no other whales that they were communicating with,” he said. “It appeared that they’re trying to just get rid of some of these remoras and they were checking whether they had less after they breached.”\n \n\n   \n    The journey’s end remains a mystery\n \n\n   \n  Australia’s so-called humpback highway is a migratory corridor traversed by 40,000 of the mammals, bringing them close to the country’s eastern coastlines for months each year as they move from icy Antarctic waters to the balmy seas off the coast of Queensland and back.\n \n\n   \n  How long much of the 10,000-km (6,000-mile) journey is undertaken by the freeloading fish, which only live for about two years, is still a puzzle, Meynecke said.\n \n\n   \n  “I suspect that the majority would probably leave at some point, maybe in temperate waters, but then where do they go?” he said. “Do they find other species that they can then use as a host and wait until the humpback whales have come back?”\n \n\n   \n  In the absence of whales, sucker fish avoid predators by seeking other large creatures to latch onto, including manta rays, dolphins and unlucky scuba divers.\n \n\n   \n  “Much to the annoyance of the divers, of course,” Meynecke said. “They’re not easy to get rid of.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/biden-democracy-wrecking-ball-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"12:28:00-05:00","title":"Biden says Trump has ‘taken a wrecking ball’ to democracy in sharp criticism","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former President Joe Biden delivered a sharp public critique of President Donald Trump, accusing him of using a 'wrecking ball' metaphor to destroy democratic institutions, including the White House East Wing, the Constitution, and the rule of law.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former President  Joe Biden  delivered a strong critique of his successor Friday, arguing to a room of supporters that President  Donald Trump  has “taken a wrecking ball” to democracy.\n \n\n   \n  “I knew Trump was going to taking a wrecking ball to the country, but I had no idea, I have to admit, I didn’t know there was going to be an actual wrecking ball,” Biden said at a gala hosted in Omaha by the Nebraska Democratic party, referring to Trump’s  demolition of the the White House’s East Wing  to build a 90,000-square foot ballroom.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a perfect symbol of his presidency,” Biden said. “Trump has taken a wrecking ball not only to the people’s house but to the Constitution, to the rule of law, to our very democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden also mocked Trump’s repeated declarations that his second term has brought  “a golden age”  to the country.\n \n\n   \n  “He now says we are quote ‘in a golden age.’ The only gold is the stuff he’s hanging on the mantle,” the former president said, referring to Trump’s  gilded additions to the Oval Office .\n \n\n   \n  At times during the remarks, Biden addressed Trump directly. In one instance, the former president said to Trump, “You act in a way that embarrasses us as a nation, quite frankly.”   \n \n\n   \n  He also criticized Trump for prioritizing the interests of his wealthy allies over the American people.\n \n\n   \n  “You work for us, Mr. President. We don’t work for you. You work for us, not just billionaires and millionaires,” Biden said, adding, “I’m angry.”\n \n\n   \n  The former president also discussed his  prostate cancer diagnosis , just weeks after ringing the bell to commemorate the completion of a course of radiation therapy. Biden tied his personal experience with the illness to the importance of health care.\n \n\n   \n  “I thank God for the doctors and the nurses and the incredible breakthroughs we’re making in cancer research,” Biden said. “Now Trump and his Republican friends are cutting government funding for health care and making it more expensive, more expensive for virtually everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden’s remarks come as the country is in the longest government shutdown in history, with the stalemate centered around the issue of health care subsidies. Democrats are refusing to support Republicans’ bill to fund the government because it doesn’t extend the  Affordable Care Act enhanced premium subsidies , which are set to expire at the end of the year.\n \n\n   \n  Biden also weighed in on the Democrats’ sweeping victory in Tuesday’s election, loudly exclaiming, “The Democratic party is back!”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats won across the spectrum Tuesday with  Zohran Mamdani  elected mayor of New York City, while  Abigail Spanberger  and  Mikie Sherrill  won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively. In California, a Democrat-backed  ballot measure on redistricting  was also approved by voters.\n \n\n   \n  He argued that the wins demonstrate that “the American people are sending a message … to Trump and to his crowd,” denouncing Trump’s policies.\n \n\n   \n  Hitting a familiar note from his campaign last year, Biden went on to stress the fragility of democracy and urged the room of supporters “to put in the work” to defend it.\n \n\n   \n  “Democracy is not a given,” Biden said. “There is nothing guaranteed about democracy even in America. You have to put in the work. We have to elect the leaders who believe in democracy, who stand up for it, who defend it, who protect it.”\n \n\n   \n  Biden later added, “I know this nation. I know the American people. And here’s what I know: No one, no one, not even the president, can destroy our democracy if we stand together and fight for it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/06/asia/typhoon-kalmaegi-philippines-damage-vietnam-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"12:53:00-05:00","title":"Typhoon Kalmaegi slams into Vietnam after unleashing deadly destruction in the Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons on record to hit Vietnam, devastated the Philippines and central Vietnam in November 2025, killing nearly 200 people and displacing over half a million.

saturated by floods due to record rainfall.\n \n\n   \n  The typhoon left a trail of death and devastation as it tore through the central Philippines on Tuesday, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and displacing tens of thousands of people. At least 188 people were killed, most in Cebu province, a tourist hotspot, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  Kalmaegi strengthened as it barreled toward the coast of Vietnam Thursday, carrying maximum sustained winds of 125 mph, records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) showed.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have  long warned  the human-caused climate crisis – for which industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility – has only exacerbated the scale and intensity of regional storms that disproportionately impact populations in the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  In the Philippines, survivors have begun the mammoth task of salvaging belongings and digging through the thick mud and debris of their destroyed homes, as the receding floodwaters exposed widespread devastation.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile another typhoon, Fung-Wong, known locally as Uwan, is hurtling towards the Philippines’ northern islands, posing a renewed threat of deadly storm surge, flooding and damage.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know:\n \n\n   \n    Homes damaged in Vietnam\n \n\n   \n  Residents began to assess the storm’s damage on Friday, with reports of houses collapsed, roofs b﻿lown off buildings, trees downed, and more than 1 million people left without power, according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  At least five people were killed and seven injured, state media Vietnam News reported, citing local authorities. One person was killed when a house collapsed during the storm in central Vietnam, and three people remain missing after being swept out to sea on Ly Son, an island in Vietnam’s Quang Ngai province, according to state media.\n \n\n   \n  Heavy rains unleashed by Kalmaegi also flooded coastal communities in Dak Lak province, which recorded 354 mm (1 foot) of rain in about six hours, Vietnam News reported.\n \n\n   \n  More than 500,000 people were evacuated, many by boat, the Associated Press reported.\n \n\n   \n  The typhoon hit as the country struggles to recover from devastating flooding last week that submerged historical sites including the ancient town of Hoi An and former imperial capital Hue.\n \n\n   \n  During those floods, more than a dozen people were killed and over 116,000 houses and 5,000 hectares of crops flooded, Reuters reported, citing the government’s disaster agency.\n \n\n   \n  Kalmaegi weakened into a tropical depression on Friday as it moved farther inland from central Vietnam, toward northern Cambodia and Laos, according to the Vietnam National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Strong, damaging winds remain a threat and continued heavy rains could trigger further flash floods and landslides in central Vietnam over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n    Homes turned to rubble\n \n\n   \n  The scale of the disaster in the Philippines’ hardest-hit Cebu province and surrounding areas took residents and local officials by surprise.\n \n\n   \n  Drone footage showed catastrophic flooding that turned streets into rivers, submerged homes and overturned cars as Typhoon Kalmaegi, known locally as Tino, dumped more than a month’s worth of rain in only 24 hours in some areas.\n \n\n   \n  In Talisay city, rows of homes were flattened and impoverished communities along the Mananga River were buried in mud and debris. In Cebu city, rescue workers could be seen wading through waist-deep water to free trapped residents from roofs and submerged homes.\n \n\n   \n  Kalmaegi is the deadliest typhoon to hit the region this year.

leaves Americans scrambling \n       \n  By Eric Bradner, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The impacts of the longest federal  government shutdown  in United States history are reverberating around the country — leaving millions of Americans in limbo and igniting concerns about an economic downturn.\n \n\n   \n  Frustrated travelers were scrambling as more than a thousand  flights were canceled  Friday and thousands more were delayed. Those who count on food stamps were in limbo as President Donald Trump’s administration continued  fighting in federal court  to resist paying full benefits for November. Federal workers who  haven’t been paid  in weeks said their bills were due and they were running out of options.\n \n\n   \n  With Congress in a stalemate — majority Republicans still short of the 60 votes they need to pass a government funding measure in the Senate, and minority Democrats sticking to their health insurance funding demands — no end to the shutdown is in sight.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican,  told reporters  Friday that the “wheels came off” in compromise talks with Democrats. He told senators to remain in Washington and available for votes this weekend. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would agree to end the shutdown in exchange for one more year of enhanced  Affordable Care Act subsidies  — an attempt to further pressure the GOP to make a deal.\n \n\n   \n  The uncertainty over when the shutdown might end has led to deepening concerns about damage it could do to the overall economy — with one of Trump’s top economic officials sounding the alarm on Friday. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Fox Business that the economic impact of the shutdown is “far worse” than initially expected “because it’s gone on for so long.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we go another month or so, then who knows how bad the economy could be this quarter,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Frustrated travelers see flights canceled, delayed\n \n\n   \n  A 4% reduction in domestic flights ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration took effect Friday, leading to more than a thousand canceled flights across 40 major airports — with further cuts slated for the weekend due to air traffic controller staffing issues.\n \n\n   \n  In addition to the cancellations, major airports — including those in Washington, Atlanta, San Francisco and Newark — were experiencing major delays due to short-staffed control towers.\n \n\n   \n  Travelers across the country told CNN they feared their plans being upended.\n \n\n   \n  Alicia Leva was set to get married Saturday in South Florida. But with more than half of her guests attending from across the country, Leva said she saw travel plans unraveling fast.\n \n\n   \n  “When I found out about the flight delays, I was just incredibly anxious,” she said. Leva didn’t want to compare her wedding woes to others who have been deeply affected by the government shutdown, but was still mourning her original vision of the couple’s special day.\n \n\n   \n  Traveler Jay Curley had hoped to fly to Wilmington, North Carolina, from Newark International Airport on Thursday night, but was instead going to rent a car, he told CNN in frustration Friday morning.\n \n\n   \n  “People are really hurting out here,” he said. Addressing federal lawmakers, he added: “It’s not just the traveling public, but it’s affecting the whole economy, and you people are to blame.”\n \n\n   \n  When Luana Griffin’s mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer this past week, she booked a flight to go spend a few days with her. Griffin’s trip, from San Diego to Sacramento, is planned for next week, she told CNN. Griffin said she has limited windows of time to be able to see her mom because she is working a contract job. Any delay or cancellation of her return flight could cause her to miss work the next day, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “I have very limited time left with my mom and so many other decisions, this is the last thing I need,” she told CNN in an email.\n \n\n   \n    ‘From bad to worse’\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge on Thursday  ruled  that the Trump administration needed to fully pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for more than 40 million Americans this month, rather than the partial payments the administration had proposed.\n \n\n   \n  “The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened and needless suffering will occur. That’s what irreparable harm here means. Last weekend, SNAP benefits lapsed for the first time in our nation’s history. This is a problem that could have and should have been avoided,” US District Judge John McConnell said during Thursday’s hearing in Rhode Island.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture then announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and that the process should be completed later in the day. Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in the coming days.\n \n\n   \n  But later Friday, the Supreme Court  temporarily paused  the lower court order requiring full payment of benefits, injecting more uncertainty into whether food stamp recipients would see their full allotments anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  Zacherie Martin, 35, of Bremerton, Washington, said he and his girlfriend are out of work and rely on food stamps in part because they can never predict whether local food banks will have food available.\n \n\n   \n  He said he’s been following news about the government shutdown “very closely,” and is struggling to plan, given the uncertainty around whether and what amount of SNAP benefits he’ll receive.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m worried if I’m going to even be able to eat at all before Thanksgiving — or at all tomorrow night, or tonight, even,” Martin said.\n \n\n   \n  Laura Bowles, a pregnant mother of five children, ages 4 to 13, in West Virginia, is trying to make her husband’s paycheck from Walmart stretch to feed their family and pay the bills this month. She  told CNN  earlier this week that her growing family has already made some tough choices this month after their SNAP benefits didn’t replenish on the first.\n \n\n   \n  “My kids eat a lot. And groceries are already so expensive these days. It was already hard,” Bowles said. “It’s a struggle out here. I am pregnant again, and that wasn’t part of the plan — but it was God’s plan. I guess people struggle everywhere, but it’s hard here in West Virginia. It just feels extra hard here. And this just made things go from bad to worse. Way worse.”\n \n\n   \n  Cuts or delays in SNAP benefits could also hurt the stores that sell to its recipients — particularly smaller grocers.\n \n\n   \n  SNAP accounted for $124 billion in sales at 262,000 retailers in 2023 — half of which were at superstores such as Walmart. A quarter of sales went to supermarkets.\n \n\n   \n  Large chains such as Walmart, Kroger, and Dollar General can absorb cuts to SNAP. It’s the small, independent grocers that depend on SNAP for up to half of their sales to sustain razor-thin profit margins that are most vulnerable to cuts, economists and grocers say.\n \n\n   \n  Progressive think tank Center for American Progress in May identified 27,000 retailers — mostly in rural areas with large shares of SNAP recipients — likeliest to shoulder the brunt of cuts to SNAP. In dozens of small counties and tribal areas, more than 30% or 40% of the population receives SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n    Federal workers under mounting pressure\n \n\n   \n  Though many of them have remained on the job, most federal workers haven’t been paid during the shutdown. Some of them told CNN that bills are now piling up.\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Morales, a nurse who works at a military base in El Paso, Texas, said she was able to make rent for October and November, but can’t go any further without pay. She said she’s not sure how she’s going to afford her car and insurance payments, gas, groceries, dog food and utilities this month without a paycheck. She said her landlord won’t work with her, and she doesn’t know where she’ll live if the shutdown doesn’t end soon.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not eligible for unemployment, because we are still reporting to work, so that disqualifies us for benefits,” she said. “I will have to look for another job this month if the government continues to be shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  At a recent job fair in McLean, Virginia, hosted by RockITGov, furloughed federal workers offered sobering accounts of what they face. They asked not to be named in order to speak candidly.\n \n\n   \n  “I haven’t gotten a paycheck. I’m trying to find a way to support my family. I have a young family,” one federal worker said. “We’re trying to figure out next steps, what our finances look like.”\n \n\n   \n  A nine-year Pentagon employee who took the deferred resignation offer in May said she was supposed to be paid through December, but hasn’t received a paycheck since early October because of the shutdown. She said she’s planning to skip holiday travel and gift-giving.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m concerned about my car payments. I’ll probably call the bank and see if I can skip a car payment,” she said. “I may have to take money from my retirement if my savings run out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/europe/pope-leo-six-months-in-american-flavor-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"05:19:00-04:00","title":"Six months in, Pope Leo is bringing an American flavor to the papacy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pope Leo XIV, the first U.S.-born pope elected on May 8, 2025, is bringing a distinctly American voice to the Vatican after six months in office.

   \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Pope Leo XIV, who on Saturday marked six months since his election, has in recent weeks stepped up his criticism of the Trump administration while bringing a distinctively American flavor to the papacy.\n \n\n   \n  The Chicago-born pontiff was elected on May 8, becoming the first US-born pope in the Catholic Church’s history. After a cautious start,  Leo  has now begun to find his voice and on Tuesday called for a “deep reflection” on what has been happening to  immigrants  in the United States over recent months under President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “Many people who have lived for years, and years and years, never causing problems, have been deeply affected by what’s going on right now,” he told reporters outside the papal retreat of Castel Gandolfo.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking in English, and thereby ensuring he could reach his intended audience directly, the pope pointed out that Christian teaching spells out that believers will be judged on how they treated “the foreigner.” He also appealed to authorities to respect the “spiritual rights” of those detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in his home state of Illinois. His remarks come after  reports  that priests and pastoral workers have been unable to bring communion to those detained.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time Leo has spoken on this topic. He has lamented the  “inhuman” treatment of migrants in the US  while urging bishops in his home country to speak out. He’s also expressed concern about tensions between the US and Canada, and the US and Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  While the pope has a more reserved, formal style than his predecessor, he is continuing Francis’ priorities. At one level, Leo represents continuity with Francis – the first Latin American pontiff – given he spent decades in Peru as a missionary. He retains a close connection with the people of Peru and remains a citizen of the country.\n \n\n   \n  “His front-burner issues seem to be poverty, migration, climate change, and he’s a big champion of the project of synodality started by Francis – the effort to make the Catholic Church more inclusive and participatory,” Christopher White, author of “Pope Leo XIV: Inside the Conclave and the Dawn of a New Papacy” and a senior fellow at Georgetown University in Washington DC, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  White insists that Leo “isn’t looking for a fight – with Trump or anyone,” but said he has “moral red lines” and is “particularly upset” about the treatment of migrants.\n \n\n   \n  Following Leo’s remarks on Tuesday, a spokesman for the White House told Reuters that Trump was elected based on commitments to deporting “criminal illegal aliens” and that “he is keeping his promise to the American people.” The US Department for Homeland Security said those detained by ICE were held in humane conditions.\n \n\n   \n  A US-born pope who is a keen sports fan and native English speaker is something of a novelty for the Vatican. Leo is a  big supporter of the Chicago White Sox  and on October 15, days after the rival Chicago Cubs were eliminated from the playoffs, the pope was out greeting crowds in St. Peter’s Square. “Go Cubs!” someone shouted out. “They lost!” Leo shouted back, smiling, from the popemobile. Since his election, he’s been presented with a White Sox cap and baseball and NFL jerseys.\n \n\n   \n  Aside from sports paraphernalia, he’s also been presented with other reminders from home: on one occasion while out in the popemobile he was hand-delivered a  box of Chicago pizza from Aurelio’s , with  Leo a regular visitor  to one of their restaurants in Homewood, Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  “He has offered a forceful and direct counterweight to the Trump administration’s ‘inhuman treatment of immigrants’,” Kim Daniels, the director of The Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at also at Georgetown told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  She said while Leo is “not retreating” from speaking out on what is happening in the US he’s not making it “personal or political”. Daniels says Leo speaks “as a moral and spiritual leader, and as someone with roots in both Chicago and Chiclayo (Peru).”\n \n\n   \n  Massimo Faggioli, a church historian at Trinity College, Dublin, who was previously based at Villanova University, Pennsylvania, said the pope’s interventions on immigration in recent weeks were significant for US Catholic leaders.\n \n\n   \n  “He has stepped up in directly addressing the issues,” he told CNN. “It’s also part of the message of the US bishops, so they will feel encouraged by what is coming from the pope.”\n \n\n   \n  Bishops from the US will meet November 10-13 in Baltimore, where they are due to elect a new president and vice-president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. In the coming months, Leo is expected to appoint a new Archbishop of New York to succeed Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who has reached the retirement age of 75. The pope has called for the US bishops to have a  “stronger, more united voice”  on issues such as immigration and said that “the church cannot remain silent.”\n \n\n   \n  Leaders such as Cardinal Robert McElroy of Washington DC and Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago have been  speaking out strongly on migration , but the forthcoming elections and the pope’s appointments to the US church hierarchy will be crucial. During the Francis era, some bishops were resistant to his agenda and priorities, and some conservative Catholics had hoped Leo would represent a break with his predecessor.\n \n\n   \n  But Faggioli insists that after the first six months, anyone who believed Leo would be an “an anti-Francis or post-Francis pope” is “fooling themselves.” Like Francis, Leo has faced criticism from conservative  US Catholics and MAGA supporters , angered by his comments on migration and climate change.\n \n\n   \n  Leo has a full plate and plenty of big decisions to make. He’s been keeping up an intense schedule of meetings and public events as the Catholic Church continues to celebrate a Jubilee year – which takes place every quarter of a century – with an increased number of pilgrims coming to the Vatican.\n \n\n   \n  Later this month, he embarks on his first foreign visit as pope – travelling to Turkey and Lebanon from 27 November to 2 December – during which he’s expected to emphasize peace in the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  When he emerged on the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica in early May, Leo seemed almost overcome with emotion. But after spending these first months acclimatizing to his new role, the first American pope is slowly getting into his stride.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/middleeast/israel-receives-remains-hostage-gaza-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"07:29:00-04:00","title":"Israel Identifies Deceased Hostage from Gaza Following Fourth Such Transfer This Week","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israel has identified the remains of Command Sergeant Major Lior Rudaeff, a deputy security coordinator killed in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack at Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, marking the fourth transfer of deceased hostages from Gaza to Israel this week.

He was the deputy security coordinator for the community’s rapid response team. His remains were held in Gaza throughout the course of the war sparked by that attack.\n \n\n   \n  Hamas transferred the remains to Israel via the Red Cross. The return means the bodies of five deceased hostages remain in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  Transfers of deceased hostages from Hamas to Israel is one of the key conditions of the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Israel  received the bodies  of Israeli-American Omer Neutra, as well as those of Asaf Hamami and Oz Daniel. Two days later, Israel received the body of Itay Chen, the  last Israeli-American dual citizen  whose remains were held in Gaza. And on Wednesday, Hamas transferred  the remains of Joshua Loitu Mollel , a Tanzanian agricultural student who was abducted from Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7, 2023.\n \n\n   \n  Adm. Brad Cooper, the commander of US Central Command, spoke at Neutra’s funeral in Israel on Friday. “Omer made the ultimate sacrifice we hope no soldier ever has to make, but many have made it nonetheless, in service to a higher cause,” Cooper said. “We express our deepest condolences for the loss of Omer.”\n \n\n   \n  The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has continued to organize  rallies  in Tel Aviv and elsewhere across Israel calling for the release of the remaining deceased hostages. Eitan Horn, who was  recently freed  after 738 days in captivity, said in Hostages Square on Saturday, “I cannot begin my journey of healing and recovery as long as I know there are families who are not with me on this journey. We have no future without the return of all the hostages.”\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this week, CNN also reported that Israel believes it has new information about the location of the longest-held remains in Gaza, belonging to Lt.  Hadar Goldin , who was killed in the final days of the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas. Goldin’s remains, according to two Israeli sources, are likely held in Rafah in southern Gaza near an area where up to 200 Hamas militants are hiding in underground tunnels in territory occupied by Israeli forces.\n \n\n   \n    Catch-up immunization campaign for Gaza’s children\n \n\n   \n  In war-ravaged Gaza, the United Nations announced an immunization campaign to reach thousands of Palestinian children who have missed essential vaccines since the start of the conflict over two years ago.\n \n\n   \n  “UNRWA, together with UNICEF, WHO, and partners, is launching a catch-up immunization campaign to reach 44,000 children with life-saving vaccines and malnutrition screening,” UNRWA, the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement comes as the death toll of Palestinians in Gaza since October 7, 2023 exceeded 69,000 on Saturday, according to Gaza’s health ministry.\n \n\n   \n  Since the ceasefire with Israel came into effect in October, 241 people have been killed in Gaza, while the bodies of 522 Palestinians have been recovered from under the rubble, the ministry added.\n \n\n   \n  Aid has resumed flowing into the enclave after the ceasefire came into effect last month, but the scale of the need remains high after months of meager shipments.\n \n\n   \n  At least 460 people in Gaza died of starvation, including 154 children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, since Hamas launched its attack on Israel in October 2023 prompting a relentless Israeli bombardment campaign.\n \n\n   \n  The UN has said that more than one million children are in need of mental health and psychosocial support.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian families are also at risk of facing a winter without “desperately needed protection from the elements,” according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The UN-coordinated entry of essential shelter materials and tents into the enclave faces “major limitations,” the agency added.\n \n\n   \n  Last winter, several children and adults died from hypothermia as a result of the cold and the lack of winter supplies.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/ups-plane-crash-victims-louisville","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"21:45:00-22:45","title":"3 Employees of Louisville Facility Among Those Missing After UPS Plane Crash That Looked Like ‘Hell’s Fury,’ Owner Says","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS cargo plane crashed into the Grade A Auto Parts facility in Louisville, Kentucky, shortly after takeoff, causing a catastrophic explosion and fire that resulted in at least 14 fatalities, including three employees of the facility and three crew members from UPS.

that looked like ‘hell’s fury,’ owner says \n       \n  By Isabel Rosales, Dalia Faheid, Jason Morris, Taylor Galgano, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:45 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The power had just gone off and the ground was shaking at Grade A Auto Parts when the owner received a panicked video call from his chief financial officer.\n \n\n   \n  On his screen, CEO Sean Garber watched a “huge fireball” engulf the Louisville, Kentucky, auto-part and recycling facility he has owned for decades as his colleague described a blast followed by “a continuation of explosions.”\n \n\n   \n  “It looked like really hell’s fury around her,” Garber recalled, describing seeing his employees screaming and running from the flames.\n \n\n   \n  A UPS cargo plane had just  slammed into the facility  shortly after taking off from a nearby airport Tuesday, leaving at least  14 people dead  and multiple families with missing loved ones, Kentucky officials said. Three of Garber’s employees are among those still unaccounted for.\n \n\n   \n  Three crew members aboard the freight plane are believed to be among those found dead, Kentucky officials said. UPS identified them Thursday as Captain Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Captain Dana Diamond.\n \n\n   \n  As flames raged and doors melted shut at the recycling facility, people jumped from windows and ran, some employees helping shield others from the growing inferno, the owner said.\n \n\n   \n  The collision left behind a fiery trail of destruction and  a half-mile-long debris field , devastating multiple small businesses like Grade A Auto Parts, where mangled, blackened remnants of buildings were set in the background of an “apocalyptic” ashy sky with an acrid smell in the air, Kentucky officials said.\n \n\n   \n  Officials are now losing hope there could be more survivors as bodies are pulled from the vast wreckage and the death toll grows.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not expect to find anyone else alive in the area,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said at a news conference Wednesday, adding the coroner’s office is working to identify remains found at the crash site, but the conditions of some victims’ bodies may make their task more difficult.\n \n\n   \n  Now, some Louisville residents are mourning those killed as others are enduring an agonizing wait to hear from missing loved ones, including the workers’ families and two men who said they  have not heard from  a woman believed to have been at Grade A Auto Parts when the crash happened.\n \n\n   \n    ‘She’s all I got’\n \n\n   \n  A woman had been dropping off some scrap metal at Grade A Auto Parts after work when the freight plane crashed, her boyfriend, Donald Henderson, told CNN affiliate  WDRB  Tuesday night.\n \n\n   \n  “‘I don’t want to go, (you) go ahead,’” Henderson recalled telling her.\n \n\n   \n  Video of the scene shows a mountainous plume of charcoal-colored smoke emanating from buildings that were set ablaze. In another chilling video at the facility, a man yells, “Did everybody make it out?” When another person responds, “No,” he screams, “What do you mean no?”\n \n\n   \n  Henderson went to a family assistance center authorities set up at the Louisville police training academy with William Moreland, who shares two children with the missing woman. Both struggled to put how they’re feeling into words.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s all I got, so … I don’t know how this is going to turn out,” Henderson told WDRB.\n \n\n   \n  The two men said officials at the center took their information and promised to “give us the news as it comes in.”\n \n\n   \n  “I had to go – I can’t be in there,” Henderson   said about being in the center with other emotional families desperately awaiting word on the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n \n\n   \n  Grade A Auto Parts – one of  two small businesses  the governor says were directly impacted by the plane – is now trying to access its computer system to help officials identify customers who were at the facility when the crash happened, according to Garber. It’s unclear exactly how many customers were at the facility at the time, but Garber says there are typically between 15 to 30 customers around that time.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s been bodies found. Many of them are not recognizable, and they’re trying to figure that out,” Garber said.\n \n\n   \n    ‘He was a great guy’\n \n\n   \n  John Loucks, a 52-year-old beloved uncle who worked on and off at Grade A Auto Parts for at least a decade, is one of the missing victims, according to his nephew Justin Loucks.\n \n\n   \n  The Louisville Metro Police Department told their family that John Loucks’ body has not been located and that they are conducting DNA testing of the remains. The lack of answers, Justin Loucks said, is difficult.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s scary really,” Loucks told CNN. “Did he die on impact? Did he land in the woods somewhere?”\n \n\n   \n  “We were told (DNA testing) could take weeks or even longer,” he added. “(Police) said there’s a lot of remains still getting recovered and a lot of them are unrecognizable.”\n \n\n   \n  Loucks said he was very close to his uncle growing up, but that they had a disagreement about a year and a half ago. “Officially, he’s still just missing … but it sucks knowing I’m not able to reconcile with him. That’s the hardest part about all this,” Loucks said.\n \n\n   \n  The pair spent a lot of time together playing video games and watching sports, he added.\n \n\n   \n  John Loucks, who lived around Louisville his entire life, loved the Kentucky Wildcats basketball team and fishing, his nephew said. But most importantly, his nephew added, Loucks loved working as a heavy machinery operator.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s what he loved doing. He loved waking up and going to work everyday,” Justin Loucks said. “He was a great guy.”\n \n\n   \n  As the holidays approach, Justin Loucks remembers spending most of them with his uncle and says he will be thinking of him during the upcoming season.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s always hope, but given the governor’s statement … I don’t feel there’s as much chance (he’s still alive), but hey, God works in mysterious ways,” the nephew said. “You never know.”\n \n\n   \n    Headcount revealed missing employees\n \n\n   \n  After the plane collapsed into Garber’s business – apparently coming to rest in the heart of the facility – a headcount revealed three employees were unaccounted for, he said.\n \n\n   \n  Two of the missing employees had been in a building where people jumped from windows to escape the flames after the heat melted the doors shut, Garber said. The third person was believed to be in a warehouse next door.\n \n\n   \n  The incoming plane looked like a rapidly approaching fireball to one of the managers, who tackled a colleague to the floor before they found themselves standing in a burning room, Garber said he later learned.\n \n\n   \n  “There were just so many heroes helping each other out,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  An employee dove between two metal bales that surround the facility to quickly carry a customer who had been burned to safety.\n \n\n   \n  “I would have to imagine it is what a war zone looks like,” Garber said.\n \n\n   \n  As he surveyed the damage Wednesday, Garber said he had lost hope that his employees were still alive. “It’s not survivable,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  One of the missing employees had been with the business for about two decades, Garber said. The second had been working there for about five years and the third had been employed there for about four years.\n \n\n   \n  When Garber met with their families at a family assistance center early Wednesday morning, he noticed they were in a state of shock, made worse by the uncertainty.\n \n\n   \n  “There still isn’t resolution for them,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Garber feels both anger and sorrow thinking about the employees and customers whose loved ones are still searching for.\n \n\n   \n  “We make our money by providing a service to our customers. People came in just to do that,” Garber said. “They didn’t get to go home and that’s a problem and that’s heartbreaking.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/americas/iran-assassination-plot-israeli-ambassador-mexico-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"20:47:00-05:00","title":"Elite Iranian unit plotted assassination of Israeli ambassador to Mexico, US official says","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A US official has revealed that an elite Iranian military unit, specifically the Quds Force of the IRGC, plotted to assassinate Israeli ambassador Einat Kranz Neiger in Mexico, beginning at the end of 2024 and continuing into early 2025.

\n  The plan, hatched by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) Quds Force, was initiated at the end of 2024 and was active through the first half of this year, said the official who spoke on

In August, Australia expelled the Iranian ambassador after the country’s intelligence agency found that Iran was behind at least two antisemitic attacks on Australian soil.

SNAP benefits for November \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Devan Cole, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:27 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture announced Friday it is working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and the process should be completed later in the day.\n \n\n   \n  Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA’s guidance, posted on the  agency’s website , is the latest step in a weekslong saga that has threatened vital food assistance for nearly 42 million Americans amid the federal government shutdown. A federal judge on Thursday directed the agency to provide  full benefits , which the Trump administration quickly appealed.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA told states last month that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are formally known, had run out of money so  November’s benefits could not be distributed . The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling that the agency must at least tap into emergency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to  fund partial benefits , but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. That led the plaintiffs in one case to argue that the judge should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not yet known what the administration’s compliance will mean for the legal challenge pending before US District Judge John McConnell, who ordered the administration on Thursday to make full SNAP payments by the end of Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Friday, the administration asked a Boston-based appeals court to halt McConnell’s order, but the appeals court had not issued a decision by the time the administration said publicly that it was complying with his directive.\n \n\n   \n  Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, with payments distributed on a staggered schedule throughout the month. Households receive about $350 a month, on average.\n \n\n   \n    Full benefits start to flow\n \n\n   \n  Just when food stamp beneficiaries will receive their assistance depends on where they live. Some states are expected to issue benefits immediately, while others may require a little more time.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania residents who should have already received their SNAP benefits this month will start seeing their full allotments hit their electronic benefit transfer cards on Friday, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced at a press conference. State officials worked quickly after McConnell’s ruling to issue benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that by this evening, by midnight or so, that all of those individuals who were owed money over the first week or so of this month, who hadn’t gotten it from the federal administration, are going to get their money,” Shapiro said.\n \n\n   \n  West Virginia also notified SNAP recipients on Friday afternoon that the state is sending full payments for November due to the court order.\n \n\n   \n  New Yorkers can expect to receive their SNAP benefits starting Sunday, according to a statement from Gov. Kathy Hochul. And Massachusetts residents will start receiving their delayed benefits as early as Saturday, Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, North Carolina started distributing partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday morning in line with the USDA’s guidance earlier this week on providing partial benefits. Recipients could see their remaining allotments hit their cards possibly as soon as this weekend, the state Department of Health and Human Services said in a press release.\n \n\n   \n  “We will keep working to help folks put food on the table during this challenging time,” Gov. Josh Stein said.\n \n\n   \n  Food stamp benefits total about $8.2 billion in November, with other expenses pushing the monthly cost up to nearly $9 billion.\n \n\n   \n  The two federal judges said last week that the USDA was required to tap into the program’s roughly $5.3 billion contingency fund, while McConnell ordered the agency on Thursday to also transfer additional unused tariff revenue used to support child nutrition programs in order to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  In its guidance, the agency did not specify how it was funding November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n    Billions ‘in the metaphorical couch cushions’\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear what Friday’s announcement from the USDA will mean for the fast-moving legal fracas around the food benefits program. As of Friday afternoon, neither side in the Rhode Island case had notified either court of the development.\n \n\n   \n  Just after McConnell made his decision on Thursday, the administration appealed it to the First Circuit. By Friday morning, lawyers for the administration were pressing the court, which is stacked with appointees of Democratic presidents, to quickly put the directive on hold.\n \n\n   \n  They argued that McConnell overstepped his authority when he issued his order, which they said “has thrust the Judiciary into the ongoing shutdown negotiations and may well have the effect of extending the lapse in appropriations, exacerbating the problem that the court was misguidedly trying to mitigate.”\n \n\n   \n  “This unprecedented injunction makes a mockery of the separation of powers. Courts hold neither the power to appropriate nor the power to spend,” they wrote. “There is no lawful basis for an order that directs USDA to somehow find $4 billion in the metaphorical couch cushions.”\n \n\n   \n  McConnell’s new order came after he said the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n  The coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses that brought the legal challenge late last month urged the First Circuit to swiftly reject the administration’s emergency bid. In court papers filed Friday afternoon, their attorneys emphasized the on-the-ground impact of any potential intervention by the court, noting it’s been nearly a week since recipients began missing payments for November.\n \n\n   \n  “Time is of the essence,” they wrote. “Plaintiffs and the public will be severely and irreparably harmed if defendants are granted a stay, even a brief one.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/us/whitestown-indiana-house-cleaner-shot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"19:50:00Z","title":"House cleaner shot to death on front porch after going to wrong house in Indianapolis suburb","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 32-year-old house cleaner, Maria Florinda Rios Perez, was shot and killed on the front porch of a home in Whitestown, an Indianapolis suburb, after mistakenly going to the wrong address.

She was part of a cleaning crew that had gone to the wrong address, the release said.\n \n\n   \n  Rios Perez’s husband, Mauricio Velazquez, told WRTV in Indianapolis that he and his wife had been cleaning homes for seven months. Velazquez said he was standing with her at the home’s front door on Wednesday morning but didn’t realize she had been shot until she fell into his arms, bleeding.\n \n\n   \n  On a fundraising page, her brother described Rios Perez as a mother of four children. Police said Friday that she was from Indianapolis but the family plans to bury her in Guatemala, according to her obituary and her brother’s fundraising page. The Associated Press was not able to reach family members directly on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities have not publicly identified the shooter. Police turned over the findings from their investigation to Boone County Prosecutor Kent Eastwood on Friday afternoon, but the prosecutor said the decision on whether to file charges won’t be easy.\n \n\n   \n  The case brings Indiana’s castle doctrine laws squarely into play, he said. Those laws allow a person to use reasonable force, including deadly force, to stop what they reasonably believe is an unlawful entry into their dwelling. Thirty-one states have similar laws on the books, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n \n\n   \n  In similar cases elsewhere, prosecutors have successfully brought charges against people who opened fire outside their homes, including a guilty plea by an 86-year-old  man who shot Ralph Yarl  after the Black teenager came to his door by mistake. In New York, a man was convicted of second-degree murder for fatally  shooting a woman inside a car  who came down his driveway by mistake.\n \n\n   \n  Eastwood said he will have to pore over investigators’ findings to understand what happened in the moments leading up to the shooting. That means reviewing “every second” of witnesses’ taped interviews and doorbell footage if police bring him any, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “You need to understand all the details so you can understand what happened and what is reasonable,” Eastwood said. “One of the hardest things today in this world is to agree on what’s reasonable. As a prosecutor, those are things we have to grapple with.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/subpoena-brennan-russian-interference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"19:39:00-05:00","title":"Feds move to subpoena former CIA director and others who investigated Russian interference in Trump’s 2016 campaign","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department, via the Southern District of Florida, has issued subpoenas to former intelligence officials including John Brennan, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Clapper, seeking documents from July 2016 to February 2017 related to the Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Prosecutors in Florida moved to issue subpoenas to former CIA Director John Brennan and other former officials as the Justice Department investigates the federal government’s counterintelligence investigation into Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign and its contacts with Russians, sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The subpoenas are likely to fuel right-wing clamoring to investigate the investigators again — after special counsel John Durham and the Justice inspector general previously probed the FBI’s work on the 2016 investigation known as “Crossfire Hurricane.”\n \n\n   \n  Subpoenas were scheduled to be sent to several people at intelligence agencies including the FBI and CIA who had worked on an Intelligence Community Assessment in 2017 that summarized counterintelligence on Russian attempts to interfere in the presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  Former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were among those who received subpoenas, sources said, as well as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\n \n\n   \n  The new investigative demands, from the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida, seek documents from July 2016 through February 2017.\n \n\n   \n  The subpoenas ask for digital and paper records that would capture any communications around the work done by intelligence officials at the time, including their text messages, emails and computer files, sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The possible targets of the investigation aren’t clear from the subpoenas themselves, nor are the possible theories of criminal law Trump administration prosecutors may want to examine with a grand jury almost a decade after the records were created.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has requested comment from Brennan’s lawyer, as well as lawyers for Strzok and Page.\n \n\n   \n  The scope of the new probe is unclear. Actions by investigators in the 2016-2019 Trump-Russia probe would be long past the 5-year statute of limitations generally for federal crimes. However, Trump allies have argued that the current Justice Department can revisit the earlier matters as part of a broad conspiracy that has targeted Trump stretching from the Russian meddling probe to the investigation into Trump’s role in the January 6 riot and his efforts to remain in office despite losing the 2020 election, as well as the probe into classified documents he kept at his Mar-a-Lago club. The latter potentially gives prosecutors in southern Florida jurisdiction to lead the new investigation, according to people briefed on the on the matter.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/china/china-trump-ryan-chen-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"19:18:00Z","title":"‘China’s Trump’ told us how he went viral.

And yes, it started as a bet \n       \n  By Mike Valerio, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:18 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   Employing the casual hyperbole of his presidential idol, the “Chinese Trump” gave our interview a 67 out of 10.\n \n\n   \n  He said it calmly. Cheerfully. With absolute confidence. Like people do when they’re standing in a megacity with fans seemingly on every street corner.\n \n\n   \n  Here in Chongqing, southwestern China, population 32 million, business manager Ryan Chen has mastered an impression so uncanny that strangers stop eating lunch to look up, mid-bite, when they hear his voice.\n \n\n   \n  As we moved through the crowded, fog-rimmed October streets, the same day as Trump’s long-anticipated summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, Chen’s fame became apparent.\n \n\n   \n  Fans mobbed him like a Hollywood star. Another phone was thrust into his orbit. Another group photo. Another, “Can you do the voice?”\n \n\n   \n  And then comes his Trump schtick.\n \n\n   \n  Chen pairs his pitch-perfect Trump impression with a Trump-style salesmanship of the best of China.\n \n\n   \n  Delectable hotpot in Chongqing? “The best, the finest.” Glittering skylines that make his hometown look like Hong Kong on steroids? “Totally incredible.”\n \n\n   \n  “Ask me how do I feel today? I’ll tell you. I feel fantastic,” Chen declared, with that mix of bombast and deadpan that’s both satire and sincerity.\n \n\n   \n  Chen mimics Trump’s voice with eerie precision, but it’s a talent that’s only been in the public sphere since January – and all because Chen lost a bet.\n \n\n   \n  “I went into a truth and dare with my friend, and I lost,” he told me. “And (my friend) dared me to do Trump, and put it on my account, see how it goes.”\n \n\n   \n  The video went viral.\n \n\n   \n  For millions across China, especially those who watch the US from a fascinated digital distance, Chen became a one-man portal into the American presidency, without the clunky geopolitical baggage.\n \n\n   \n  Chen is now one of China’s most popular English-language creators, with more than two million followers combined on Instagram and Douyin, China’s version of TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  He understands the American media feed better than many who grew up inside it – a startling achievement for a man who’s never been to the United States.\n \n\n   \n  And he uses his Trump impression to promote his hometown of Chongqing – and China – as a tourist destination. But on China’s closely monitored social-media platforms, his videos walk a tightrope.\n \n\n   \n  “I try to keep everything non-political,” he said. “I’m promoting my culture, my food, showing basically what’s real about China.”\n \n\n   \n  Which is how I found myself joining Chen for a day, experiencing a meticulously curated Trumpian sales pitch of Chongqing.\n \n\n   \n  We ate lunch inside a packed restaurant with red-checkered tablecloths and a dozen tables. Steam blasted out of the kitchen like the cooks were trying to season the air. Chen ordered all the courses.\n \n\n   \n  Tofu pudding with piping-hot dipping sauce. Pork with Sichuan seasoning. And the chef’s signature: braised pork belly with fermented cabbage at the bottom.\n \n\n   \n  “This one’s my regular go-to… When you put it in your mouth it just melts,” Chen said.\n \n\n   \n  “So incredible, only in Chongqing,” he added, hands moving like he’s playing an invisible accordion.\n \n\n   \n  Then came the thousand-year egg. “It tastes like MSG,” Chen offered. And when diners nearby half-turned their heads to check if the foreigner liked it, Chen saw my expression of delight. In his Trump voice, he declared, “I love this guy! He likes everything! He likes every controversial food!”\n \n\n   \n  Outside, skyscrapers broke through the fog like theatrical scenery. More fans. More phones. And then, a visit to Chen’s barber, Mr. Tom.\n \n\n   \n  This is the man who tends to Chen’s all-important hair. “He’s very professional, this guy,” roared the Trump voice.\n \n\n   \n  Chen sat. The shears hummed. He coached the cut like a director choreographing his own silhouette.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m gonna look 30 pounds lighter after this. We had a promise, right? A deal is a deal, right?”\n \n\n   \n  Cut. Dust. Brush. Reveal.\n \n\n   \n  “Tremendous,” Chen said, as he examined his reflection.\n \n\n   \n  Mr. Tom echoed, on command: “Tremendous!”\n \n\n   \n  Chen says he enjoys what he does because laughter bridges barriers, even between superpowers. His fans say the same thing – that he shows them a China that feels confident, funny, and cosmopolitan.\n \n\n   \n  And as someone who arrived in China only weeks ago, I found myself unexpectedly enlightened by a Trump impersonator in a part of the country that’s not typically high on tourist itineraries.\n \n\n   \n  Chen’s broad appeal with audiences in the US and China shows that language is no barrier when it comes to sharing a laugh.\n \n\n   \n  As for what’s next? He’s slowly winding down his day job in an architecture firm and would like to pursue acting full-time.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also his dream – audacious, perhaps cinematic – of visiting America for the first time.\n \n\n   \n  More to the point, he’d like to dive into New York, the city that gave us Trump.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d like to experience, embrace the chaos a little bit to see how it really feels,” Chen said.\n \n\n   \n  Yes, Chen’s voice is astonishing. Yes, the viral fame is ascendant.\n \n\n   \n  But by dusk in Chongqing, it hit me that the loudest thing Chen wants from his imitation is perhaps also the simplest: joy.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/americas/miss-universe-mexico-thailand-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"19:10:00-05:00","title":"‘No one can shut our voice’: Miss Universe Mexico confronts mistreatment","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A video of Miss Universe Mexico contestant Fatima Bosch being verbally abused by Thai pageant director Nawat Itsaragrisil during a pre-pageant meeting in Bangkok sparked global outrage, exposing deep misogyny and power imbalances within international beauty pageants.

At that point, other contestants stood up and walked out in solidarity – prompting the pageant’s director to threaten them with elimination if they didn’t sit down.\n \n\n   \n  Though Nawat later apologized publicly to the contestants, his actions drew swift condemnation around the world, including from Mexico’s president, who described it as an “aggression” that Bosch handled with “dignity.”\n \n\n   \n     Anger and apology \n \n\n   \n  Bosch, who was crowned Miss Universe Mexico earlier this year, denounced Nawat for insulting her.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after the exchange, she told the media that the mistreatment by the Thai official stemmed from a disagreement Nawat had with the Miss Universe Organization, whose president is also Mexican.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that’s not fair because I’m here, and I do everything OK. I don’t mess with anyone. I just try to be kind. I’m trying to give my best,” the young woman said in a  video  posted on TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  “He just said to me, ‘shut up,’ and a lot of different things. And I think that the world needs to see this because we are empowered women, and this is a platform for our voice, and no one can shut our voice,” Bosch said.\n \n\n   \n  The president of the Miss Universe Organization, Raúl Rocha, also  criticized  the Thai businessman and restricted him from participating in further activities. Rocha said Nawat had humiliated and disrespected the Mexican contestant, and held him responsible for “the great abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenseless woman trying to silence and exclude her.”\n \n\n   \n  “I have restricted Nawat’s participation in the events that are part of the 74th Miss Universe competition, limiting it as much as possible or eliminating it entirely,” Rocha said in Spanish.\n \n\n   \n  Nawat  apologized  during a live streamed welcoming ceremony on Wednesday. He insisted that he didn’t intend to hurt anyone and that he respected all those involved. “I have to say I’m very sorry,” he told the dozens of participants who stood onstage beside him, including Bosch.\n \n\n   \n     ‘Women look more beautiful when we raise our voices’ \n \n\n   \n  News of the incident quickly reached as high as the Mexican presidency.\n \n\n   \n  During a press conference on Wednesday, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Bosch’s response was “an example of how women must raise their voices.”\n \n\n   \n  Sheinbaum, who recently experienced an apparent  groping incident , reflected on a sexist phrase often used to silence women in Mexico: “Calladita te ves más bonita,” which means, “You look more beautiful when you’re silent.”\n \n\n   \n  “Well, I don’t know if anyone has said it to the women here, but they did say it to me,” the president said.\n \n\n   \n  She proposed a more empowering mantra: “Women look more beautiful when we raise our voices and participate. Because that has to do with the recognition of our rights. So, I recognize this young woman.”\n \n\n   \n     Crown and dignity \n \n\n   \n  Catalina Ruiz Navarro, a Colombian feminist activist and journalist based in Mexico City, argued that the nature of beauty pageants like Miss Universe places women in a patriarchal position.\n \n\n   \n  “The Miss Universe pageant is about disciplining and monitoring the body, and seeing how, through technology, intervention, exercise and diet, we adjust this body to conform to an ideal that is practically Catholic,” she said to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Ruiz Navarro also praised Bosch, saying her reaction was “truly courageous because she had so much to lose. And the fact that the girls left with her at the same time speaks to a collective outrage and marks a small line they were willing to cross.”\n \n\n   \n  Sheynnis Palacios, Miss Universe 2023 and representative of Nicaragua, said on social media that “a crown should not cost a woman her dignity,” She argued that these pageants are supposed to empower, inspire and foster leadership, but that its purpose is betrayed “when power dynamics, humiliation or disrespect are generated.”\n \n\n   \n  Alicia Machado, who was crowned Miss Universe 1996 representing Venezuela, said similar problems existed when she won the pageant. “I don’t understand why these international competitions continue to be condoned for engaging in unethical practices,” she said, calling for the pageant to be used to fight “for gender rights and equality in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Ruiz Navarro says Bosch’s actions and those of the other contestants could limit this type of behavior, but that it may not be enough. As long as beauty pageants exist, she says, “they have to be more inclusive, fairer, and they have to treat beauty queens with dignity.”\n \n\n   \n  The pageant activities began on Sunday in Bangkok. Women from 130 countries are participating in this year’s edition, which concludes on November 21 with the crowning of the winner.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/affordability-trump-gop-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"19:32:00-05:00","title":"Trump's 'Affordability' Campaign: A Strategy in Contradiction with Reality","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump is attempting to reframe public perception by claiming that prices are falling and affordability has improved under his administration, despite rising inflation and widespread public evidence to the contrary.

Through  repetition, force of will and shamelessness , he’s convinced tens of millions of Americans of  a host of dubious or outright-false claims  – most notably that the 2020 election he lost was somehow “stolen.”\n \n\n   \n  But Trump’s latest effort to rewrite reality is brazen and puzzling even by his standards.\n \n\n   \n  As inflation has proven stubborn, and even ticked up, and as energy and  grocery prices have continued to rise , Trump has set about trying to convince people that this isn’t the case at all.\n \n\n   \n  “I will say this: If you look at affordability, which they campaigned on, they lied,” Trump told reporters on Friday, referring to Democrats’ success in Tuesday’s election.\n \n\n   \n  “Because they talked about, ‘Oh, prices are up.’ No, no. Prices are down under the Trump administration. And they’re down substantially.”\n \n\n   \n  He’s arguing that the rising costs people can see and feel are actually down. And now he’s trying to make “affordability” his calling card.\n \n\n   \n  Good luck with that.\n \n\n   \n  Polls have made clear Americans not only overwhelmingly understand prices are rising, but they strongly link this to Trump’s policies.\n \n\n   \n  What’s more, the president has allowed a particularly troublesome perception to fester: that he’s been asleep at the wheel.\n \n\n   \n  It’s difficult to see how pretending that inflation doesn’t exist and that his administration has done a great job on this issue is going to change that. If anything, it could exacerbate a perception that the administration is divorced from reality.\n \n\n   \n    Trump’s newfound ‘affordability’ focus\n \n\n   \n  Trump has responded to Republicans’ poor 2025 election results by suddenly keying like a laser on “affordability.” He might not have much regard for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s democratic socialist policies, but he seems happy to rip a page out of Mamdani’s political playbook.\n \n\n   \n  “Why did Zohran Mamdani do so well last night? He relentlessly focused on affordability,” top White House political adviser James Blair  told Politico  on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s MAGA ally Vivek Ramaswamy, who is running for Ohio governor, cut a video on election night urging Republicans to set aside their focus on culture wars  in favor of an affordability focus .\n \n\n   \n  Trump has posted on social media and spoken repeatedly about affordability in the last few days, claiming on Friday that Democrats’ message on the topic was a “con job” and that Republicans need to do a better job talking about his economic successes.\n \n\n   \n  “The only problem is the Republicans don’t talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads, because we have great numbers,” he said Thursday, claiming there’s “virtually no inflation.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has also repeatedly pointed to Walmart’s annual Thanksgiving grocery list costing under $40 this year compared to about $55 last year.\n \n\n   \n  The talking point is  a complete non sequitur , as CNN’s Daniel Dale writes. It’s not apples-to-apples because this year’s list has fewer items. And it’s clear that grocery prices writ large are up. In fact, average prices in September  were up 1.4% compared to January  and up about 3% since last year, according to a recent Consumer Price Index study. They also just saw their  largest one-month year-over-year increase (0.6%) in three years  this summer.\n \n\n   \n  When pressed on the apples-to-oranges comparison of the Walmart Thanksgiving list on Friday, he dismissed the question as “fake news.”\n \n\n   \n    Few believe in Trump’s alternate reality\n \n\n   \n  But it’s not just that prices are up; it’s also that people recognize that, despite Trump’s claims.\n \n\n   \n  A CBS News-YouGov poll last week showed just  7% of Americans said prices have been going down  recently. Another 62% said they’re going up.\n \n\n   \n  A Washington Post-ABC News poll, meanwhile, shows  fewer than 10% of Americans say they’re paying less for groceries and utilities  compared to a year ago. Conversely, 71% said they’re paying more for groceries, and 59% said they’re paying more for utilities.\n \n\n   \n    Americans directly blame Trump for economic problems\n \n\n   \n  And more than that, people draw a direct line from these price increases and economic pains to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  All of which brings us to perhaps the one economic number that I keep coming back to on this topic.\n \n\n   \n  CBS has asked repeatedly during Trump’s second term whether he was focused enough on lowering prices.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage who said he’s focused “not enough” on this has risen from 64% in March to 70% in July to 75% in October.\n \n\n   \n  That’s three-quarters of Americans who haven’t seen Trump doing enough on this topic. Even a clear majority of Republicans – 57% – say Trump has neglected the issue.\n \n\n   \n    The risk of Trump’s new strategy\n \n\n   \n  These perceptions are baked-in now, in large part because Trump  has  neglected the issue, at least until he decided to start saying “affordability” a lot in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  If anything, he’s given people a shorthand to tie him to this persistent inflation. That’s in part because he decided to make tariffs, which are often inflationary, his signature economic policy. And he decided to implement them unilaterally, making it clear exactly who is responsible for them. He voluntarily took near-complete ownership of the economy, and now he’s trying to pretend things have gone better than they have.\n \n\n   \n  Trump might be able to convince some people that what they see with their own eyes at the grocery stores or on their electric bills isn’t real. Maybe he’ll get some MAGA Republicans to misremember prices being higher a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  But when it comes to convincing the rest of the population they’re better off now, it’s really hard to see that working.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s alternate realities often resonate because Americans live in information silos where his claims aren’t fact-checked. That can work well when it comes to complex subjects like voter fraud.\n \n\n   \n  But prices are things people can fact-check with their own eyes. They’re facts that are quite literally in people’s faces on a daily basis.\n \n\n   \n  And ultimately, what Trump risks is instead convincing people that he’s out of touch with their economic realities.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional remarks from President Donald Trump.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/flight-cuts-government-shutdown-travel","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"08:29:00-05:00","title":"Hundreds of Flights Slashed Amid Longest Government Shutdown in US History","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The longest government shutdown in US history, beginning on October 1, 2025, has led to widespread flight cancellations and delays due to unpaid federal employees, particularly air traffic controllers and TSA screeners.

What to know if you’re about to fly \n       \n  By Holly Yan, Pete Muntean, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:29 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Travel plans for millions of Americans could come to a screeching halt this month as more flights get canceled during the longest  government shutdown  in US history.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,000 Friday flights were slashed on the first day of the Trump administration’s mandatory cuts to reduce US air traffic, a majority due to the cuts mandated because of the shutdown. And flyers face further travel disruptions through the weekend as airlines are now canceling hundreds of additional flights.\n \n\n   \n  Officials said the cancellations are needed to maintain safety, as some air traffic controllers and federal security screeners – who aren’t getting paid during the shutdown – are not showing up to work.\n \n\n   \n  But the reduction in flights has not eased the cascading delays for travelers across the country due to air traffic controller staffing shortages, as more than 4,500 flights were delayed Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The cancellations and delays are mostly due to a combination of air traffic controller staffing issues and an Federal Aviation Administration-mandated 4% cut to flights because of the shutdown.   \n \n\n   \n  Friday’s cuts represent a 4% reduction in flights at  40 of the largest airports nationwide . If the shutdown drags on, airlines would have to gradually cancel more flights in the coming days – potentially leading to 10% of flights axed next Friday.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know as bewildered travelers get hit by the shutdown:\n \n\n   \n    Which 40 airports are losing flights?\n \n\n   \n  Airlines must cancel flights to 40 “high-volume traffic” airports, the FAA said. Each airline can decide which specific flights to cut, as long as they meet the mandatory number of cancellations.\n \n\n   \n   Here are those airports, divided by region: \n \n\n   \n   Northeast:  Boston Logan International, Newark Liberty International, New York John F. Kennedy International, New York LaGuardia, Philadelphia International and Teterboro in New Jersey.\n \n\n   \n   Midwest:  Chicago Midway International, Chicago O’Hare International, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County, Indianapolis International, Louisville Muhammad Ali International and Minneapolis-St. Paul International.\n \n\n   \n   South:  Charlotte Douglas International, Dallas-Fort Worth International, Dallas Love Field, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International, George Bush Houston Intercontinental, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Houston Hobby, Memphis International, Orlando International, Miami International and Tampa International.\n \n\n   \n   DC area:  Baltimore/Washington International, Ronald Reagan Washington National and Washington Dulles International.\n \n\n   \n   West:  Denver International, Harry Reid International Airport, Los Angeles International, Oakland International, Ontario International, Phoenix Sky Harbor International, Portland International, Salt Lake City International, San Diego International, San Francisco International and Seattle/Tacoma International.\n \n\n   \n   Hawaii and Alaska:  Daniel K. Inouye International and Ted Stevens Anchorage International.\n \n\n   \n  Many smaller airports could also be impacted, as some flights from those 40 high-traffic airports fly to those locations.\n \n\n   \n    How many flights will be cut, and when?\n \n\n   \n  The FAA told airlines to cut traffic by 4% at 40 major airports, resulting in about 800 flights slashed for Friday. There are currently 1,700 flight cancellations through Sunday, according to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics company.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, more than 1,000 flights were canceled Friday in the US, which includes cancellations that are not shutdown-related, according to FlightAware.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines might have to cancel 6% of their flights to those airports on Tuesday, 8% Thursday and 10% next Friday if the stalemate continues, the FAA says.\n \n\n   \n  If the impasse drags on – and not enough air traffic controllers go to work – the Department of Transportation might hike cancellations to 15%-20%,  DOT Secretary Sean Duffy  told Fox News on Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t want to see that,” Duffy said. “If controllers start coming to work and the pressure goes down, we can move those numbers in the other direction.”\n \n\n   \n  But travelers can still see flight cancellations even if the government were to reopen next week, as the FAA’s emergency order requires airlines to cancel flights days in advance.\n \n\n   \n  And air traffic controllers probably wouldn’t return to work right away, Duffy said.\n \n\n   \n    What airports are seeing flight delays?\n \n\n   \n  The control towers at nine airports were short-staffed Friday, including airports in Austin, Texas; Burbank, California; Newark, New Jersey; New Orleans; Ontario, California; San Francisco; Tampa; and near Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA reports 32 facilities were understaffed, even as airlines were forced to cut flights.\n \n\n   \n  Flights headed to Ronald Reagan Washington National had to wait an average of four hours before taking off Friday evening, according to an advisory from the FAA.\n \n\n   \n  San Francisco International Airport’s control tower has also been facing staffing shortages, forcing inbound travelers to wait on the ground about an hour for takeoff.\n \n\n   \n  Flights headed to Phoenix were delayed 90 minutes and those headed to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport were delayed 61 minutes. Manchester, New Hampshire-bound flights had delays of 45 minutes.\n \n\n   \n  Flights headed to Houston’s William Hobby Airport are delayed an average of nearly three hours. The city’s other main airport, George Bush Intercontinental, is seeing incoming delays of 46 minutes, and departures are delayed 30 minutes. Dallas Love Field’s delays began growing to 30 minutes and Austin, Texas, has 47-minute average delays.\n \n\n   \n    How many Friday flights did the biggest airlines cancel?\n \n\n   \n  Delta Air Lines has canceled about 170 regional and mainline flights scheduled for Friday, a spokesperson told CNN.   \n \n\n   \n  United Airlines canceled about 200 flights Friday – mostly regional flights. It will cancel another 4% of its flights Saturday and Sunday, United said.\n \n\n   \n  American Airlines’ 4% reduction equals about 220 flights canceled each day from Friday through Monday, spokesperson Sarah Jantz told CNN. “Even with these cancellations,” Jantz said, “we plan to operate around 6,000 daily flights.”\n \n\n   \n  About 120 Southwest Airlines flights are canceled for Friday, the airline said.\n \n\n   \n    What should I do if I plan to fly soon?\n \n\n   \n  Airline officials are urging people to book backup tickets on different carriers and waiving fees for passengers who want to change their tickets.\n \n\n   \n  “If you are flying Friday or in the next ten days and need to be there or don’t want to be stranded I highly recommend booking a backup ticket on another carrier,” Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle  posted  on Instagram.\n \n\n   \n  “Don’t book a basic ticket. For example, book Economy on Frontier so you can reuse the ticket value as changes are free or you can get a credit,” Biffle wrote. “If your flight is cancelled your chances of being stranded are high so I would simply have a backup ticket on another airline.”\n \n\n   \n  American, Delta, Southwest, United and Frontier are all offering waivers to allow passengers who do not want to fly to change their tickets without fees.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also helpful to book directly with an airline instead of through a third-party website.   If you book through another company and your flight gets canceled, you might have to deal with a third party to get your problem resolved.\n \n\n   \n  And try to avoid booking flights with layovers, the  US Public Interest Research Group  says. The more planes you have to jump on to reach your destination, the more chances you have for a flight to be delayed or canceled.\n \n\n   \n    What if I’m stuck at an airport and my flight gets canceled? Will anyone pay for a hotel?\n \n\n   \n  Airlines must give passengers full refunds for flight cancellations, the DOT says. But they don’t have to pay for hotels, meals or other expenses if a delay or cancelation isn’t their fault.\n \n\n   \n  Even though airlines can choose which flights to cancel as part of the mandatory cuts, the cancellations are not considered to be the airlines’ fault.\n \n\n   \n    How are travelers managing disruptions?\n \n\n   \n  When flights are canceled, most passengers will be automatically rebooked by airlines on flights with different departure times or connections.\n \n\n   \n  Some travelers are left without backup options and others simply don’t want to risk further travel disruptions, so they have given up on flying and resorted to renting cars to reach their destinations.\n \n\n   \n  Two car rental companies, Hertz and Turo, are reporting a significant uptick in car rental bookings as cancellations and delays upend travel plans.\n \n\n   \n  For Hertz, one-way rental bookings made over the last two days for this weekend spiked 20% compared to the same time last year, according to a company spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  Nationwide bookings for Turo cars on Friday jumped 30% year-over-year, and the company is reporting a 44% search volume increase “in a number of key markets impacted by the shutdown,” a spokesperson told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    Will international flights be impacted?\n \n\n   \n  Probably not. The flight reduction order “does not require a reduction in international flights,” a  statement  from the FAA and DOT said. However, “Carriers may use their own discretion to decide which flights are canceled to reach the order’s goal.”\n \n\n   \n  In other words: Airlines get to pick which flights they will cut. But it’s unlikely they will cancel international flights, since they generally bring in more revenue than domestic flights and are subject to international agreements.\n \n\n   \n    Why is all this happening?\n \n\n   \n  The government shutdown, which started on October 1, has prevented many federal employees from getting paid.\n \n\n   \n  Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration screeners are considered essential employees and are expected to go to work during the shutdown. But they’re not getting paid, and some have needed to find other sources of income to pay the bills.\n \n\n   \n  “Controllers are resigning every day now because of the prolonged nature of the shutdown,” said Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. “We’re also 400 controllers short — shorter than we were in the 2019 shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 480 staffing shortages have been reported at FAA facilities since the shutdown began, which is more than four times what was recorded on the same dates last year, according to FAA operations plans.\n \n\n   \n    If airports are short-staffed, is it still safe to fly?\n \n\n   \n  The longer the shutdown continues, the more risks could emerge – especially as controllers go longer without pay, the union leader said earlier this week.\n \n\n   \n  “Every single day that this goes on, tomorrow is now less safe than today,” Daniels  told CNN  before the flight reductions.\n \n\n   \n  But the new flight cancelations will help maintain safety, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “THIS is safety management, the very foundation of our aviation system, and it’s the right thing to do,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy  posted  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “NTSB has repeatedly stated low air traffic control staffing levels, mandatory overtime, and six-day work weeks have a direct impact on  #safety .”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Alexandra Skores, Aaron Cooper, Forrest Brown, Rebekah Riess, Tori B.

filibuster fixation intensifies after a tough week for the GOP \n       \n  By Adam Cancryn, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:19 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  knows he’s losing the politics of  the government shutdown  so far. But that’s not making him any more inclined to give ground on the Democratic demands that could bring the standoff to a swift end.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has repeatedly urged Senate Republicans to unilaterally reopen the government by killing the filibuster, insisting in public and private that the so-called nuclear move is the simplest way to resolve the crisis — and put him back on offense following one of the toughest weeks of his second term.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s push to bypass Democrats completely has intensified since the GOP’s electoral drubbing on Tuesday, even as party leaders on Capitol Hill oppose such drastic action, and despite a pickup in bipartisan talks that lawmakers hope can eventually end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s pressing — which he’s not going to get — the elimination of the filibuster,” said one person with knowledge of the behind-the-scenes shutdown discussions. “That’s not going to happen and he just has to accept that.”\n \n\n   \n  Yet Trump remains undeterred, arguing that the filibuster is enabling Democrats’ opposition, impeding his own ambitions and dampening Republicans’ chances of staying in power beyond next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The filibuster rule allows a minority of senators to block legislation if they can marshal 41 votes against it, giving the party out of power some measure of influence. Most Republicans see that as a structural benefit that has preserved conservative policies over time and prevented Democrats from enacting sweeping reforms.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Trump urged the GOP in three separate Truth Social posts to cut off negotiations and change the rules instead. He reprised the argument at length during a White House meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re making a big mistake,” he said of Republicans not eliminating the filibuster. “If we do it, we will never lose the midterms, and we will never lose the general election, because we will have produced so many different things for the people, for the country, that it would be impossible to lose an election.”\n \n\n   \n    Nuclear option is a nonstarter on the Hill\n \n\n   \n  The president’s filibuster fixation has not appeared to sway many senators. GOP congressional leaders have said plainly to Trump — in public and in private — that nuking the filibuster is off the table. Even those who are personally open to the idea argue it’s an unhelpful conversation right now.\n \n\n   \n  “Any minute we spend talking about this right now — that’s what the Democrats want. They want us to fight amongst themselves,” GOP Sen. Jon Husted of Ohio told local  conservative radio host  Bob Frantz on Friday. “This isn’t coming up for a vote in the US Senate. It’s not going to be voted on.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump earlier this week acknowledged that he would “probably not” blow up his relationship with Republican lawmakers over the filibuster, though he’s continued to press them relentlessly since then.\n \n\n   \n  And it has further complicated efforts to negotiate an end to the record-long shutdown, leaving members unsure of what exactly Trump might accept as part of a compromise deal — and Democrats more emboldened to stay dug in, especially after their electoral victories.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democrats have so far rejected the GOP’s offer of a vote on extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies at the center of the funding battle, countering on Friday with a call to continue the subsidies for a year while the two parties negotiate a longer-term deal.\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers quickly opposed the proposal, leaving the two sides deadlocked heading into the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official cast the Democrats’ offer as a “massive climbdown” from the party’s initial push for a wide range of concessions, as well as reinforcement that Democratic lawmakers are the ones driving the shutdown in pursuit of their policy aims.\n \n\n   \n  But the official declined to say whether Trump opposed the substance of the offer, sticking instead to the administration’s stance that it won’t negotiate until the government is open.\n \n\n   \n  “They should open the government, and we’ll meet with them on the tax credit and work with them on it,” the official said, adding that Trump “doesn’t like that Americans are paying the price for Democrats trying to negotiate their policy agenda.”\n \n\n   \n  Republican lawmakers have pushed for Trump to apply clearer pressure on Democrats, rather than on the filibuster, as negotiators search for a funding-and-health care formulation that can unlock the stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how we get out of this,” said one GOP leadership source, summing up the bleak situation on Capitol Hill as lawmakers prepared to work through the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  But Trump has declined to get more directly involved. And aides and allies say the president’s own attitude toward the shutdown is far more high level: He just wants it over with — but also to emerge with some semblance of a victory.\n \n\n   \n    GOP feels the shutdown’s political blowback\n \n\n   \n  The electoral results earlier this week served as the clearest sign yet that the shutdown offers little remaining upside for Trump, with public polling largely showing Americans faulting Republicans and the president.\n \n\n   \n  “We got our asses kicked the other night,” said one Trump political adviser, who blamed the shutdown for juicing enthusiasm among Democrats. “I don’t think there’s any question it had an effect.”\n \n\n   \n  There is some hope within the administration that more voters will begin to blame Democrats after the party’s Friday decision to continue holding out, the White House official said.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s little expectation that public attitudes are shifting significantly. Trump allies in recent days have also passed around a report by the conservative Media Research Center claiming the overwhelming majority of broadcast television coverage of the shutdown has favored Democrats, gloomily citing it as evidence there’s little hope of breaking through enough to turn around public opinion.\n \n\n   \n  White House officials in the meantime have grown concerned that the shutdown is diverting attention from the administration’s policy successes, contributing to voters’ dissatisfaction with cost-of-living issues that Trump and his aides have blamed in part on Americans not knowing what he’s accomplished thus far.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at affordability, which they campaigned on, they lied, because they talked about all prices are up,” Trump claimed Friday, referring to winning Democratic campaigns in Virginia and New Jersey. “No, no. Prices are down under the Trump administration, and they’re down substantially.”\n \n\n   \n  Later Friday, Trump announced that he’d order the Justice Department to investigate meatpacking companies he accused of driving up the price of beef — a grocery staple whose soaring cost he has tried over the past month to bring down. But despite Trump’s claims,  it’s not just beef  that’s grown more expensive this year — dozens of grocery items have too.\n \n\n   \n    Trump presents few alternatives\n \n\n   \n  Still, despite those broader headwinds, Trump has remained resistant to giving in to Democrats’ demands for concessions on health care — or even to meeting with them. The president is still eager for a win even as he wants the standoff done with, advisers said, a combination of desires that landed him on killing the filibuster as a way to achieve both.\n \n\n   \n  While at least two dozen Republicans would oppose weakening the 60-vote threshold — including staunch conservatives otherwise closely allied with the White House — Trump has only grown more attached to the idea since Tuesday, arguing it could also unlock a far more expansive agenda that could only pass with a simple majority.\n \n\n   \n  On multiple occasions this week, the president rattled off a long list of post-filibuster priorities, including measures to further tighten voting rules ahead of next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t make any sense that a Republican would not want to do that,” Trump said Friday, adding that reopening the government “is one of the reasons, not the major reason, by the way. I think it’s less important than the other things that we get.”\n \n\n   \n  But with little fresh appetite on Capitol Hill for killing the filibuster and the negotiations at a standstill, Trump has presented few alternative paths out of the crisis. Asked Thursday where he stood on the debate over extending the ACA subsidies, Trump said he “won’t weigh in” and that there were “a lot of great ideas out there.”\n \n\n   \n  “That’s not my fault,” he said of the steep rate increases that many Republicans worry could prove politically disastrous if the subsidies aren’t continued. “I didn’t want Obamacare.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/shutdown-congress-federal-pay-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"18:33:00Z","title":"Senate Democrats block GOP-led bill to pay federal workers as shutdown stalemate deepens","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Senate Democrats blocked a Republican-led bill aimed at paying federal workers during the government shutdown, refusing to support a measure that would only cover some workers.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:33 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Senate on Friday failed to pass a bill to pay federal workers forced to work without pay during the government shutdown, with Democrats refusing to yield to GOP attempts to fund any parts of the federal government without major concessions for their party.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown – already the longest on record – is now likely to extend into next week as painful consequences impact millions of Americans across the country, from major air travel disruptions to uncertainty over critical federal aid programs.\n \n\n   \n  The vote was 53 to 43. Three Democrats crossed the aisle to vote with Republicans in support: Sens. Ben Ray Lujan, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock\n \n\n   \n  The federal worker pay bill from GOP Sen. Ron Johnson failed even after Republicans said they would   add language specifically requested by Democrats to pay both workers who are required to work during the shutdown — also known as “essential” workers — as well as the hundreds of thousands of workers who were furloughed.\n \n\n   \n  It’s the latest sign that the record-long stalemate on Capitol Hill is not close to an end. Just days earlier, GOP leaders believed Democrats were on the cusp of accepting their proposal of a future vote on the health care subsidies. Now, an exasperated Senate Majority Leader John Thune has been left with no real path forward as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democrats line up behind an offer of their own that GOP lawmakers have widely rejected.\n \n\n   \n  In response to the vote on the federal pay bill, Democrats, for their part, said they were refusing to yield to a funding measure that limits the shutdown pain for only some Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “We cannot leave any Americans behind in this critical moment — we must reopen all of the government and prevent Americans’ costs from spiking because of Republican in action,” said a memo obtained by CNN from Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations panel.\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the vote, Schumer said that Democrats would agree to end the shutdown in exchange for a one-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, an issue that has become the key sticking point in the shutdown stalemate.\n \n\n   \n  “Democrats are offering a very simple compromise,” Schumer said, with dozens of Senate Democrats sitting beside him on the floor. “Now, the ball is in the Republicans’ court. We need Republicans to just say yes.”\n \n\n   \n  But Senate Republicans, who have said they won’t negotiate over the health care subsidies until the government is open, quickly dismissed the offer as unserious.\n \n\n   \n  “I think everybody who follows this knows that’s a nonstarter,” Thune told reporters. “The Obamacare extension is the negotiation. That’s what we’re going to negotiate once the government opens up.”\n \n\n   \n  Inside the Capitol, the mood among Republicans is exasperation. Many — including Thune — felt blindsided by the Democrats’ abrupt shift away from bipartisan talks this week. They want clearer pressure from Trump on Democrats — rather than just asking his own party to end the filibuster.\n \n\n   \n  The House, meanwhile, has been out of session since September 19, with those GOP lawmakers growing increasingly restless and frustrated at home in their districts. House Speaker Mike Johnson has maintained he will not bring back the chamber until Senate Democrats agree to reopen the government — preventing votes, hearings and most major committee work.\n \n\n   \n  GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, meanwhile, said he “literally begged” Democrats to support the federal worker pay bill and fought to convince his fellow GOP senators to add furloughed workers to the measure.\n \n\n   \n  “If you’re going to force them to work, at a minimum, let’s be sure to pay them. And pay them on time,” Johnson said. “It wasn’t quite that easy…But in the end, we overcame objections in our conference… We completely amended the bill now. We’ve added furloughed workers.”\n \n\n   \n  A visibly frustrated Thune took the floor before the vote on Friday to accost Democrats for blocking the bill.\n \n\n   \n  “Everybody in this chamber is going to be put on the record on whether or not they want to pay federal employees,” Thune said. “I am tired of political games, I really am.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/us/ice-immigration-federal-agencies-trump","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:15+00:00","title":"AI in Education: A New Era of Personalized Learning Begins","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores the growing role of artificial intelligence in transforming education.

Other personnel are troops with the National Guard, the  reserve arm  of the Army and Air Force.\n \n\n   \n  Here is a look at the agencies involved and how their complicated and often overlapping duties have evolved under the current administration’s deportation policy.\n \n\n   \n    Customs and Border Protection\n \n\n   \n  In its  own words , US Customs and Border Protection “is one of the world’s largest law enforcement organizations and is charged with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. while facilitating lawful international travel and trade.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency started as the Customs Administration in 1789 to collect tariffs, the federal government’s primary source of revenue at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Back then, the United States was effectively an “open borders” country until the passage of a  law  in 1875 blocking the immigration of most Chinese women on the premise of curbing prostitution and human trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Full federal border inspections under a new agency  began  in 1891, which later became the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n \n\n   \n  The functions of enforcing immigration law and collecting tariffs and customs duties stayed separate until shortly after the   September 11 terror attacks , when a push to consolidate more agencies under the new Department of Homeland Security  created  Customs and Border Protection in 2003.\n \n\n   \n  “The intent was to create a single focused agency responsible for issues at the border,” Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now at the Migration Policy Institute, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sizeable agency has more than  60,000 employees , including about 20,000 Border Patrol agents, all tasked with one mission: “Protect the American people, safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation’s economic prosperity.”\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  Two decades later, the Border Patrol division of CBP has taken on an increasingly significant role in high-profile immigration actions under Trump, with sector chief  Gregory Bovino  emerging as the  on-the-ground face  of “Operation Midway Blitz.” The initiative targets “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,”  DHS says .\n \n\n   \n  Armed agents, who once apprehended migrants across the US’s borders and stopped drug and human trafficking operations, now stand sentinel over federal immigration facilities that are the sites of immigration protests.\n \n\n   \n  “These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so,” former CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske  testified  in a  lawsuit  filed by journalists. The lawsuit stemmed from what they called “overwhelming and illegal violence” against protesters in Los Angeles this summer, a response that was also helmed by Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions from the summer’s violent clashes between immigration officers and demonstrators continued to boil over this fall in America’s largest cities.\n \n\n   \n   Jason Houser , a former DHS official, said the current administration is putting Border Patrol agents in security and crowd control situations they’re not equipped to handle.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re trained for border interdiction, terrorist threats, drug interdictions on swift boats,” Houser said. “Those tactics aren’t for de-escalation of a protest or riots. That’s not their core training.”\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, the indelible image of a  pastor in a clerical collar  shot in the head with a pepper ball by agents standing on the rooftop of an ICE building is a direct violation of CBP’s use of force  policy .\n \n\n   \n  Officers using pepper balls “shall not intentionally target the head, neck, spine, or groin of the intended subject, unless the use of deadly force is reasonable,” ﻿the  policy  states.\n \n\n   \n  But Bovino, who has said agents have acted proportionally and in response to attacks from demonstrators, expressed ambivalence about protesters being injured – also a direct violation of CBP’s use of force  policy. \n \n\n   \n  “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that’s on them,” Bovino  told CBS News  in October. “Don’t protest and don’t trespass.”\n \n\n   \n  Like many law enforcement agencies since 9/11, the CBP has substantially beefed up its equipment with military-style weaponry and aircraft, including a  fleet  of Black Hawk helicopters and Predator drones.\n \n\n   \n  The equipment was put to use in an  overnight raid  in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood, when agents clad in tactical gear  rappelled  from a Black Hawk helicopter and burst through the windows of an apartment building to pull families from their homes.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been on military bases for a good portion of my life, and the activity I saw – it was an invasion,”  said  neighbor Darrell Ballard.\n \n\n   \n  The show of force in Operation Midway Blitz even included sending  speedboats  – the kind   typically seen on the waterways along the nation’s borders – to patrol the Chicago River, in the shadow of the Windy City’s Trump International Hotel and Tower.\n \n\n   \n  The boats “are from Detroit. Those are interdiction patrol boats that patrol up and down the border between Canada and Michigan,” said Houser, who worries their presence in Chicago leaves the northern border vulnerable.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re not there in Michigan, does that mean those smuggling lines are open that day, but they were out going up and down (the Chicago River) like it was St. Patrick’s Day?”\n \n\n   \n  CBP has not said if the Border Patrol assets used on the Chicago River impacted operations along the Canadian border and did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  While a city that is more than 400 miles from the nearest international border crossing may seem like an unusual choice for intense stops and searches, there is a legal loophole.\n \n\n   \n  The CBP can legally conduct warrantless searches of vehicles and property believed to be involved in immigration violations anywhere within 100 miles of the US border or coastline. The agency also  includes  the entire coastline of Lake Michigan, which lies fully within the United States, as the “functional equivalent” of an international border.\n \n\n   \n  Under CBP policy, Chicago is as much of a border town as El Paso, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “Border enforcement does need to be as modern as possible and as updated as possible in terms of technology,” Meissner said. “But it should be taking place at the border because that’s the crossing point.”\n \n\n   \n    Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n \n\n   \n  Like its cousin CBP, ICE started as part of the new Department of Homeland Security in 2003. But in addition to having a catchier name, ICE had a different mission – focus on the nation’s interior to catch and deport undocumented immigrants, along with investigating “narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, gang violence, money laundering and other financial crimes,” the agency’s website  says .\n \n\n   \n  To accomplish these two very different tasks, the agency has two divisions: Enforcement and Removal Operations, which deports people in the country illegally, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), where  agents  “launch and pursue investigations into transnational crime.”\n \n\n   \n  During the Biden administration, HSI took steps to rebrand itself and  set up  its own website to try to distinguish its work from deportations.\n \n\n   \n  “The civil immigration enforcement side of the ICE mission is not what HSI does,” Katrina Berger, then-executive associate director of HSI,  told ABC News  last year, a few months before retiring.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of his second term, Trump made clear that ICE – including HSI – has a singular focus under his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “The primary mission of (HSI) is the enforcement of … (laws) related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States,” the president  said  in an executive order signed on Inauguration Day.\n \n\n   \n  The HSI patch on uniforms has become a common sight in immigration raids. It was the lead agency in the  operation  at a Georgia Hyundai plant in September that  rounded up  nearly 500 workers accused of being in the country illegally.\n \n\n   \n  While HSI is typically the  lead  on worksite enforcement issues, former agency leaders fear that increasing HSI’s focus on removing undocumented workers from the country comes at the expense of investigating more significant dangers to the US, like targeting the importation of  fentanyl  and firearms  smuggling .\n \n\n   \n  “HSI, within ICE, has always been focused on human smuggling, sex trafficking, cybercrimes, Deep Web threats to children,” said Houser, who served as the ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration. “What we see now is a fundamental shifting away from that focus on national security.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency has also faced criticism for  aggressive tactics  used by ICE agents in executing the president’s immigration policy. Migrants have been  pulled from cars ,  off streets  and  tackled in courthouses  by masked agents.\n \n\n   \n  The heavy-handed tactics have also been used to control crowds at protests, where federal agents have at times used pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas to clear  demonstrators .\n \n\n   \n  ICE and US Customs and Border Protection agents are trained “to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officers under DHS are “highly trained” in de-escalation tactics and “regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois’ Democratic governor disagreed, accusing the agents of being provocative with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE is causing this mayhem,” Gov. JB Pritzker  said . “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh says he got firsthand experience after accusing an ICE agent of  pointing a gun  at him when he was following an ICE vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  “These are ICE agents who are wearing masks. Their badges aren’t very clear,” Huynh  told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not comment on whether a gun was drawn, but McLaughlin accused Huynh of “stalking law enforcement” and said agents had to “assess if he was a threat.”\n \n\n   \n  Huynh’s encounter demonstrates the difficulty people have just figuring out what agency an officer represents, especially since most DHS agencies do not have standard uniforms.\n \n\n   \n   Video  of the incident shows the  ICE agents  wearing camo uniforms marked with “POLICE.” The agency’s tan and olive shoulder patch blends into the camouflage color scheme. On a backpack, another agent is identified as being with “SRT,” the ICE Special Response Team, with SWAT-style training. Another uniform appears to say BORTAC, the Border Patrol’s own tactical unit. None of the uniforms seen in the video specifically said ICE.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Chicago expressed her own concerns about the confusion caused when agents aren’t clearly identified, issuing an  order  that all agents “must have visible identification.”\n \n\n   \n  “The way that they’re carrying on without any visible identification – even that they’re law enforcement, much less what agency they’re with – it really is pretty unprecedented to see at this scale, and I think it’s very dangerous,”  said Scott Shuchart , a senior ICE official during the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just the uniforms – masked federal officers have also become the  new calling card  of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  DHS officials say the masks are necessary to deal with increasing threats against ICE agents, including violence from protesters and doxxing.\n \n\n   \n  Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has said  federal officers are covering up to protect their families  after some have been publicly identified and then harassed online, along with relatives.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a proponent of the masks at all, but if it’s going to keep officers safe, it’s going to keep people from using advanced AI to find out their addresses and their families’ information, then by all means I’ll let them do it,” he  told NewsNation  in October.\n \n\n   \n   John Sandweg , an acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama and a former acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, has been on dozens of ride-alongs during his tenure and said he never saw anyone wear a mask.\n \n\n   \n  “When you’re at ICE and you’re at DHS, the first and highest priority is the safety of the workforce, and you have to do what’s necessary to protect them, but I think there’s no doubt it’s gone past what any reasonable policy would allow, and it really has to be a situation where it’s the exception, not the rule,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    US Coast Guard\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard was created in 1915 after a  merger  of agencies that focused on maritime tax evasion and emergency response on the high seas. The Coast Guard is responsible for “safety, security, and stewardship” on the water.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, its jurisdiction has expanded to include coverage of inland waterways, coastlines, bridges and ports.\n \n\n   \n  It is the only agency of government that is a branch of the military but operates as a civilian law enforcement agency during peacetime. The Coast Guard has been under civilian command since the end of World War II, and DHS has been in charge of the agency since 2003.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard’s unique hybrid structure straddling the military and civilian worlds allows Trump a great deal of leeway in deployment. But the administration has turned its focus to largely urban areas instead of waterways, relegating the Coast Guard to a supporting role.\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard said it was  preparing to support CBP agents  at the Coast Guard base in Alameda, California.\n \n\n   \n  It is working with other agencies to “detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border,” the Coast Guard told CNN affiliate  KCRA .\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Coast Guard “ personnel defensively fired their weapons ” at a U-Haul truck backing toward them outside the Coast Guard base in Alameda, where a  protest  had taken place against an anticipated federal deployment in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n \n\n   \n  No Coast Guard personnel were hurt, DHS  said  at the time, and the driver’s injury was not life-threatening,  according to  the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.\n \n\n   \n  Trump later  stood down  on plans to “surge” resources to San Francisco after friends, including local tech executives Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce, told him San Francisco had made “substantial progress” against crime.\n \n\n   \n    National Guard\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard says its beginnings go back more than a century before the Revolutionary War, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony  established  its own permanent militia. But the current organization didn’t come  until 1933 , when the National Guard Mobilization Act created a unique two-tiered structure.\n \n\n   \n  Today’s National Guard is the descent of state militias and also the combat reserve for the Army and Air Force. The National Guard is under the direction of its state’s governor, who decides when and where to deploy troops. The president has full power over the  DC National Guard  and can also federalize the states’ National Guard for US operations in the case of an emergency when “regular forces” are unable to enforce federal law. Exactly what the law means by “regular forces” is still being discussed in the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Trump’s call-ups this year in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, the last time the National Guard was put under federal control for an operation within American borders was during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 – and it was  coordinated with state officials  at the time.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s attempt to invoke a rarely used law to deploy National Guard troops to several major American cities to curb crime and shut down protests has been one of the most striking and legally aggressive moves by the president — and one that’s come up against legal  challenges   over  and  over  again.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration recently attempted to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities that have been targeted by demonstrators in  Chicago  and  Portland , comparing the cities to a war zone and saying there is either “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion”  there .\n \n\n   \n  “You look at a place like Portland, it’s just — it’s ridiculous, when they say that there’s no problem. The place is — it was on fire over the weekend,” the president  said  last month.\n \n\n   \n  But both deployments have been halted by federal judges who say there is no justification to bring in the military.\n \n\n   \n  In  August , Trump  announced he is placing  the Washington, DC, police department “ under direct federal control ” and deploying National Guard troops to the nation’s capital, saying the move is aimed at restoring order in the city. The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall crime numbers are  lower this year  than in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,000 National Guard troops in DC are stationed throughout the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, while other soldiers and airmen are helping with “beautification projects,” like picking up trash, replanting grass and spreading mulch.\n \n\n   \n  The ongoing mission costs about  $1 million  a day, experts estimated to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president brought the stepped-up law enforcement model next to Memphis, Tennessee, in an attempt to crack down on crime. The move marked the first such effort in a Republican state, and Tennessee Republicans, including Gov. Bill Lee,  welcomed the announcement .\n \n\n   \n  Like in Washington, DC, the National Guard troops in Memphis are not dedicated just to securing federal property but are also supporting local law enforcement in their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Although the city’s leadership disagreed with the Guard’s deployment, officials have cooperated and  advised  residents that the troops will be “serving as extra ‘eyes and ears’ in our neighborhoods.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want to be clear I did not ask for the National Guard and I don’t think it is the way to drive down crime,” Mayor Paul Young  said  in September. “However, that decision has already been made.”\n \n\n   \n  Young and others said they wanted the task force to  focus on targeting violent offenders  rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic-elected officials in Tennessee filed a  lawsuit   trying to stop the Memphis deployment, but the court has taken no action yet.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, graphic designer Leah Abucayan and photo editor Austin Steele contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/us/ashlee-buzzard-arrest-melodee-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"18:43:00Z","title":"Mother of Missing 9-Year-Old Melodee Buzzard Arrested on False Imprisonment Charge, Not Related to Disappearance","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melodee Buzzard, a 9-year-old girl from Lompoc, California, went missing during a cross-state road trip that began on October 7, 2025.

That day, surveillance footage captured the girl at a local car rental agency dressed in  what seemed to be a disguise .\n \n\n   \n  Melodee was wearing a hoodie pulled over her head and “what appears to be a wig that is darker and straighter than her natural hair,” the  sheriff’s office  said. “Investigators believe the wig may have been used to alter her appearance.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators also believe that the mother  swapped wigs  throughout the trip, possibly “to avoid recognition during travel,” the sheriff’s office said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next three days, the rental car traveled through Nebraska, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and Kansas, at some point seen with “a false or switched” license plate, according to the sheriff’s office.\n \n\n   \n  The rental car then returned to the family’s home in Lompoc, about 55 miles northwest of Santa Barbara, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  “Ashlee was seen returning to her Lompoc residence on October 10, driving the same rental vehicle she departed with on October 7— but Melodee was not in the car,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  The child was last seen a day before on video surveillance in the region between the Colorado and Utah state line.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee was reported missing days later on October 14 – not by a family member, but by  a school administrator concerned  about her long absence.\n \n\n   \n  When authorities visited her mother’s home, “Melodee was not at the home, and  no verifiable explanation  for her whereabouts was provided,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Ashlee has remained uncooperative and has not confirmed Melodee’s location or welfare,” authorities said on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Though the mother’s arrest Friday did happen during the missing persons investigation, “it is not directly related to Melodee’s disappearance,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheriff’s detectives remain fully focused on locating Melodee and confirming her safety,” the Friday release said.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who has seen Melodee or may know something about her whereabouts is encouraged to call the sheriff’s office or leave  an anonymous tip .\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear whether Buzzard has an attorney. She will be booked at a Santa Barbara County jail with bail set at $100,000, officials said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/sport/football-nfl-antonio-brown-waives-extradition-attempted-murder","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"18:30:00Z","title":"Ex-NFL player Antonio Brown waives extradition on attempted murder charge, will return to Miami","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former NFL star Antonio Brown has waived extradition to Florida on a second-degree attempted murder charge, returning to the Essex County Jail in New Jersey after being arrested in Dubai.

judge to dismiss charges, arguing they are the result of Trump’s personal revenge \n       \n  By Kara Scannell, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:06 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  New York Attorney General Letitia James said Friday her criminal case should be thrown out because it’s the product of President Donald Trump’s yearslong personal vendetta against her.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers for James  filed a motion to dismiss the two-count indictment  related to a 2020 mortgage, saying it is both a vindictive and selective prosecution.\n \n\n   \n  “The Government’s conduct here has offended the very core of due process and equal protection principles in transforming the Department of Justice into the President’s personal agents of revenge,” her lawyers wrote. “The only remedy that will vindicate AG James’ rights is dismissal with prejudice, as the investigation and the Department of Justice are too tainted with unconstitutional motivation to bring these charges fairly against AG James,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  James’ lawyers attached over 350 public statements, Truth Social posts, and other remarks Trump has made about James over the past six years. Another two dozen statements from Attorney General Pam Bondi, Director of DOJ’s Weaponization Working Group Ed Martin and other officials were also included.\n \n\n   \n  Her lawyers said if the judge doesn’t dismiss the indictment, he should allow them to explore their claim by ordering evidence be turned over and schedule a hearing.\n \n\n   \n  James was indicted last month on one count of making false statements to a financial institution and one count of bank fraud. Prosecutors allege she received a better interest rate on a Norfolk, Virginia, home by falsely claiming it was a second home and not an investment property. James has called the charges “baseless” and pleaded not guilty. A person familiar with the house said James’ grandniece occupies the home and is not paying any rent.\n \n\n   \n  James is separately challenging the legality of the appointment of Lindsey Halligan as the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Halligan was handpicked by Trump to serve in the role after the previous US attorney resigned under pressure by Trump to bring the case against James despite doubts about its validity. A judge is hearing oral arguments next week on that challenge in conjunction with a similar challenge from another indicted Trump enemy, former FBI Director James Comey.\n \n\n   \n  James and Trump have a long history of animus. She campaigned for New York attorney general pledging to investigate his real estate businesses. Her office launched an investigation and filed a civil lawsuit against Trump, his eldest sons and the Trump Organization in 2022 alleging they improperly benefited by inflating the value of properties to receive better rates on loans and insurance. Trump testified during the civil trial.\n \n\n   \n  A state judge found Trump liable and ordered him to pay more than $350 million plus interest. A New York appeals court upheld the liability finding but threw out the judgment finding it “excessive.” Both Trump and James are appealing.\n \n\n   \n  It’s Trump’s reaction to the investigation — his repeated calls that James be investigated and prosecuted — that her lawyers highlight to support their motion.\n \n\n   \n  “The Executive has shouted six years of direct evidence of genuine animus through a megaphone,” James’ lawyers wrote. “The President and DOJ cannot hide behind Ms. Halligan to disguise their hand in AG James’ prosecution.”\n \n\n   \n  They also argued it’s an improper selective prosecution because DOJ has not “investigated several of the Presidents’ officials with virtually the same mortgage or residence issues alleged in the indictment.”\n \n\n   \n  James is also seeking to quash a subpoena in a separate Justice Department investigation looking into her office’s possible civil rights violations for the investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization. In that case her lawyers argued the subpoena is retaliatory and was issued improperly because the US attorney for the Northern District of New York, who signed the subpoena, is unlawfully serving in the role. DOJ has defended the appointment and subpoena.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/michael-mcmahon-trump-pardon","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"16:50:00Z","title":"Trump approves pardon for former NYPD officer convicted in Chinese government scheme","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has approved a pardon for Michael McMahon, a former NYPD sergeant convicted in 2023 for allegedly acting as a Chinese agent in a campaign to stalk and intimidate a former Chinese government official and his family between 2016 and 2019.

The FAA is limiting flights at big airports. But passengers at small airports will feel the most pain \n       \n  By Chris Isidore, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:21 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The federal government is ordering flight cuts at 40 major airports because of the shutdown – but it’s flyers in places like Pensacola, Florida; Moline, Illinois; Waco, Texas; and Shreveport, Louisiana who will have it the hardest.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because small feeder flights are largely the ones getting canceled, not the flights between major cities.\n \n\n   \n  Canceling flights at the smaller airports can cause significant problems for those who depend on them ,  but it limits the disruption for the system overall. That allows the airlines to comply with the new Federal Aviation Administration limits.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Miami International Airport is one of the airports where the FAA limits went into effect Friday. Pensacola International Airport, a small regional airport nearly 700 miles away on the Florida panhandle, definitely is not.\n \n\n   \n  But some Pensacola flights were among those affected anyway.\n \n\n   \n   All eight flights normally scheduled between Miami and Pensacola by American Airlines on Friday had been canceled. Pensacola travelers needing to get to Miami had a couple of unappealing choices – drive the 700 miles or fly in the wrong direction to Atlanta, Charlotte or Dallas and then fly to Miami.\n \n\n   \n  Flight tracker FlightAware showed the US airports with the greatest percentage of canceled flights Friday were all small ones - Quad Cities International Airport in Moline, Illinois on the Mississippi River had 9% of its outbound flights canceled. Shreveport Regional in Louisiana had 7%. Northwest Arkansas National was one of a number of airports at a 6% cancellation rate. All were well above the overall   3% of domestic flights nationwide that had been grounded, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhle Cirium shows only one of 46 flights from Los Angeles International Airport to a New York airport being canceled.\n \n\n   \n  “No one likes to see a flight canceled,” Todd Payne, assistant director at the Pensacola airport, told CNN. “We realize the issues being dealt with on a national air systems basis. We’re fortunate we have no local issues with the folks in our (control) tower.”\n \n\n   \n  Six of 45 scheduled outbound flights at Pensacola had been canceled so far on Friday, for 13%, Payne said that   morning.\n \n\n   \n  Short hops common among connecting passengers also got canceled. United canceled eight of 24 flights between Colorado Springs and Denver which is only about 100 miles away. American canceled four of six flights between its Dallas-Fort Worth hub and Waco, also just over 100 miles away. While 100 miles is a more drivable distance than Pensacola to Miami, it can present its own challenges for travelers.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA said it is trying to limit problems at smaller airports.\n \n\n   \n  If airlines can’t minimize those impacts, the agency said in a statement, “the FAA may direct cancellations on a more prescriptive basis.”\n \n\n   \n  But as much as the smaller airports might be bearing a greater brunt of the cancellations, neither the FAA nor the airlines are going to choke off the flow of passengers between major cities, said Zach Griff, an aviation expert.\n \n\n   \n  “Hub to hub flights, are they incredibly important,” he said. “They have a lot more downstream effect than canceling some of the smaller feeder flights, both for passengers and the crews. If you cancel those (mainline) flights you can quickly put crews out of place.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/middleeast/turkey-issues-genocide-arrest-warrant-against-netanyahu-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"17:49:00-05:00","title":"Turkey Issues 'Genocide' Arrest Warrants Against Netanyahu and Other Israeli Officials","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Turkey’s Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office has issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 36 other Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Israel Katz, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, and military chief Eyal Zamir, on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity related to actions in Gaza and the interception of a humanitarian aid flotilla.

Benjamin Netanyahu and dozens of other Israeli officials on “genocide” charges.\n \n\n   \n  The Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office said it has issued warrants against 37 people. Besides Netanyahu, warrants target Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and military chief Eyal Zamir, among others.\n \n\n   \n  The warrants charge the Israeli officials with “crimes against humanity” and “genocide” committed in Gaza and against the  flotilla  carrying aid to the enclave, according to the prosecutor’s office. That flotilla was intercepted by Israeli authorities last month.\n \n\n   \n  Israel was quick to condemn and reject the warrants.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar called the move a “PR stunt” by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n \n\n   \n  “In Erdoğan’s Turkey, the judiciary has long since become a tool for silencing political rivals and detaining journalists, judges, and mayors,” Sa’ar said in a social media post, referring to the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu earlier this year.

And while it’s not clear what role Turkey will play in the force, Israel has made clear it is  against  Turkish troops in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  US Vice President JD Vance has said Israel will ultimately have to consent to any foreign troops stationed in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The Turkish warrants for Netanyahu and other officials come almost a year after the  International Criminal Court (ICC) issued  a warrant for the Israeli leader, accusing him of war crimes.

use of force by federal agents in Chicago, finding the Trump administration’s version of recent events involving agents was not credible.\n \n\n   \n  One of the incidents in question was a confrontation between federal agents and protestors, where  Gregory Bovino , a top Border Patrol official charged with the immigration crackdown in Chicago deployed tear gas.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Sara Ellis found that Bovino wasn’t hit in the head with a rock  prior to deploying tear gas  despite claims from the Department of Homeland Security justifying the use of force. “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  “Video evidence ultimately disproved this,” said Ellis, who is presiding over a case concerning the heavy-handed tactics used by federal agents in Chicago. Bovino, who sat for an hours-long deposition, said he was hit after the tear gas was thrown, Ellis said. The top Border Patrol official has started wearing his body camera, according to federal government attorneys, after revealing in court last month that he did not have one.\n \n\n   \n  The government has until the end of the day Friday to provide proof that Bovino and other agents are now using body cameras as required, according to the written injunction filed after the hearing on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  During Thursday’s hearing, Ellis slammed the Trump administration, saying that the government’s portrayal of Chicago “is untrue.”\n \n\n   \n  “I find the defendant’s evidence simply not credible,” Ellis said. “I watched the defendants’ videos,” she continued. “This, and hours and hours and hours of bodycam video and video from helicopters, was the best they could provide. ”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis also found that the plaintiffs in the case, who accuse federal agents of aggressive behavior against peaceful protesters, were “threatened and harmed for exercising their constitutional rights.”\n \n\n   \n  In citing the government’s concern over micromanaging by the court, Judge Ellis said, “I’m doing no such thing with this injunction.”\n \n\n   \n  Ellis said she is not telling the government how to handle their operations. “I’m not telling defendants who to hire,” Ellis added.\n \n\n   \n  Federal agents must give at least two separate warnings before issuing riot control weapons and provide “reasonable opportunity” for people to comply, Ellis ruled.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis gave more specifics in  her written order , saying agents must issue two distinct audible warnings - each clearly stating that force may be used before deploying tear gas or other “riot control weapons.” The only exception Ellis is giving to these restrictions is if immediate action is necessary to preserve life or prevent catastrophic outcomes.\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, DHS was ordered to distribute copies of the injunction to all federal agents operating in the Northern District of Illinois by 10 p.m. Thursday and file any updated policy guidance with the court within five business days.\n \n\n   \n  In an apparent effort to manage the flood of motions filed in recent weeks, Ellis also ordered plaintiffs to make “good faith attempts to meet and confer with Defendants at least 24 hours before filing a request for relief.” The defendants, in turn, must respond according to the court’s schedule.\n \n\n   \n  The judge said she will not issue a stay of the injunction pending appeal.\n \n\n   \n  As the hearing came to a close, plaintiffs’ attorney Steve Art thanked the judge, saying, “We appreciate you protecting this community.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/trump-pardons-mlb-great-darryl-strawberry-on-1995-tax-evasion-charge","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"16:46:00-05:00","title":"Trump Pardons MLB Great Darryl Strawberry on 1995 Tax Evasion Charge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to former Major League Baseball star Darryl Strawberry for a 1995 tax evasion charge, marking a significant use of executive clemency.

House official said, “has approved a pardon for Darryl Strawberry, three-time World Series champion and eight-time MLB All-Star.”\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Strawberry served time and paid back taxes after pleading guilty to one count of tax evasion,” the official added, highlighting his subsequent sobriety, his Christian faith, and his efforts to start a recovery  center  in Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Strawberry, who played for the New York Yankees, the New York Mets, and other teams during his MLB career, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 1995, which The New York Times  reported at the time  avoided a trial on three tax-related counts that could have landed him in prison for fifteen years.\n \n\n   \n  Strawberry thanked Trump in an Instagram post that included several pictures of the two men and recounted learning about the clemency plan in a phone call with the president on Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump spoke warmly about my baseball days in NYC, praising me as one the greatest player of the ‘80s and celebrating the Mets. Then, he told me he was granting me a full pardon from my past,” he wrote. “I was overwhelmed with gratitude—thanking God for setting me free from my past, helping me become a better Man,Husband and Father.”\n \n\n   \n  The former baseball player also served time in prison in an unrelated state case. In 2002, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for violating his probation on a conviction on drug and solicitation of prostitution charges, according to  ESPN . He was released after 11 months.\n \n\n   \n  Strawberry is the  second alum  of Trump’s former reality show, “The Celebrity Apprentice,” to receive a pardon. Trump  pardoned  fellow contestant and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in February.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has used his clemency powers more aggressively in his second term, pardoning more than 1,000 people charged in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and commuting the sentence of disgraced former GOP Rep. George Santos, along with other allies.\n \n\n   \n  The president came under scrutiny during a recent interview with CBS News’ “60 Minutes” when he was pressed on a recent pardon for Binance CEO  Changpeng Zhao  on a money laundering charge.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know who he is. I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that, and I heard it was a Biden witch hunt,” he said in the interview.\n \n\n   \n  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later told reporters that Trump does not know Zhao “personally,” but that there is a “thorough review process” with the Department of Justice and White House Counsel’s office who offer Trump clemency recommendations.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details.  \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Marshall Cohen and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.   \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/emails-blaming-democrats-shutdown-violate-first-amendment","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"16:17:00Z","title":"Editing federal employees’ emails to blame Democrats for shutdown violated their First Amendment rights, judge says","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. federal judge, Christopher Cooper, ruled that the Department of Education violated the First Amendment by editing out-of-office email messages of furloughed employees to blame Democrats for the government shutdown.

\n  Teachers in US military schools abroad who have been working without pay during the  government shutdown  received letters this week telling them they owed money to the government, CNN has learned.\n \n\n   \n  Debt letters outlining that personnel have been “overpaid” by various amounts ranging from several hundred dollars to more than $1,000, according to letters viewed by CNN. The letters, sent by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, told employees they have 70 days from the date of the letter to pay the debts.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) told employees that the letters were sent out in error due to a glitch that will be corrected once the government is funded. But impacted employees told CNN the letters added to the stress of Defense Department civilians who have been deemed essential and have worked without pay since the shutdown began on October 1.\n \n\n   \n  “DoDEA claims it will be corrected at some point after the shutdown ends but gave no indication of when or what the process to correct it will be,” one employee said. “So, in the meantime, DoDEA teachers will continue to not only work for no pay but also be charged a debt for each day we are forced to work without pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Another DOD civilian pointed to longstanding issues with the military’s pay system and said they have little faith the issue will be resolved quickly. A third individual living overseas posted on social media that they received the letter and said the stress “is becoming overwhelming.”\n \n\n   \n  The DoDEA system has 161 schools at home and abroad at US military installations, according to the agency’s website, and teaches more than 60,000 students. As of 2022, there were more than 11,000 full-time personnel within DoDEA.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has ensured active members of the military are being paid throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The director of the DoDEA, Beth Schiavino-Narvaez, told employees in an email on Thursday, which was obtained by CNN, that the agency is aware of the “various pay-related issues.” DoDEA is “working closely with the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) to obtain all necessary information regarding the problems that are employees are experiencing due to payroll status changes,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue largely was due to a coding error due to the shutdown, Schiavino-Narvaez’s email said. All employees must be identified by a code for “Leave Without Pay” during the lapse in appropriations for timekeeping purposes, she said. Teachers and administrators’ salaries are based on the number of days in a school year they are paid for, the email goes on to explain, and therefore when a Leave Without Pay code is entered into the pay system, “the payroll system automatically adjusts for overpayment because fewer than the required number of days will be recorded.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, due to the age of its system and regulatory requirements, DFAS is unable to override these adjustments, and a debt letter is automatically issued,” the director’s email said.\n \n\n   \n  Schiavino-Narvaez specifies in the email that once the government is funded, timecards will be corrected – but she also told employees that it may take “several pay periods to fully reconcile and cancel” any outstanding debt.\n \n\n   \n  Employees “are not required to make any payments on debt letters at this time,” she said, adding that she recognizes “we are all experiencing extraordinary challenges due to the lapse in appropriations.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  previously reported  that the morale of civilian employees around the globe — many of whom are veterans or military family members themselves — is dropping rapidly with many considering leaving government service.\n \n\n   \n  The first affected DoDEA employee told CNN that to say the director’s reassurances “don’t mean much is an understatement.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have no urgency to correct this and just tell us to basically wait and hope for the best,” the employee said, “because they don’t know how to fix this and don’t seem overly concerned with finding a method to fix this.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/entertainment/katseye-grammys","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"16:51:00Z","title":"Katseye is having the best year ever and the Grammys just proved it","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Katseye, a globally diverse girl group formed through the reality show 'The Debut: Dream Academy' in collaboration with HYBE and Geffen Records, has achieved major recognition by being nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2025 — Best New Artist and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.

Laforteza, and Yoonchae Jeung were nominated in the Grammy’s best new artist category, as well as best pop duo/group performance. The honor caps what has been a great year so far for the girl group, formed via a reality competition show called “The Debut: Dream Academy.”\n \n\n   \n  The competition was a partnership with HYBE, a South Korean entertainment company that also manages BTS, and Geffen Records.\n \n\n   \n  Their journey was also chronicled in the Netflix documentary, “Pop Star Academy: KATSEYE.”\n \n\n   \n  Though some elements of K-pop world were incorporated into the group’s formation and training, they call themselves a “global group,” nodding to the members’ varied roots.\n \n\n   \n  Avanzini, Skiendiel and Raj are all Americans from diverse backgrounds. Bannerman is from Switzerland and of Ghanaian, Swiss and Italian heritage. Laforteza is from Manila, and Jeung is from South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  Katseye dropped their first EP, “SIS (Soft Is Strong),” in August 2024, and it included their breakthrough single “Touch.” Their second, “Beautiful Chaos,” was released in June. While both were strong performers – their latest EP peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart – it was their  starring role in Gap’s viral “Better in Denim” ad  that cemented their popularity.\n \n\n   \n  They take their fairly newfound fame pretty seriously.\n \n\n   \n  “Making a genuine impact on culture is our biggest goal,”  Raj said  in a recently published BBC Radio 1 interview. “A big thing about us is being versatile. We switch it up with every project we put out. Even on each EP, every song is different and that is important to us.”\n \n\n   \n  After the Grammy nominations were announced, the group took to t heir Instagram stories  to express their delight.\n \n\n   \n  “So honored to be nominated and in this company,” they wrote on a video of 2025 best new artist Grammy winner Chappell Roan introducing the category and its nominations.\n \n\n   \n  The group’s fellow best new artist nominees included Olivia Dean, The Marias,  Addison Rae ,  sombr , Leon Thomas, Alex Warren and  Lola Young  – which you could call some pretty EYE-conic company.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/americas/canada-ostriches-killed-rfk-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"15:39:00-05:00","title":"Professional marksmen kill flu-exposed ostrich herd in Canada, ending legal saga that attracted RFK Jr.’s attention","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a move to contain a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) culled a flu-exposed ostrich herd at Universal Ostrich Farms in Edgewood, British Columbia, after a nearly year-long legal battle.

Kennedy, Jr.\n \n\n   \n  “As part of its disease response policy, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has culled the ostrich population on a farm in Edgewood, British Columbia,” the CFIA said in a statement Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The farm in question, Universal Ostrich Farms, will remain under quarantine.\n \n\n   \n  “After consulting with experts experienced in managing ostrich disease outbreaks,” the statement added, “the CFIA concluded that the most appropriate and humane option was to use professional marksmen in a controlled on-farm setting.”\n \n\n   \n  Universal Ostrich Farms had launched a legal battle against the CFIA’s decision to cull the herd, attracting the attention of Kennedy, who urged the Canadian government in May to reconsider.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy had argued the animals exposed to flu may hold potential for disease research, but the agency said there was no evidence for this and yesterday the Canadian Supreme Court declined to weigh in on the case, removing the last legal roadblock to prevent their culling.\n \n\n   \n  Katie Pasitney, the spokesperson for Universal Ostrich Farms, told CNN that the culling was “traumatizing.”\n \n\n   \n  “There’s nothing professional or humane about putting almost 330 birds in a square pen in the dark of night and shooting at them,” Pasitney said on Friday.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Stamping out’ bird flu\n \n\n   \n  The CFIA had ordered the culling after detecting  highly pathogenic avian influenza  on the farm in December 2024.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement published Thursday, shortly after the Canadian Supreme Court dismissed the case, the CFIA cited its “stamping out” policy, in which exposed or infected animals are killed en masse to prevent further outbreaks.\n \n\n   \n  The farm’s owners disputed the CFIA’s conclusions, arguing that the ostriches that survived the flu might offer disease-fighting antibodies for research – an idea that Kennedy endorsed in his letter to the CFIA in May after meeting with Canadian officials.\n \n\n   \n  The ostriches, Kennedy  wrote , offered the “potential to study both antibody levels and cellular immunity to help further our scientific understanding of the virus and the immune physiologic response.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency, however,  called   the farm’s research claims “unsubstantiated,” saying that the CFIA had “not received any evidence of research activities” on the ostrich farm, nor “any research to show the flock of ostriches currently under quarantine has a unique capacity to produce eggs with antibodies.”\n \n\n   \n  The CFIA eventually took full control of the farm and its animals in September. Supporters have frequently gathered near the farm to protest. In its statement Friday, the CFIA warned demonstrators not to interfere with its operations and reiterated that drone flights over the property are illegal.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the controversy, Canadian officials have cited the need to prevent an outbreak that might damage the country’s nearly  $7 billion poultry industry .\n \n\n   \n  There are more cases of avian flu in British Columbia than any other Canadian province, according to  CFIA’s statistics , with an estimated 11,439,000 birds affected as of October 28.\n \n\n   \n  Neighboring Alberta, the next most-affected province, has an estimated 2 million birds impacted.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/fact-check-beef-grocery-prices-trump-vis","dateOfPublication":"2024-04-15","timeOfPublication":"20:45:30Z","title":"Biden Administration Enacts New Rules on Foreign Investment in Critical Technologies","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Biden administration has introduced new regulations to restrict foreign investment in critical technologies, citing national security concerns.

about expensive valuations and a potential artificial intelligence bubble.\n \n\n   \n  The Nasdaq Composite closed lower by 0.21% on Friday. The tech-heavy index fell 3.04% across the week and suffered its worst week since early April, when President Donald Trump’s announcement of so-called reciprocal tariffs rocked markets.\n \n\n   \n  The benchmark S&P 500 gained 0.13% on Friday after falling as much as 1.3% during earlier trading. The blue-chip Dow closed higher by 75 points, or 0.16%, after sliding more than 400 points earlier. The Nasdaq fell as much as 2.1% earlier before recouping losses.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks bounced off their lowest levels of the day on Friday as investors bought the dip and embraced hopes that  the US government shutdown  — which became the longest in history this week — might come to an end soon.\n \n\n   \n    AI rally takes a breather\n \n\n   \n  After a monthslong rally, skepticism is mounting about whether high-flying tech stocks will continue to produce superior returns.\n \n\n   \n  Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, finished the day relatively flat but had jumped as much as 16% earlier as a tech sell-off weighed on sentiment.  CNN’s Fear and Greed index  hovered in “extreme fear” and briefly hit its lowest level since April.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks came under pressure this week as the CEOs of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley voiced concerns about elevated valuations, while Wall Street’s bar for positive surprises on earnings results continues to rise after a monster rally in stocks in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  “There are some concerns percolating under the surface with AI valuations,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n \n\n   \n  AI and tech stocks have driven the market’s bull run in recent years. As stocks rally, they can become relatively more expensive, creating an additional layer of consideration for investors. Meanwhile, there is increasing skepticism about whether the enormous amounts of money being spent on AI will be justified.\n \n\n   \n  Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) and Palantir shares ( PLTR ) — two stars of the AI trade — fell roughly 7.1% and 11.2% on the week, respectively, and each had their worst week since April.\n \n\n   \n  Oracle shares ( ORCL ), which soared 36% in one day in September after the company announced a deal with OpenAI, have nearly erased all of their gains since then. It’s emblematic of the renewed uncertainty about the AI wave.\n \n\n   \n  Oracle shares slid 8.89% this week and had their worst week this year.\n \n\n   \n  “Sentiment and positioning have certainly become stretched, leaving the Mag Seven [tech companies] and broader tech complex vulnerable to profit taking,” Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email.\n \n\n   \n  “While there are some early yellow flags worth monitoring around circular and debt financing, much of the concern appears to be somewhat overdone in our view,” Melson said.\n \n\n   \n  Also contributing to jitters this week: OpenAI, the center of the AI boom, found itself in some hot water after top executives  backtracked from earlier comments  that suggested government help might be needed to pay for the roughly $1.4 trillion in chips and infrastructure it has announced.\n \n\n   \n  “Nearly every major technology company in the US equity market has celebrated their entanglement with a company that lacks the resources to meet its obligations,” Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in a note. “These companies have each invited a much greater degree of uncertainty into their financial forecasts.”\n \n\n   \n  The S&P 500 on Friday briefly dipped below its 50-day moving average, a key threshold. The index finished the week down roughly 1.63% and snapped a three-week winning streak.\n \n\n   \n  While concerns about tech are weighing on the market, the prolonged US government shutdown is also lingering in the background.\n \n\n   \n  “The government shutdown creates further risk because the longer it continues, the more its impact will be felt on Main Street,” David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Consumer sentiment also just hit its  lowest level since June 2022 , according to the University of Michigan’s latest survey. It’s a sign Americans are feeling increasingly worse about the economy and their personal finances, with many respondents citing the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks rose off their lowest levels on Friday after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats were proposing a deal to end the shutdown. “Now, the ball is in the Republicans’ court,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  It is not expected that the Republicans will accept the offer. Yet investors bought the dip Friday on optimism that the shutdown might end relatively soon.\n \n\n   \n  “We believe we are approaching the end of the longest government shutdown of all time,” Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, said in a note. “Travel issues ahead of the Thanksgiving season will amplify pressure to end the shutdown, and uncertainty around the payment of SNAP benefits this month has continued to accelerate.”\n \n\n   \n  While volatility has picked up on Wall Street, a drawdown in the S&P 500 would present a buying opportunity for long-term investors, according to Wren at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/ice-nypd-zohran-mamdani","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"14:11:00Z","title":"ICE is recruiting NYPD officers after Zohran Mamdani’s victory","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following Zohran Mamdani’s election as mayor of New York City, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has launched a recruitment campaign targeting New York Police Department (NYPD) officers, urging them to join ICE in defending the homeland and supporting law enforcement.

and Nobel Prize co-winner in the structure of DNA, dies at 97 \n       \n  By Christina Zdanowicz, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:47 PM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  James Watson, a renowned molecular biologist and one of the Nobel Prize winners for discovering the structure of DNA, died Thursday after a brief illness, according to a statement from his former employer.\n \n\n   \n  He was 97.\n \n\n   \n  His death was confirmed by a spokesperson with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he spent the bulk of his career, who cited he died following a brief illness.\n \n\n   \n  Watson, whose mission it was to figure out what the molecule of life looks like,  won a Nobel Prize  for it in 1962. He later became the first director of the groundbreaking Human Genome Project and the first living recipient to  sell a Nobel Prize , some of which went toward raising money for scientific research.\n \n\n   \n  “I think early on, I wanted to do something important with my life. I still want to think about science and really nothing else,” Watson told CNN in 2013. “Being  driven by the desire to find the truth , that’s really my legacy. The truth, sometimes you don’t find it and it’s complicated, but what you always have is that if you can start with the truth, it’s helpful.”\n \n\n   \n  His legacy was marred in later years after he made headlines for incendiary racist, sexist and homophobic remarks  belittling various groups of people , claiming they had genetic differences. The remarks led to him losing some of his honorary titles.\n \n\n   \n  Watson, alongside Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, is most known for discovering DNA’s double helix structure in 1953.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was 25, my colleague Francis Crick and I published a very short paper outlining the structure of DNA,” he told CNN in 2013. “We thought it was a bombshell and fortunately, it was.”\n \n\n   \n  That groundbreaking discovery, published in the journal  Nature , was a huge advancement in science that gave way to the field of molecular biology. They cracked the code of how DNA stores information and how its special structure allows the molecule to replicate itself.\n \n\n   \n    His curiosity started at a young age\n \n\n   \n  Watson was born on April 6, 1928, in Chicago. His signature curiosity was evident as a child.\n \n\n   \n  When he was 8, he wondered what makes birds migrate. The question seemed like a puzzle that he wanted to solve, inspiring him to go into science so he could understand how the natural world worked.\n \n\n   \n  After only two years in high school, Watson got a tuition scholarship at The University of Chicago, just a few miles up the road. In 1947, he graduated with a degree in zoology.\n \n\n   \n  He kept learning more about the field, earning a PhD in zoology at Indiana University Bloomington. It was there where his childhood interest in birdwatching gave way to his passion for learning about genetics.\n \n\n   \n  Watson became mesmerized with the three-dimensional structures of molecules from his bacterial virus research at the university. He found out about the work scientists were doing at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England, and a few years later, he joined them to work there in 1951.\n \n\n   \n    He met VIP scientists and a discovery was born\n \n\n   \n  Watson met two important people in 1951: Wilkins and Crick, the men with whom he would later share the  1962 Nobel Prize  in Physiology or Medicine. Wilkins showed Watson photographs of the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA’s structure and later that year, Watson learned both he and Crick wanted to discover DNA’s structure.\n \n\n   \n  “At that time, we knew that a new world had been opened and that an old world, which seemed rather mystical, was gone,” Watson said of the discovery during his  Nobel banquet speech  in 1962.\n \n\n   \n  “All we could say when we got it: It’s so beautiful!”  Watson recalled  of getting the structure right, which took more than a year.\n \n\n   \n  Watson and Crick also used British chemist Rosalind Franklin’s work to help them with their discovery, but her contribution was largely overlooked until after her death. Watson’s first memoir, “The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA,” stoked controversy over his account of the DNA discovery and the roles of those involved.\n \n\n   \n  Franklin’s work went uncredited, and she died of ovarian cancer in 1958 before the Nobel Prize was awarded for the DNA structure discovery. While the award is never given posthumously and  Franklin was never nominated , some in the scientific community say she was snubbed.\n \n\n   \n  Three years after winning the Nobel Prize, Watson published the textbook “Molecular Biology of the Gene,” which is one of the most-used modern biology texts.\n \n\n   \n  “I probably spent more of my career as a writer than as a scientist,” Watson said in a  2012 interview with NobelPrize.org . He said his popular textbook doubled his income and opened new worlds.\n \n\n   \n  In 1968, Watson started directing the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a Long Island, New York, research institution, for 25 years, transforming it into a hub for molecular biology research. It was a big year, as  Watson married Elizabeth Lewis  and they later had two boys, Rufus and Duncan.\n \n\n   \n  Later in his career, Watson was the first director of the Human Genome Project, an international research effort that had the goal of mapping out the human genome, until 1992 when he resigned. In 2007, Watson became the second person to have his genome sequenced in its entirety and he published it online.\n \n\n   \n    He turned heads for different reasons later\n \n\n   \n  Watson also made news when he  sold his Nobel Prize  in 2014 for  $4.76 million at auction , including the buyer’s premium, and the manuscript of his awards acceptance speech for another $356,000, which raised money for scientific research. A Russian billionaire bought the medal and later returned it to Watson.\n \n\n   \n  Watson stirred controversy late in life, tarnishing his reputation as a scientist in a series of racist remarks. In 2007, he made comments about the intelligence of Black people in Britain’s Sunday Times. He was  stripped of his title as chancellor  at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he had worked for more than four decades.\n \n\n   \n  He also made other controversial comments without scientific backing throughout the years. This included repeating racist comments in 2019, insinuating a claim that Blacks are less intelligent than Whites due to genetics. Those comments cost him the rest of his honorary titles at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/europe/israeli-orchestras-paris-concert-flares-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"12:26:00-05:00","title":"Flares, smoke and clashes disrupt Israeli orchestra’s Paris concert","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A protest by pro-Palestinian demonstrators disrupted a concert by the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra at Paris’ Philharmonie venue, resulting in flares, smoke bombs, and physical confrontations.

hall.\n \n\n   \n  In video of the event shared on social media, several members of the audience could be seen physically assaulting one of the activists  who lit a red flare. The man was chased down steps in the gallery of Paris’ Philharmonie concert hall before being protected by other concertgoers.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Friday, the Philharmonie said two smoke bombs were set off during the performance, which French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said was carried out by pro-Palestinian demonstrators.\n \n\n   \n  “The troublemakers were removed and the concert, which had been interrupted, resumed and ended peacefully,” the Philarmonie said, adding that it was the first time a concert at the venue had been disrupted.\n \n\n   \n  Nuñez roundly criticized the interruptions on X Friday: “Nothing can justify them,” he said, adding that four people were detained by authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Robert Ejnes, executive director of France’s Representative Council of Jewish Institutions (CRIF), accused the protesters of trying to “turn a cultural event into a political event.”\n \n\n   \n  Questioned over the protest, Manon Aubry, from France’s Far-left party France Unbowed, refused to condemn the disruption, pointing to Israel’s war in Gaza as justification.\n \n\n   \n  “The best way to prevent this type of incident from happening again is for the Israeli government to stop massacring an entire people,” Aubry told French TV station CNews on Friday.\n \n\n   \n    Prior concerns\n \n\n   \n  The scheduling of the concert had raised concerns and opposition, and France’s entertainment union had slammed the Philharmonie’s decision to go ahead with the performance.\n \n\n   \n  “This concert is understood as an attempt at normalization by the State of Israel, even though it is responsible for genocide against the Palestinian people,” CGT Spectacle said in an October 29 statement.

ongoing investigation into game-fixing in  college basketball  has ensnared six more athletes from three additional schools.\n \n\n   \n  The  NCAA  announced on Friday that players from the University of New Orleans, Mississippi Valley State and Arizona State have been deemed permanently ineligible for their involvement in game manipulation and sharing information with known bettors and unwillingness to cooperate with the investigations.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA  says  the cases at each school are not directly related and represent three separate infractions decisions.\n \n\n   \n  The players involved - Cedquavious Hunter, Dyquavian Short and Jamond Vincent of New Orleans; Donovan Sanders and Alvin Stredic of Mississippi Valley; and Chatton “BJ” Freeman of Arizona State - are no longer enrolled at their schools, the NCAA said in its report.\n \n\n   \n  “Hunter and Sanders declined to participate in their respective cases,” the NCAA said in its statement. “Short, Vincent and Stredic were unresponsive to enforcement staff as their respective cases were processed. Freeman participated in a negotiated resolution and agreed to his violations.”\n \n\n   \n  In September, the NCAA announced it was investigating 13 college basketball players from six named schools. In conjunction with similar rulings involving Fresno State and Eastern Michigan, the NCAA has now ruled on 12 of those athletes at five separate schools. Temple University is the only named school to still be awaiting a decision.\n \n\n   \n  While a student-athlete at Arizona State, the NCAA says Freeman  provided information to an associate  and to his then-girlfriend on multiple occasions for the purposes of betting on Freeman through daily fantasy sports accounts.\n \n\n   \n  The cases at New Orleans and Mississippi Valley State each involved unnamed third-party bettors, with the NCAA using information from integrity monitoring services that flagged suspicious betting activity. The subsequent investigations revealed that players at both schools were overheard discussing “throwing” a game and that on the day of one of the flagged games, the New Orleans players even discussed going shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue after receiving their $5,000.\n \n\n   \n  All of this comes as the feds pursue two separate gambling cases involving NBA players that include, according to reports in ESPN and﻿ Sports Illustrated, many of the same people behind the NCAA gambling probes.\n \n\n   \n  Shane Hennen and Marves Fairley, both indicted in both of the NBA-related cases, are also alleged to be behind the point-shaving scandal in college basketball, per ESPN and Sports Illustrated.\n \n\n   \n  Hennen and Fairley are career criminals with serious charges on their lengthy rap  sheets . Hennen spent 30 months in prison for intent to distribute cocaine and was separately arrested for assault after stabbing someone. Fairley was accused in 2018 of murdering a man in witness protection. The judge, however, cited a “number of matters involving the defendant, state and others,’’ and he was given a 15-year suspended sentence with no time served.\n \n\n   \n  As this unfolds, the NCAA is also toying with changing its longstanding policy that prohibits college athletes and staff members from betting on professional sports.\n \n\n   \n  The NCAA initially announced it would lift that gambling ban but amid pushback from both Congress and Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey doubled back within days, giving member institutions until November 21 to vote to rescind the change.\n \n\n   \n  In order to revert to the original rule and prohibit pro sports gambling, two-thirds of the schools (about 260) must file the necessary paperwork.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/entertainment/grammy-award-nominations-2026","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"15:34:00Z","title":"Grammy Awards 2026: See a list of nominees","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2026 Grammy Awards nominees have been announced, with Kendrick Lamar leading the field with nine nominations, including in the top categories.

Lamar led the field with nine nominations, including album, record and song of the year.\n \n\n   \n  Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny and Sabrina Carpenter were also top nominees this year.\n \n\n   \n  Bad Bunny made a bit of history becoming the first Spanish-language artist to simultaneously snag nominations in the coveted best album, record and song categories in the same year with “Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos).”\n \n\n   \n  That wasn’t the only bit of history made.\n \n\n   \n  The K-pop genre received some love courtesy of singer Rosé’s hit “APT.” with collaborator Bruno Mars, which is up for record and song of the year, in addition to best pop duo/group performance.\n \n\n   \n  “Golden,” a hit song from the hit Netflix film “Kpop Demon Hunters” scored a nomination for song of the year, pop duo/group performance and best song written for visual media, adding more luster to the K-pop of it all. Some may include Katseye as evidence of more K-pop success (the group was nominated in the best new artist and best pop duo/group performance categories), but technically they style themselves a global girl group, more so than K-pop.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, Jack Antonoff became first producer/songwriter to earn nominations in all three major categories - album of the year, song of the year and record of the year - with two different artists in the same year.\n \n\n   \n  The Grammys celebrates the best music released within the window of eligibility, which this year is August 31, 2024-August 30, 2025. Meaning, that’s why you don’t see Taylor Swift’s “The Life of a Showgirl” (released October 3) represented.\n \n\n   \n  The winners will be revealed at the Grammy Awards live show at the Crypto.com arena in Downtown Los Angeles on Sunday, February 1.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some more highlights across the 95 categories announced.

You can  sign up for free here . \n \n\n   \n  President Trump said Thursday that “I don’t want to hear about the affordability.” The comment — which instantly became prime-time cable fodder — came in the middle of a meandering and misleading response to a question from Fox News correspondent Jacqui Heinrich.\n \n\n   \n  “Groceries are way down. Everything is way down,” Trump falsely claimed. “And the press doesn’t report it. The press reports whatever the con people say. You know, I call the Democrats con men and women. They make up numbers.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s easy enough for Trump to blame the press when he is in a Q&A session with reporters. It’s harder when he’s hearing from a voter who is struggling.\n \n\n   \n  That’s why this was an especially savvy move by Fox News anchor Bret Baier on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  Baier used his access to Trump, on the sidelines of a business forum in Miami, to read a message from Regina Foley, a retiree in Greensboro, North Carolina. Foley told Baier that she was a three-time Trump voter who was worried about the GOP losing control of Congress next year.\n \n\n   \n  “Something has to be done fast,” Foley wrote to Baier. “I don’t see the best economy right now. Wall Street numbers do not reflect my Main Street money. Please do something, President Trump.”\n \n\n   \n  Her concern about the cost of living was tellingly framed as a political problem, not an economic or moral one. However, it hit right at the theme of the off-year elections earlier this week. As  Axios  put it Friday morning, “The affordability crisis, once Biden’s, is now Trump’s.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s non-answer to Foley’s concern (he said prices are “down already,” and the “biggest problem is Republicans don’t talk about it”) made waves on social media. On Baier’s  Instagram page , commenters said things like “Our groceries are not down” and “Why don’t you come shopping?”\n \n\n   \n  The exchange underscored that the press is most effective when it is really, directly channeling the public.\n \n\n   \n    Fuzzy Walmart math\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s ability to talk some people into believing up is down, with the assistance of the right-wing media machine, has been central to his political success. And his “affordability” comments this week suggest that he sees it as a messaging problem.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s new favorite thing to tout is Walmart’s promotional Thanksgiving meal basket being 25% cheaper than last year. CNN’s Daniel Dale  looked into it  and explained that the basket’s contents are markedly different this year.\n \n\n   \n    ‘Don’t believe your eyes’\n \n\n   \n  GOP radio host Erick Erickson offered some tough love for his party yesterday.\n \n\n   \n  “Grocery prices are going up. And now Republicans are perversely doing the same thing Democrats did when they were in office with Joe Biden, saying, ‘No, actually, don’t believe your eyes at the grocery store, prices are coming down!’” Erickson said on his syndicated radio show.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s not helpful to Americans who are feeling higher grocery costs right now, which is actually happening. The Republicans have gotta figure this out.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-november","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"11:47:00.000-05:00","title":"Americans are feeling worse about the economy as government shutdown drags on","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The prolonged government shutdown has significantly worsened Americans' economic outlook, as shown by a sharp decline in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index to 50.3 in November 2025—the lowest level since June 2022.

The one notable exception was consumers who are heavily invested in the stock market. They reported an 11% improvement in sentiment as the stock market hangs near record highs.\n \n\n   \n  That group of consumers is crucial because they have “the biggest influence on the aggregate consumer spending data, so continued strength here is important for the resilience of the economy overall,” Thomas Simmons, chief US economist at Jefferies, said in a note to clients Friday.\n \n\n   \n  “However, that middle tercile is important too, and the decline in their sentiment appears to be intensifying.

He was in Indianapolis for Fox’s coverage of the October 5 game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders.

Among first-time buyers, the average age was 40 —  an all-time high.   First-time buyers accounted for only about one in five homes sold during the 12 months ending in June.  That's a record low and half the share of first-time buyers a generation ago.   \"It shows some real problems in the housing market that need to be addressed,\" Lautz says. \"When we look at the lack of inventory for young adults to be able to purchase what ends up being their biggest financial asset and to bring them into the housing ladder, we have work to do.\"  Eve Burdick and husband Cael just celebrated their first wedding anniversary.

Burdick says by the time her parents were her age, they'd already been homeowners for several years.  But that's uncommon in today's market.   Part of the problem is that people who already own homes, often with much lower mortgage rates, are staying put longer than they used to — a record 11 years, on average, according to the new Realtors' report. That means fewer houses are available for new buyers. \"We see gridlock in today's housing market,\" Lautz says. The overall shortage of homes is compounded by the high price of other necessities, which makes it hard for first-time buyers to save up a down payment.  And many are already saddled with other debt.   Eve Burdick and her husband are paying off both student and medical debt. She was also out of work for a few months, which took a big bite out of the couple's savings.  \"So we feel much more behind,\" Burdick says. \"We thought we'd be buying a house in a year.

A new report shows people are waiting until they're much older to buy that first home than in past years. The report underscores how challenging it's become for young people to get a foothold in the costly housing market, as NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Eve Burdick and her husband, Cael, just celebrated their first wedding anniversary. They're both 30 years old and at the stage of life when they'd like to be shopping for their first home. In fact, Eve Burdick has been window-shopping. EVE BURDICK: Oh my gosh, all the time. Are you kidding me? (Laughter) I am on Zillow. My mom sends me stuff pretty much multiple times a week (laughter). HORSLEY: But even though home prices in Minneapolis, where the couple lives, are below the national average, everything they look at is far above their price range or needs more fixing up than the couple could afford. BURDICK: There is no feasible way that we could buy a house for $350,000 and then pull a home equity line of credit to drywall the basement. HORSLEY: Burdick says by the time her parents were her age, they'd already owned a home for several years. But in today's pricey market, that's uncommon. A new report from the National Association of Realtors says the average person buying their first home this past year was 40 years old - an all-time high. Deputy Chief Economist Jessica Lautz says the association had to scrap the photo that was supposed to go on the cover of the report. JESSICA LAUTZ: The original cover had a very cute young couple who was expecting, and I said, that's not going to work. We're not seeing young couples, unfortunately, so it didn't match. HORSLEY: Instead, the realtors went with a photo showing a couple near retirement age, more representative of today's average buyer. Lautz says first-time buyers accounted for just 21% of home sales during this past year. That's a record low and about half the share of first-time buyers a generation ago. LAUTZ: It shows some real problems in the housing market that need to be addressed. For young adults to be able to purchase what ends up being their biggest financial asset and to bring them into the housing ladder, we have work to do. HORSLEY: Part of the problem is that people who already own homes, often with much lower mortgage rates, are staying put longer - a record 11 years on average. That means fewer houses are available to new buyers, a situation Lautz describes as gridlock. The overall shortage of homes is compounded by the high price of other necessities, which makes it hard for first-time buyers to save up a down payment. Many are also saddled with student or medical debt. Sasha Skelton's 34. Her partner's 36. She works in HR for a bank. He's in property management. Skelton wishes they'd been able to buy a home a few years ago when interest rates were lower, but they were repeatedly outbid, often by older, wealthier buyers. Today, she says, everything in their Richmond, Virginia, suburb seems so expensive. She's also nervous about the job market and the overall economy. SASHA SKELTON: It makes me cautious about really wanting to take a jump where, if we have our jobs fall out from underneath of us, our house could be taken away. And, like, with the increase in groceries, it's just everything is kind of coming all at once, it feels like. HORSLEY: For now, Skelton and her partner have put house-hunting on the back burner. But they haven't given up. SKELTON: Both him and I have moved around a lot. I was an Army brat, so it would be nice to, like, settle down and have a home where we can, like, kind of put our roots in. It's just the market right now is not where we want it. HORSLEY: Mortgage rates have been inching down in recent months, but they're still more than twice as high as they were a few years ago. Meanwhile, the average home price just keeps going up. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper  wrote in his decision  on Friday, \"and they certainly do not sign up to be a billboard for any given administration's partisan views.\" The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). \"This ridiculous ploy by the Trump administration was a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the workers at the Education Department,\" said Rachel Gittleman, the president of AFGE Local 252, which represents many Education Department workers, in a statement. She added it is \"one of the many ways the Department's leadership has threatened, harassed and demoralized these hardworking public servants in the last 10 months.\" Cooper ordered the department to restore union members' personalized out-of-office email notices immediately. If that could not be done, he warned, then the department would be required to remove the partisan language from all employees' accounts, union member or not. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       According to court records, in the run-up to the government shutdown, Education Department employees were told to create an out-of-office message for their government email accounts to be used while workers were furloughed. The department even gave employees boilerplate language they could adapt that simply said: \"We are unable to respond to your request due to a lapse in appropriations for the Department of Education. We will respond to your request when appropriations are enacted. Thank you.\" But, on the shutdown's first day, the department's deputy chief of staff for operations overrode staffers' personal messages and replaced them with this partisan autoreply: \"Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.\" While the message was written in the first person, multiple employees  told NPR  they did not write it and were not told it would replace the out-of-office messages they had written. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At the time, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications, said in a statement to NPR: \"The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where's the lie?\" In his decision, Cooper lambasted the department for \"turning its own workforce into political spokespeople through their official email accounts. The Department may have added insult to injury, but it also overplayed its hand.\" The department did not respond to an NPR request to comment on the ruling. \"Nonpartisanship is the foundation of the federal civil-service system,\" Cooper wrote, a principle that Congress enshrined in the Hatch Act. That law, passed in 1939, was intended to protect public employees from political pressure and, according to the  U.S. Office of Special Counsel , \"to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/sport/football-nfl-week-10-preview","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"11:41:00.000-05:00","title":"Football in Berlin, a showdown in Tampa and a Monday night blockbuster: 5 things to know about Week 10 of the NFL season","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Week 10 of the NFL season features international flair with the Colts and Falcons playing their first regular-season game in Berlin at Olympiastadion, marking a historic milestone.

\nUpdated: \n        11:41 AM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Week 10 in the  NFL  brings international flair, playoff implications, and MVP intrigue.\n \n\n   \n  From Sauce Gardner’s Colts debut in Berlin to a big-time Monday Night Football matchup, here are five things to know about Week 10.\n \n\n   \n    Sauce Debuts in Germany\n \n\n   \n  For the first time in the regular season, the NFL is heading to Berlin, where the Colts and Falcons will clash Sunday at Olympiastadion. The historic venue has hosted four NFL preseason games between 1990 and 1994, but this will be its first regular-season contest.\n \n\n   \n  It’s also the Colts debut of cornerback Sauce Gardner, acquired earlier this week in a blockbuster trade with the Jets that cost Indianapolis two first-round picks and a wide receiver.\n \n\n   \n  The Colts (7-2) are coming off just their second loss of the season, falling to Pittsburgh in  Week 9 .\n \n\n   \n  Set those alarms early — kickoff in Berlin is 9:30 a.m. ET.\n \n\n   \n    Stafford in the MVP Conversation\n \n\n   \n  Matthew Stafford has been nearly flawless this season, and he’s made sure the Rams remain squarely in the NFC West race.\n \n\n   \n  The Rams visit San Francisco for a rematch of their Week 5 clash, when an injury-riddled 49ers squad stunned Los Angeles 26-23. With Brock Purdy possibly back under center, the 49ers are getting healthier — and hungrier.\n \n\n   \n  Stafford, meanwhile, has thrown a league-high 21 touchdown passes with just two interceptions and hasn’t thrown one since Week 3. He currently holds the fourth-best MVP odds behind Josh Allen,  Patrick Mahomes  and Drake Maye.\n \n\n   \n  Kickoff is set for 4:25 p.m. ET. The Rams badly need this one — a loss would put them on the wrong side of a season sweep against the 49ers, a setback that could loom large in division tiebreakers down the stretch.\n \n\n   \n    The Playoff Panthers?\n \n\n   \n  It’s been a while since Carolina played meaningful football in November. But the Panthers (5-4) have quietly worked their way into the playoff mix and are favored for the first time this season as they host the 1-8 Saints.\n \n\n   \n  The problem? Carolina hasn’t won a game as the favorite since September 2021, going 0-10 in such matchups since. Sunday could mark a turning point for the franchise if they can finally deliver as expected.\n \n\n   \n    Patriots Streaking in Florida\n \n\n   \n  Remember when “Brady Bowl” was the storyline for Patriots-Bucs? Now it’s all about Drake Maye vs. Baker Mayfield.\n \n\n   \n  The Patriots ride a six-game winning streak into Tampa, where Maye will look to add to his 2025 brilliance — tossing 17 touchdowns to just four interceptions. Mayfield’s numbers are strong too (13 TDs, 2 INTs), but it’s the Patriots’ resurgence that’s turning heads.\n \n\n   \n  Under first-year head coach Mike Vrabel, New England has rediscovered its edge. A win Sunday could elevate them from “contender” to legitimate Super Bowl threat.\n \n\n   \n    Eagles-Packers Under the Lights\n \n\n   \n  Monday Night Football delivers a heavyweight matchup in Green Bay as the Eagles visit the Packers.\n \n\n   \n  Philadelphia swept the Packers last year — including a Wild Card round win — and Jordan Love hasn’t forgotten. Green Bay (5-2-1) is looking to bounce back from a disappointing home loss to Carolina and will have to do it without standout tight end Tucker Kraft, who’s out for the season with a knee injury.\n \n\n   \n  Love and the Packers offense will need to find their rhythm quickly if they want to stay on track for a Super Bowl run.\n \n\n   \n  Both teams lead their respective divisions, and this one has the makings of a potential NFC Championship preview.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/05/weather/cold-temperatures-snow-winter-forecast-arctic-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"10:55:00.000-05:00","title":"Deep Freeze to Cause Major Temperature Swings, with Lows That Could Break Records in the South","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sudden rush of Arctic air is causing a deep freeze across more than 20 U.S. states, beginning in the Midwest and spreading southward into the Southeast and East Coast by early next week.

in the South \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologist Mary Gilbert\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:55 AM EST, Fri November 7, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The calendar still says fall, but the atmosphere is skipping ahead to winter as a rush of Arctic air sends more than two dozen states into a brief deep freeze.\n \n\n   \n  It all starts this weekend in the Midwest, where temperatures will drop 10 to 20 degrees below average, making it feel more like December from the Dakotas to Missouri. The shivering conditions could allow the first snowflakes of the season to fall in parts of the Midwest, while also turning on the  lake-effect snow  machine in the Great Lakes.\n \n\n   \n  These winter-like conditions — with the coldest temperatures of the season — will reach   as far south as Florida while also spreading to the East Coast early next week.   More   than 20   locations in the Southeast could wake-up to record cold temperatures Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s how this chilly change-up will play out.\n \n\n   \n    A winter-like weekend\n \n\n   \n  Parts of the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest will be first in line for plummeting temperatures starting Saturday. This temperature drop could also be accompanied by a mix of snow and rain from the Dakotas to southern Minnesota and northern Iowa.\n \n\n   \n  Minneapolis will wake up to wind chills in the lower teens by Sunday morning;   the actual air temperature will struggle to reach the freezing mark. That’s   on par with the average high for December 6.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday will begin with low temperatures in the 20s or lower for much of the central US and stay frigid. Temperatures could end up 10 to 20 degrees below average for much of the Plains, Midwest and portions of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.\n \n\n   \n  The high temperature in Chicago will likely struggle to reach the mid-30s Sunday, which is about 15 degrees colder than normal. St. Louis will be 15 degrees colder than it should be with a high near 40 degrees.\n \n\n   \n    Record-setting cold to start the week\n \n\n   \n  Monday morning will be the coldest since spring for tens of millions of people east of the Rockies and dip even cooler, threatening several record lows, by Tuesday morning.   Low temperatures at or below freezing – 32 degrees – are possible as far south as Texas and as far east as the Appalachians.\n \n\n   \n  Buffalo, New York, could drop into the 20s on Monday morning and only reach the mid-30s by the afternoon. A normal early November high for the city is about 50 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Monday will likely be the coldest day of the wintry blast for much of the eastern two-thirds of the US, but the Southeast will be the epicenter for some of the coldest air relative to normal.\n \n\n   \n  Monday will also feature a dramatic temperature drop for Atlanta. Sunday’s high in the city is expected to be near 70   degrees, but temperatures will struggle to reach the mid-40s on Monday. Temperatures could tumble to the upper 20s by Tuesday morning, which could end up being Atlanta’s coldest morning since February.\n \n\n   \n  Daily record lows temperatures could be threatened Tuesday morning in parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, southeast Louisiana and Florida. That includes Birmingham and Huntsville, Alabama; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Savannah, Georgia; and Tampa and Fort Myers, Florida.\n \n\n   \n  While not at record cold levels, much of the East will remain quite chilly on Tuesday. It’s likely to be the coldest morning of the stretch for Washington, DC, and New York City. Low temperatures in both cities could be right around the freezing mark, with morning wind chills down in the lower to mid-20s.\n \n\n   \n  This cold snap won’t stick around long though: Temperatures in much of the central US will quickly rebound to near or even above normal on Tuesday and most of the East will follow suit on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n    Snow chances highest in Great Lakes\n \n\n   \n  The blast of Arctic air could set up some places to get their first snow event of the year.\n \n\n   \n  The typical snow belts downwind of the Great Lakes are so far the most likely to see accumulating snow   later this weekend into next week, with lake-effect possible after the cold front swings over the lakes   on Sunday. Some snow could accumulate in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York through Monday night.\n \n\n   \n  There’s also the possibility for snow in other parts of the Midwest this weekend. Chicago, Milwaukee and Rochester, Minnesota, are among the places that could see a mix of rain and snow or get their first proper snowflakes of the season, though little – if any – accumulation is expected.\n \n\n   \n  Snowflakes could even fly through the air as far south as the Ohio and Tennessee valleys by Monday. Higher elevations of the Appalachians will see accumulating snow from West Virginia to border between North Carolina and Tennessee.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5602930","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"17:31:00-05:00","title":"Some UPS and FedEx planes are grounded.

What does that mean for holiday shipping? \n         By Chandelis Duster \n        \n           Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 5:31 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered all McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft grounded pending further inspection, following UPS and FedEx each  deciding to ground  the planes that make up part of their cargo fleet. The FAA's emergency directive on Saturday prohibits flight of MD-11 aircraft because it has \"determined the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design.\" The grounding comes after a UPS MD-11 plane  crashed shortly after takeoff  in Louisville, Ky., last week, killing 14 people. Though the MD-11s make up a small share of UPS and FedEx's cargo fleet, some aviation experts say that depending on how long the MD-11s are grounded, it could delay holiday deliveries. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The cause of the crash is still under investigation. Boeing on Friday  said in a statement  that operators of MD-11 aircraft should \"suspend flight operations while additional engineering analysis is performed,\" adding that the recommendation is \"in an abundance of caution.\" Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997. Here is what to know about the MD-11 and holiday shipping. The MD-11s make up a small percentage of the cargo fleet The MD-11s were first introduced in 1986 and service flights began in December 1990, with the last MD-11 aircraft being manufactured in 2000, according to Boeing. UPS said in 2023 that it would begin replacing MD-11 aircraft with more efficient Boeing 767 aircraft,  according to FreightWaves . Over the last three years, FedEx has retired 20 MD-11 aircraft and had plans to retire the rest of its fleet by fiscal year 2032, John Dietrich, executive vice president and chief financial officer of FedEx Corporation,  said in March . Out of more than 500 aircraft that UPS uses, only 26 of them are MD-11s, according to the shipping company. FedEx said it has 28 MD-11s out of about 700 aircraft in its fleet. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Western Global Airlines, an air cargo company, also uses MD-11 aircraft in its fleet. NPR reached out to Western Global Airlines for comment but has not received a response. Holiday deliveries could be impacted Both UPS and FedEx told NPR contingency plans are in place to minimize disruption in deliveries. The companies did not share details, but some aviation experts told NPR that some cargo could be shifted to passenger planes, trains and trucks. Jeremy Tancredi, a partner who specializes in supply chain issues at consulting firm West Monroe and who previously worked for UPS as an industrial engineer, said there could still be an impact on deliveries during the holiday season. \"As that peak volume increases and you need every bit of transportation capacity, not having 26 planes could be a real big factor for them,\" Tancredi told NPR. Each MD-11 aircraft used by UPS can carry 20,000 packages, the company said. While the MD-11s are a small part of the UPS and FedEx fleet, the delivery impacts could also depend on how long the aircraft are grounded, said Mike Stengel, a partner at AeroDynamic Advisory. \"If the grounding is extended more than a week or two, then as it creeps up on the holidays, there definitely is the possibility of packages getting delayed,\" Stengel told NPR. The FAA directive to airports  to reduce flights  as the government shutdown lingers and air traffic controllers go without pay should not impact deliveries, Stengel also said. \"The cargo carriers have been generally insulated from the recent reductions in the caps that the FAA has placed in flight activity just the past few days, because the caps are generally for flights during the day, whereas UPS and FedEx generally fly in the middle of the night,\" Stengel told NPR. \"So there isn't the same strain of air traffic controllers in the middle of the night.\" Deliveries are expected to jump 5% during the holiday season compared to the 2024 holiday season — with 2.3 billion packages estimated to be delivered, according to consulting and analytics company  ShipMatrix . It is unclear whether UPS or FedEx will adjust holiday shipping deadlines because of the MD-11 aircraft grounding. Tancredi has advice for those looking to send packages to loved ones during the holidays: \"Shop early.\" \"With the rail network taking on more capacity, with the ground network and trucks taking on more capacity, there's still time to order online and get your holiday packages there,\" he said. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96931","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"07:22:00-05:00","title":"Rat Caught and Ate a Bat — What Does It Mean?

A RAT caught and ate a BAT? And there's video! What does it portend? \n         By Bec Roldan \n        \n           Saturday, November 8, 2025 • 7:22 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Bats carry lots of viruses – including variants of the coronavirus that sparked the pandemic. But since bats don't often attack humans, the question is: What's the risk of these viruses being passed on to humans. A new study inadvertently  discovered a possible route of transmission . Researchers were filming bats to learn how they communicate when they swarm – and during a routine watch of the live footage they saw something that shocked them: A rat grabbed a bat and bit it. \"We thought, oh well, that's an unlucky coincidence,\" says  Mirjam Knörnschild , co-author of the paper and head of evolutionary diversity dynamics at the Museum of Natural History in Berlin. But then it happened again. And again. The rats could even snatch a bat flying in mid-air. The study reveals as urbanization increasingly encroaches upon bat-safe caves, invasive, city-dwelling rats are likely to follow. \"This just adds to the threats that bats are already experiencing,\" says Knörnschild. \"We need to find smarter ways to keep the wildlife that follows us around away from bats.\" Knörnschild was fascinated by the attacks, which were captured in the pitch dark, using an infrared camera to film the northern Germany cave. \"Bats can echolocate, so they should have been able to see the rat, but how was the rat able to see the bats? That's still a mystery, actually,\" says Knörnschild The brown rats likely stemmed from a nearby open-air theater in the town of Bad Segeberg, which frequently brings in droves of trash-tossing tourists. Knörnschild and her team wondered if this rat behavior was common at other bat hibernation spots where tourists aren't hanging on, so they surveyed a different cave in the town of Lüneburg, outside of Germany's second largest city, Hamburg. \"We found the very same thing,\" Knörnschild says, including a cache of bitten or partially eaten dead bats near the cave. \"This is something that is apparently more common whenever there are more rats, and cities breed rats.\" The behavior is mildly concerning to  Raina Plowright , an infectious disease ecologist at Cornell University who studies bat viruses. For bat viruses like coronaviruses to spread to people, there is often a bridging host — an animal that regularly comes in contact with both bats and people. Plowright says this study shows that rats could be a possible bridging host. \"Rats are adapted to human environments, they're all around us,\" she says. \"As we degrade habitats, we bring rats with us, and we're potentially bringing a bridging host with us to help us be exposed to the next pandemic pathogen.\" Still, Plowright doesn't think this one study is cause for concern from a human health perspective. \"If there was a pandemic-potential pathogen in those bats, we probably would have seen it already,\" Plowright says. The real issue, she thinks, is not what the bat-eating rats could do to people, but rather, what they could do to bats. \"Bats are under growing pressure worldwide,\" Plowright says, due to human-caused stressors like destruction of bat habitats, and noise and light pollution. Declining bat populations could have real consequences for us, given the important role bats play in insect control, seed dispersal, and pollination. \"Those services are disappearing because their habitats are disappearing.\" Knörnschild is equally concerned. Her research has sparked a collaboration with  Umweltbundesamt , a federal agency in Germany focused on environmental research. Her team now plans to test ways to safely and humanely reduce the invasive rat population around bat hibernation spots, like the cave in Bad Segeberg. \"We don't want to just report curiosity,\" she says. \"We want this to ideally be translated into conservation action.\" Bec Roldan is an independent science journalist based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

The BBC said Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness had both decided to leave the corporation. Britain's public broadcaster has been criticized for editing a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, before protesters attacked the Capitol in Washington. Critics said that the way the speech was edited for a BBC documentary last year was misleading and cut out a section where Trump said that he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. In a letter to staff, Davie said quitting the job after five years \"is entirely my decision.\" \"Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said. He said that he was \"working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.\" Turness said that the controversy about the Trump documentary \"has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC — an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\" \"In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down,\" she said in a note to staff. \"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.\" Pressure on the broadcaster's top executives has been growing since the Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier complied by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. As well as the Trump edit, it criticized the BBC's coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC's Arabic service. The BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters — and criticism from its commercial rivals — because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television. It also is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial in its output, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5603375","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"09:27:00-05:00","title":"Israel Receives Remains of Hostage That Hamas Says Is IDF Soldier Killed in 2014","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Red Cross has received the remains of a hostage in Gaza that Hamas claims is Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier killed in 2014 and held captive for 11 years.

His remains are the only ones currently held in Gaza since before the latest, two-year war between Israel and Hamas. Hamas said it found the body of the soldier, Hadar Goldin, in a tunnel in the enclave's southernmost city of Rafah on Saturday. Goldin was killed on Aug. 1, 2014, two hours after a ceasefire took effect ending that year's war between Israel and Hamas. The remains will be transferred to Israel and to the national forensic institute for identification. If the body is identified as Goldin's, there will be four bodies of hostages remaining in Gaza. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       His return would be a significant development in the U.S.-brokered truce and close a painful, 11-year saga for his family. At the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that holding the body for so long has caused \"great agony of his family, which will now be able to give him a Jewish burial.\" Bringing Israel's fallen home Goldin's family spearheaded a very public campaign, along with the family of another soldier whose body was taken in 2014, to bring their sons home for burial. Israel recovered the remains of the other soldier earlier this year. Netanyahu said the country would continue trying to bring home the bodies of Israelis still being held across enemy lines, such as Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy hung in Damascus in 1965. Israeli media, citing anonymous officials, have reported that Hamas was delaying the release of Goldin's body in hopes of negotiating safe passage for more than 100 militants surrounded by Israeli forces and trapped in the enclave's southernmost city of Rafah. Gila Gamliel, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology and a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, told Army radio that Israel is not negotiating for a deal within a deal. \"There are agreements whose implementation is guaranteed by the mediators, and we shouldn't allow anyone to come know and play (games) and to reopen the agreement,\" she said. Hamas made no comment on a possible exchange for its fighters stuck in the so-called yellow zone, which is controlled by Israeli forces, though they acknowledged that there are clashes taking place there. Hamas made no comment on a possible exchange for its fighters stuck in the so-called yellow zone, which is controlled by Israeli forces, though they acknowledged that there are clashes taking place there. Positive development in the truce Since the ceasefire began last month, militants have released the remains of 23 hostages. As part of the truce deal, the militants are expected to return all of the remains of hostages. For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. Ahmed Dheir, director of forensic medicine at Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, said that the remains of 300 have now been returned, with 89 identified. The war began with a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 251 people were kidnapped and 1,200 killed in Israel, mostly civilians. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On Saturday, Gaza's Health Ministry said the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza has risen to 69,176. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts. A mother's pain Back in 2014, the Israeli military determined, based on evidence found in the tunnel where Goldin's body was taken — including a blood-soaked shirt and prayer fringes — that he had been killed in the attack. His family held what Leah Goldin now calls a \"pseudo-funeral' including Goldin's shirt and fringes, at the urging of Israel's military rabbis. But the lingering uncertainty was like a \"knife constantly making new cuts.\" Leah Goldin told the Associated Press earlier this year that returning her son's body is an ethical and religious value, part of the sacrosanct pact Israel makes with its citizens, who are required by law to serve in the military. \"Hadar is a soldier who went to combat and they abandoned him, and they destroyed his humanitarian rights and ours as well,\" Goldin said. She said her family often felt alone in their struggle to bring Hadar, a talented artist who had just gotten engaged, home for burial. In the dizzying days after Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Goldin family threw themselves into attempting to help hundreds of families of the 251 people Hamas had dragged into Gaza. Initially, the Goldins found themselves shunned as advocacy for the Oct. 7 hostages surged. \"We were a symbol of failure,\" Goldin recalled. \"They told us, 'we aren't like you, our kids will come back soon.'\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5600001","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"15:41:00-05:00","title":"As millions of Americans struggle with SNAP lapses, food banks are swamped with demand","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on a severe surge in demand at food banks and pantries across the U.S. due to the recent lapse of SNAP food assistance for 42 million Americans.

food banks are swamped with demand \n         By Tovia Smith \n        \n           Friday, November 7, 2025 • 3:41 PM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         BOSTON — November is peak season for food banks and pantries — in a normal year. But this year, since SNAP food assistance has lapsed for 42 million Americans, the pressure on pantries is next-level. \"Welcome to the madness,\" says Operations Manager Elaina Schreckenberger, at the ABCD Allston/Brighton Neighborhood Opportunity Center Food Pantry, where staff are scrambling to keep up with the steady flow of people at the front door. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's Turkey Day, so it's chaotic,\" she says. Staff at the Action for Boston Community Development pantry are handing out scores of frozen turkeys for Thanksgiving, though some of the people lined up here say they're stretched so thin on food, they might end up eating their holiday dinner before the holiday. \"Maybe,\" says Yenifer Burgos. \"I have four kids.\" Wanda Concepcion, who can't work because of a disability, is also worried about her next meal. \"I don't know how to survive,\" she says. \"I don't know how I'm going to do it. I'm trying my best.\" As anxiety and demand have been mounting, staff at the ABCD pantry are already having to tell some people it's a two-week wait to get food. \"It's painful when someone comes in and we have to say, 'I just don't have anything for you today,' \" says the pantry's client advocate, Juliet Smith. \"We've never had to do that before. Never.\" Food banks had already taken a hit earlier this year when the U.S. Department of Agriculture halted some $500 million in food deliveries. Pantries took another hit when the federal government shut down last month and many unpaid federal workers added to the demand for assistance. Now, on top of it all, the lapse in SNAP benefits this month is driving some to the breaking point. \"This is a totally different curveball,\" says Andrea Cook, executive director of the Johnston Partnership, which runs a small pantry outside Des Moines, Iowa. Every November, Cook says, her whole office is stacked high with cans and boxes of food. But this year, food is moving out at least as fast as it's coming in. \"We've broken records every day we've been open so far in November, and yesterday was again our highest day we ever had,\" she says. To help manage the rush, they're counting on volunteers, including board members. \"They're unloading food, sorting donations, they're answering phones, making deliveries and doing the things that our staff just doesn't have time to do right now.\" Cook says. \"I would say the whole system is on the brink right now,\" says Erin McAleer, who is president and CEO of Project Bread, a Massachusetts-based anti-hunger organization that also provides direct assistance programs. Project Bread's FoodSource Hotline, which refers people to places offering free food, has been getting four times its usual calls, McAleer says. And sometimes, there are no good answers. \"Just yesterday, some pantries reached out and said, 'We can't take any more people, so please slow down referrals. We can't feed everybody.' So I would say the levees are already starting to break,\" McAleer says. Several state and local governments have been stepping in to help fill funding shortfalls for food banks and pantries. New York, for example, declared a state of emergency and is sending $65 million to food banks and pantries. And California committed $80 million, plus National Guard resources to help with distribution. Private donations are also up, says David Finke, CEO of Jewish Family and Career Services, an organization in Louisville, Ky., that serves people of all religions and backgrounds. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       It's enormously helpful, Finke says, but SNAP provides roughly nine times the volume of food assistance as the entire network of the nation's nonprofit food banks, and even the most generous gifts cannot make up for SNAP reductions or delays. \"I'll just give you a quick example. On Monday, almost 600 pounds of food was donated to us. ... And that sounds great, except that we gave out almost 1,000 pounds of food,\" Finke says. \"This is not sustainable.\" Finke says he knows three nonprofits that expect to soon be unable to make payroll. Jewish Family and Career Services is more financially stable, but Finke says he does worry that directing so much of his agency's resources to the food crisis might end up jeopardizing some of the other important services they offer, like helping people get jobs or providing family and individual therapy. \"What services are we able to provide? What are we not able to provide? I don't have an answer to that yet,\" he says. \"So that sort of adds to the fear and anxiety.\" And the frustration, which is already starting to show. \"At some point, you cannot count on the community to take over for what should be a government program,\" says Judith Ingram, director of NW Community Food in Washington, D.C. \"We are nowhere close to shutting down, but at some point when the rubber meets the road, how much longer can a [private nonprofit organization] fill this need.\" Sarah Saadian, a senior vice president with the National Council of Nonprofits, put it more bluntly. \"Food banks are part of the puzzle,\" she said, adding, \"But they couldn't possibly make up for the failure of the federal government.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         SCOTT DETROW, HOST:   The Trump administration says it is complying with a federal judge's order requiring full payments for SNAP food assistance even as it's appealing the decision. It's all just adding to the uncertainty for the millions of Americans who need food right now, and it's putting pressure on food pantries and food banks struggling to keep up with demand. NPR's Tovia Smith reports. TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: November is usually the busiest season for food pantries in any year, but since SNAP benefits have been in question, it's been next-level busy for pantries. ELAINA SCHRECKENBERGER: Welcome to the madness. T SMITH: At an ABCD - or Action for Boston Community Development - pantry in Boston, operations manager Elaina Schreckenberger and staff are handing out turkeys for Thanksgiving, though some here say they might need to eat theirs before then. Wanda Concepcion, who can't work because of a disability, is among those worried about her next meal. WANDA CONCEPCION: I don't know how to survive. I don't know how we're going to do it. I'm trying, you know? T SMITH: Demand is already so high client advocate Juliet Smith says this pantry is having to tell people to wait two weeks. JULIET SMITH: It's painful when someone comes in and we have to say, I just don't have anything for you today. We've never had to do that before. Never. T SMITH: Food banks had already taken several hits this year, including cuts to USDA's emergency food deliveries and ever-increasing demand. Now, on top of it all, the lapse in SNAP benefits is bringing some to the breaking point. ANDREA COOK: This is a totally different curveball. T SMITH: Andrea Cook is executive director of the Johnston Partnership, which runs a small pantry just outside Des Moines, Iowa. This time of year, she says her office is usually stacked with cans and boxes of food, but this year, food is moving out at least as fast as it's coming in. COOK: We've broken records every day we've been open so far in November. And yesterday was, again, our highest day that we've ever had. T SMITH: It's all hands on deck, Cook says, including her board members. COOK: They're unloading food, sorting donations, they're, you know, answering phones, making the deliveries and doing the things that our staff just doesn't have the time to do right now. T SMITH: Erin McAleer is CEO of Project Bread, a Massachusetts anti-hunger organization. Its FoodSource Hotline is getting four times its usual calls from people asking where they can find food. And sometimes, McAleer says, there are no good answers. ERIN MCALEER: Just yesterday, some pantries reached out and said, we can't take any more people. Please slow down referrals. We can't feed everybody. So I would say the levees are already starting to break. T SMITH: Many state and local governments have stepped in and increased funding for food banks, sending tens of millions of dollars in emergency aid and even National Guard resources to help with distribution. Private donations are also up, says David Finke, CEO of Jewish Family and Career Services, an organization in Louisville, Kentucky that serves people of all religions and backgrounds. But, Finke says, the donations won't solve the problem either. DAVID FINKE: Almost 600 pounds of food was donated to us on Monday alone. And that sounds great, except that we gave out almost a thousand pounds of food. This is not sustainable. T SMITH: Finke says he worries that directing so much of his agency's resources to the food crisis may jeopardize some of the other critical services they offer, like helping people get jobs or therapy. FINKE: What services are we able to provide? What are we not able to provide? I don't have an answer to that problem yet. So that sort of adds to the fear and anxiety. T SMITH: And frustration, which is already starting to show. As one executive for a network of nonprofits puts it, food banks and pantries can't possibly make up for the failure of the federal government.

charged with stone-throwing \n         By Lauren Frayer \n        \n           Updated Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 11:43 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Weekend Edition Saturday \n        \n      \n\n         AL-MAZRAA A-SHARQIYA, Israeli-occupied West Bank — Last February, Mohammed Ibrahim — then 15 — was awoken and pulled from his bed by Israeli soldiers, who said he'd been spotted throwing stones in the occupied West Bank. He's Palestinian-American, and his family splits their time between the Tampa area and a sprawling stone house surrounded by olive trees in this West Bank village. \"Around 3:30 in the morning, they blindfolded him, handcuffed him — they just took him,\" his mother, Muna Ibrahim, 46, recalls. \"Since that day I didn't see my son. I didn't hear his voice.\" Mohammed, a U.S. citizen, has been in Israeli prison since then, without family visits or phone calls. In March, he turned 16 behind bars, and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       He's one of more than 9,000 Palestinians, including hundreds of children, detained in the West Bank since the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, and the Gaza war that followed, according to official Palestinian figures. At a hearing Sunday, an Israeli military court postponed proceedings in the Florida teen's case to Dec. 15, effectively extending his imprisonment until at least then, according to his father Zaher Ibrahim, who attended the hearing. Like this one, all of his previous hearings have adjourned without a plea bargain or trial date. \"Their hearings here are not like America. You wait 9 hours, 8 hours, 7 hours — there's no time when his court starts,\" the father, 50, says. \"You walk in and they just say, 'Court delayed until next month.' That's how it's been for 9 months almost.\" Israel has allowed U.S. Embassy officials to visit Mohammed in prison. Zaher Ibrahim says those officials, as well as freed prisoners, told him his son is suffering from scabies — a rash caused by a skin parasite — that began on one foot and has spread all over his body, and that he's lost nearly a third of his body weight. Members of the U.S. Congress  say  he may also have \"signs of torture.\" Why stone-throwing carries a long prison sentence under Israeli military law Rather than the regular Israeli penal code, Mohammed's case falls under special West Bank security provisions imposed after the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023. Those provisions classify stone-throwing as a serious offense. It was widespread in two Palestinian  intifadas . Altogether more than 1,000 Israelis were killed in those uprisings, along with many times that number of Palestinians. Court documents reviewed by NPR show Mohammed is charged with two counts of stone-throwing. The law says it's a criminal offense to \"throw an object, including a stone, or act in concert to do so.\" Three other Palestinian youths were arrested on the same day as Mohammed, in connection with the same alleged incident. The law says if the target of stone-throwing is a person or property, the penalty is 10 years in prison. For a moving vehicle, it's 20 years. The latter is what Mohammed is charged with. Under interrogation, Mohammed admitted to throwing a stone near a road, but says he didn't hit anything, and didn't try to. That's according to court documents and a video of the interrogation, which a lawyer shared with his father. In a statement to NPR, the Israeli military refused to comment on the specifics of Mohammed's case, but said military juvenile courts in the West Bank are kept secret to \"protect the privacy of minors.\" One of the rationales for such long prison sentences is to incentivize plea bargains, and the vast majority of minors charged in such cases never serve 20 years, says Lea   Tsemel,  a renowned Israeli lawyer  who has represented hundreds of Palestinians charged in Israeli courts. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Tsemel is not representing Mohammed. But she says the Kafkaesque experience his father describes in military courts, and the accounts of disease and malnutrition conveyed by U.S. consular officials, are typical in such cases. \"Even a boy — even a younger boy than this one — is considered a security prisoner [under special West Bank security provisions], and will be limited and denied of any right, including food, including family visits,\" Tsemel says. \"Hardly they can see a lawyer here and there.\" The Ibrahim family has been able to hire a lawyer for Mohammed, but prison visits are infrequent, his father says.  The Israeli military disputes that. \"Defendants are represented by a lawyer of their choice, and all evidence is made available to the defense. The military courts strictly uphold due process and the rights of the defendants throughout the proceedings,\" it said in a statement to NPR. What the U.S. government is doing Last month, 27 members of Congress  signed a letter  to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who's from Florida, like the Ibrahim family. The lawmakers called on the U.S. government to engage with Israel to secure Mohammed's \"swift release,\" citing his \"alarming weight loss, deteriorating health, and signs of torture.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       On one of Rubio's recent trips to Israel, he appointed a U.S. diplomat to liaise with the Ibrahim family, and Zaher Ibrahim says he's been in touch often with that person. \"They had a couple sit-downs with the Israeli government. They said the meeting was very positive, but there's been no follow-up after that,\" Zaher Ibrahim says. The U.S. State Department tells NPR it's \"tracking Mr. Ibrahim's case closely and working with the government of Israel.\" Huckabee and embassy staff are \"deeply involved,\" it said in an email. Whenever Mohammed gets out, his family has somber news to deliver Zaher Ibrahim says he hopes his son will be released at his Dec. 15 hearing, or be able to enter a plea bargain, or at least get a trial date. His wife Muna keeps a box of chocolates on Mohammed's bed, where he hasn't slept in nearly nine months — as a welcome home gift. \"May no mother go through what I went through,\" she says. \"We expected he'll come out within one week, because he's a U.S. citizen, and we just keep waiting.\" And she's struggling with how to tell him about what's happened, while he's been in prison: In July, Mohammed's 20-year-old cousin, Sayfollah Musallet, a fellow U.S. citizen, was killed in the West Bank. He was  beaten to death  by Israeli settlers. The two boys were close, Muna Ibrahim says. Musallet was the fifth American killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7, 2023. No trial has been set in his murder case, either. NPR producer Nuha Musleh contributed to this story from the West Bank.

Nearly a million people evacuate as Super Typhoon Fung-wong threatens the Philippines \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 1:44 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         MANILA, Philippines — Super Typhoon Fung-wong, the biggest storm to threaten the Philippines this year, started battering the country's northeastern coast ahead of landfall on Sunday, knocking down power, forcing the evacuation of nearly a million people and prompting the defense chief to warn many others to evacuate to safety from high-risk villages before it's too late. Fung-wong, which could cover two-thirds of the Southeast Asian archipelago with its 1,600-kilometer- (994-mile-) wide rain and wind band, approached from the Pacific while the Philippines was still dealing with the devastation wrought by Typhoon Kalmaegi, which left at least 224 people dead in central island provinces on Tuesday before pummeling Vietnam, where at least five were killed. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has declared a state of emergency due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected calamity from Fung-wong, which is called Uwan in the Philippines. Fung-wong, with winds of up to 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph), was spotted by government forecasters before noon Sunday over coastal waters near the town of Pandan in eastern Catanduanes province, where torrential rains and fog have obscured visibility. The typhoon is expected to track northwestward and make landfall on the coast of Aurora or Isabela province later Sunday or early Monday, state forecasters said. Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph) or higher are categorized in the Philippines as a super typhoon, a designation adopted years ago to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances. More than 916,860 people were evacuated from high-risk villages in northeastern provinces, including in Bicol, a coastal region vulnerable to Pacific cyclones and mudflows from Mayon, one of the country's most active volcanoes. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr., who oversees the country's disaster response agencies and the military, warned about the potentially catastrophic impact of Fung-wong in televised remarks Saturday. He said the storm could affect a vast expanse of the country, including Cebu, the central province hit hardest by Typhoon Kalmaegi, and metropolitan Manila, the densely populated capital region which is the seat of power and the country's financial center. More than 30 million people could be exposed to hazards posed by Fung-wong, the Office of Civil Defense said. Teodoro asked people to follow orders by officials to immediately move away from villages and towns prone to flash floods, landslides and coastal tidal surges. \"We need to do this because when it's already raining or the typhoon has hit and flooding has started, it's hard to rescue people,\" Teodoro said. The Philippines has not called for international help following the devastation caused by Kalmaegi but Teodoro said the United States, the country's longtime treaty ally, and Japan were ready to provide assistance. As Fung-wong approached with its wide band of fierce wind and rain, several eastern towns and villages lost power, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, deputy administrator of the Office of Civil Defense said. Authorities in northern provinces to be hit or sideswiped by Fung-wong preemptively declared the shutdown of schools and most government offices on Monday and Tuesday. At least 325 domestic and 61 international flights have been canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in at least 109 seaports, where the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas. Authorities warned of a \"high risk of life-threatening and damaging storm surge\" of more than 3 meters (nearly 10 feet) along the coasts of more than 20 provinces and regions, including metropolitan Manila. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. The country also is often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5603612","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"14:17:00-05:00","title":"Paul Tagliabue, NFL commissioner for 17 years, dies at 84","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Tagliabue, who served as NFL commissioner from 1989 to 2006, passed away at 84 due to heart failure.

Press \n        \n           Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 2:17 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NEW YORK — Paul Tagliabue, who helped bring labor peace and riches to the NFL during his 17 years as commissioner but was criticized for not taking stronger action on concussions, died Sunday from heart failure at 84 years old. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Tagliabue's family informed the league of his death in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Tagliabue, who had developed Parkinson's disease, was commissioner after Pete Rozelle from 1989 to 2006. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of a special centennial class in 2020. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell succeeded Tagliabue. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Paul was the ultimate steward of the game — tall in stature, humble in presence and decisive in his loyalty to the NFL,\" Goodell said in a statement. \"I am forever grateful and proud to have Paul as my friend and mentor. I cherished the innumerable hours we spent together where he helped shape me as an executive but also as a man, husband and father.\" Tagliabue oversaw a myriad of new stadiums and negotiated television contracts that added billions of dollars to the league's bank account. Under him, there were no labor stoppages. During his time, Los Angeles lost two teams and Cleveland another, migrating to Baltimore before being replaced by an expansion franchise. Tagliabue implemented a policy on substance abuse that was considered the strongest in all major sports. He also established the \"Rooney Rule,\" in which all teams with coaching vacancies must interview minority candidates. It has since been expanded to include front-office and league executive positions. When he took office in 1989, the NFL had just gotten its first Black head coach of the modern era. By the time Tagliabue stepped down in 2006, there were seven minority head coaches in the league. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In one of his pivotal moments, Tagliabue called off NFL games the weekend after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It was one of the few times the public compared him favorably to Rozelle, who proceeded with the games the Sunday after John Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. A key presidential aide had advised Rozelle that the NFL should play, a decision that was one of the commissioner's great regrets. Tagliabue certainly had his detractors, notably over concussions. The issue has plagued the NFL for decades, though team owners had a major role in the lack of progress in dealing with head trauma. In 2017, Tagliabue apologized for remarks he made decades ago about concussions in football, acknowledging he didn't have the proper data at the time in 1994. He called concussions \"one of those pack-journalism issues\" and contended the number of concussions \"is relatively small; the problem is the journalist issue.\" \"Obviously,\" he said on Talk of Fame Network, \"I do regret those remarks. Looking back, it was not sensible language to use to express my thoughts at the time. My language was intemperate, and it led to serious misunderstanding. \"My intention at the time was to make a point which could have been made fairly simply: that there was a need for better data. There was a need for more reliable information about concussions and uniformity in terms of how they were being defined in terms of severity.\" While concussion recognition, research and treatment lagged for much of Tagliabue's tenure, his work on the labor front was exemplary. As one of his first decisions, Tagliabue reached out to the players' union, then run by Gene Upshaw, a Hall of Fame player and former star for Al Davis' Raiders. Tagliabue had insisted he be directly involved in all labor negotiations, basically rendering useless the Management Council of club executives that had handled such duties for nearly two decades. It was a wise decision. \"When Paul was named commissioner after that seven-month search in 1989, that's when the league got back on track,\" said Joe Browne, who spent 50 years as an NFL executive and was a confidant of Rozelle and Tagliabue. \"Paul had insisted during his negotiations for the position that final control over matters such as labor and all commercial business dealings had to rest in the commissioner's office. The owners agreed and that was a large step forward toward the tremendous rebound we had as a league — an expanded league — in the '90s and beyond.\" Tagliabue forged a solid relationship with Upshaw. In breaking with the contentious dealings between the league and the NFL Players Association, Tagliabue and Upshaw kept negotiations respectful and centered on what would benefit both sides. Compromise was key, Upshaw always said — although the union often was criticized for being too accommodating. Tagliabue had been the NFL's Washington lawyer, a partner in the prestigious firm of Covington and Burling. He was chosen as commissioner in October 1989 over New Orleans general manager Jim Finks after a bitter fight highlighting the differences between the NFL's old guard and newer owners. Yet during his reign as commissioner, which ended in the spring of 2006 after pushing through a highly contested labor agreement, he managed to unite those divided owners and, in fact, relied more on the old-timers who supported him than on Jerry Jones and many of the younger owners. Tagliabue was born on Nov. 24, 1940, in Jersey City, New Jersey. He was the 6-foot-5 captain of the basketball team at Georgetown and graduated in 1962 as one of the school's leading rebounders at the time — his career average later listed just below that of Patrick Ewing. He was president of his class and a Rhodes scholar finalist. Three years later, he graduated from NYU Law School and subsequently worked as a lawyer in the Defense Department before joining Covington & Burling. He eventually took over the NFL account, establishing a close relationship with Rozelle and other NFL officials during a series of legal actions in the 1970s and 1980s. Tagliabue was reserved by nature and it sometimes led to coolness with the media, which had embraced Rozelle, an affable former public relations man. Even after he left office, Tagliabue did not measure up in that regard with Goodell, who began his NFL career in the public relations department. But after 9/11, Tagliabue showed a different side, particularly toward league employees who had lost loved ones in the attacks. He accompanied Ed Tighe, an NFL Management Council lawyer whose wife died that day, to Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, a few blocks from the NFL office. Art Shell, a Hall of Fame player, became the NFL's first modern-day Black head coach with the Raiders. He got to see Tagliabue up close and thought him utterly suited for his job. \"After my coaching career was over, I had the privilege of working directly with Paul in the league office,\" Shell said, \"His philosophy on almost every issue was, 'If it's broke, fix it. And if it's not broke, fix it anyway.' \"He always challenged us to find better ways of doing things. Paul never lost sight of his responsibility to do what was right for the game. He was the perfect choice as NFL commissioner.\" Tagliabue is survived by his wife Chandler, son Drew, and daughter Emily. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5603653","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:23:00-05:00","title":"MLB Pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz Charged with Taking Bribes to Rig Pitches","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz have been indicted on charges of accepting bribes from sports bettors to manipulate pitches — including throwing balls in the dirt or bouncing pitches to ensure betting success.

pitches \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 6:23 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         NEW YORK — Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz have been indicted on charges they took bribes from sports bettors to throw certain types of pitches, including tossing balls in the dirt instead of strikes, to ensure successful bets. According to the indictment unsealed Sunday in federal court in Brooklyn, the highly-paid hurlers took several thousand dollars in payoffs to help two unnamed gamblers from their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 on in-game prop bets on the speed and outcome of certain pitches. Clase, the Guardians' former closer, and Ortiz, a starter, have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July, when Major League Baseball started investigating what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched. Some of the games in question were in April, May and June. Ortiz, 26, was arrested Sunday by the FBI at Boston Logan International Airport. He is expected to appear in federal court in Boston on Monday. Clase, 27, was not in custody, officials said. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ortiz and Clase \"betrayed America's pastime,\" U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. said. \"Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.\" Ortiz's lawyer, Chris Georgalis, said in a statement that his client was innocent and \"has never, and would never, improperly influence a game — not for anyone and not for anything.\" Georgalis said Ortiz's defense team had previously documented for prosecutors that the payments and money transfers between him and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for lawful activities. \"There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning. Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court,\" Georgalis said. A lawyer for Clase did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Major League Baseball Players Association had no comment. Unusual betting activity prompted investigation Major League Baseball said it contacted federal law enforcement when it began investigating unusual betting activity and \"has fully cooperated\" with authorities. \"We are aware of the indictment and today's arrest, and our investigation is ongoing,\" a league statement said. In a statement, the Guardians said: \"We are aware of the recent law enforcement action. We will continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Clase and Ortiz are both charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery. The top charges carry a potential punishment of up to 20 years in prison. In one example cited in the indictment, Clase allegedly invited a bettor to a game against the Boston Red Sox in April and spoke with him by phone just before taking the mound. Four minutes later, the indictment said, the bettor and his associates won $11,000 on a wager that Clase would toss a certain pitch slower than 97.95 mph (157.63 kph). In May, the indictment said, Clase agreed to throw a ball at a certain point in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, but the batter swung, resulting in a strike, costing the bettors $4,000 in wagers. After the game, which the Guardians won, Clase sent text messages to one of the bettors with images of a man hanging himself with toilet paper and a sad puppy dog face, the indictment said. Clase, a three-time All-Star and two-time American League Reliever of the Year, had a $4.5 million salary in 2025, the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract. The three-time AL save leader began providing the bettors with information about his pitches in 2023 but didn't ask for payoffs until this year, prosecutors said. The indictment cited specific pitches Clase allegedly rigged — all of them first pitches when he entered to start an inning: a 98.5 mph (158.5 kph) cutter low and inside to the New York Mets' Starling Marte on May 19, 2023; an 89.4 mph (143.8 kph) slider to Minnesota's Ryan Jeffers that bounced well short of home plate on June 3, 2023; an 89.4 mph (143.8 kph) slider to Kansas City's Bobby Witt Jr. that bounced on April 12; a 99.1 mph (159.5 kph) cutter in the dirt to Philadelphia's Max Kepler on May 11; a bounced 89.1 mph (143.4) slider to Milwaukee's Jake Bauers on May 13; and a bounced 87.5 mph (140.8 kph) slider to Cincinnati's Santiago Espinal on May 17. Prosecutors said Ortiz, who had a $782,600 salary this year, got in on the scheme in June and is accused of rigging pitches in games against the Seattle Mariners and the St. Louis Cardinals. Ortiz was cited for bouncing a first-pitch 86.7 mph (139.5 kph) slider to Seattle's Randy Arozarena starting the second inning on June 15 and bouncing a first-pitch 86.7 mph (139.5 kph) slider to St. Louis' Pedro Pagés that went to the backstop opening the third inning on June 27. Dozens of pro athletes have been charged in gambling sweeps The charges are the latest bombshell developments in a federal crackdown on betting in professional sports. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Last month, more than 30 people, including prominent basketball figures such as Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, were arrested in a gambling sweep that rocked the NBA. Sports betting scandals have long been a concern, but a May 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling led to a wave of gambling incidents involving athletes and officials. The ruling struck down a federal ban on sports betting in most states and opened the doors for online sportsbooks to take a prominent space in the sports ecosystem. Major League Baseball suspended five players in June 2024, including a lifetime ban for San Diego infielder Tucupita Marcano for allegedly placing 387 baseball bets with a legal sportsbook totaling more than $150,000. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-96333","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"07:23:00-04:00","title":"A first-time HPV vaccination campaign sees some success -- and strong resistance","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccination campaign in September 2025 to protect girls aged 9 to 14 from cervical cancer, which is the third most common cancer in the country with 5,000 cases annually.

campaign sees some success -- and strong resistance \n         By Text and photos by Betsy Joles \n        \n           Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 7:23 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         ISLAMABAD — This fall saw Pakistan's first-ever campaign to administer the  human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine , which protects girls from cervical cancer. The vaccine is highly effective, according to global health groups, and is routinely administered in some 150 countries. It was not a rousing success. As vaccinators fanned out to schools and other sites in mid-September, they explained that the vaccine would be offered for free to girls ages 9 through 14 and could save their lives if they later contracted HPV, a common sexually transmitted infection that is a major cause of cervical cancer. In Pakistan, HPV is the third most common cancer, with some 5,000 cases reported annually. The yearly global death toll from the disease is approximately 300,000, with most fatalities in places where screenings and treatment are not easily accessible. The teams, operating in parts of Pakistan as well as Pakistan-administered Kashmir, met fierce resistance from some parents. They asked: Why is the vaccine being given only to young girls and not boys? (That's a complicated question – boys are eligible and being vaccinated could protect their future female sexual partners but because cervical cancer only affects women, the emphasis is on vaccinating girls.) They wanted to know if the vaccine would affect their daughters' ability to have children later on — and why foreign organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF and the World Health Organization were involved in the campaign. (Health experts say there's  no data  to suggest that the vaccine affects fertility. The concern stemmed from videos parents had seen in WhatsApp groups with the longstanding rumor that the vaccine is a population control ploy by Western funders to sterilize Muslims.) \"We went three to four times to try to convince people,\" Rehana Khan Abbasi, 48, a vaccinator working in Bhara Kahu, a town on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan's capital city, told NPR. On the last official day of the two-week   campaign, Abbasi sat in the office of a school trying to get more parents on board. One mother, Zuleikha Bibi, remained hesitant; she'd read the fertility rumors about the HPV vaccine online. And her husband had made it clear that he would not allow their daughter to be vaccinated. \"Maybe what people are saying is true, maybe not. Only God knows the truth — we do not know,\" Bibi said. The goal had been to vaccinate about 90% of around 13 million eligible girls. Khurram Akram, technical director at Pakistan Federal Directorate of Immunization's, estimates that the actual percentage of girls vaccinated was around 70%. \"Our biggest challenge was to counter misinformation,\" says Akram. This community response underscores the challenge of public vaccination efforts in Pakistan, where skepticism is often fueled by social media hearsay and  conspiracies . In Bhara Kahu,   schools sent   permission forms back marked \"no\" before families got a chance to see them, and vaccinators were barred by school administrators from entry, said Syed Ehsan Hussain, a supervisor for the area's rural health center. The reaction to the HPV campaign mirrors longstanding vaccine skepticism in Pakistan, which, along with neighboring Afghanistan, is one of only two countries in the world where wild polio circulates. Vaccine hesitancy has been stoked by the revelation that the CIA sponsored a vaccination drive in 2011 in its effort to uncover Osama Bin Laden as well as by misinformation. Messaging around the HPV vaccination has been especially tricky, Hussain said, because HPV is often, though not always, spread through sex. \"Whenever we bring up sexual contact again and again, it becomes sensitive due to our religious values and our society.\" Health officials involved in the campaign say some parents were offended by the introduction of the vaccine as they thought it suggested that their teenage girls were having sex. Pakistani officials — including the country's federal health minister, Mustafa Kamal — tried to reassure the public by arranging for public vaccination of their own daughters. Vaccinators also went door-to-door to address parental fears. They downplayed the sexual transmission of the virus in favor of a broader message warning women about other methods of transmission — during childbirth and through contact with contaminated objects, including in hospital delivery rooms if instruments aren't sterilized properly. This type of transmission, although possible according to some research, is unlikely. Fatima Khan, 13, was vaccinated during the campaign at her private school in Islamabad after explaining to her mother why she thought it was a good idea. \"I was raised on the internet,\" she told NPR. \"I did my own research and explained to her why I thought it was important.\" Adil Hussain, a 36-year-old hotel security guard in Islamabad, also made up his mind about the vaccine after doing some research. He says when vaccinators didn't show up at his 10-year-old daughter Ayesha's school, he brought her on a Saturday to the local clinic for the shot. He doesn't use social media, so online rumors didn't dissuade him. He said he and his family members received other routine vaccines in the past, \"and now the same is being done for our children.\" That's an attitude Pakistani officials hope will gain momentum in future campaigns.

a small group of other international journalists inside Gaza on Wednesday, nearly one month into the ceasefire.  It was the first time I had entered Gaza after two years of war. We stood at the edge of an Israeli military outpost, looking out at what used to be the bustling Shujaiya neighborhood outside Gaza City. It was the scene of fierce fighting during the war. Now it is a wasteland of destruction. The tall high-rise buildings not demolished in Gaza City are seen in the far distance. Around them is a vast monochrome expanse as far as the eye can see. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Piles of concrete that used to be homes. Skeletons of schools. Concrete beams standing in the dirt like tall tombstones. For years before the war, I would enter Gaza every few months, to report for NPR. I remember driving through the Shujaiyeh neighborhood on my way to the center of Gaza City. Now it is unrecognizable. Gaza is now divided in two We were brought to an Israeli military outpost close to the \"yellow line,\" where Israeli forces withdrew to as part of the ceasefire deal that divides Gaza in half between areas controlled by Israel and Hamas. Palestinians aren't allowed to return to live in the half of Gaza where Israeli troops are stationed. They are living on the other side of Gaza under Hamas control. The military showed us a map of Hamas tunnel routes Israeli forces are still discovering and demolishing in the area. Israel has allowed Hamas and the International Committee of the Red Cross to access this area to uncover the bodies of hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel's military is dug in for the long term There is a plan for the next phase of the ceasefire: A multinational peacekeeping force is supposed to deploy in Gaza, and Hamas is supposed to disarm. Only then, Israel says, will it withdraw from Gaza. Questions remain: Will these next steps proceed as planned? If not, is the alternative a return to war? Is this temporary division of Gaza the new status quo? Israel's military says it is building the infrastructure to prepare its troops to occupy this half of Gaza for the foreseeable future. This Israeli military outpost has a tall cellphone tower, electricity poles and cement walls. On the other side of the yellow line, Hamas is digging in, too — regrouping after the war and consolidating control of its part of Gaza. A tightly controlled visit Israel only allows select journalists into Gaza for brief visits escorted by soldiers. We were restricted in who we could interview or film among the soldiers. We did not see Palestinians. As a condition of the visit, Israel's military censor reviewed NPR's raw audio and video. It prohibited NPR from publishing an Israeli military map of Gaza, but did not prohibit the publication of any other material. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Even now that there's a ceasefire, Israel does not allow journalists to enter Gaza independently. The Foreign Press Association in Israel and the Palestinian territories, of which NPR is a member, has  challenged the government  at Israel's Supreme Court to let journalists into the territory. The government has a Nov. 23 deadline to tell the court its position on independent entry for journalists to Gaza. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5603370","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"07:20:00-04:00","title":"Fedora man unmasked: Meet the teen behind the Louvre mystery photo","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 15-year-old boy, Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, from Rambouillet, France, gained global attention when a photo of him wearing a fedora and a three-piece suit was taken at the Louvre during a security cordon following a daylight heist of French crown jewels.

Louvre mystery photo \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Sunday, November 9, 2025 • 7:20 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         PARIS — When 15-year-old Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux realized an Associated Press photo of him at the Louvre on the day of the crown jewels heist had drawn millions of views, his first instinct was not to rush online and unmask himself. Quite the opposite. A fan of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who lives with his parents and grandfather in Rambouillet, 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Paris, Pedro decided to play along with the world's suspense. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       As theories swirled about the sharply dressed stranger in the \"Fedora Man\" shot — detective, insider, AI fake — he decided to stay silent and watch. \"I didn't want to say immediately it was me,\" he said. \"With this photo there is a mystery, so you have to make it last.\" For his only in-person interview since that snap turned him into an international curiosity, he appeared for the AP cameras at his home much as he did that Sunday: in a fedora hat, Yves Saint Laurent waistcoat borrowed from his father, jacket chosen by his mother, neat tie, Tommy Hilfiger trousers and a restored, war-battered Russian watch. The fedora, angled just so, is his homage to French Resistance hero Jean Moulin. In person, he is a bright, amused teenager who wandered, by accident, into a global story. From photo to fame The image that made him famous was meant to document a crime scene. Three police officers lean on a silver car blocking a Louvre entrance, hours after thieves carried out a daylight raid on French crown jewels. To the right, a lone figure in a three-piece ensemble strides past — a flash of film noir in a modern-day manhunt. The internet did the rest. \"Fedora Man,\" as users dubbed him, was cast as an old-school detective, an inside man, a Netflix pitch — or not human at all. Many were convinced he was AI-generated. Pedro understood why. \"In the photo, I'm dressed more in the 1940s, and we are in 2025,\" he said. \"There is a contrast.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Even some relatives and friends hesitated until they spotted his mother in the background. Only then were they sure: The internet's favorite fake detective was a real boy. The real story was simple. Pedro, his mother and grandfather had come to visit the Louvre. \"We wanted to go to the Louvre, but it was closed,\" he said. \"We didn't know there was a heist.\" They asked officers why the gates were shut. Seconds later, AP photographer Thibault Camus, documenting the security cordon, caught Pedro midstride. \"When the picture was taken, I didn't know,\" Pedro said. \"I was just passing through.\" Four days later, an acquaintance messaged: Is that you? \"She told me there were 5 million views,\" he said. \"I was a bit surprised.\" Then his mother called to say he was in The New York Times. \"It's not every day,\" he said. Cousins in Colombia, friends in Austria, family friends and classmates followed with screenshots and calls. \"People said, 'You've become a star,'\" he said. \"I was astonished that just with one photo you can become viral in a few days.\" An inspired style The look that jolted tens of millions is not a costume whipped up for a museum trip. Pedro began dressing this way less than a year ago, inspired by 20th-century history and black-and-white images of suited statesmen and fictional detectives. \"I like to be chic,\" he said. \"I go to school like this.\" In a sea of hoodies and sneakers, he shows up in a riff on a three-piece suit. And the hat? No, that's its own ritual. The fedora is reserved for weekends, holidays and museum visits. At his no-uniform school, his style has already started to spread. \"One of my friends came this week with a tie,\" he said. He understands why people projected a whole sleuth character onto him: improbable heist, improbable detective. He loves Poirot — \"very elegant\" — and likes the idea that an unusual crime calls for someone who looks unusual. \"When something unusual happens, you don't imagine a normal detective,\" he said. \"You imagine someone different.\" That instinct fits the world he comes from. His mother, Félicité Garzon Delvaux, grew up in an 18th-century museum-palace, daughter of a curator and an artist — and regularly takes her son to exhibits. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Art and museums are living spaces,\" she said. \"Life without art is not life.\" For Pedro, art and imagery were part of everyday life. So when millions projected stories onto a single frame of him in a fedora beside armed police at the Louvre, he recognized the power of an image and let the myth breathe before stepping forward. He stayed silent for several days, then switched his Instagram from private to public. \"People had to try to find who I am,\" he said. \"Then journalists came, and I told them my age. They were extremely surprised.\" He is relaxed about whatever comes next. \"I'm waiting for people to contact me for films,\" he said, grinning. \"That would be very funny.\" In a story of theft and security lapses, \"Fedora Man\" is a gentler counterpoint — a teenager who believes art, style and a good mystery belong to ordinary life. One photo turned him into a symbol. Meeting him confirms he is, reassuringly, real. \"I'm a star,\" he says — less brag than experiment, as if he's trying on the words the way he tries on a hat. \"I'll keep dressing like this. It's my style.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5601666","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"15:31:00-05:00","title":"What to do if your flight gets canceled because of the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to an extended government shutdown now the longest in U.S. history, the Trump administration is reducing air traffic at 40 of the nation's busiest airports, starting Friday and increasing to 10% flight reductions by next Friday.

\n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration is  reducing air traffic  at 40 of the nation's busiest airports, starting Friday and ramping up over the next week. The  Federal Aviation Administration says  the move aims to reduce pressure on air traffic controllers. As federal employees, they have been working without pay for over a month due to the government shutdown, now the  longest in U.S. history  with no end in sight. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Delays and disruptions  have already hit airports across the country as a result of  escalating staffing shortages . The new flight restrictions add another layer of uncertainty and stress for travelers. \"It does have the potential to be quite disruptive, even though the vast majority of flights are still going to operate as scheduled,\" says Nick Ewen, senior editorial director of The Points Guy travel website. The cancellations on Friday represent about a 4% reduction in flights. That number is expected to ramp up to the FAA-required 10% — or  some 4,400 fights daily  — by next Friday if the shutdown continues. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Major U.S. airlines say they are trying to minimize disruptions and are granting customers extra flexibility to change or refund their tickets during this period — even if their flight isn't canceled. The key word is \"flexibility,\" Ewen says. \"Travelers that are flying this weekend into next week, they have to be flexible and ready to pivot if things go wrong,\" he says. Here's what to know if that applies to you. Which flights could be affected?  Ewen says the likelihood of a flight getting canceled comes down to factors such as the size of the plane, how full it is and what route it is flying. \"The airlines are really trying to focus on those flights that are going to be least disruptive, where there are … alternatives to get affected customers to their final destination,\" he adds. United ,  Delta  and  Alaska  airlines, for instance, say their international flights will not be affected. United also says it is not canceling any flights operating between its seven hub airports, in Newark, N.J., Chicago, Houston, Denver, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some airlines have already posted flight changes through the weekend, and others into next week. They all say they are working to alert passengers on affected flights with as much notice as possible, directly through booking contact information as well as through their apps and websites. Ewen says anyone planning to travel should download their airline's app days in advance, and make sure notifications are enabled so travelers will, ideally, know about any changes before they actually get to the airport. \"If you do go to the airport, remember that a little kindness goes a long way,\" he adds. \"Screaming at a gate agent, yelling at a customer service agent is not going to increase the likelihood of you getting rebooked.\" What if your flight gets canceled?  Ewen advises passengers to try to rebook their flight as soon as possible, either through the airline's app or website, by phone or in-person if they're already at the airport. \"If you're on a plane with 100 passengers that gets canceled, that's 100 people that have to be accommodated,\" Ewen says. \"So if you can be among the first five to get accommodated, that's going to be ideally a better situation than someone who's the 95th customer.\" Airlines including  Alaska ,  Southwest  and  JetBlue  say that in most cases, customers on canceled flights will be automatically rebooked on the next available flight, though they can still cancel for a refund. Under Department of Transportation rules, customers on  significantly delayed  or canceled flights who choose not to accept an airline's rebooking option are entitled to a full refund, regardless of how restrictive their original ticket was. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That still applies here, Ewen says. On top of that, many airlines are giving customers more options by allowing them to cancel or rebook their flights without change fees. American Airlines is  waiving change fees , refunding affected passengers — in any fare class — if their flight is canceled or they choose not to fly. Delta is similarly letting all customers  change or cancel their flights  for free in affected markets. United also  says it will  refund those who cancel flights, and waive change fees (and in some cases, fare differences) for those who rebook. The specifics of these waivers are likely to evolve in the coming days, Ewen says. \"The best thing to do is if you are flying on a particular airline, look at that airline's website, read through the details of the policy that they have and know that it could change,\" he says. \"So even if your flight is not eligible today, it could be later today, or it could be tomorrow, or it could be on Monday.\" Should you change your plans proactively? With so much up in the air, some passengers may be wondering if it's worth flying at all. Ewen says if your plans are flexible, it may be worth rescheduling — both to remove some of the potential risk and add some \"slack back to the system\" by opening up seats for other people. The same is true for those who may be able to travel by car or train instead. \"Everyone has their own definition of how important it is to take the trip that they have booked,\" he says. \"But if you are truly flexible and you're like, 'Yeah, no, I can do this some other time,' it could be a good idea to go ahead and make that decision to cancel.\" What about booking upcoming travel?  Thanksgiving travel — which can be a headache any year — is one  big question  mark as the shutdown stretches on. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At the moment, Ewen says, it's still \"safe-ish.\" He says people who've already booked Thanksgiving flights shouldn't rush to cancel them just yet, and those hoping to make plans can still proceed with caution. \"If someone has not booked Thanksgiving travel yet and they have to take a flight, I would say go ahead and try to lock those plans in now, and maybe consider either adding travel insurance on top of that or potentially booking a fully refundable ticket in case there are going to be delays or cancellations.\" Mark Friedlander, a spokesperson for the nonprofit Insurance Information Institute, recommends people shop around for travel insurance policies beyond what airlines offer at checkout, noting that sites like  Squaremouth  make it easy to compare options. He says standard policies typically start at between 4% and 10% of the cost of a prepaid, nonrefundable trip — and while you don't necessarily have to buy them the same day you book your flight, it's cheaper to do so sooner than later. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       There is one catch: Most standard policies have a \"known event clause\" for things like natural disasters or political crises, Friedlander says. So the travel insurance you buy while the shutdown is already happening is not likely to cover any disruptions caused by it. That's why airlines' extra flexible policies are \"good news for all consumers,\" he says. Ewen of The Points Guy says the longer the shutdown continues, the longer it could take crews and planes to get back on track — all the more reason airlines and passengers alike are hoping for a resolution soon. \"Right now, we're in a little bit of a travel lull before that Thanksgiving rush,\" he says. \"So if we can get things dealt with, hopefully we'll be able to avoid some of the major issues during Thanksgiving week. But again, that just remains to be seen.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587748","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:58:00-05:00","title":"CRISPR Gene-Editing Works to Reduce High Cholesterol in a New Study","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small early clinical study involving 15 volunteers found that a single infusion of a CRISPR-based gene-editing drug safely reduces cholesterol and triglyceride levels by up to 50%, by disabling the ANGPTL3 gene in the liver.

CRISPR gene-editing works to reduce high cholesterol in a new study \n         By Rob Stein \n        \n           Saturday, November 8, 2025 • 9:58 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         A single infusion of an experimental gene-editing drug appears safe and effective for cutting cholesterol, possibly for life, according to a small early study released Saturday. The study, which involved 15 volunteers, found one infusion of a drug that uses the CRISPR gene-editing technique could safely reduce cholesterol, as well as levels of harmful triglycerides, by about half. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Rather than a lifetime worth of medicine, we have the potential to give people a cure,\" said Dr.  Luke Laffin , a preventative cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who helped conduct the study. \"It's very exciting.\" The results of the study were presented Saturday at the  American Heart Association's annual meeting  and published in  The New England Journal of Medicine . If confirmed by future research, the approach could provide a powerful new weapon to fight  heart disease , the nation's leading killer, freeing people from the need to take statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs every day. Laffin and others cautioned, however, that much more research is needed to confirm the findings and make sure the treatment would be safe and long-lasting. \"The idea of an inexpensive, one-and-done [treatment], so you don't have to take any of those drugs, right now that's an idea — a fantasy — because gene-editing is expensive, long-term safety is unclear,\" Dr.  Eric Topol , a cardiologist at Scripps Research in California who wasn't involved in the study. Other scientists agree. \"It's a step in the right direction,\" says Dr.  Kiran Musunuru , scientific director of the Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. He was not involved in the research either.  \"It could be a very important tool,\" he says. \"But to actually prove it's protective against cardiovascular disease you need to do more study.\" And, Musunuru and others note that the bar for safety would be higher to use gene-editing on patients who are otherwise healthy compared to those already suffering from serious illnesses. Doctors infuse the drug into patients' bloodstream so it can travel to the liver and disable a gene called ANGPTL3, which is involved in producing cholesterol and triglycerides.  \"It's a knockout of the gene.

A single infusion of an experimental gene-editing drug appears safe and effective for cutting cholesterol, possibly for life. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the story. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Millions of people take medicines every day to cut their cholesterol and the risk of having a heart attack or stroke, but heart disease still kills nearly 700,000 people every year in the U.S. One big reason - a lot of people quit taking their medicine. Dr. Steven Nissen is a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. STEVEN NISSEN: This problem of adherence, that people stop taking their medications, is huge. STEIN: So Nissen and his colleagues infused 15 patients with an experimental drug that uses the gene-editing technique called CRISPR. This CRISPR drug homes in on a gene in the liver involved in making cholesterol, as well as dangerous triglycerides, and literally slices it. NISSEN: It's a knockout of the gene. It cuts it, and after that, the gene no longer functions. STEIN: And disabling the gene appears to work, safely reducing levels of cholesterol and triglycerides by as much as half for at least two months, suggesting the benefits may be permanent. LUKE LAFFIN: This is a big deal. Rather than a lifetime worth of medicine, we have the potential to give people a cure. STEIN: Dr. Luke Laffin worked with Nissen at the Cleveland Clinic. Their team presented the results at the American Heart Association's annual scientific meeting at the same time the details were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The results are similar to those announced previously by another team testing another potential one-and-done gene-editing drug to cut cholesterol. Fyodor Urnov studies gene editing at the University of California, Berkeley. FYODOR URNOV: The fact that we now have more clinical data that there is, quote, \"a there there,\" is, of course, tremendously encouraging. Having a CRISPR medicine for heart attack would be an extraordinary win. STEIN: But others urge caution, noting the studies so far have been very small and very short. Dr. Eric Topol is a cardiologist at Scripps Research in California. ERIC TOPOL: The idea of an inexpensive one-and-done so you don't have to take any of those drugs, right now, that's an idea - a fantasy - 'cause right now, genome editing is terribly expensive. The long-term safety is unclear. STEIN: So researchers are planning larger, longer studies to see whether a one-time gene-editing drug could safely protect people against heart attacks and strokes for a lifetime.

air traffic reductions are taking effect. Here's what to know \n         By Joel Rose \n        \n           Friday, November 7, 2025 • 1:14 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         WASHINGTON — Airlines have begun canceling hundreds of flights to comply with an order from the Federal Aviation Administration, with the goal of gradually reducing air traffic at dozens of the nation's busiest airports by 10%. The agency says the move is necessary to keep the airspace safe as it deals with persistent staffing shortages of air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay during the government shutdown. \"We'll see probably more people on less flights, which means less pressure on controllers,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said to reporters at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Friday. But there are still many unanswered questions about this planned reduction in air traffic, and what it will mean for airlines and travelers. How will the FAA's plan to reduce flights work? In an  order  released late Thursday, the FAA listed the 40 major airports that it has targeted for reductions in air traffic. The list includes major airline hubs in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles and in Newark, N.J. Flights between those major airports and many other mid-sized and regional airports will also be affected as airlines pare back their schedules. For example, United Airlines has  published a full list of flights  it is cancelling through the weekend, with many smaller markets like Moline, Ill.; Shreveport, La.; Grand Junction, Colo.; and Fresno, Calif., losing flights. The FAA's plan requires airlines to phase in these cuts gradually, starting with 4% of flights through the weekend and gradually building up to 10% by next Friday. Airlines have some discretion to decide how they're going to hit those targets, so it's likely they will seek to protect their most popular and profitable routes while cutting back on regional flights. The order to reduce traffic applies only to domestic flights, not to international routes. The FAA's plan also imposes temporary limits on commercial space launches, which can place extra demands on air traffic controllers. How big of an impact will this have on airline operations?  The major airlines are trying to downplay the impact of the flight reductions. Delta Air Lines says it plans to operate \"the vast majority of our schedule,\" and to continue flying to all of the markets the airline serves, \"though frequency may be affected.\" David Seymour, the chief operating officer at American Airlines, said in a letter to the company's employees that \"the majority of our reductions involve our regional flying schedule. And, to ensure we can reaccommodate as many customers as possible, we've also focused the reductions on higher-frequency markets.\" An executive at United Airlines says the airline will also try to minimize the impact on customers. \"The good point, if there is a silver lining here, is that we are not in peak travel period now,\" said David Kinzelman, a senior vice president for airport operations at United, so the airline has more seats available for customers whose flights are cancelled. In an  interview  with NPR's All Things Considered on Thursday, Kinzelman said airlines are used to adjusting their operations quickly. \"We have service disruptions frequently in the airline business. They could be storms. They could be staffing triggers,\" Kinzelman said. \"So we've got a good playbook. Just to put it in perspective, the impact here is about what we would expect from a medium-sized storm.\" But this situation is different from a line of thunderstorms that affects only one or two parts of the country. There is no exact precedent for a reduction in air traffic across so many airports at the same time, so it's difficult to predict how it will go. How did the FAA pick which airports to target?  It's not entirely clear, though FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford has said the process was based on data, including internal safety metrics and voluntary reports from commercial air transport pilots. \"We're trying to be prescriptive, surgical,\" Bedford said during a press conference announcing the reductions on Wednesday. \"Put the relief where the relief will do the most good.\" The list of 40 major airports includes some that have experienced persistent shortages of air traffic controllers during the shutdown, including Newark Liberty International Airport and Reagan Washington National Airport. But surprisingly, the list does not include airports in Austin and Nashville, which have seen frequent shortages of controllers both before and during the shutdown. Some of the airports that do appear on the list are also puzzling — perhaps none more so than Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in Alaska. The airport is a major hub for cargo arriving from Asia. But the FAA has not reported significant staffing shortages of air traffic controllers at the airport or other facilities that manage traffic around it during the shutdown. Why is the FAA doing this right now?  The FAA says the move is necessary to keep the system safe while fewer air traffic controllers are showing up to work during the government shutdown.  Those controllers are required to work without pay until the shutdown ends, and they're under  growing pressure  as they face the prospect of missing a second full paycheck. Some have taken on second jobs, and many are calling out sick. Despite that, the air traffic control system had been working fairly well during the shutdown — until last weekend, when the FAA reported extensive staffing shortages at dozens of facilities across the country. But the Trump administration's critics say the move appears to be about more than just safety. \"This is a political move by the Trump administration to try to force Democrats to accede to their budget and priorities which cut health care and nutritional benefits from seniors, children and people with disabilities,\" said U.S. Representative Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., a former top Democrat on the House subcommittee that oversees aviation. Still, Cohen called the move \"prudent\" given the added stress on air traffic controllers. The head of Airlines for America, an airline industry trade group, rejected the argument that optics or politics are driving the flight reductions. \"It's all in the name of safety,\" said Chris Sununu, the group's president and CEO and a former Republican governor of New Hampshire, in an  interview  with NPR's Morning Edition. \"The airlines are at risk of losing hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. They're not doing that just for political moves. They're doing that because they know safety is absolutely paramount, pressures are absolutely growing.\" How are travelers handling the uncertainty about their flights?  Many are understandably worried about their upcoming travel plans. NPR member station WABE spoke to Ellen Silva, who had just arrived in Atlanta on Thursday. She's supposed to fly back to Baltimore on Tuesday, but she's concerned about what could happen if that flight is cancelled. \"I would miss work and I'd have some very unhappy people that I work for because they depend on me so they can travel, and if I'm not there they can't leave,\" Silva said. Patricia Andeweg was supposed to fly from Boston Logan International Airport to Australia to celebrate her 90th birthday with family this week. But thanks to a series of delays and shutdown-induced cancellations, she missed her connecting flight. \"I'm missing my birthday,\" Andeweg told member station GBH on Friday. \"But on the other hand, I met so many helpful people, right, left and center. I call it the journey to nowhere.\" Jeremy Siegel from member station GBH in Boston and Marlon Hyde at WABE in Atlanta contributed to this report. \n         \n         Transcript \n         JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:   Airlines have begun canceling hundreds of flights to comply with an order from the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency says this move is necessary to keep the airspace safe, as it deals with a persistent shortage of air traffic controllers during the ongoing government shutdown. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says, reductions are set to hit 10% of flights at dozens of high-traffic airports next week, and Duffy told Fox News today there could be even more cuts ahead. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SEAN DUFFY: So if this shutdown doesn't end relatively soon, the consequence of that is going to be more controllers don't come to work, and then we're going to have to continue to assess the pressure in the airspace and make decisions that may, again, move us from 10% to 15%, maybe to 20. SUMMERS: NPR transportation correspondent Joel Rose is here with more. Hey there. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey there. SUMMERS: Joel, this doesn't sound like great news if you've got to get on a plane anytime soon. What can you tell us about how these cuts might work? ROSE: Yeah. Late Thursday, the FAA officially released the list of these 40 major airports where it is aiming to reduce the number of flights, it includes some major airline hubs - Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, many more. But the effects will also ripple out and touch many smaller airports that have flights that connect with those bigger hubs. The FAA's plan requires airlines to phase in the cuts gradually, so these airlines are going to cut about 4% of flights this weekend and then gradually work their way up to 10% by next Friday. The airlines have some discretion to decide how they're going to hit those targets. So I think it's likely that they're going to try to protect their most popular and most profitable routes. And we also know these reductions will not apply to international flights, only to domestic. SUMMERS: Do you have a sense of how big an impact this will have on airline operations? ROSE: The major airlines are trying to downplay the impact of these reductions. Delta Airlines said that it would operate the vast majority of its flights as scheduled, but that the frequency of those flights to some destinations might be limited. American airlines said the impact would be mostly on its regional flights, and United Airlines has published a full list of the flights that it is canceling through the weekend. And it includes flights to or from many smaller markets, places like Moline, Illinois, Shreveport, Louisiana, Grand Junction, Colorado, and Fresno, California. So, you know, we may see that these mid-sized and regional airports that don't have as many flights to begin with, they are probably going to share in this pain, too. SUMMERS: I think a big question for a lot of travelers is why all of this is happening right now? ROSE: There is debate over whether this is really about safety or politics. The government shutdown is clearly taking a toll on air traffic controllers who are required to work without pay. Some have taken on second jobs, and many are calling out sick. Overall, though, the air traffic control system had been working fairly well during the shutdown until this past weekend. That is when we did see staffing shortages at dozens of facilities all at once. Chris Sununu is the head of Airlines For America. It's an airline industry trade group. He is also a former Republican governor of New Hampshire. Sununu spoke to NPR's Morning Edition today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT) CHRIS SUNUNU: It is all about safety. Trust me, the airlines have - are at the risk of losing hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. LEILA FADEL: Yeah. SUNUNU: They're not doing that just for political moves. They're doing it because they know safety is absolutely paramount. Pressures are absolutely growing. ROSE: You know, not everyone shares that view, however, of what is happening. To the Trump administration's critics, this move does appear to be about politics, as well. Congressman Steve Cohen from Tennessee is a Democrat and the former ranking member of the House subcommittee that oversees aviation. And in a statement, he said that this is a, quote, \"political move by the Trump administration,\" unquote, to try to force Democrats' hands as this government shutdown drags on. SUMMERS: Joel, one more thing, do you know how the FAA picked which 40 airports to target for these reductions? ROSE: You know, it is not entirely clear. The FAA administrator says the agency was trying to, quote, \"put the relief where the relief will do the most good.\" And, you know, the list does include some of the places that have had persistent staffing shortages, but it does not include some airports that you would also have expected to see, including Nashville and Austin, which, even today, had long ground delays because of staffing shortages. And then there are some puzzling choices that are on the list, including Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport in Alaska. The airport is a major hub for cargo that's arriving from Asia, but the FAA has not reported significant shortages of air traffic controllers at the airport or the facilities that manage its traffic. So kind of hard to understand why that one is seeing these cuts. SUMMERS: NPR's Joel Rose. Thank you. ROSE: You're welcome. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5558286","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"05:01:00-04:00","title":"Support for Israel among U.S. conservatives is starting to crack.

Here's why \n         By Geoff Brumfiel \n        \n           Friday, November 7, 2025 • 5:01 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         Red-state America has been a big fan of Israel, according to Jackson Lahmeyer, an evangelical pastor in Oklahoma and founder of Pastors for Trump. \"Evangelical Christians in America for the most part, not always but generally speaking, have usually been very strong supporters of the nation of Israel and the Jewish people,\" Lahmeyer said in an interview with NPR. That support is deeply rooted in their evangelical faith, he said. But recently, Lahmeyer has noticed the conversation around Israel is changing quite a bit — particularly online. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Some very influential leaders, all of whom I like — Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene — have taken a very controversial stance in regards to the nation of Israel,\" he said. Last week, Carlson hosted a prominent white nationalist named Nick Fuentes on his show. Although Carlson disagreed with Fuentes on his most antisemitic statements, such as American Jews are more faithful to Israel than they are to the United States, he did broadly align with Fuentes on his views about the country itself. \"I've always thought it's great to criticize and question our relationship with Israel because it's insane and it hurts us. We get nothing out of it, I completely agree with you there,\" Carlson said. Opposition to Israel on the right isn't new, but younger conservatives appear to be rapidly moving away from supporting the close U.S. relationship with the country. Among several polls,  one from the Pew Research Center  out earlier this year showed that conservatives under 50 were increasingly skeptical of Israel. Over the past three years, the group's negative views of the country jumped from 35% to 50%. The stakes for Israel are enormous. If skepticism starts spreading from conservative influencers to elected officials, it could threaten  billions in military and foreign aid  that Israel receives each year from the U.S.  For more than a decade, the majority of its political support in America has come from Christian conservatives, said Daniel Hummel, a historian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison who's studied Christian support for Israel. Today, with many on the left angry over the war in Gaza, their backing is more important than ever. \"They're the last bastion of organized, large-scale national support for Israel,\" he said. Biblical roots Christian support for Israel is rooted in the Bible itself. Many evangelical Christians believe that the promises God made to the Jewish people in the Old Testament still hold, Lahmeyer said. \"God's made a covenant with the Jewish people and he's not going to break that covenant,\" he said. Evangelicals see support of the modern state of Israel as a way of honoring that divine will. \"If God says, 'This land belongs to you eternally,' then it belongs to you eternally — because God's the creator, he's the owner,\" Lahmeyer said. Many also believe the return of the Jewish people to Israel is a prerequisite for the second coming of Christ, he added. From a modern standpoint, Hummel says, Christian support for the state of Israel has been growing in fits and starts since the nation was founded in 1948. The famous evangelical pastor Billy Graham visited Israel in the 1960s. By the 1980s and 1990s many large Christian groups, like the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition, were supporting Israel. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Evangelical support for Israel grew vastly in the years following the 9/11 terror attacks, Hummel said. Particularly in 2006, support for the country took off with the formation of a group known as Christians United For Israel (CUFI). The group became a single-issue lobby that claimed support from millions of American evangelicals, Hummel said. CUFI has been a staunch advocate for Israel and some of its most expansionist policies — such as settlements in the West Bank. (CUFI did not respond to NPR's request for an interview for this story.) Because of their biblical beliefs about Israel, Hummel said, evangelical backers, known as Christian Zionists, have become central to American support. The backing of Christian Zionists kept growing, even as traditional supporters on the American left grew increasingly skeptical of Israel's policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Today Christian Zionists \"are really valuable to Israel,\" he said. \"They tend to say, 'We think Israel knows its interests best… and we just want to support what they decide.'\" Cracks over Gaza But Israel's war in Gaza has challenged that view. \"Over the last two years, there has been this kind of gnawing away of support of Israel among evangelical Christians,\" Lahmeyer said. The polls support that observation, said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, who tracks public opinion about Israel. He says that since the war in Gaza, support has plummeted among young conservatives. Telhami's own work shows that today, only 32% of evangelicals aged 18-34 sympathize with Israel over the Palestinians — that's more than 30 points lower than the older generation. Support more broadly from Republicans in the same age range is only 24%. Telhami believes that shift in sentiment has emboldened longtime opponents to Israel on the right. In addition to Tucker Carlson, prominent Republican influencers like Candace Owens and Stephen Bannon have publicly criticized Israel recently. Many of these personalities never supported Israel, and they sense that now is the moment to speak up, said Curt Mills, editor of the American Conservative Magazine, which opposes Israeli policies and was founded by Pat Buchanan – a Christian conservative, former presidential hopeful and political commentator. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Tucker and Bannon are political operators and in a lot of ways true believers, but they are also very effective businessmen and they would not be doing these programs if nobody gave a hoot,\" he said. \"There's an audience for this, people are frustrated, people are angry and they have reason to be.\" In addition to anger over the way Israel has conducted its war in Gaza, Mills says many conservatives want America to avoid becoming entangled in new wars, particularly in the Middle East. And they worry Trump is allowing Israel to drive military decisions. That anxiety grew after  America bombed Iranian nuclear sites  earlier this year. \"They are using Donald Trump's presidency like a rented car. The Israelis, the Israeli lobby, the Netanyahu Government, the neoconservatives in his ranks,\" he said. Resurgent antisemitism A desire for American isolationism and outrage over how Israel has conducted the war have driven some to speak up. But other influencers are using the war as an opportunity to peddle antisemitic conspiracies. One example came last month, when podcaster Candace Owens discussed  a meeting  between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a group of U.S. social media influencers: \"Two years ago, the mere idea that you might share a perspective that Jews are controlling the media, that would be considered antisemitic. You would be called a Jew hater. Fast forward to 2025, and Bibi Netanyahu is now hosting an on-camera meeting,\" she said. The idea that \"Jews control the media\" is a long-held antisemitic trope. Owens has made other antisemitic remarks in the past, though she has repeatedly said that she does not hate Jewish people. White nationalist Nick Fuentes used his appearance on Carlson's show to promote numerous antisemitic ideas: including that he believed Jews naturally dislike Europeans and that Jewish people prevent America from unifying around a common vision for itself. \"The main challenge to that, a big challenge to [unifying the country] is organized Jewry in America,\" he told Carlson. Hummel points out that much of this antisemitism is entangled in a theological divide over Israel. Many conservative opponents to Israel are Catholic or non-evangelical Protestants, he said. Those individuals do not necessarily share the view that the Jewish people still share a sacred covenant with God. And some, like Fuentes, are resurfacing centuries-old Christian conspiracy theories about the Jewish people. Telhami says that it remains to be seen what all this actually means for the relationship between America and Israel. The Trump administration continues to be broadly supportive, and the U.S. ambassador to Israel is Mike Huckabee — a devout evangelical Christian. \"The question of course is whether the shift in public opinion in-and-of-itself would lead to a shift in policy. And that's not a straightforward line,\" Telhami said. But he added, it is clear that on the American right, support for Israel is no longer the given it once was. \n         \n         Transcript \n         MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   For decades, Israel has enjoyed strong support from American conservatives. Now some prominent influencers on the political right are questioning that support. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has more on what's driving the change and what it could mean. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Red-state America has been a fan of Israel. Just ask Jackson Lahmeyer, an evangelical pastor in Oklahoma. JACKSON LAHMEYER: In the past, everyone that was in our Christian conservative circles, you just assumed everybody supported Israel. BRUMFIEL: That evangelical support is deeply rooted in faith, he says, but recently, Lahmeyer has noticed the conversation is changing quite a bit, particularly online. LAHMEYER: Some very influential leaders, all of whom I like - Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene - have taken a very controversial stance in regards to the nation of Israel that has actually been more of a Democratic Party platform item. BRUMFIEL: Like in August, when Tucker Carlson interviewed a nun from the West Bank about the suffering of Palestinian Christians. Carlson said he wanted to raise awareness among Americans. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\") TUCKER CARLSON: Israel couldn't exist without the United States, and it has the support of so many Christians in the United States. And I don't know if they're fully aware. I think they would care if they knew. BRUMFIEL: The war in Gaza has prompted other prominent Republicans like Steve Bannon to raise criticisms of Israel. Curt Mills is editor of The American Conservative magazine. He says many of these personalities never supported Israel, and they sense now is the moment to speak up. CURT MILLS: Tucker and Bannon are political operators and, in a lot of ways, true believers. But they are also very effective businessmen, and they would not be doing these programs if nobody gave a hoot. There's an audience for this. People are frustrated, people are angry, and they have reason to be. BRUMFIEL: That frustration is about more than just suffering in Gaza, Mills says. Many conservatives want America to avoid becoming entangled in new wars, particularly in the Middle East, and they worry the Trump administration is allowing Israel to drive military decisions like America's attack on Iran earlier this year. MILLS: They are using Donald Trump's presidency like a rented car - the Israelis, the Israel lobby, the Netanyahu government, the neoconservatives in his ranks. BRUMFIEL: So outrage over the war in Gaza and the America First agenda are driving some of this conservative opposition to Israel, but there's something else - antisemitic conspiracies. Take, for example, this comment podcaster Candace Owens made about a recent meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a group of U.S. social media influencers. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"CANDACE\") CANDACE OWENS: Two years ago, the mere idea that you might share a perspective that Jews are controlling the media, that would be considered antisemitic. You would be called a Jew-hater. Fast forward to 2025, and Bibi Netanyahu is now hosting an on-camera meeting. BRUMFIEL: The idea that Jews control the media is a long-held antisemitic trope. Owens has made other antisemitic remarks in the past, though she has repeatedly said that she does not hate Jewish people. And just last week, Tucker Carlson hosted Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist who has called Hitler awesome. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\") CARLSON: I'm going to just shut up, and you tell me what you actually believe. NICK FUENTES: Yeah... BRUMFIEL: Fuentes went on to make numerous antisemitic statements, including that he believed Jews were more faithful to Israel than the countries they were born in and that Jewish people prevent America from unifying around a common vision for itself. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\") FUENTES: The main challenge to that, a big challenge to that, is organized Jewry in America. BRUMFIEL: Carlson's interview with Fuentes sparked a firestorm on the right. Some Republicans blasted him for giving Fuentes a platform, while others, like the president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, supported Carlson's right to have an open dialogue. Why is this happening now? Shibley Telhami is a scholar at the University of Maryland who tracks public opinion about Israel. SHIBLEY TELHAMI: Among Republicans, there's still support for Israel. That is really the core support for Israel right now. But what we've seen is really a shift. BRUMFIEL: He says the Gaza war has damaged Israel's image, particularly with young conservatives. A Pew poll this spring found the number of Republicans under 50 with an unfavorable view of Israel has jumped 15 points since 2022. Telhami's own work shows that only 24% of young Republicans sympathize with Israel in the current conflict. And separate polling has also showed that younger conservatives are more likely to agree with antisemitic statements than other groups. Put it all together and, he says, influencers are free to speak up. TELHAMI: These people who are critics of Israel on the right feel more empowered because they now see that even public opinion is on their side among the young generation of Republicans. BRUMFIEL: It remains to be seen what this actually means for America's relationship with Israel. American Ambassador Mike Huckabee is a devout evangelical Christian, and the Trump administration continues to be broadly supportive. TELHAMI: The question, of course, is whether the shift in public opinion in and of itself would lead to a shift in policy, and that's not a straightforward line. BRUMFIEL: But it is clear that, on the American right, support for Israel is no longer the given it once was.

know about the 5 hostages whose remains are still in Gaza \n         By The Associated Press \n        \n           Saturday, November 8, 2025 • 4:16 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         JERUSALEM — Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza began on Oct. 10, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 23 hostages held for the past two years. But the process of returning the bodies of the five remaining hostages, as called for under the truce deal, is progressing slowly. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Hamas says it has not been able to reach all of the remains because they are buried under rubble left by Israel's two-year offensive in Gaza. Israel has accused the militants of dragging their feet and threatened to resume military operations or withhold humanitarian aid if all remains are not returned. In the most recent release, Hamas returned the remains of an Israeli man who died while fighting Hamas in the militants' Oct. 7, 2023 attack that started the war. He was identified as Lior Rudaeff, who was 61 when he was killed. In return, Israel has released the bodies of 285 Palestinians back to Gaza. Israel has not provided details on their identities, and it is unclear if they were people killed in Israel during the Oct. 7 attack, Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody or bodies taken from Gaza by Israeli troops during the war. Health officials in Gaza have struggled to identify the bodies without access to DNA kits and have identified 84 of the bodies. Here's a look at the hostages whose remains have not been returned. Meny Godard, 73 Meny Godard was a professional soccer player before enlisting in the Israeli military and serving in the 1973 Mideast War, according to Kibbutz Be'eri. He served in a variety of different positions in the kibbutz, including at its printing press. On the morning of Oct. 7, Godard and his wife, Ayelet, were forced out of their home after it was set on fire. She hid in the bushes for a number of hours before militants discovered her and killed her. She was able to tell her children that Meny had been killed before she died. The family held a double funeral for the couple. They are survived by four children and six grandchildren. Hadar Goldin, 23 Hadar Goldin's remains are the only ones that have been held in Gaza since before the war. The Israeli soldier was killed on Aug. 1, 2014, two hours after a ceasefire took effect ending the that year's war between Israel and Hamas. Based on evidence found in the tunnel where Goldin's body was taken, including a blood-soaked shirt and prayer fringes, the military quickly determined that he had been killed in the attack. Goldin is survived by his parents and three siblings, including a twin. He had proposed to his fiancée before he was killed. Earlier this year, Goldin's family marked 4,000 days since his body was taken. The military retrieved the body of another soldier who was killed in the 2014 war earlier this year. Ran Gvili, 24 Ran Gvili, who served in an elite police unit, was recovering from a broken shoulder he sustained in a motorcycle accident but rushed to assist fellow officers on Oct. 7. After helping people escape from the Nova music festival, he was killed fighting at another location and his body was taken to Gaza. The military confirmed his death four months later. He is survived by his parents and a sister. Dror Or, 52 Dror Or was a father of three who worked at the dairy farm on Kibbutz Be'eri for 15 years, rising to the position of manager. He was an expert cheesemaker, according to family and friends. On Oct. 7, the family was hiding in their safe room when militants lit the house on fire. Dror and his wife, Yonat, were killed. Two of their children, Noam, 17, and Alma, 13, were abducted and released during the November 2023 ceasefire. Sudthisak Rinthalak Sudthisak Rinthalak was an agricultural worker from Thailand who had been employed at Kibbutz Be'eri. According to media reports, Rinthalak was divorced and had been working in Israel since 2017. A total of 31 workers from Thailand were kidnapped on Oct. 7, the largest group of foreigners to be held in captivity. Most of them were released in the first and second ceasefires. The Thai Foreign Ministry has said in addition to the hostages, 46 Thais have been killed during the war. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/florida-tampa-police-chase-deadly-crash-cb88187b5d8ae830fbefef0456c6bf82","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"15:57:12+00:00","title":"Speeding Car Slams Into Tampa Bar, Killing Four, Injuring 11","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 22-year-old man, Silas Sampson, was involved in a deadly collision after fleeing police in a silver sedan through the historic Ybor City district of Tampa, Florida.

crowded bar early Saturday, killing four people and injuring 11 in a historic district of Tampa, Florida, that is known for its nightlife and tourists. An air patrol unit spotted the silver sedan driving recklessly on a freeway at about 12:40 a.m. after it was seen street racing in another neighborhood, the Tampa Police Department said in a statement. The Florida Highway Patrol caught up with the vehicle and tried to perform a PIT maneuver, which involves bumping the rear fender to cause a spinout, but it was unsuccessful. Highway patrol officers “disengaged” as the vehicle sped toward historic Ybor City near downtown, police said, and ultimately the driver lost control and hit more than a dozen people outside the bar, Bradley’s on 7th. Three people died at the scene, and a fourth died at a hospital. As of Saturday afternoon, two people were hospitalized in critical condition, seven were listed as stable and two had been treated and discharged, police said. Additionally there were two people who had only minor injuries and declined treatment at the scene. “What happened this morning was a senseless tragedy, our hearts are with the loved ones of the victims and all those who were impacted,” Police Chief Lee Bercaw said in a statement.

She added that the investigation is ongoing. In recent years some states and local agencies have pushed to restrict high-speed car chases to protect both civilians and officers. Following a rise in fatalities , a 2023 study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice called for chases to be rare, saying the dangers often outweigh the immediate need to take someone into custody. Nevertheless, Florida’s highway patrol has loosened limits on car chases and PIT maneuvers, tactics that the Justice Department-backed report characterized as “high-risk” and “controversial.” ___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The demand from the U.S. Department of Agriculture came as more than two dozen states warned of “catastrophic operational disruptions” if the Trump administration does not reimburse them for those SNAP benefits they authorized before the Supreme Court’s stay. Nonprofits and Democratic attorneys general sued to force the Trump administration to maintain the program in November despite the ongoing government shutdown . They won the favorable rulings last week, leading to the swift release of benefits to millions in several states, and the Trump administration belatedly said the program could continue.

It was unclear if the directive applies to states that used their own funds to keep the program alive or to ones relying on federal money entirely. The Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a filing in federal court on Sunday, the agency said states moved too quickly and erroneously released full money SNAP Benefits after last week’s rulings. U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, on Sunday called the directive “shocking” if it applies to states, like hers, that used their own money to prop up the program. “It’s one thing if the federal government is going to continue its level of appeal through the courts to say, no, this can’t be done,” Murkowski said. “But when you are telling the states that have said this is a significant enough issue in our state, we’re going to find resources, backfill or front load, whatever term you want, to help our people, those states should not be penalized.” Sen.

Maura Healey of Massachusetts said SNAP benefits were processed and placed on EBT cards before the U.S. Supreme Court order Friday night, in line with the previous guidance from the USDA. She said that if Trump attempts to claw back the money, “we will see him in court.” “Massachusetts residents with funds on their cards should continue to spend it on food,” she said in a statement Sunday. “President Trump should be focusing on reopening the government that he controls instead of repeatedly fighting to take away food from American families.” Democrats have hammered Trump for targeting the anti-hunger program during the government shutdown, contending the administration could have maintained it even with other parts of the government idle. As senators worked through the weekend on a deal to end the stalemate, their bipartisan package of agreed-upon measures to keep open some aspects of government included full funding of SNAP programs and a provision that would ensure reimbursements for expenditures made during the shutdown. More than two-dozen states represented by Democratic attorneys general on Saturday warned in a court filing that, even before the Supreme Court put the rulings on hold, the Trump administration was refusing to reimburse them for those legally-ordered SNAP payments.

Tony Evers’ administration warned in a lengthy statement on Sunday. The lack of money could leave vendors unpaid and trigger escalating legal claims, the states warned. “States could face demands to return hundreds of millions of dollars in the aggregate,” the states’ filing at the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals says. That situation “would risk catastrophic operational disruptions for the States, with a consequent cascade of harms for their residents,” the filing concludes. Evers issued a quick response to the Trump administration’s demand to undo the payments. “No,” the governor said in a statement. “Pursuant to and consistent with an active court order, Wisconsin legally loaded benefits to cards, ensuring nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites, including nearly 270,000 kids, had access to basic food and groceries,” Evers said. “After we did so, the Trump Administration assured Wisconsin and other states that they were actively working to implement full SNAP benefits for November and would ‘complete the processes necessary to make funds available.’ They have failed to do so to date.” Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland said in an interview on CBS on Sunday that “in the past six days, we’ve received four different measures of guidance” from the Trump administration. He fumed over the latest that threatened to punish states that paid the full benefits. “There is a chaos, and it is an intentional chaos, that we are seeing from this administration,” Moore said. __ Riccardi reported from Denver and Bauer from Madison, Wisconsin.

estimates Sunday, a better-than-expected result that slightly lifted the box office from its autumn doldrums. On the heels of the worst box office weekend of 2025, “Predator: Badlands” faced little competition from new titles. Not accounting for inflation, the $40 million opening marked a new high for the dreadlocked alien franchise, besting the $38.3 million launch of 2004’s “Alien vs. Predator.” “Predator: Badlands,” written and directed by Dan Trachtenberg, collected another $40 million overseas for the Walt Disney Co.’s 20th Century Studios. A key factor for “Predator: Badlands” is that, with a budget of $105 million, it’s also the most expensive “Predator” film. “Badlands,” the eighth movie in the franchise that began with 1987’s “Predator,” offers a novel twist for the sci-fi series. On a remote planet, a young, outcast predator (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) encounters an android researcher (Elle Fanning), and the two set off on a journey. Reviews (85% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) have been good. Moviegoers gave it an “A-” CinemaScore. Good news had lately been hard to find in movie theaters. On Wednesday, AMC Theaters, the largest theater chain, posted a $298.2 million quarterly loss, partly due to a less-than-stellar summer season. But the fall has been worse. Last month was the lowest-grossing October in nearly three decades. Few awards hopefuls have made much of a mark.

But despite plenty of star power, most fell flat. “Die My Love,” starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson, launched with $2.8 million from 1,983 theaters. The film, directed by Lynne Ramsay, stars Lawrence as a new mother and Pattinson as her husband. Mubi plunked down a reported $24 million for “Die My Love” after its debut at the Cannes Film Festival . Audience slammed it with a “D+” CinemaScore. “Christy,” starring Sydney Sweeney as the professional boxer Christy Martin, debuted with $1.3 million in 2,011 theaters. The film, the first one distributed by production company Black Bear Pictures, has earned Sweeney awards buzz since its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics’ “Nuremberg,” a post-World War II drama about the Nuremberg trials starring Rami Malek and Russell Crowe, managed to do a bit better. It opened with $4.1 million in 1,802 theaters. It was slightly edged by the best performer of the newcomers: “Sarah’s Oil.” The Amazon MGM release opened with $4.5 million from 2,410 locations. It stars Naya Desir-Johnson as a young Black girl in the early 1900s who learns that her Oklahoma land allotment is rich with oil. “Sarah’s Oil” scored a rare “A+” CinemaScore from ticket buyers. Arguably the most promising of the prospective awards movies to open in theaters over the weekend was Neon’s “Sentimental Value.” The film, a prize-winner at Cannes, directed by Norwegian-Danish filmmaker Joachim Trier, has been tabbed as a major Oscar contender this year. The family drama’s cast includes Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, and, in her second movie of the weekend, Elle Fanning. It opened in four theaters with $200,000, giving it a $50,000 per-screen average. That’s the third best of the year. The debut of “Predator: Badlands” sealed the Walt Disney Co.’s fourth straight year of $4 billion in worldwide ticket sales. It also broke a short streak of disappointments for the studio, including “Tron: Ares” and “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” With potentially two of the biggest box-office hits of the year still to come in “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Disney is poised to surpass $5 billion. Top 10 movies by domestic box office With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. “Predator: Badlands,” $40 million. 2. “Regretting You,” $7.1 million. 3. “Black Phone 2,” $5.3 million. 4. “Sarah’s Oil,” $4.5 million. 5. “Nuremberg,” $4.1 million. 6. “Chainsaw Man,” $3.6 million. 7. “Bugonia,” $3.5 million. 8. “Die My Love,” $2.8 million. 9. “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,” $2.2 million. 10. “Tron: Ares,” $1.8 million."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/rock-hall-fame-2025-outkast-white-stripes-16fde4991b33c8cab386d410da047264","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"05:00:33+00:00","title":"Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony Honors Women, Legends, and Legacy","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Los Angeles celebrated music legends and highlighted the enduring power of women and diverse voices in music.

Colors” into a defiant call for courage and the music of Outkast, Soundgarden and the White Stripes brought waves of emotion Saturday night at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Partway through the song, Lauper shouted the line “don’t be afraid!,” thrust her fist in the air and kept it there as the music stopped for a long and dramatic stretch. She was then joined by Raye to sing “Time After Time” and Avril Lavigne for “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” backed by an all-female band that included Gina Schock of the Go-Go’s. As Lauper called for the ladies to sing with her, Salt-N-Pepa — who earlier in the night donned their old tri-color jackets to rock the crowd with “Push It” for their induction — came dancing out and joined her. Chappell Roan, who inducted Lauper while wearing a huge, ornamented, showgirl-style headpiece, said Lauper redefined what a pop star could look like, sound like, sing like.” Lauper looked at Roan during her speech when she said, “I know that I stand on the shoulders of the women in the industry that came before me. And my shoulders are broad enough to have the women that came after me stand on mine.” Related Stories The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony is this weekend. Who’s getting in, and who’s honoring them? 4 MIN READ Lauper came back for an all-star jam and sang a verse of inductee Joe Cocker’s “With a Little Help From My Friends” along with Teddy Swims, Bryan Adams and Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes. Cocker’s was one of several posthumous inductions, including a moving tribute to late Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell. The power of women in music was called out loudly earlier in the evening at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles during the induction of Salt-N-Pepa. “This is for every woman who picked up a mic when they told her she couldn’t,” Cheryl “Salt” James said in a rousing speech accepting her, Sandra “Pepa” Denton and DJ Spinderella’s entrance into the hall. James brought up their fight to reclaim their master recordings from Universal Music Group. “The industry still doesn’t want to play fair, Salt-N-Pepa have never been afraid of a fight,” James said. They took the stage for a medley of their hits, opening with “Shoop” then sliding into “Let’s Talk About Sex” before En Vogue joined them for their joint hit “What a Man.” James apologized to the fans who “got in trouble for cutting their hair like us,” a line that reverberated later when Roan said that Lauper showed you could “have whatever hair color you want.” Outkast rocks the house, but not entirely together Outkast didn’t perform together for the first time since 2016 as some had hoped, but the duo stood together on stage, surrounded by a crew of friends and cohorts as they gave grateful speeches after doing rock-paper-scissors to decide who would go first. Andre 3000 gave a long, rambling funny speech — “I’m freestylin’ y’all!” — that ended in tears when he talked about their very beginnings in a basement “dungeon” in Atlanta in the early 1990s. He choked out the words, “Great things start in little rooms.” Andre sat out the performance but Big Boi, wearing shorts and a fur coat, started off an express tour through the Atlanta duo’s discography that included Tyler the Creator, JID and Killer Mike. Janelle Monáe joined them to shake her way through “Hey Ya” and Doja Cat delivered a sly and soulful take on “Ms. Jackson.” Emotional words and songs from Soundgarden Emotions ran deep during Soundgarden’s segment of the night, starting with the induction speech of Jim Carrey, the actor and Soundgarden superfan who seemed to be fighting off tears throughout as he talked about Cornell, who died from suicide in 2017. “When you looked into his eyes, it’s like eternity was staring back,” Carrey said. “For all time, his voice will continue to light up the ether like a Tesla coil.” Each of his band mates, all major godfathers of the Seattle grunge scene, paid their own tearful tributes. One of Cornell’s daughters, Lilian, spoke while another, Toni, sang a quiet rendition of his song “Fell on Black Days.” “I am just really, really happy that he got to make music with his friends,” Lilian Cornell said. Taylor Momsen, who co-starred as a child with Carrey in “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” and Brandi Carlile showed serious vocal power with their versions of Cornell’s mighty wail, backed by his band mates on “Rusty Cage” and “Black Hole Sun.” Bassist Hiro Yamamoto was among the few who brought up the politics from the stage. “Thanks to my parents, whose story is American citizens who are rounded up and placed into prison camps just for being Japanese during World War II,” Yamamoto said to some of the biggest cheers of the night. “Well that affected my life greatly, and it really echoes strongly today. Let’s not add another story like this to our history.” Twenty One Pilots and Olivia Rodrigo play for the White Stripes The White Stripes reunion that some fans had also hoped for didn’t happen. Their induction was among the highlights of the night anyway. Twenty One Pilots brought the house down with a version of the duo’s stadium-shaking anthem “Seven Nation Army” and Olivia Rodrigo and Feist delivered an acoustic version of “We’re Gonna Be Friends.” Their fellow Detroit rock legend Iggy Pop began his induction speech by leading the crowd in a chorus of “Seven Nation Army” then remembered his thoughts on meeting them. “Cute kids, they’re gonna go places,” Pop said. “And they did.” Drummer Meg White, who has led an almost entirely private life since the band broke up in 2011, did not show up for the ceremony, but Jack White said Meg, his ex-wife, helped him write the speech he delivered while wearing the band’s signature red and white. Jack White shouted out several great duos from across culture and said that kind of one-on-one collaboration is “the most beautiful thing you can have as an artist and musician.” He nearly cried several times as he told an Adam-and-Eve-like tale of “the boy and the girl” who made magic together. Bad Company induction is one of may rousing tributes for absent inductees Stevie Wonder led a funky and flashy tribute to the late Sly Stone to open the show that streamed live on Disney+. An edited version airs on ABC on Jan 1. Wonder was joined by Questlove, Leon Thomas, Maxwell, Beck, Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers for renditions of Sly and the Family Stone hits “Dance to the Music,” “Everyday People” and “Thank You.” Jennifer Hudson joined them to wail through “Higher.” Stone, who was inducted into the hall in 1993, died in June. Brian Wilson, who died two days later, got his own tribute from Elton John, who took the stage late in the show to sing the Beach Boys’ “God Only Knows.” Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac inducted Bad Company , calling the British group founded by Paul Rodgers and Mick Ralphs in 1973 “classic rock legends.” Rodgers had to skip the ceremony because of health issues and Ralphs died earlier this year, so drummer Simon Kirke was the only member on the stage. He was joined by an ad hoc super group that included Robinson and Heart guitarist Nancy Wilson, who blasted through “Feel Like Makin’ Love” and “Can’t Get Enough.” The late singer-songwriter Warren Zevon was inducted by David Letterman, a friend and superfan who made Zevon a regular on his NBC late-night show, including an appearance when Zevon was dying of cancer in 2002. “Warren Zevon is in my Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,” Letterman said. “Actually his own wing.” Other inductees who got video tributes in the theater were Chubby Checker, session bassist Carole Kaye, session piano man Nicky Hopkins and record producer and executive Lenny Waronker."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/flight-cancellations-government-shutdown-what-to-know-dea56ba97690b43397a96289f5f949e8","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"05:02:54+00:00","title":"U.S. Airlines Cancel Over 2,500 Weekend Flights Amid Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the U.S. federal government shutdown continues, the Federal Aviation Administration has mandated a significant reduction in air traffic, leading to over 2,500 weekend flight cancellations by Saturday evening.

to reduce air traffic because of the government shutdown showed no signs of easing. The slowdown at many of the nation’s busiest airports did not cause immediate widespread disruptions . But it deepened the impact felt by the nation’s longest federal shutdown . “We all travel. We all have somewhere to be,” said Emmy Holguin, 36, who was flying from Miami to see family in the Dominican Republic. “I’m hoping that the government can take care of this.” Analysts warn that the upheaval will intensify and spread far beyond air travel if cancellations keep growing and reach into Thanksgiving week. Already there are concerns about the squeeze on tourism destinations and holiday shipping. Here’s what to know about the flight reductions: Related Stories US airlines’ daily cancellations top 2,000 for first time since shutdown cuts began 3 MIN READ Senate nears potential shutdown deal but there’s no guarantee of success 5 MIN READ The Latest: Hundreds of flights canceled nationwide due to government shutdown 15 MIN READ How many flights have been canceled? Cancellations jumped Saturday — typically a slow travel day — to more than 1,500, following just over 1,000 the previous day, according to the tracking website FlightAware. By the evening U.S. airlines already had canceled another 1,000-plus for Sunday. Airports in Atlanta and Chicago, as well as Charlotte, North Carolina, and Newark, New Jersey, saw numerous disruptions throughout the day. Ongoing staffing shortages in radar centers and control towers added to the cancellations and delays at several East Coast airports, including those around New York City. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Not all the cancellations were due to the FAA order , and those numbers represented just a small portion of the overall flights nationwide. But they are certain to rise in the coming days if the slowdown continues. The FAA said the reductions impacting all commercial airlines started at 4% of flights at 40 targeted airports and will be bumped up again Tuesday before hitting 10% on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week that even more cuts might be needed if the shutdown continues and more air traffic controllers are off the job. Why are the flights being canceled? Controllers have gone without paychecks for nearly a month during the shutdown, leading many to call in sick and compound previously existing staffing shortages . Most are working mandatory overtime six days a week during without pay, and some are taking second jobs to pay their bills, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association has said. On Saturday the union said it had delivered 1,600 handwritten letters from members to Congress calling for the shutdown to end. How are passengers being affected? Most were relieved to find that airlines largely stayed on schedule Friday, and those whose flights were called off were able to quickly rebook. So far, longer international flights have not been interrupted. There is still a lot of uncertainty about which flights will be canceled next. And not everyone has the means to pay for a hotel or deal with a last-minute disruption, said Heather Xu, 46, who was in Miami on Saturday after a cruise and flying home to Puerto Rico. “Travel is stressful enough. Then you put these disruptions in place, and it really makes everything more challenging,” she said. Rental car companies reported a sharp increase in one-way reservations Friday, and some people simply canceled flights altogether. Diana Alvear of Bridgewater, New Jersey, scratched her family’s trip next weekend to see in-laws in California because of concerns about flying when controllers are working long hours and understaffed. She also was nervous about being stranded, which would be “a huge debacle” for work. United Airlines gave her credit for the airfare, but the family is still out nearly $700 for the deposit on an Airbnb. “This has been costly to us, and it’s a huge disappointment for us and our family,” Alvear said. “It’s really weighing on our hearts that we had to do this.” What could be the impacts beyond air travel? First there is the potential for higher prices in stores, as nearly half of U.S. air freight is shipped in the bellies of passenger aircraft. Major flight disruptions could bring higher shipping costs that get passed on to consumers, said Patrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University. Further losses will ripple through the economy if the slowdown continues, from tourism to manufacturing, said Greg Raiff, CEO of Elevate Aviation Group. “This shutdown is going to impact everything from cargo aircraft to people getting to business meetings to tourists being able to travel,” Raiff said. “It’s going to hit the hotel taxes and city taxes. There’s a cascading effect that results from this thing.” ___ Associated Press journalists Cody Jackson in Miami, Paul Wiseman in Washington, Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, and Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/messi-nashville-inter-miami-895eccf2617a9c49cf75f3a7f5cf6834","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"03:20:10+00:00","title":"Lionel Messi Leads Inter Miami to Playoff Victory, on Track for MLS Cup Title","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Lionel Messi led Inter Miami to a 4-0 victory over Nashville SC in the decisive Game 3 of their Eastern Conference playoff series, scoring two goals and providing two assists.

(AP) — Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are three wins away from an MLS Cup title. Messi scored a pair of first-half goals and added two assists, leading the way as third-seeded Inter Miami ousted sixth-seeded Nashville SC 4-0 on Saturday night in the decisive Game 3 of their first-round Eastern Conference playoff series. Tadeo Allende scored a pair of goals about three minutes apart — both set up by Messi — in the second half to blow the game open for Inter Miami, which outscored Nashville 8-3 in the series. Messi had a hand in all eight of those goals, scoring five and assisting on the other three. Inter Miami will go to FC Cincinnati for an East semifinal match — everything now is single-elimination, unlike Round 1’s best-of-three format — on Nov. 22 or Nov. 23. Cincinnati went 1-0-1 against Inter Miami this season, winning 3-0 at home on July 16 and playing to a scoreless draw at Fort Lauderdale on July 26. Messi was in the lineup for the first meeting, but not the second. “We know Cincinnati will be a tough test,” Inter Miami’s Jordi Alba — who is retiring when this playoff run ends — said after his 100th appearance with the club.

He also won the Golden Boot as MLS’ leading scorer this season, just finalized a new three-year deal to remain with the club through 2028 and seems to be playing his best soccer at the perfect time for Inter Miami. This is the first time Inter Miami has gotten this far in the MLS playoffs. South Florida’s MLS predecessor — the long-defunct Miami Fusion — got as far as the league’s semifinals in its final season in 2001, but this is new territory for Inter Miami. A year ago, in Messi’s first full season with the club, it lost a Game 3 of Round 1 at home as the Supporters Shield winners and were ousted by Atlanta. Not this time. Messi saw to that. With four Nashville defenders around him, Messi scored from the top of the 18-yard box in the 10th minute for a 1-0 lead. And the second goal was from nearly the same spot, albeit much easier. Mateo Silvetti controlled a long pass and got past a Nashville defender, attracting the attention of goalkeeper Joe Willis. Silvetti pushed the ball toward Messi, who had nothing but empty net to shoot at in the 39th minute for a 2-0 edge. “I would say the team played a near-perfect game, through the defense, midfield and attack,” Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano said. Inter Miami is 19-2-3 this season in MLS play when it scores at least two goals, but Nashville made the Herons earn this one. It appeared, briefly anyway, that Nashville cut the lead in half in the opening minute of the second half, but Sam Surridge’s would-have-been goal was whistled dead because one of his feet got tangled with Inter Miami’s Maxi Falcon on the play and a foul got called. The Inter Miami-Cincinnati winner will play either top-seeded Philadelphia Union or fifth-seeded NYCFC in the East final. The MLS Cup final is scheduled for Dec. 6, and Philadelphia, Cincinnati or Inter Miami would all play host that match if it got to the title game. ___ AP Sports Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this report. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/soccer"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-congress-trump-641e7e2324f261da72395b604d9540e8","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"05:01:34+00:00","title":"Moderate Democrats Propose Deal to End Government Shutdown in Exchange for Health Care Subsidy Vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of moderate Democrats, including Senators Jeanne Shaheen, Maggie Hassan, and Angus King, has proposed a tentative deal to end a 38-day government shutdown by passing three annual spending bills and extending funding until January 31.

2025-11-09T05:01:34+00:00\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A group of moderate Democrats has a tentative deal to reopen the government if Republicans promise to hold a vote on expiring health care subsidies by December, a potential breakthrough as lawmakers seek to end the shutdown . The group of three former governors — New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine — has a deal to pass three annual spending bills and extend the rest of government funding until late January, according to three people familiar with the agreement who requested anonymity until the deal is made public. The deal was far from final, and final passage of the legislation could take several days. Republicans had not yet said whether they support the deal, and it was unclear whether there would be enough Democrats to support it absent their central demand through the now 40-day shutdown — an extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire Jan. 1. After Democrats met for over two hours to discuss the proposal, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer emerged to say he would vote “no.” Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, said as he walked into the meeting that it would be a “horrific mistake to cave in to Trump right now.” Related Stories Weekend session gets off to slow start in Senate as lawmakers look for a way out of shutdown 4 MIN READ The Latest: Hundreds of flights canceled nationwide due to government shutdown 15 MIN READ Republicans swat down Democratic offer to end shutdown as impasse continues into 38th day 5 MIN READ Republicans have been working with the group of moderates as the shutdown continued to disrupt flights nationwide , threaten food assistance for millions of Americans and leave federal workers without pay. But many Democrats have warned their colleagues against giving in, arguing that they can’t end the fight without an agreement to extend the health subsidies. Government shutdown The AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them? Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said earlier in the day that a potential deal was “coming together.” But he has not yet publicly endorsed it. “We’ll see where the votes are,” Thune said. Returning to the White House on Sunday evening after attending a football game, Trump did not say whether he endorsed the deal. But he said, “It looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending.” Democrats have now voted 14 times not to reopen the government as they have demanded the extension of tax credits that make coverage more affordable for health plans offered under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have refused to negotiate on the health care subsidies while the government is closed, but they have so far been supportive of the proposal from moderate Democrats as it emerged over the last several days. The contours of a deal The agreement would fund parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things — and extend funding for everything else until the end of January. It would take up Republicans on their longstanding offer to hold a future vote on the health care subsidies, with that vote occurring by the middle of December, the people said. The deal would reinstate federal workers who had received reduction in force, or layoff, notices and reimburses states that spent their own funds to keep federal programs running during the shutdown. It would also protect against future reductions in force through January, the people said, and guarantee all federal workers would be paid once the shutdown is over. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, home to millions of federal workers, said he would support the deal. “I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans’ health care mess and to protect the federal workforce,” Kaine said. Alongside the funding fix, Republicans released final legislative text of three full-year spending bills Sunday. That legislation keeps a ban on pay raises for lawmakers but boosts their security by $203.5 million in response to increased threats. There’s also a provision championed by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to prevent the sale of some hemp-based products. Democratic pushback expected Republicans only need five votes from Democrats to reopen the government, so a handful of senators could end the shutdown with only the promise of a later vote on health care. Around 10 to 12 Democrats have been involved in the talks, and the three people familiar with the agreement said they had enough votes to join with Republicans and pass the deal. Many of their Democratic colleagues are saying the emerging deal is not enough. “I really wanted to get something on health care,” said Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin. “I’m going to hear about it right now, but it doesn’t look like it has something concrete.” House Democrats were also chiming in against it. Texas Rep. Greg Casar, the chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said a deal that doesn’t reduce health care costs is a “betrayal” of millions of Americans who are counting on Democrats to fight. “Accepting nothing but a pinky promise from Republicans isn’t a compromise — it’s capitulation,” Casar said in a post on X. “Millions of families would pay the price.” Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota posted that “if people believe this is a ‘deal,’ I have a bridge to sell you.” Even if the Senate were to move forward with funding legislation, getting to a final vote could take several days if Democrats who oppose the deal object and draw out the process. The first vote, which could come as soon as Sunday evening, would be to proceed to consideration of the legislation. Republicans preview health care debate There is no guarantee that the Affordable Care Act subsidies would be extended if Republicans agree to a future vote on health care. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he will not commit to a health vote. Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19-era tax credits as premiums could skyrocket for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies and argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals. Other Republicans, including Trump, have used the debate to renew their yearslong criticism of the law and called for it to be scrapped or overhauled. “THE WORST HEALTHCARE FOR THE HIGHEST PRICE,” Trump said of the Affordable Care Act in a post Sunday. Shutdown effects worsen Meanwhile, the consequences of the shutdown were compounding. U.S. airlines canceled more than 2,000 flights on Sunday for the first time since the shutdown began, and there were more than 7,000 flight delays, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks air travel disruptions. Treasury Secretary Sean Duffy said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that air travel ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday will be “reduced to a trickle” if the government doesn’t reopen. At the same time, food aid was delayed for tens of millions of people as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits were caught up in legal battles related to the shutdown. More than two dozen states warned of “catastrophic operational disruptions” as Trump’s administration is demanding states “undo” benefits paid out under judges’ orders last week, now that the U.S. Supreme Court has stayed those rulings. And in Washington, home to millions of federal workers who have gone unpaid, the Capital Area Food Bank said it is providing 8 million more meals than it had prepared to this budget year — a nearly 20% increase. ___ Associated Press writers Stephen Groves and Kevin Freking contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-netanyahu-ceasefire-hostage-d262329a0122ab65dc27787c4b43159c","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"07:39:33+00:00","title":"Over 69,000 Palestinians Killed in Israel-Hamas War; Settler Violence Rises in West Bank","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas enters its second phase, over 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since October 2023, with the Gaza Health Ministry reporting a surge in deaths and continued body recoveries.

so far, Gaza health officials said Saturday, as both sides completed the latest exchange of bodies under the terms of the tenuous ceasefire . The latest jump in deaths occurred as more bodies are recovered in the devastated Gaza Strip since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10, and as other bodies are identified. The toll also includes Palestinians killed by strikes that Israel says target remaining militants. Israel on Saturday returned the remains of another 15 Palestinians to Gaza, according to hospital officials there, a day after militants returned the remains of a hostage to Israel . He was identified as Lior Rudaeff, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said that Rudaeff was born in Argentina. The exchanges are the central part of the ceasefire’s initial phase, which requires that Hamas return all hostage remains as quickly as possible. Families and supporters rallied again Saturday night in Tel Aviv for the return of all. The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. It began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Also Saturday, Israeli settlers staged two attacks on Palestinian farmers and others in the occupied West Bank as settler violence reaches new highs during this year’s olive harvest. ‘I have not lost hope’ For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. Ahmed Dheir, director of forensic medicine at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, said that the remains of 300 have now been returned, with 89 identified. “We do not have sufficient resources or the DNA to match them with the martyrs’ families,” Dheir said. Unidentified ones will be buried in batches. Hopeful families looked into body bags of decomposed remains. “Close it, it’s not him,” one family said. “I always come here. I have not lost hope. I am still waiting for him,” said the mother of a missing boy, who did not give her name. Gaza’s Health Ministry said the number of people killed there since the war began has risen to 69,169. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts. The ministry said 284 people were added to the total after their identities were verified between Oct. 31 and Nov. 7. Over the past three days, 10 bodies were brought to Gaza hospitals — nine retrieved from the rubble and one newly killed, the ministry said. Since the ceasefire began, 241 people have been killed in Gaza, it said. It added that a large number of Palestinians remain missing. Israel’s military on Saturday said that soldiers killed two militants who had approached troops, one in northern Gaza and the other in the south. Israeli settler attack Palestinian health officials said 11 people were injured in an attack by Israeli settlers in the West Bank town of Beita, including journalists, medics, international activists and farmers. Activists and medics have flocked to this year’s olive harvest to help Palestinian farmers safely reach their fields. The U.N. humanitarian office reported more Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians and their property in the West Bank in October than in any other month since the office began keeping track in 2006. There were over 260 attacks, the office said. Jonathan Pollak, a longtime activist, told The Associated Press that he was picking olives when dozens of masked Israeli settlers, armed with clubs, descended, chasing people and throwing rocks. Pollak was hit in the head and taken to the hospital. Pollak said that he saw five settlers converge on a journalist and her security guard. He watched the settlers beat and bludgeon her, denting her helmet. A Reuters spokesperson said that two colleagues were “attacked by a group of men with sticks and rocks,” despite identifying themselves as journalists, and both were injured. The spokesperson called on Israeli authorities to investigate and hold those responsible accountable. Israel’s military said it dispersed a confrontation “between Israeli civilians and Palestinians during an uncoordinated olive harvest in an area that requires prior coordination” and that several Palestinians had been injured. Rights groups say that arrests for settler violence are rare, and prosecutions even rarer. Israel’s left-leaning Haaretz newspaper reported in 2022 that based on statistics from the Israeli police, charges were pressed in only 3.8% of cases of settler violence, with most cases closed without action taken. Also Saturday, Palestinian paramedics reported another settler attack in a nearby village, Burin. The Palestinian Red Crescent said settlers injured four international activists and one 57-year-old man. Israel’s military said soldiers responded to a report of rock-throwing at an Israeli vehicle and that Israeli civilians then hurled rocks at harvesters. It said Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured. ___ Julia Frankel reported from Jerusalem, and Sally Abou AlJoud from Beirut. ___ Find more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/snap-food-government-shutdown-trump-4a6edf5a6dbdf18049f1585bf7b61687","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"05:09:36+00:00","title":"SNAP Benefits Delayed Across U.S. Amid Legal Battle Over Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a federal government shutdown, the Trump administration initially withheld November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, causing a national crisis for nearly 42 million Americans who rely on food assistance.

groceries with federally funded SNAP benefits this weekend while those elsewhere are still waiting for November food benefits delayed by a protracted legal battle over the federal government shutdown. The Trump administration initially said last month that it would not fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for November because of the U.S. government shutdown . The twists and turns since have exacerbated uncertainty for the nearly 1 in 8 Americans who receive monthly SNAP benefits to spend at grocery stores and farmer’s markets. On Friday, some states began issuing full monthly SNAP benefits to people, a day after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to provide the funds. But Friday night, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused that judicial order to give an appeals court in Boston time to decide whether to issue a more lasting halt. Jackson acted because she handles emergency matters from Massachusetts. The high court’s order didn’t stop payment distribution in at least some states, but millions of other Americans who depend on SNAP remain in limbo. How are SNAP recipients faring? Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, for help buying groceries. Most have incomes below the poverty line, which is about $32,000 for a family of four. An individual can receive a monthly maximum food benefit of nearly $300 and a family of four up to nearly $1,000, although many receive less than that under a formula that takes into consideration their income. The delay in payments has led to a surge in demand at food banks and pantries across the country, as well as long lines for free meals or drive-thru giveaways. Some states have provided emergency funding to food banks to help them respond to the increased need. Some states also used their own dollars to fund direct payments to people while the federal benefits were in limbo. North Carolina’s Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai acknowledged that more than 190,000 households there received just $16 or less, after the state paused the full payment of benefits following the Supreme Court’s order. Where have people already received benefits? Whether SNAP beneficiaries are seeing money on their electronic benefits transfer cards depends on where they live. In Hawaii, Oregon and Wisconsin, officials worked quickly after a judge ordered full benefit payments Thursday to instruct their EBT providers to process the full payments. “We moved with haste once we verified everything,” Joseph Campos II, deputy director of Hawaii’s Department of Human Services, told The Associated Press. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said state employees “worked through the night” to issue full November benefits. Officials in California, Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington also confirmed that some SNAP recipients were issued their full November payments on Friday. Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said more than 250,000 households that missed their regular monthly SNAP payment during the first week of November received their full amount on Friday. The remaining beneficiaries would receive their November funds on their regularly scheduled dates later this month — if distribution does not remain blocked by legal challenges. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said that state’s SNAP recipients had received full November benefits as of Saturday afternoon, while Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, also a Democrat, said half a million recipients in her state got their benefits after a previously scheduled payment went out Saturday morning. A half a million more residents there are supposed to get their benefits next week. Officials in Colorado said Saturday that about 32,000 recipients had received their full monthly benefits before the Supreme Court’s order came down. More than 560,000 additional recipients were still waiting. In Rhode Island, about 79,000 households received their full benefits, Gov. Dan McKee, a Democrat said, adding that his team is “working through the weekend” to help address what he called “a crisis for families.” The Trump administration said in a legal filing with the Supreme Court that “there is no ready mechanism for the government to recover those funds” that already have been distributed. How long might residents elsewhere wait? Before Jackson ordered a pause, New York had said access to full SNAP benefits should begin by Sunday. New Hampshire had said full benefits should be available over the weekend. Arizona and Minnesota also said that full SNAP benefits would be accessible in the coming days. Whether all the people expecting to receive those benefits on their EBT cards will find them there remains unclear. For people in some other states, the wait appears likely to extend into next week. Numerous state officials said they had been waiting for further guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP. What has been holding up November benefits? Because of the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration originally had said SNAP benefits would not be available in November. After two judges ruled the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely, the administration said it would use an emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to provide partial benefits in November. A judge on Thursday said that wasn’t good enough, and ordered other funds to be used to make the full monthly payment. The Trump administration appealed, asking a higher court to suspend any orders that require it to spend more money than is available in the contingency fund. That is what led to Jackson’s temporary hold issued late Friday. ___ Associated Press reporters from across the U.S. contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1011-11-20","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00-11:00","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This news article covers a range of global events, including Egypt’s upcoming parliamentary elections, a worsening U.S. government shutdown surpassing a previous record, military actions in the West Bank that resulted in a civilian fatality, political controversy over a New York City mayor’s citizenship, severe weather in the Philippines following a devastating typhoon, and humanitarian rescue efforts for missing Rohingya people.

Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz have been indicted on charges they took bribes from sports bettors to throw certain types of pitches, including tossing balls in the dirt instead of strikes, to ensure successful bets. According to the indictment unsealed Sunday in federal court in Brooklyn, the highly-paid hurlers took several thousand dollars in payoffs to help two unnamed gamblers from their native Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 on in-game prop bets on the speed and outcome of certain pitches. Clase, the Guardians’ former closer, and Ortiz, a starter, have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July, when Major League Baseball started investigating what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when they pitched. Some of the games in question were in April, May and June. Ortiz, 26, was arrested Sunday by the FBI at Boston Logan International Airport. He is expected to appear in federal court in Boston on Monday. Clase, 27, was not in custody, officials said. Ortiz and Clase “betrayed America’s pastime,” U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. said. “Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.” Related Stories A closer look at the pitches by Clase, Ortiz cited in sporting gambling indictment 3 MIN READ Black Sox, Ohtani’s interpreter and more: A look at notable sports betting scandals 10 MIN READ Rob Manfred increasingly confident major leaguers will play in 2028 LA Olympics 4 MIN READ Ortiz’s lawyer, Chris Georgalis, said in a statement that his client was innocent and “has never, and would never, improperly influence a game — not for anyone and not for anything.” Georgalis said Ortiz’s defense team had previously documented for prosecutors that the payments and money transfers between him and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for lawful activities. “There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning. Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court,” Georgalis said. A lawyer for Clase did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Major League Baseball Players Association had no comment. Unusual betting activity prompted investigation Major League Baseball said it contacted federal law enforcement when it began investigating unusual betting activity and “has fully cooperated” with authorities. “We are aware of the indictment and today’s arrest, and our investigation is ongoing,” a league statement said. In a statement, the Guardians said: “We are aware of the recent law enforcement action. We will continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.” Clase and Ortiz are both charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery. The top charges carry a potential punishment of up to 20 years in prison. In one example cited in the indictment, Clase allegedly invited a bettor to a game against the Boston Red Sox in April and spoke with him by phone just before taking the mound. Four minutes later, the indictment said, the bettor and his associates won $11,000 on a wager that Clase would toss a certain pitch slower than 97.95 mph (157.63 kph). In May, the indictment said, Clase agreed to throw a ball at a certain point in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, but the batter swung, resulting in a strike, costing the bettors $4,000 in wagers. After the game, which the Guardians won, Clase sent text messages to one of the bettors with images of a man hanging himself with toilet paper and a sad puppy dog face, the indictment said. Clase, a three-time All-Star and two-time American League Reliever of the Year, had a $4.5 million salary in 2025, the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract . The three-time AL save leader began providing the bettors with information about his pitches in 2023 but didn’t ask for payoffs until this year, prosecutors said. The indictment cited specific pitches Clase allegedly rigged — all of them first pitches when he entered to start an inning: a 98.5 mph (158.5 kph) cutter low and inside to the New York Mets’ Starling Marte on May 19, 2023; an 89.4 mph (143.8 kph) slider to Minnesota’s Ryan Jeffers that bounced well short of home plate on June 3, 2023; an 89.4 mph (143.8 kph) slider to Kansas City’s Bobby Witt Jr. that bounced on April 12; a 99.1 mph (159.5 kph) cutter in the dirt to Philadelphia’s Max Kepler on May 11; a bounced 89.1 mph (143.4) slider to Milwaukee’s Jake Bauers on May 13; and a bounced 87.5 mph (140.8 kph) slider to Cincinnati’s Santiago Espinal on May 17. Prosecutors said Ortiz, who had a $782,600 salary this year, got in on the scheme in June and is accused of rigging pitches in games against the Seattle Mariners and the St. Louis Cardinals. Ortiz was cited for bouncing a first-pitch 86.7 mph (139.5 kph) slider to Seattle’s Randy Arozarena starting the second inning on June 15 and bouncing a first-pitch 86.7 mph (139.5 kph) slider to St. Louis’ Pedro Pagés that went to the backstop opening the third inning on June 27. Dozens of pro athletes have been charged in gambling sweeps The charges are the latest bombshell developments in a federal crackdown on betting in professional sports. Last month, more than 30 people, including prominent basketball figures such as Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier , were arrested in a gambling sweep that rocked the NBA. Sports betting scandals have long been a concern, but a May 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling led to a wave of gambling incidents involving athletes and officials. The ruling struck down a federal ban on sports betting in most states and opened the doors for online sportsbooks to take a prominent space in the sports ecosystem. Major League Baseball suspended five players in June 2024, including a lifetime ban for San Diego infielder Tucupita Marcano for allegedly placing 387 baseball bets with a legal sportsbook totaling more than $150,000. _____ Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker in Washington, D.C., and Ron Blum in New York contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09Z","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have recorded the most powerful flare ever observed from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

2025-11-04T15:09:09+00:00\n\nTitle: Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26+00:00","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, the co-discoverer of DNA’s double helix structure with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, has died at the age of 97.

double helix, dies at 97\n\nScientist James Watson, whose research on the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/6/seven-italian-climbers-missing-in-nepal-as-storms-avalanches-leave-9-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-06","timeOfPublication":"03:45:30+00:00","title":"Seven Italian climbers missing in Nepal as storms, avalanches leave 9 dead","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In recent days, severe weather linked to Cyclone Montha triggered avalanches in Nepal’s Himalayan mountains, killing at least nine people and leaving seven Italian climbers missing.

2025-10-23T08:09:33+00:00\n\nTitle: Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the controversy surrounding proposed U.S. nuclear testing, with President Donald Trump urging the Department of Defense to restart nuclear weapons testing in response to perceived threats from China and North Korea.

‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?\n\nUnited States Energy Secretary Chris Wright says planned nuclear tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/6/typhoon-kalmaegi-bears-down-on-vietnam-after-114-killed-in-the-philippines","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-06","timeOfPublication":"04:46:40+00:00","title":"Typhoon Kalmaegi makes landfall in Vietnam after 142 killed in Philippines","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi, known as Tino in the Philippines, made landfall in central Vietnam’s Gia Lai province after causing at least 142 deaths and widespread destruction in the Philippines.

has made landfall in central Vietnam with strong winds and heavy rain, after killing at least 142 people across the Philippines.\n\nKalmaegi — one of the world’s deadliest cyclones this year — crashed into Gia Lai province late on Thursday, packing sustained winds of up to 149km/h (92.5mph) with much faster gusts, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment said.\n\n“The wind is so so strong, nothing can resist,” Vu Van Hao, 48, told the news wire AFP as he surveyed the shards of windows shattered by the storm in the lobby of a hotel in Gia Lai.\n\nThe storm produced waves as high as 10

It’s a natural disaster, what can we do?” Vu Van Hao told AFP.\n\nBefore hitting Vietnam, the typhoon wreaked devastation across the  Philippines, killing at least 142 people, and leaving another 127 people missing, as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency and warned of another incoming super typhoon.\n\nThe national civil defence office on Thursday confirmed 114 deaths, though that tally did not include an additional 28 recorded by Cebu provincial authorities. More than 500,000 Filipinos remain displaced.\n\nThe typhoon is so far the globe’s deadliest of 2025, according to disaster database EM-DAT.\n\n“This is a huge typhoon with terrible devastating capacity,” Pham Anh Tuan, a senior official in Vietnam’s Gia Lai told AFP. More than 7,000 people had been evacuated in the area as of Wednesday night.\n\nAs Vietnam prepared for the storm, the government said it had placed more than 268,000 soldiers on standby for search and rescue operations. It warned of floods in low-lying areas and impacts on agriculture, including in the Central Highlands, the main coffee-growing region.\n\nSchools closed Thursday and Friday in Gia Lai and Quang Ngai provinces, and more than 260,000 people in Gia Lai province had been evacuated, the government said.\n\nThe country also closed six airports, forcing authorities to cancel hundreds of flights.\n\nVietnam is in one of the most active tropical cyclone regions on Earth and is typically affected by 10 typhoons or storms a year, but Kalmaegi is set to be the 13th of 2025.\n\nThe country is  still recovering  from severe flooding in late October that affected thousands of households. The Environment Ministry said October’s rain caused more than 150 landslides, inundated 2,200 hectares (5,400 acres) of crops and flooded 103,525 houses.\n\nThe typhoon, named Tino locally, devastated large areas of the Philippines as it made landfall in eight areas in the centre of the country on Tuesday, in what is officially the deadliest natural disaster to hit the Southeast Asian archipelago nation this year.\n\nScenes of widespread destruction have begun to emerge from the hardest-hit Philippine province of Cebu, from where the storm receded on Wednesday.\n\nMany of the more than 200,000 people who were evacuated have returned to find their homes destroyed, vehicles overturned, and streets blocked with piles of debris.\n\nThe arduous cleanup effort has begun, with communities scraping mud from their homes and removing large pieces of debris from the streets.\n\nOn Al Jazeera.\n\nTyphoon Kalmaegi  #TinoPH  has moved away from the Philippines but left a trail of death and destruction. At least 85 people are confirmed dead but that toll is likely to rise.

He said declaring a national emergency will give the government “quicker access to some of the emergency funds” and prevent food hoarding and overpricing.\n\nMarcos also warned of another storm approaching the northern Philippines – known internationally as Typhoon Fung-wong, and locally as Uwan – which he said “could be even stronger” than Kalmaegi.\n\nThe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said it expects Fung-wong to develop into a super typhoon by Saturday.\n\nPAGASA said it could enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility late on Friday or early Saturday, and has “an increasing chance of landfall” in northern or central Luzon, the island on which the country’s capital, Manila, is located."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/syrias-al-sharaa-pledges-commitment-to-climate-goals-at-cop30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:02:54+00:00","title":"Syria’s al-Sharaa pledges commitment to climate goals at COP30","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa made a significant diplomatic return by attending the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, where he pledged Syria’s full commitment to climate action and renewable energy investments.

the complex challenges faced by Syria after the 14-year civil war that finally toppled longtime president  Bashar al-Assad  last December, in a definitive lightning offensive led by al-Sharaa, while underlining the urgency of tackling climate change, which hit Syria hard this year with “a drought unlike any it has seen in over six decades”.\n\nHe called on nations to strengthen “bonds of cooperation from the Amazon to the Barada and Euphrates rivers, within a framework of strong inter-state collaboration and in support of the growing role of developing nations”.\n\nHis visit to the

hottest years on record\n\nThis year is set to be among the hottest on record, sinking the world even deeper into the climate crisis and threatening “irreversible damage,” the United Nations says in a new report.\n\nYears 2023, 2024 and 2025 are set to be the hottest years ever recorded, with this  year  on track to be the second or third hottest ever in 176 years of record keeping, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in the report released on Thursday in advance of next week’s COP30 UN climate summit in Brazil.\n\nThe UN report offered some stark observations, including warnings that concentrations of greenhouse gases have grown to new record highs, locking in more heat for the future, while the past 11 years, 2015 to 2025, will individually have been the 11 warmest years.\n\nTogether, these developments make “it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5C [2.7F] in the next few years,” WMO chief Celeste Saulo said in a statement, referring to the 2015 Paris climate accords.\n\nThe  legally binding pact  limiting greenhouse gas emissions aimed to provide the world a roadmap for breaking away from fossil fuels that have powered the global economy since the Industrial Revolution and looked to limit global warming to well below 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels, and to 1.5C if possible.\n\nBut the world has fallen short of its Paris obligations, with  the WMO now saying  limiting global heating to the goals of the 2015 agreement is virtually impossible.\n\n“This unprecedented streak of high temperatures, combined with last year’s record increase in greenhouse gas levels, makes it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting this target,” Saulo said. “But the science is equally clear that it’s still entirely possible and essential to bring temperatures back down to 1.5C by the end of the century.”\n\nIn the report, the WMO said the mean near-surface temperature — about 2 metres (6 feet) above the ground — during the first eight months of this year stood at 1.42C (2.5F) above the pre-industrial average.\n\nAt the same time, concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and ocean heat content continued to rise this year, up from 2024’s already record levels.\n\nIn its annual report on Tuesday, the UN Environment Programme also confirmed that emissions of greenhouse gases increased by a further 2.3 percent last year, an increase driven by India, followed by China, Russia and Indonesia.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres called the inability to limit the rise in global temperatures a “moral failure” on Thursday at the opening of a leaders’ summit in Brazil before COP30.\n\n“Each year above 1.5 degrees will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and inflict irreversible damage. We must act now, at great speed and scale, to make the overshoot as small, as short, and as safe as possible – and bring temperatures back below 1.5C before the end of the century,” Guterres said.\n\nThe WMO said the impact of temperature rises can be seen in the Arctic sea ice extent, which, after the winter freeze this year, was the lowest ever recorded.\n\nThe Antarctic sea ice extent, meanwhile, tracked well below average throughout the year, it said.\n\nThe UN agency also highlighted numerous weather and climate-related extreme events during the first eight months of 2025, from devastating flooding to brutal heat and wildfires, with “cascading impacts on lives, livelihoods and food systems”.\n\nIn this context, the WMO hailed “significant advances” in multi-hazard early warning systems, which it stressed were “more crucial than ever”.\n\nSince 2015, it said, the number of countries reporting such systems had more than doubled, from 56 to 119.\n\nIt hailed in particular progress among the world’s least developed countries and small island developing states, which showed a 5 percent rise in access in the past year alone.\n\nHowever, it lamented that 40 percent of the world’s countries still have no such early warning systems.\n\n“Urgent action is needed to close these remaining gaps,” it said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mosquitoes have been detected in Iceland for the first time, specifically the cold-adapted Culiseta annulata species, marking a significant ecological shift.

Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reveals that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may significantly improve survival in cancer patients, especially those with advanced or 'cold' tumors.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/philippines-begins-cleanup-as-typhoon-kalmaegi-death-toll-hits-85","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"17:31:43+00:00","title":"Philippines begins cleanup as Typhoon Kalmaegi death toll hits 85","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Kalmaegi struck the central Philippines, killing at least 85 people and leaving 75 missing, with six military personnel among the fatalities from a helicopter crash in Agusan del Sur.

Typhoon Fung-wong after earlier storm kills over 200\n\nTyphoon Kalmaegi has left a trail of devastation across Southeast Asia, killing hundreds in the Philippines and at least five in Vietnam, flattening homes, uprooting trees and knocking out power to millions, but there could be more suffering to come.\n\nRescue operations were suspended and mass evacuations began on Saturday as another storm, Typhoon Fung-wong, approached the Philippines, just days after  Kalmaegi  killed at least 204 people.\n\nAuthorities warned that Fung-wong, expected to strengthen into a super typhoon before landfall, could blanket nearly the entire country. “Its radius is so wide it could cover almost the whole Philippines,” a government meteorologist said.\n\nOfficials have urged residents in coastal and low-lying areas to seek safety, fearing more flooding and landslides after last week’s destruction.\n\nEmergency shelters were prepared nationwide as the country braces for what could be one of the season’s most powerful storms.\n\nIn the Philippines, grief and exhaustion swept through the province of Cebu in Kalmaegi’s destructive and deadly wake. Families gathered around rows of white coffins, mourning loved ones lost to floods and landslides.\n\nJimmy Abatayo, who lost his wife and nine relatives, was overcome with guilt as he touched his wife’s coffin. “I told my family to swim, be brave and keep swimming,” he said, breaking into tears. “They did not hear what I said because I would never see them again.”\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr has declared a state of national emergency as the country braces for Typhoon Fung-wong, which is expected to strike early next week. Marcos said the sheer volume of rainfall had overwhelmed flood defences, forcing residents to flee to rooftops for safety.\n\nAccording to the Office of Civil Defense, Kalmaegi  displaced  more than half a million people. Nearly 450,000 sought shelter in evacuation centres or with relatives, as rescue crews continued to search for more than 100 missing people.\n\nIn Vietnam, state media reported five deaths, three in Dak Lak province and two in Gia Lai, and three people missing in Quang Ngai city. The storm destroyed or damaged nearly 2,600 homes and cut power to more than 1.6 million households. In Quy Nhon, residents emerged to find metal roofs and furniture scattered across streets, while shopkeepers laid out soaked goods to dry.\n\nAuthorities said more than 537,000 Vietnamese had been evacuated before the storm hit, with Kalmaegi dumping up to 600mm (24in) of rain before weakening into a tropical storm and moving into Cambodia.\n\nThe Philippines and Vietnam, two of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, face typhoons almost yearly. But scientists warn that  climate change  is causing stronger and more frequent storms.\n\nKristen Corbosiero, an atmospheric sciences professor at the University at Albany, said Kalmaegi was already the fourth-strongest typhoon of the season. “The warm waters that fuel these storms are there almost year-round,” she said, warning that rising sea temperatures are intensifying their destructive power."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/8/cop30-climate-summit-hears-from-countries-suffering-global-warming-harms","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"09:15:56+00:00","title":"COP30 climate summit hears from countries suffering global warming harms","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, world leaders from nations experiencing severe climate impacts — including Haiti, Kenya, and Barbados — are urging urgent action to address climate change.

climate summit hears from countries suffering global warming harms\n\nLeaders from countries suffering some of the most catastrophic effects of the global climate crisis, from hurricanes, floods and more, have urged the United Nations climate conference in Brazil, COP30, to take action.\n\nWorld leaders are gathered on the edge of the fast-dwindling Amazon rainforest in advance of Monday’s official kickoff, with many focusing on  better balancing the gap  between developing nations and richer countries that produce most of the world’s harmful gas emissions.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has emphasised the need for a concrete roadmap to “undo deforestation, overcome fossil fuels and mobilise the resources needed”.\n\nAnother initiative aims to create a shared global carbon market, where those who produce less emissions than their required targets could potentially receive credit and sell it to those who overshoot commitments.\n\nRicher countries pledged $300bn to help poorer nations deal with the wide-ranging impacts of the warming climate at last year’s summit, but no money has been distributed.\n\nMoreover, developing countries and international advocacy groups maintain that the figure is  woefully insufficient to meet the needs , eyeing a goal of $1.3 trillion in various forms of government and private assistance.\n\nDuring the leaders’ meeting on Friday, Haitian diplomat Smith Augustin said  Hurricane Melissa  devastated his country, while small island states are the least responsible for climate change.\n\nKithure Kindiki, Kenya’s vice president, said “a previously once-in-a-century cycle of extreme droughts alternating with devastating floods continues to wipe out lives” in the East African country, which  experienced a deadly landslide last week .\n\nThe prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, said leaders at the summit must “hold our heads down in shame” as a loss and damage fund established in the 2022 conference in Egypt still has a capital base of less than $800m, “while Jamaica reels from damage in excess of $7 billion US, not to mention Cuba, Haiti or the Bahamas”.\n\nMahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chairman of the African Union Commission, said leaders from countries suffering the most harmful impacts of the climate crisis are not asking for charity, but for “climate justice”.\n\nSeveral leaders also criticised the United States, which under President Donald Trump has branded climate change a “hoax” and has refused to send an envoy to the talks while digging deeper into fossil fuels.\n\nThe UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said in its  latest report  earlier this week that it is “very likely” the world will exceed the 1.5C (2.7F) global warming mark – an internationally agreed-upon target set under the Paris Agreement – within the next decade.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the officials gathered in Brazil that they can choose to lead or be led to ruin.\n\n“Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation, with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress, and too many leaders remain captive to these entrenched interests,” he said.\n\nGuterres also said overshooting 1.5C is inevitable in the short term, “but what matters is how high and for how long”.\n\nThe UN says global emissions must nearly halve by 2030, reach net zero by 2050, and move to net negative thereafter."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia

to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/israel-forces-kill-palestinian-man-during-occupied-west-bank-raid","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"11:38:10+00:00","title":"Israeli forces kill Palestinian man during occupied West Bank raid","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Israeli forces killed 26-year-old Palestinian Abdel Rahman Darawsha during a raid on the Far’a refugee camp in southern Tubas.

displaced population have begun casting their ballots in the parliamentary elections – the sixth since a United States-led invasion toppled longtime ruler Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nPolls opened at 7am (04:00 GMT) on Sunday for 1.3 million members of the security forces at 809 polling centres and will close at 6pm (15:00 GMT) before they are deployed for security purposes on the election day on Tuesday.\n\nMore than 26,500 internally displaced people are also eligible for early voting on Sunday across 97 polling stations at 27 places in Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) said.\n\nInterior Minister Abdul Amir al-Shammari told INA that the special voting process is advancing “smoothly and in an organised manner”.\n\nNearly 21 million Iraqis are eligible to vote on Tuesday across 4,501 polling stations nationwide, the INA said.\n\nMore than 7,750 candidates, nearly a third of them women, are running for the 329-seat parliament. Under the law, 25 percent of the seats are reserved for women, while nine are allocated for religious minorities.\n\nThe current parliament began its term on January 9, 2022, and will last four years, ending on January 8, 2026.\n\nAn old electoral law, revived in 2023, will apply to the ongoing elections, with many seeing it as favouring larger parties. While about 70 independents won in the 2021 vote, only 75 independents are contesting this year.\n\nObservers also fear that turnout might dip below the record low of 41 percent in 2021, reflecting voters’ apathy and scepticism in a country marked by entrenched leadership and allegations of mismanagement and endemic corruption.\n\nThere were widespread accusations of corruption and vote-buying before the elections, and 848 candidates were disqualified by election officials, sometimes for obscure reasons, including insulting religious rituals or members of the armed forces.\n\nPast elections in Iraq have been marred by violence, including assassinations of candidates, attacks on polling stations, and clashes between the supporters of different blocs. While overall levels of violence have subsided, a candidate was assassinated in the run-up to this year’s election.\n\nInfluential Shia leader Moqtada Sadr urged his  followers to boycott  what he described as a “flawed election”.\n\nAl-Sadr’s bloc won the largest number of seats in 2021, but later withdrew after failed negotiations over forming the government amid a standoff with rival Shia parties. He has since boycotted the political system.\n\n“The fact that Iraq is having another election on time is a good sign that it is on track of democratisation,” Muhanad Seloom, assistant professor in Critical Security Studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHowever, “the road has not been easy for Iraq and I would say that the Iraqi government doesn’t have the luxury to be independent, either from Iran or the United States,” Seloom added.\n\nPrime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who was  elected in 2022  with the backing of pro-Iran parties, has sought to balance Iraq’s relations with Tehran and Washington. He is seeking a second term and is expected to secure a sizeable bloc.\n\n“Iran’s grip on Iraq is weakening, because the US is more assertive in its foreign policy towards Iraq,” said Seloom.\n\nAmong the other frontrunners are influential Shia figures, including former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Muslim scholar Ammar al-Hakim.\n\nBy convention in post-invasion Iraq, a Shia Muslim holds the powerful post of the prime minister and a Sunni of the parliament’s speaker, while the largely ceremonial presidency goes to a Kurd."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/republicans-push-to-strip-zohran-mamdani-of-us-citizenship-is-it-possible","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"10:59:08+00:00","title":"Republicans push to strip Zohran Mamdani of US citizenship.

US citizenship. Is it possible?\n\nAfter Zohran Mamdani handily  won  the New York City mayoral election, becoming the city’s first Muslim and first South Asian mayor-elect, Republican detractors in Washington, DC, said they would try to stop him from taking office.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who threatened to  withhold federal funds  to New York City if Mamdani won, lent credence to misleading questions about  Mamdani’s citizenship  and falsely accused the Ugandan-born 34-year-old of being a communist.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers requested investigations into Mamdani’s naturalisation process and have called for stripping him of his United States citizenship and deporting him, accusing him without evidence of embracing communist and “terrorist” activities.\n\n“If Mamdani lied on his naturalisation documents, he doesn’t get to be a citizen, and he certainly doesn’t get to run for mayor of New York City. A great American city is on the precipice of being run by a communist who has publicly embraced a terroristic ideology,” Representative Andy Ogles from the Republican party said in an October 29 news release, after asking US Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Mamdani.\n\n“The American naturalisation system REQUIRES any alignments with communism or terrorist activities to be disclosed. I’m doubtful he disclosed them. If this is confirmed, put him on the first flight back to Uganda.”\n\nRandy Fine, the Republican representative from Florida, misrepresented  Mamdani’s time in the US  when he said on October 27 on Newsmax, “The barbarians are no longer at the gate, they’re inside. … And Mamdani, having just moved here eight years ago, is a great example of that, becoming a citizen. Look, it is clear with much of what I have read that he did not meet the definition to gain citizenship.”\n\nPolitiFact found no credible evidence that Mamdani lied on his citizenship application.\n\nBorn in  Uganda , Mamdani moved to the US in 1998, when he was seven years old, and became a US citizen in 2018. For adults to become US citizens, they generally must have lived continuously in the country as a lawful permanent resident for five years, or three years if married to a US citizen.\n\nDenaturalisation, the process of revoking a person’s citizenship, can be done only by judicial order. It’s been used sparingly, such as for removing Nazis who fled to the US after World War II or people convicted of or associated with “terrorism”.\n\nImmigration law experts said they have seen no evidence to support Ogles and Fine’s assertions about Mamdani’s application.\n\n“Denaturalisation is an extreme, rare remedy that requires the government to prove either illegal procurement or a willful, material lie – at a minimum, clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence that the fact would have changed the outcome at the time of naturalisation,” said immigration lawyer Jeremy McKinney. “I’ve seen no credible proof he was ineligible when he took the oath or that any omission was material.”\n\nOgles and Fine did not respond to PolitiFact’s requests for comment by publication.\n\nThe push to question Mamdani’s citizenship started in the summer when he became the Democratic mayoral nominee.\n\nIn a June letter to Bondi, Ogles asked the Justice Department to pursue denaturalisation proceedings against Mamdani, “on the grounds that he may have procured US citizenship through willful misrepresentation or concealment of material support for terrorism”.\n\nOgles cited rap lyrics Mamdani wrote in 2017 supporting the “Holy Land Five”, a reference to five men in the Holy Land Foundation, a  Muslim  charity, convicted in 2008 of providing material support to the Palestinian group Hamas. Some lawyers have  criticised  the case’s evidence and use of hearsay.\n\nOgles and Fine said Mamdani did not disclose his Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) membership on his citizenship application form. The lawmakers say it is a  communist organisation , and Mamdani’s involvement could have disqualified him from citizenship.\n\nThe US naturalisation form asks whether applicants have been a member, involved in or associated with any communist or totalitarian party. But the  Democratic Socialists of America  is not a communist party.\n\nDemocratic socialism  emerged as an alternative to communism, Harvey Klehr, an Emory University expert on the history of American communism, previously told PolitiFact. Democratic socialists generally “reject the communist hostility to representative democracy, as well as the communist belief in state ownership of the means of production,” Klehr said.\n\nMcKinney, the immigration lawyer, said, “DSA membership isn’t a bar to citizenship; failing to list a lawful political group on the [naturalisation form] doesn’t become fraud unless disclosure would have led to a denial. A lyric referencing the Holy Land Five is protected speech absent actual material support to a designated foreign terrorist organisation.”\n\nPolitiFact reached out to Mamdani for comment but did not hear back.\n\nThe anti-Muslim rhetoric during the campaign drew criticism from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and even  members  of the Democratic Party. CAIR, the Muslim advocacy group,  called  the demand seeking denaturalisation proceedings against Mamdani racist and Islamophobic.\n\nMamdani, in an interview with MSNBC in October, also spoke about the anti-Muslim rhetoric during the campaign.\n\n“I think Islamophobia is something that is endemic to politics across this country,” Mamdani told MSNBC.\n\n“And we have seen it normalised. We have seen it accepted. And it has come to a point where to speak up about it is seen as if you are making it into an issue, whereas in fact you are naming that which already exists. And so much of this is driven from an unwillingness to recognise that Muslims belong here in the city.”\n\nThe New York Young Republican Club is taking a different tactic, citing the 14th Amendment, the New York Post reported.\n\nThe amendment bars from office anyone who “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” or who has “given aid or comfort to the enemies” of the country. The state GOP group said Mamdani provided “aid and comfort” to US enemies by supporting “pro-Hamas” groups and said he supports gangs through his calls to resist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\n\nThis would be a long-shot push for Congress to declare Mamdani ineligible for office, requiring a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and Senate. If passed, it still could be challenged up to the US Supreme Court.\n\nImmigration experts told PolitiFact that calls to resist ICE agents do not trigger the 14th Amendment, as the relevant clause targets insurrection and aid to wartime enemies, not domestic policy criticism.\n\nThe Justice Department can strip US citizenship by filing criminal charges for naturalisation fraud or a civil lawsuit.\n\nIn either case, the government would have to prove that an applicant made a false statement in a citizenship application, and show that the statement would have affected the application.\n\nThe government’s standard to clear in a criminal case – proving guilt “beyond a reasonable doubt” – is higher than a civil case standard of presenting “clear and convincing evidence”. The more common civil process lacks certain constitutional protections, such as the right to a court-appointed lawyer, Cassandra Burke Robertson, a Case Western Reserve University law professor who studies denaturalisation, said.\n\nRobertson said it is “extraordinarily unlikely that a proceeding against Mamdani would gain any traction”.\n\n“The bigger risk, in my mind, is the potential chilling effect on individuals with fewer resources who might be afraid to speak out against the government,” Robertson said.\n\nAlthough denaturalisations generally have been rare in the US, they have become more frequent under the Trump administration, Irina Manta, a Hofstra University law professor who studies denaturalisation, said.\n\nIn June, the Justice Department issued a memo directing lawyers to prioritise denaturalisation cases. The memo’s list of priority categories includes people whom the administration says pose national security concerns, gang members and a catchall category for “any other cases referred to the Civil Division that the Division determines to be sufficiently important to pursue”.\n\nIf Mamdani were to have his citizenship revoked, his immigration status would revert to his previous one – lawful permanent residence. That would disqualify him from serving as New York City mayor.\n\nPolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are rushing to study 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, discovered in 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/uk-military-to-help-belgium-after-drone-sightings-near-airports","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"13:48:54+00:00","title":"UK military to help Belgium after drone sightings near airports","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The UK military is deploying personnel and equipment to Belgium in response to a series of disruptive drone sightings near major airports, including Brussels and Liege, which led to temporary closures.

disruptive drone sightings forced the temporary closures of two major airports.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Richard Knighton told the BBC network on Sunday that the military had agreed to “deploy our people, our equipment to Belgium to help them” after a request from Belgian authorities.\n\n“We don’t know – and the Belgians don’t yet know – the source of those drones, but we will help them by providing our kit and capability, which has already started to deploy to help Belgium,” said Knighton, who did not give details about what sort of equipment would be sent or how many personnel.\n\nIn the past week, both Belgium’s main international airport at Brussels and one of Europe’s biggest cargo airports at Liege were  forced to close  temporarily because of drone incursions. That came after a series of unidentified drone flights near a United States military base in Belgium where nuclear weapons are stored.\n\nBelgium’s Liege airport resumed operations on Sunday evening after a 30-minute suspension due to a drone sighting, a spokesperson for the Skeyes air traffic control service said.\n\nDrone sightings also forced the temporary closures of airports in other countries, including Sweden, on Thursday. The Belgian government  held an emergency meeting  to address the drone sightings.\n\nKnighton said it was not known yet who was behind the drone sightings but noted Russia has been involved in a pattern of “hybrid warfare” in recent years.\n\nRussia has been blamed in some cases, but Belgium has not said who has been operating the drones. Russia has denied any connection with the incidents, and there has been no evidence to directly link the drones to Russia.\n\nBelgian Defence Minister Theo Francken said he believed some incidents were part of “a spying operation” that could not have been done by amateurs.\n\nDrone incidents have also caused major disruptions across Europe in recent months amid deepening concerns that Russia’s war in Ukraine might spill across Europe’s borders. Since September, drones have been spotted near civilian airports and military facilities in countries including  Denmark , Germany and Norway.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called the incursions “hybrid warfare”. While she did not hold Russia responsible for the incidents, she said it was clear Russia’s aim was to “sow division” in Europe.\n\nIn September,  Polish and NATO forces shot down drones  violating the country’s airspace during a Russian aerial attack on neighbouring Ukraine.\n\nBelgium is home to the headquarters of NATO and the European Union as well as Europe’s biggest financial clearinghouse, holding tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets.

accused the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of engaging in a “desperate attempt” to conceal evidence of mass killings in Darfur by burning bodies or burying them in mass graves.\n\nThe Sudan Doctors Network said on Sunday that paramilitaries are collecting “hundreds of bodies” from the streets of  el-Fasher , in Sudan’s western Darfur region, after their bloody takeover of the city on October 26, saying the group’s crimes could not be “erased through concealment or burning”.\n\n“What happened in el-Fasher is not an isolated incident but rather another chapter in a full-fledged genocide carried out by the RSF, blatantly violating all international and religious norms that prohibit the mutilation of corpses and guarantee the dead the right to a dignified burial,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that 82,000 of el-Fasher’s total population of 260,000 fled after the RSF seized the last Sudanese military stronghold in the region, amid reports of mass killings, rape, and torture. Many residents are believed to still be trapped.\n\nReporting from the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan said many people fleeing el-Fasher for Al Dabbah in the north died on the road, “because they had no food or water, or because they sustained injuries as a result of gunfire”.\n\nMorgan said that escapees told Al Jazeera they learned of the deaths of relatives from social media videos of their killings posted by RSF fighters. Several videos depicting extreme acts of violence have emerged in the public domain since the group overran the city.\n\nWith the “communications blackout” in the city, many did not know what happened to their family members.\n\n“They believe if their relatives are still alive inside el-Fasher, then they may not be so for long because of a lack of food and water… or because the RSF has been targeting people based on their ethnicities,” Morgan reported.\n\nThe RSF, which has been fighting the Sudanese army for control of Sudan since April 2023, traces its origins to the predominantly Arab, government-backed  militia known as the “Janjaweed” , which has been accused of genocide in Darfur two decades ago.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2008, an estimated 300,000 people were killed, and nearly 2.7 million were displaced in campaigns of ethnic violence.\n\nSylvain Penicaud of Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, who spoke to civilians who fled el-Fasher for the town of Tawila, said many of those fleeing said they were “targeted because of the colour of their skin”.\n\n“For me, the most terrifying part was [civilians] being hunted down while they were running for their lives; being attacked simply for being Black,” Penicaud said.\n\nThe Zaghawa, the dominant ethnic group in el-Fasher, has been fighting alongside the army since late 2023.\n\nThe group, which initially remained neutral when the war began, aligned with the military after the RSF carried out massacres against the Masalit tribe in West Darfur’s capital, el-Geneina, killing up to 15,000 people.\n\nHassan Osman, a university student from el-Fasher, said residents with darker skin, especially Zaghawa civilians, were subjected to “racial insults, humiliation, degradation and physical and psychological violence” as they fled.\n\n“If your skin is light, they might let you go,” he said. “It’s purely ethnic.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/us-highlights-gaza-aid-surge-palestinians-allege-engineered-starvation","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:56:06+00:00","title":"US highlights Gaza aid surge; Palestinians allege ‘engineered starvation’","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US government claims that nearly 15,000 aid trucks have entered Gaza since the October 10 ceasefire, delivering food, water, and medical supplies, with US officials highlighting improvements such as the return of eggs and increased meal production.

the required food aid is currently reaching Gaza, while a coalition of Palestinian relief agencies said total aid deliveries amounted to just one-quarter of what was agreed under the ceasefire

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/one-dead-dozens-missing-after-migrant-boat-sinks-off-malaysia-coast","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"07:58:39+00:00","title":"Seven dead, hundreds missing after migrant boat sinks off Malaysian coast","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A migrant boat carrying Rohingya refugees from Myanmar’s Rakhine state capsized near the Thai-Malaysian maritime border, killing at least seven people and leaving hundreds missing.

people fleeing Myanmar has capsized near the Thai-Malaysian maritime border, killing at least seven people and leaving hundreds missing.\n\nRescue teams recovered seven bodies on Sunday, including five women and a girl. Teams have rescued 13 survivors so far, according to Romli Mustafa, head of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) in the region.\n\nThe vessel went down off Thailand’s Tarutao Island, just north of Malaysia’s Langkawi Island.\n\nAuthorities said the boat was part of a larger group of about 300 Rohingya who departed Myanmar’s Rakhine state three days earlier aboard multiple vessels.\n\n“As they neared the border, they were instructed to transfer onto three smaller boats, each carrying around 100 people,” Kedah state police chief Adzli Abu Shah told local media.\n\nTwo of the boats remain missing, and rescue operations are continuing across an area near Langkawi that stretches for 583 square kilometres (170 square nautical miles).\n\n“We have requested the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency and the Marine Police to launch search-and-rescue operations and to look for the other missing boats,” Adzli said.\n\nImages released by MMEA showed one survivor covered by a sheet and another lying on a stretcher as rescue crews scoured the waters.\n\n“Cross-border syndicates are now increasingly active in exploiting migrants by making them victims of human trafficking using high-risk sea routes,” Romli said.\n\nReports suggest traffickers charge up to $3,500 per person for the perilous journey.\n\nReporting from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride said a major search-and-rescue operation is under way.\n\n“The authorities believe that the migrants set off around three days ago from a part of the coast in Myanmar – they are thought to be mainly from the Rohingya minority,” he said.\n\n“This is a well-used maritime route sailing down the coast of Thailand, heading towards Malaysia, where they will hope to start a new life, where often they will have relatives and acquaintances who are already here in Malaysia.”\n\nMalaysia is home to millions of migrants and refugees from other parts of Asia – many of them undocumented, working in industries including construction and agriculture.\n\nMembers of the mainly Muslim Rohingya minority periodically flee predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, where they are seen as foreign interlopers from South Asia, denied citizenship, and subjected to abuse. Nearly one million Rohingya refugees live in cramped camps across southern Bangladesh.\n\nMyanmar has also been mired in  civil war  fought between the military and multiple armed opposition groups since a 2021 coup, when the military seized power from the elected government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nMany of the refugees  attempt maritime crossings  to relatively affluent regional countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, facilitated by human trafficking syndicates. But the trips often turn  hazardous , leading to frequent capsizing.\n\nIn one of the worst incidents in December 2021, more than 20 people drowned in several capsizing incidents off the Malaysian coastline.\n\n“According to the authorities, the situation in Myanmar – with the increased instability and also the ongoing civil war – is forcing people to take ever more desperate maritime journeys to try and start a new life,” said McBride.\n\n“And as we’ve seen in this case, some of those journeys end with very tragic consequences.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/egyptians-set-to-head-to-the-polls-in-parliament-vote","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"15:56:34+00:00","title":"Egyptians set to head to the polls in Parliament vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Egyptians are set to vote in a two-phase parliamentary election to elect a new House of Representatives, with voting beginning on November 9.

Read on, and find out.\n\nMonday will see the start of voting for the 596-member House of Representatives.\n\nOf those seats, 284 are individual seats, while another 284 are filled via a closed party list system. Twenty-eight more members are appointed by presidential decree. A quarter of the seats must be held by women.\n\nThere are 70 counting committees, and voting will be conducted across 5,606 polling stations, according to Egyptian media. Fourteen governorates vote in the first phase and 13 vote in the second.\n\nResults for the voting may not be fully known before the end of December.\n\nPhase one includes the governorates of Alexandria, Assiut, Aswan, Beheira, Beni Suef, Fayoum, Giza, Luxor, Matrouh, Minya, New Valley, Qena, Red Sea, and Sohag.\n\nPhase two includes Cairo, Daqahlia, Damietta, Gharbia, Ismailia, Kafr El-Sheikh, Menoufia, North Sinai, Port Said, Qalyubia, Sharqia, South Sinai, and Suez.\n\nPhase one results will be announced on November 18.\n\nIf phase one requires run-offs, voting will be held internationally over the first two days of December and then in Egypt on December 3 and 4, with results announced on December 11.\n\nPhase-two voting for Egyptians abroad will take place on November 21 and 22. Voting inside Egypt will take place on November 24 and 25, with results announced on December 2.\n\nIn case of phase-two run-offs, voting will take place on December 15 and 16 abroad and 17 and 18 inside Egypt, with the final results announced on December 25.\n\nFirst, voting has to be broken down by “party-list constituencies” and individual candidates. Each group is competing for 284 seats.\n\nThe party-list constituencies in Egypt divide the country into four areas. Cairo and the Central and Southern Delta has 102 seats. North, Central, and South Upper Egypt has 102 seats. The Eastern Delta and Western Delta have 40 seats apiece.\n\nThen, individual candidates are running for another 284 across 143 constituencies.\n\nThe electoral lists are closed, meaning that parties must be approved to run.\n\nThe current lists include 12 political parties plus the Coordination Committee of Parties’ Youth Leaders and Politicians, who will compete for the 284 party-list seats. The National List for Egypt, the Generation List, the Popular List, Your Voice for Egypt List, and the Egypt Call List are seen as some of the bigger parties running.\n\nAhram Online reported that it went smoothly.\n\nA total 139 electoral committees were set up in 117 countries. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also set up 24-hour operation rooms in every mission to coordinate with the National Elections Authority in Cairo.\n\nThe round two vote is still set to take place in late November.\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives serve five-year terms.\n\nThe current House was elected in late 2020 for a five-year term that expires in January 2026.\n\nPresident el-Sisi is in his third and, constitutionally, final term. In 2019, the Parliament of Egypt changed the constitution to allow him to serve until 2030, and there’s a widely held belief that Parliament could once again amend the constitution, allowing el-Sisi to extend his mandate.\n\nIn recent years, el-Sisi has worked to reshape Egypt by liberalising the economy, but many Egyptians are struggling with a rising cost of living and will likely be heading to the polls with the economy in mind.\n\nOther important issues expressed by Egyptians include health and medical care, and a new rental law that threatens to evict millions living in rent-controlled properties.\n\nAnalysts say these elections could play a significant role in the country’s future, especially after the end of el-Sisi’s term.\n\n“[T]he 2025 parliament will serve as both a legal and political instrument through which the Egyptian authorities channel key post-2030 decisions,” Halem Henish, a legal associate at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, wrote in October. “The composition of that parliament will directly reflect the Egyptian authorities’ intentions for the future.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/powerful-tornado-wrecks-brazil-town-killing-six-and-injuring-hundreds","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"04:22:10+00:00","title":"Powerful tornado wrecks Brazil town, killing six and injuring hundreds","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful tornado with winds up to 250 km/h (155 mph) struck the town of Rio Bonito do Iguacu in southern Brazil’s Paraná state on Friday, November 7, 2025, killing at least six people and injuring 750.

President Donald Trump on the day of the 2021 attack on the United States Capitol.\n\nSunday’s joint resignations of Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness capped a turbulent week of accusations that the broadcaster edited a speech Trump made on January 6, 2021, to make it appear as if he encouraged the riots that followed his defeat in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDavie said he took “ultimate responsibility” for mistakes made, saying that quitting his role at the helm of the public broadcaster after five years was “entirely my decision”.\n\n“I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the charter plans they will be delivering,” he said.\n\nA documentary by flagship programme Panorama aired a week before last year’s US election, splicing together clips of Trump’s speech uttered at different points.\n\nThe edit made it seem as if Trump said: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nCritics said it was misleading as it cut out a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nTurness said the controversy about the Trump documentary “has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love”.\n\n“As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me,” she added.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, UK Culture, Media and Sport Minister Lisa Nandy called the allegations “incredibly serious”, saying there is a “systemic bias in the way that difficult issues are reported at the BBC”.\n\nReporting from London, Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands noted that the BBC has always been in a difficult position.\n\n“It is pilloried by the right, who perceive it to be a hotbed of liberal bias. It’s pilloried by the left, who think that it kowtows to the establishment and pumps out government lines when it comes to things like Gaza, particularly, not holding the powerful to account as it should do as a broadcaster.”\n\nThe controversy, whipped up by UK right-wing media, reached the other side of the Atlantic with Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing the BBC as “100 percent fake news” and a “propaganda machine” on Friday.\n\nThe story broke on Tuesday when The Daily Telegraph cited a memo complied by Michael Prescott, a former member of the BBC’s editorial standards committee, which raised concerns over the Trump edit, as well as criticising perceived anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service.\n\nOn Saturday, the newspaper reported right-wing lawmaker Priti Patel, of the Conservative Party, demanded the UK Foreign Office review its funding of BBC Arabic through its grant for the BBC World Service, alleging “pro-Hamas and anti-Israel bias”.\n\nThe broadcaster has also been accused of giving Israel favourable coverage in its reporting of the war on Gaza, coming under criticism from  its own staff .\n\nDavie’s resignation was celebrated by Nigel Farage, leader of the populist hard-right Reform UK party, which is soaring in opinion polls.\n\n“This is the BBC’s last chance. If they don’t get this right there will be vast numbers of people refusing to pay the licence fee,” Farage said on X."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/why-does-the-uk-want-to-copy-denmarks-stringent-immigration-policies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"16:50:32+00:00","title":"Why does the UK want to copy Denmark’s stringent immigration policies?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Kingdom is considering adopting Denmark’s stringent immigration policies, including stricter family reunification rules and longer waiting periods for permanent residency, amid rising public concern and pressure from far-right parties like Reform UK.

The UK Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, is under intense scrutiny due to record net migration and public opposition, prompting a proposal to double the permanent settlement waiting period to 10 years and raise English language requirements. While Labour leaders argue such policies align with a 'controlled, fair' migration system, critics—including MPs Nadia Whittome and Clive Lewis—label them as morally and politically dangerous, citing links to far-right ideologies. The debate reflects broader European trends where nations like Austria, Germany, and Hungary have drawn inspiration from Denmark’s model, while human rights groups condemn the externalization of asylum and ethnic profiling.

is considering an amendment to immigration rules modelled on Denmark’s controversial policy amid pressure from the far-right groups, who have attacked the Labour government over the  rising number  of refugees and migrants crossing into the country.\n\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood last month dispatched officials to study the workings of the Danish immigration and asylum system, widely considered the toughest in Europe. The officials are reportedly looking to review the British immigration rules on family reunion and limit refugees to a temporary stay.\n\nThe Labour government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been under immense pressure amid growing public opposition to immigration and the surge in the popularity of the far-right Reform UK, which has centred its campaign around the issue of immigration.\n\nSo, what’s in Denmark’s immigration laws, and why is the centre-left Labour government adopting laws on asylum and border controls championed by the right wing?\n\nOver the last two decades in Europe, Denmark has led the way in implementing increasingly restrictive policies in its immigration and asylum system, with top leaders  aiming  for “zero asylum seekers” arriving in the country.\n\nFirst, Denmark has made family reunions tougher, keeping the bar of conditions comparatively higher than it is in allied countries. Those who live in estates designated as “parallel societies”, where more than 50 percent of residents are from so-called “non-Western” backgrounds, are barred from being granted family reunion. This has been decried by rights groups as racist for refugees’ ethnic profiling.\n\nIn Denmark, a refugee with residency rights must meet several criteria for their partner to join them in the country. Both must be age 24 or older, the partner in Denmark must not have claimed benefits for three years, and both partners need to pass a Danish language test.\n\nPermanent residency is possible only after eight years under very strict criteria, including full-time employment.\n\nChristian Albrekt Larsen, a professor in the Political Science department of Aalborg University in Denmark, told Al Jazeera that successive Danish governments’ restrictive policies on “immigration and integration have turned [it] into a consensus position – meaning the ‘need’ for radical anti-immigration parties has been reduced”.\n\nNoting that “there is not one single Danish ‘model’”, but that the evolution has been a process of adjustments since 1998, Larsen said, “In general, Denmark’s ‘effectiveness’ lies in being seen as less attractive than its close neighbours, [including] Germany, Sweden, and Norway.”\n\nCopenhagen is more likely to give asylum to those who have been targeted by a foreign regime, while those fleeing conflicts are increasingly limited in remaining in the country temporarily.\n\nHowever, Denmark decides which country is safe on its own. For example, in 2022, the Danish government did not renew permits for more than 1,200 refugees from Syria because it judged Damascus to be safe for refugees to return to.\n\nIn 2021, Denmark also passed laws allowing it to process asylum seekers outside of Europe, like negotiating with Rwanda, though putting this into practice has been controversial and challenging.\n\nDenmark has reduced the number of successful asylum claims to a 40-year low, except in 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic’s travel restrictions.\n\nThe UK allows individuals to claim asylum if they prove they are unsafe in their home countries. Refugee status is granted if an individual is at risk of persecution under the United Nations’ 1951 Refugee Convention. Refugees are usually granted five years of leave to remain, with the option to apply for permanent settlement afterward.\n\nMost migrants and refugees can apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after five years, followed by eligibility for citizenship one year later. Requirements include English proficiency and passing the “Life in the UK” test.\n\nThe UK system currently does not impose an age limit beyond 18, but requires a minimum annual income of 29,000 British pounds ($38,161), and is subject to a rise pending a review, for sponsoring partners.\n\nAsylum seekers are excluded from mainstream welfare and receive a meagre weekly allowance. However, once granted protection, they access the same benefits as British nationals.\n\nThe UK under the previous Conservative government passed controversial legislation to enable deportation to Rwanda, but the policy has not yet been implemented due to ongoing legal challenges.\n\nBefore September this year, the UK Home Office allowed spouses, partners, and dependents under 18 to come to the UK without fulfilling the income and English-language tests that apply to other migrants. That is currently  suspended , pending the drafting of new rules.\n\nFacing heat from the opposition over the rising arrivals of migrants and refugees by boats, Prime Minister Starmer in May proposed a draft paper on immigration, calling it a move towards a “controlled, selective and fair” system.\n\nAs part of the proposal, the standard waiting time for migrants and refugees for permanent settlement would be doubled to 10 years, and English language requirements would be tightened.\n\nThe Labour Party, which advocated for a more open migration model, has been on the back foot over the issue of immigration.\n\nFrom January through July of this year, more than 25,000 people crossed the English Channel into the UK.\n\nThe opposition has seized on this issue.\n\nNigel Farage, the leader of the Reform UK party, has accused Labour of being soft on immigration. Farage has pledged to scrap indefinite leave to remain – a proposal Starmer has dubbed as “racist” and “immoral”.\n\nSuccessive British governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number leaving. Net migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023. It stood at 728,000 last year.\n\nStarmer’s administration has framed the new immigration rules as a “clean break” from a system they see as overreliant on low-paid overseas labour.\n\nA survey  released  by Ipsos last month revealed that immigration continues to be seen as the biggest issue facing the country, with 51 percent of Britons mentioning it as a concern. That is more than the economy (35 percent) or healthcare (26 percent).\n\nHowever, at the same time, a YouGov poll found only 26 percent of people said immigration and asylum was one of the three most important issues facing their community.\n\nConcern about immigration is a “manufactured panic”, a report published by the Best for Britain campaign group noted.\n\nThe group’s director of policy and research, Tom Brufatto, said that “the data clearly demonstrates that media exposure and political discourse are fanning the flames of anti-immigration sentiment in the UK, causing the government to lose support both to its right and left flank simultaneously.”\n\nThe left-leaning leaders of the Labour Party have condemned the “far-right”, “racist” approach of the British government’s moves to adapt the Danish model.\n\nLabour MPs urged Home Secretary Mahmood to dial down her plans for a Danish-style overhaul of the immigration and asylum system.\n\nNadia Whittome, Labour MP for Nottingham East, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that she thinks that “this is a dead end – morally, politically and electorally”.\n\n“I think these are policies of the far right,” she said. “I don’t think anyone wants to see a Labour government flirting with them.”\n\nWhittome argued that it would be a “dangerous path” to take and that some of the Danish policies, especially those around “parallel societies”, were “undeniably racist”.\n\nClive Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, said: “Denmark’s Social Democrats have gone down what I would call a hardcore approach to immigration.\n\n“They’ve adopted many of the talking points of what we would call the far right,” Lewis said. “Labour does need to win back some Reform-leaning voters, but you can’t do that at the cost of losing progressive votes.”\n\nMeanwhile, members of Parliament from the traditional “Red Wall” constituencies, where the Reform UK party has a support base, are receptive to Mahmood’s plans.\n\nThe fissures grew more apparent after Lucy Powell, who won the Labour deputy leadership contest last month, challenged Starmer to soften his stance on immigration.\n\n“Division and hate are on the rise,” Powell said last month. “Discontent and disillusionment are widespread. We have this one big chance to show that progressive mainstream politics really can change people’s lives for the better.”\n\nEuropean countries differ widely in how they manage immigration. Some are major destinations for large absolute numbers of migrants and refugees, while others have adopted restrictive legal measures or strong integration policies.\n\nIn 2023, the largest absolute numbers of immigrants entering European Union countries were recorded in Germany and Spain, over 1.2 million each, followed by Italy and France, according to the EU’s latest Migration and Asylum report.\n\nThese four countries together accounted for more than half of all non-EU immigration to the EU.\n\nEU member states operate within EU migration and asylum rules, and Schengen zone rules where applicable, and are bound by international obligations such as the UN Refugee Convention. But individual states apply national legislation that interprets those obligations, and i n recent years, public sentiment has turned against immigration amid a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nYouGov polling conducted in Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden found that respondents believe immigration over the past decade has been too high. In Britain, 70 percent of those surveyed said that immigration rates have been too high, according to the survey released in February.\n\nOn the other hand, countries like Hungary, Poland, and Austria, in addition to Denmark, have formed immigration policies focused on building border fences and restrictive family reunification rules, alongside expedited deportations and limits on access to social benefits.\n\nAustrian and German ministers have referenced the Danish model as a source of inspiration for their own domestic policies.\n\nSeveral EU states have also tried a version of externalising asylum processes, including Italy with Albania, Denmark with Rwanda, Greece with Turkiye, Spain with Morocco, and Malta with Libya and Tunisia.\n\nRights groups have criticised the EU for immigration policies that focus on border control and for policies to transfer refugees to third countries."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vn25d5dq7o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"22:28:33.556+00:00","title":"BBC director general Tim Davie and News CEO Deborah Turness resign over Trump documentary edit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, the BBC's director general and head of news, have resigned following intense public and political backlash over a Panorama documentary that was accused of editing a segment of Donald Trump’s January 6, 2021 speech to falsely imply he encouraged the Capitol riot.

edit\n\nThe BBC's director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness have resigned after criticism that a Panorama documentary misled viewers by editing a speech by Donald Trump.\n\nDavie, in the job for five years, had faced increasing pressure over a series of controversies and accusations of bias that have dogged the public broadcaster.\n\nThe Telegraph published details  of a leaked internal BBC memo on Monday that suggested the Panorama programme edited two parts of the US president's speech together so he appeared to explicitly encourage the Capitol Hill riot of January 2021.\n\nUK political leaders expressed hope the resignations would lead to change, while Trump welcomed the decision.\n\nIt is unprecedented for both the director general and the head of BBC News to resign on the same day.\n\nAnnouncing the move on Sunday evening, Davie said: \"Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable.\n\n\"While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision.\n\n\"Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.\"\n\nTurness said in a statement on Sunday night that the Panorama controversy had \"reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC\", adding: \"The buck stops with me.\"\n\nShe said: \"In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down. While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.\"\n\nTurness has been CEO of News and Current Affairs for the past three years.\n\nThe internal memo published by the Telegraph also raised concerns about a lack of action to address what it described as \"systemic problems\" of bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIn Trump's speech in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, he said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nHowever, in the Panorama edit he was shown saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"\n\nThe two sections that were stitched together were originally more than 50 minutes apart.\n\nThe publication of the internal memo sparked criticism of the BBC, including from the White House, which described the corporation as \"100% fake news\".\n\nTrump responded to the resignations on Sunday, saying top people in the BBC were quitting or being fired \"because they were caught 'doctoring' my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th\".\n\n\"These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election,\" he wrote. \"What a terrible thing for Democracy!\"\n\nThe pair's resignations come ahead of a statement expected on Monday by BBC chairman Samir Shah to a parliamentary committee in which he was anticipated to apologise for the way the speech was edited.\n\nCommenting on the resignations on Sunday, Shah said it was a \"sad day for the BBC\" and that Davie \"had the full support of me and the [BBC] board throughout\" his tenure.\n\nHe continued: \"However, I understand the continued pressure on him, personally and professionally, which has led him to take this decision today. The whole board respects the decision and the reasons for it.\"\n\nThe leaked memo was written by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the broadcaster's editorial standards committee, who left the role in June.\n\nIn the memo, he also expressed concerns about the BBC's coverage of trans issues, suggesting its coverage was effectively \"censored\" by its specialist LGBT reporters who promoted a pro-trans agenda.\n\nHis leaked memo said he had felt \"despair\" at the lack of action by BBC management \"when issues come to light\".\n\nSeparately on Thursday, the BBC  upheld 20 impartiality complaints  over the way presenter Martine Croxall altered a script she was reading live earlier this year on the BBC News Channel, which referred to \"pregnant people\".\n\nThe corporation has also faced criticism in recent months over failing to disclose that the narrator of  a documentary about Gaza  was the son of a Hamas official.\n\nThe BBC's  broadcast of a Glastonbury set  in which punk duo Bob Vylan led a chant of \"death, death to the IDF [Israel Defence Forces]\" also broke editorial guidelines in relation to harm and offence.\n\nDame Caroline Dineage, who chairs the culture, media and sport committee of MPs, said the broadcaster had been damaged by \"what has become a seemingly constant stream of crises and missteps\".\n\nSome media commentators were critical of the way the BBC had handled the latest controversy.\n\nRoger Mosey, the former head of BBC TV News, said the broadcaster had been \"slow to respond to the latest allegations\".\n\nHe told BBC News the Trump speech edit \"doesn't seem to be defensible\", while other concerns raised in the memo, such as language around trans issues, were part of how the BBC \"has to reshape and reform its editorial from time to time\".\n\nDorothy Byrne, Channel 4's former head of news, criticised the BBC for not only making a \"basic error\" in editing the speech but in taking \"an inordinate length of time to apologise\".\n\nDavie, who has worked for the corporation for 20 years, stressed that \"our journalism and quality content continues to be admired as a gold standard\" and that the organisation was \"overwhelmingly kind, tolerant and curious\".\n\nHe said the timing of his departure - which will involve an \"orderly transition\" to a successor in the coming months - would allow the next director general to \"positively shape\" the next Royal Charter.\n\nThe Charter sets the funding and regulatory duties of the BBC and is negotiated with the government. A new one must be reached before the current one expires at the end of 2027.\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy thanked Davie, saying he had \"led the BBC through a period of significant change\".\n\nShe went on: \"The BBC is one of our most important national institutions... Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world.\"\n\nNandy added that the government would ensure the Charter review \"is the catalyst that helps the BBC to adapt to this new era\".\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said it was \"right\" that Davie and Turness had stood down, but said there was \"a catalogue of serious failures that runs far deeper\" that \"cannot be swept away with two resignations\".\n\nBadenoch said the BBC \"should not expect the public to keep funding it through a compulsory licence fee unless it can finally demonstrate true impartiality\".\n\nSir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the resignations \"must be an opportunity for the BBC to turn a new leaf\", adding: \"The BBC isn't perfect, but it remains one of the few institutions standing between our British values and a populist, Trump-style takeover of our politics.\"\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said the departures must mark \"the start of wholesale change\", calling on the government to appoint a leader who had \"a record of coming in and turning companies and their cultures around\".\n\nThe BBC board is responsible for appointing a director general under the terms of its Charter.\n\nPrior to being made the BBC's 17th director general, replacing Lord Hall in 2020, Davie was the chief of BBC Studios, and before that was a marketing executive at Pepsi and Proctor & Gamble.\n\nTurness previously headed news organisations ITN and NBC News International.\n\nThe corporation has seen the resignation of previous directors general including George Entwistle, who resigned in 2012.\n\nBut whoever replaces Davie and Turness will have to step straight into dealing with a series of critical news reports.\n\nMosey said the BBC's director general had to be \"superhuman\" and questioned whether the corporation needed to consider splitting the role into separate corporate and editorial jobs."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/us-government-shutdown-enters-40th-day-how-is-it-affecting-americans","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"14:05:59Z","title":"US government shutdown enters 40th day: How is it affecting Americans?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is experiencing its longest government shutdown in history, lasting 40 days since October 1, 2025, due to a deadlock between Democrats and Republicans over the renewal of Affordable Care Act healthcare subsidies.

2025-11-09T14:05:59+00:00\n\nTitle: US government shutdown enters 40th day: How is it affecting Americans?\n\nAs United States lawmakers fail to agree on a deal to end the government shutdown, around 750,000 federal employees have been furloughed, millions of Americans go without food assistance, and air travel is disrupted across the country.\n\nThe shutdown began on October 1, after opposing sides in the US Senate failed to agree on spending priorities, with Republicans rejecting a push by Democrats to protect healthcare and other social programmes.\n\nSince then, both sides have failed to agree on 14 separate funding measures, delaying payment to hundreds of thousands of federal staff.\n\nAfter 40 days, senators from both parties are working this weekend to try to end what has become the longest government shutdown in US history. But talks on Saturday showed little sign of breaking the impasse and securing long-term funding for key programmes.\n\nOn Friday, Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer offered Republicans a narrower version of an earlier Democratic proposal – a temporary extension of healthcare subsidies. Republicans rejected the offer, prolonging the record-breaking shutdown.\n\nSo what do we know about the shutdown, and how it has impacted Americans?\n\nThe shutdown has created major  disruptions for the aviation industry , with staffing shortages among unpaid air traffic controllers.\n\nMore than 1,530 flights were cancelled across the US on Saturday, while thousands more were delayed as authorities ordered airports to reduce air traffic.\n\nAccording to the flight tracking website FlightAware, Saturday’s cancellations marked an increase from 1,025 the previous day. The trend looks set to continue, with at least 1,000 cancellations logged for Sunday.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said staffing shortages were affecting 42 control towers and other facilities, leading to delays in at least a dozen major cities – including Atlanta, Newark, San Francisco, New York and Chicago.\n\nThe travel chaos could prove politically costly for lawmakers if disruptions persist, especially ahead of the holiday season. Reduced air traffic will also hit deliveries and shipping, since many commercial flights carry cargo alongside passengers.\n\nThe CEO of Elevate Aviation Group, Greg Raiff, recently warned that the economic impact would ripple outward. “This shutdown is going to affect everything from business travel to tourism,” he told the Associated Press.\n\n“It’s going to hurt local tax revenues and city budgets – there’s a cascading effect from all this.”\n\nIn recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has said he will only restore  food aid  once the government shutdown ends.\n\n“SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden’s disastrous term … will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government,” he wrote earlier this week on Truth Social.\n\nThe US Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps, provides low-income Americans with roughly $8bn a month in grocery assistance. The average individual benefit is about $190 per month, while a household receives around $356.\n\nDemocrats blame the shutdown on Republicans’ refusal to renew expiring healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Talks stalled again on Saturday after Trump declared he would not compromise on the issue.\n\nDemocrats are pushing for a one-year extension of the ACA subsidies, which mainly help people without employer or government health coverage buy insurance. But with a 53–47 majority in the Senate, Republicans can block the proposal.\n\nTrump intervened on Saturday via Truth Social, calling on Republican senators to redirect federal funds used for health insurance subsidies toward direct payments for individuals.\n\n“I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies … BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,” he said.\n\nRoughly 24 million Americans currently benefit from the ACA subsidies. Analysts warn that premiums could double by 2026 if Congress allows them to expire.\n\nThis is  not the first time  Washington has faced such a standoff. The graphic below shows every US funding gap and government shutdown since 1976, including how long each lasted and under which administration it occurred.\n\nThe current federal budget process dates back to 1976. Since its creation, the government has experienced 20 funding gaps, leading to 10 shutdowns.\n\nPrior to the 1980s, such funding lapses rarely caused shutdowns. Most federal agencies continued operating, expecting Congress to soon approve new funding.\n\nThat changed in 1980, when Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued legal opinions clarifying that, under federal law, agencies cannot spend money without congressional authorisation. Only essential functions (like air traffic control) were permitted to continue.\n\nFrom 1982 onward, this interpretation has meant that funding gaps have more frequently triggered full or partial government shutdowns, lasting until Congress reaches a resolution.\n\nNo breakthrough was announced after the US Senate convened for a rare Saturday session. The chamber is now expected to reconvene at 1:30pm local time on Sunday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that the chamber will continue meeting until the government reopens. “There’s still only one path out – it’s a clean funding extension,” he said.\n\nSome 1.3 million service members are now at risk of missing a paycheque, and that might put pressure on both sides to agree on a deal. Earlier this month, staff were paid after $8bn from military research and development funds were made available at the intervention of Trump.\n\nBut questions remain about whether the administration will resort to a similar procedure if the shutdown is prolonged.  Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire told reporters on Friday that Democrats “need another path forward”.\n\nShaheen and several moderate Democrats are floating a proposal that would temporarily fund certain departments – such as veterans’ services and food aid – while keeping the rest of the government open until December or early next year.\n\nIt’s understood that Shaheen’s plan would include a promise of a future vote on healthcare subsidies, but not a guaranteed extension. It remains unclear whether enough Democrats would support that compromise.\n\nThune, meanwhile, is reportedly considering a bipartisan version of the proposal. On Friday, he  said  he thinks the offer is an indication that Democrats are “feeling the heat … I guess you could characterise that as progress”.\n\nLooking ahead, it remains unclear what Republicans might offer regarding healthcare.\n\nFor now, Democrats face a stark choice: keep pressing for a firm deal to renew healthcare subsidies and prolong the shutdown – or vote to reopen the government and trust Republicans’ assurances of a future healthcare vote, with no certainty of success."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kp9yev5e5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"09:17:13.924+00:00","title":"Tanzania's Samia Suluhu Hassan: The president blamed for shattering the country's aura of stability","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tanzania is facing a major political crisis following its worst post-election violence in decades, as the country’s long-standing reputation for stability is eroded.

Hassan: The president blamed for shattering the country's aura of stability\n\nTanzania remains gripped by the aftermath of its worst post-election violence in decades, a crisis that has shaken its long-standing reputation as a beacon of peace and stability in Africa.\n\nIt has also earned the country rare rebukes from regional and continental organisations.\n\nIn a defiant inauguration speech on Monday, President Samia Suluhu Hassan said the election was fair and transparent but acknowledged people had died during the protests. She blamed foreign actors for the deadly protests.\n\nThe death toll is not clear but families continue to search for or bury relatives killed following the recent disputed poll, that Samia won with 98% of the vote.\n\nSamia, the soft-spoken leader whose calm and gentle demeanour, initially inspired optimism when she assumed power in 2021 after the sudden death in office of her authoritarian predecessor, John Magufuli.\n\nBut that has now changed.\n\n\"Samia has pushed Tanzania to its thick winter of protests, instability and uncertainty,\" Prof Peter Kagwanja, a Kenyan policy analyst, told the BBC.\n\nThe protests, organised by young people, drew clear parallels with global Gen Z-led mobilisations against entrenched leadership and unresponsive governments.\n\nAnalysts say while the unrest was unprecedented for Tanzania, it was preceded by a tense political climate - marked by stalled reforms, years of simmering youth anger, power tussles within the ruling party and the sustained persecution of opposition leaders.\n\n\"The protests were just a culmination of years of anger and grievances that have been bottled in by Tanzanians,\" Godfrey Mwampembwa, a Tanzanian-born political cartoonist, popularly known as Gado, said.\n\nGado's satirical cartoons depicting President Samia as authoritarian and intolerant of political competition, have been circulated widely on social media.\n\nVeteran Tanzanian journalist Jenerali Ulimwengu described in a column how the recent election was \"the boiling point reached by societal soups that have been cooking for decades in a slow cooker without being noticed by an absent-minded rulership, totally submerged in the middle of its gravy train\".\n\nSimilar sentiments were shared by Gado, who accused the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party of \"burying its head in the sand\" and being \"tone-deaf\" to Tanzanians' growing calls for change.\n\n\"CCM has over the years disenfranchised the masses and disregarded the very state institutions that keep it in power, \" said the satirist, who is based in neighbouring Kenya but has been closely following events in his home country.\n\nCharles Onyango-Obbo, political commentator on East African matters, agrees that the CCM \"had long mistaken calm for maturity, but it was only age and arrogance hiding behind a glorious history\".\n\n\"It confused the people's silence with peace, not realising it was the quiet of exhaustion,\" he wrote.\n\nUnlike others in the region, the CCM, which emerged from the Tanganyika African National Union, is a post-colonial liberation party that has maintained a firm grip not only on the levers of power but also on the nation's psyche.\n\nBut it is the nature of this latest election that has exposed a shocking new side of Tanzania, a country long seen as protest-shy, especially when compared with neighbouring Kenya.\n\nIn the months preceding election day, the CCM government worked to systematically eliminate any credible competition, according to analysts.\n\nThe two main opposition leaders were blocked from contesting the poll - Tundu Lissu is in detention on treason charges, which he denies, while Luhaga Mpina's candidacy was rejected on technical grounds.\n\nAccording to Prof Kagwanja, that act alone negated what Tanzania and its founding President Julius Nyerere stood for.\n\n\"You don't jail your opponents, you seek to get support from people against the opposition,\" said Prof Kagwanja.\n\nFondly known as Mama Samia, the 65-year-old president is now facing mounting accusations of heading a repressive government responsible for violently crushing historic protests.\n\nHer approach to leadership was initially admired both at home and abroad as she allowed opposition parties to organise rallies and criticise the government without the fear of grave repercussions.\n\nShe had pledged to re-open Tanzania to the world through her \"4R\" doctrine - reconciliation, resilience, rebuilding and reform.\n\nHaving been born and raised in Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous archipelago known for humility and hospitality, it was unsurprising that Samia inspired a sense of relief when she assumed power in 2021.\n\nBut analysts say that as Samia set her eyes on a second term, she started seeing internal party pressure within the CCM and the resurgence of the opposition as threats to her ambition.\n\nFor the last three years, she had reshuffled the cabinet multiple times and replaced  military and intelligence chiefs, in moves seen as weeding out loyalists of her predecessor.\n\n\"Within the CCM, she resorted to a Magufuli script of manipulating the party, centralising power and creating a cabal of trusted loyalists as the new fulcrum of power,\" said Prof Kagwanja.\n\nSamia's calculated political manoeuvres - which earned her the nickname \"Simba jike\" (Swahili for lioness) among her supporters - paid off as the CCM nominated her as its presidential candidate in January.\n\nMonths to the election, a wave of abductions, arrests and the brutal killings of opposition members gripped the country, shattering hopes for reforms and reconciliation.\n\nThe political space had drastically shrunk in the run-up to the recent election, that was overshadowed by an internet blackout and a curfew.\n\nHundreds may have died in post-election unrest according to the opposition. The  authorities are yet to release an official death toll.\n\nThe violence was shocking for a nation that had cultivated an image of calm, consensus, and order for nearly six decades.\n\n\"The myth of Tanzanian exceptionalism lies in ruins,\" stated Mr Onyango-Obbo.\n\nIn an uncommon critique, the African Union and the regional Southern African Development Community said Samia's electoral victory did not meet accepted democratic standards, citing ballot-stuffing, repression and systemic flaws.\n\nThe main opposition, the Party for Democracy and Development (Chadema), dismissed the results as \"completely fabricated\".\n\n\"Samia's challenge was not winning the election. Instead, it was to win the hearts and minds of Tanzanians and East Africans that she was elected in a fair contest. Lamentably, Samia chose coronation. She closed all avenues to a fair contest,\"  said Prof Kagwanja.\n\nAs she begins to serve her second term in office, analysts say Samia is facing mounting international scrutiny which could undermine her legitimacy to lead the East African country.\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993lpxjx1po","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"23:40:54.170+00:00","title":"Shutdown could reduce US flights 'to a trickle', transport secretary warns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ongoing 40-day government shutdown in the United States has severely disrupted air travel, with over 2,900 flights cancelled and 8,600 delayed, particularly at the nation's busiest airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that air travel could be reduced to a 'trickle' if the shutdown continues, jeopardizing Thanksgiving travel for thousands. The Federal Aviation Administration has implemented capacity cuts due to unpaid air traffic controllers, who are fatigued and absent from duty. While Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth offered military controllers as a backup, they were declined due to lack of certification.

and cancellations continue to snarl US air travel for a third day as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned air traffic will be \"reduced to a trickle\" if the US government shutdown continues.\n\nMore than 2,900 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled and   8,600   delayed by late afternoon on Sunday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The longest delays were reported in Newark, New Jersey – more than two hours on average.\n\nIn a hopeful sign, lawmakers are working on a possible deal to reach a compromise on government funding and end the shutdown, according to US media reports.\n\nThe Senate was scheduled to convene on Sunday in a rare weekend session.\n\nDuffy warned the impacts on air travel will grow dire if they do not break the stalemate soon.\n\n\"You're going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,\" he said on CNN on Sunday. He added that travellers trying to fly home for the Thanksgiving holiday later this month may not be able to get there.\n\n\"Many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn't open back up,\" he said.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced last week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to 6% this weekend and 10% by next weekend at 40 of the nation's busiest airports. The cuts do not apply to international flights, but some airlines may choose to also cancel some of those flights, the FAA said.\n\nAir traffic controllers, who are not being paid during the shutdown, are reportedly fatigued and not coming to work, triggering the reductions in air traffic allowances.\n\nDuffy said Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth offered to have military air traffic controllers step in to help but he declined the offer because they are not certified to direct air traffic at the civilian airports.\n\nAltogether, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not being paid since the Government ran out of money on 1 October. Food assistance for low-income Americans also has been in limbo, with the administration agreeing to pay only half of monthly benefits.\n\nSunday marked the 40th day of the longest shutdown in history as Republicans and Democrats still have not agreed on a funding resolution to reopen the government.\n\nThe two parties have blamed each other for causing the impasse and for the travel disruptions.\n\nThe White House said on Friday that Democrats were \"inflicting their man-made catastrophe on Americans just trying to make life-saving medical trips or get home for Thanksgiving\".\n\nMeanwhile, on Saturday Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of \"playing games with people's livelihoods\".\n\nDemocrats have refused to back any Republican spending plan unless money for health insurance subsidies be included, while Republicans want to provide funding for the government without anything else attached.\n\nUS President Donald Trump suggested over the weekend money should be sent directly to Americans to buy health insurance rather than to insurance companies.\n\nRepublican senators are working on a compromise package that could end the impasse with a vote to advance legislation possibly coming on Sunday."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kljww1zdo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"00:18:18.197+00:00","title":"Tutor sought for £180k job to teach baby to become a 'gentleman'","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A family in north London has launched a unique job advertisement seeking a £180,000-a-year tutor to begin shaping the cultural identity of their one-year-old child from infancy, aiming to instill British gentlemanly values such as Received Pronunciation, etiquette, horse riding, and music.

2025-11-10T00:18:18.197+00:00\n\nTitle: Tutor sought for £180k job to teach baby to become a 'gentleman'\n\n\"A family based in north London seeks an extraordinary and experienced tutor to support their youngest child on his first steps to becoming an English gentleman.\"\n\nWhen reading this advert, you would be forgiven for skimming over the words \"first-steps\", as a turn of phrase.\n\nBut, it could be the most significant part of this unique job advert, as it seeks to find a tutor for a one-year-old.\n\nHundreds of applications have now been submitted since the anonymous family published their request for the £180k-a-year tutor, who has to be \"someone very special\".\n\nOver the last few weeks, the advert has gained attention across the media, with many questioning why?\n\nAdam Caller, CEO and founder of Tutors International, which is assisting the family in their search, said despite initial scepticism, he found the idea \"far sighted\", and \"progressive\".\n\nWhen he met the family, he said they appreciated the unusual nature of their request, and how young their son is.\n\nHowever, they explained that they \"didn't want to wait any longer\" to get a tutor, as they had waited until their older child was five, and by that stage \"cultural bias had already set in\".\n\nBut what does the family mean by \"cultural bias\"?\n\nIt's \"everything\", Adam replied. \"The way you eat, the way you speak\".\n\nHe said the older sibling had picked \"really subtle, non-verbal cues\" from the family, and had adopted their cultural ways. The family told Adam they did not want history to repeat itself with their new baby.\n\nThe plan:  To bring in a British tutor , who must speak with Received Pronunciation, to influence the baby right from the beginning.\n\n\"A lot of the learning at the beginning here is kind of osmotic,\" said Adam.\n\nIt's via this osmosis that the family are hoping the child will pick up the British traits they wish to instil.\n\nAdam said the tutor had to be somebody who went to \"the right kinds of schools - the same kinds of schools as the family aspire to send their son to\".\n\n\"The tutor just has to be the right kind of person, they'll be doing things they don't even know they're doing, just naturally,\" he said.\n\nThe family told Adam the successful candidate should ideally also have knowledge of or interest in horse riding, skiing, the arts and music so as to influence the child in a broad spectrum of interests.\n\nMore than that though, he said the family wanted the tutor to enrol the child on a range of classes so the child would be \"pony-riding and picking up an instrument by the time they are around three years old\".\n\nIn the family's minds, helping their son become a \"British gentleman\" will lead to success and open doors.\n\n\"For all the rights and wrongs of that, because it's definitely a class statement,\" he adds.\n\nBut, despite all this tutelage in \"Britishness\", could the child pick up so-called cultural bias from the international family he lives with anyway?\n\n\"Yes\", said Adam. \"The family know this may not work, but they've just taken the view of, 'let's give it a go and let's go as early as we can', because the cost of it is not relevant,\" he said.\n\nThere are some in the tutoring industry who share those concerns.\n\nPeter Cui, CEO and founder of Blue Education, who also offer private tutors, wrote  in a blog  that \"the process of becoming bicultural, or indeed, becoming oneself, is something that must be lived into, not engineered.\"\n\nPeter wrote that he had moved from China to the UK at the age of seven, and had been raised knowing and living both cultures. He went on to study at Cambridge University.\n\n\"The idea that one individual can serve as a living vessel of Britishness, someone who can somehow transplant the qualities of a British gentleman onto a one-year-old child, strikes me as idealistic and unrealistic,\" he wrote.\n\n\"In my experience, having a quintessentially British tutor from infancy will not automatically produce the outcome they desire.\n\n\"I never had such a figure, and yet I have been fortunate enough to live many of the experiences they aspire for their son.\"\n\nHe added: \"The truth is, cultural identity cannot be imposed from the outside; it must be chosen, and it must come from within.\"\n\nOf course, Britishness is something Adam hopes can be taught - and sold.\n\n\"I think the fact that the world holds us in this regard is something that we should be cherishing and taking advantage of at the same time,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think that, as British people, we should be embarrassed by this,\" Adam said.\n\n\"I think we should be proud of it.\n\nThe market for buying Britishness isn't just helping Adam's tutoring business, it's given rise to businesses such as Laura Windsor's Etiquette Academy.\n\nLaura, like other \"etiquette experts\", can teach people - for a fee - how to take afternoon tea, dress and hold a conversation, \"like a British person\".\n\n\"Society has become so diluted and unrestrained, people now want to go back to the way it was,\" she said.\n\nThe demand for etiquette training is mainly from international clients who wish to be able to interact at business meetings and functions, she said.\n\nBut she also teaches groups of children too. Why?\n\n\"Because being a polite gentleman or gentlewoman is all about first impressions,\" she said.\n\n\"Being polite means you respect other people, you make them feel comfortable and important. When you make people feel important, you're liked, and that opens doors to incredible opportunities.\"\n\nShe said she teaches people how it's \"all in the details\": \"It's about opening doors, and saying 'please' and 'thank you', and thinking about the other person.\"\n\nLaura's students are never usually as young as one, but starting that young is something the etiquette expert says can have benefits.\n\n\"Starting at one, they will grow up being a gentleman, and therefore it's not a question of 'tweaking', it's who they are.\n\n\"Whereas nowadays, people need to be tweaked a little bit, to be a little bit more aware of what they do,\" she said.\n\nRaising children to be classically British - with all the etiquette trimmings - is not the priority for parent Daniel (not his real name).\n\n\"Far from leaning into English, British values, we wanted the total opposite. We are trying to go away from the UK system and the straight-jacket of that,\" he said.\n\nDaniel is currently employing one of Adam's super-tutors to work with his three children around their school hours.\n\nNext year the tutor will accompany the whole family as they move abroad for work.\n\nFor Daniel and his wife, it's about teaching emotional intelligence, and preparing their children for a world influenced by Artificial Intelligence. Neither believes this is possible without an external tutor.\n\nThe current British school system \"isn't fit for purpose\", he said, adding that one private school in London,  Latymer Upper School,  has now dropped using most of the GCSE examination system and instead uses its own in-house system which involves more group work activities and project-based learning.\n\n\"If GCSE's aren't going to be recognised everywhere - and are not the gold standard - maybe we would be better leaning into a tutor where we get so much more out of it,\" said Daniel.\n\n\"Right here, right now, in the UK school system, if I look at the quality of teacher my kids would get at a private school versus these tutors, it's an absolute joke - there is a real discrepancy,\" he said.\n\nHe added that he recognised hiring a high-end tutor was for \"those in a lucky financial situation\", but explained that since private school fees  increased following the addition of VAT in January , he felt the cost of the private tutor had become comparable for three children.\n\n\"My kids could have one-twentieth of a very average person's attention in school, or they could have one-third of an absolutely exceptional person - it's an absolute no brainer.\"\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on  Sounds  and follow BBC London on  Facebook ,  X  and  Instagram .

It both warns Chinese people of South East Asia's billion-dollar scam industry, and highlights the Chinese government's crackdown on the men behind an industry which has trapped thousands, and stolen billions.\n\nThe message China wants to send, as one investigator puts it, is clear: \"It's to warn other people, no matter who you are, where you are, as long as you commit such heinous crimes against Chinese people, you will pay the price.\"\n\nOr, to use a Chinese idiom: kill the chicken to scare the monkey.\n\nThere are few chickens bigger than the Weis, Lius, Mings and Bais - Godfather-esque families who rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s.\n\nUnder their rule, the impoverished backwater was transformed into a flashy hub of casinos and red-light districts.\n\nMore recent are the scam farms - which hold people against their will, forcing them to defraud strangers online, or face brutal punishment or even death. Many of those trapped were Chinese and targeted people in China.\n\nBut the families' empires came crashing down in 2023, when Myanmar authorities arrested them and handed them to China. Since then, Chinese courts have tried them for crimes ranging from fraud to human trafficking to homicide.\n\nExamples are now being made out of the families: 11 members of the Ming clan and five of the Bais have been sentenced to death, while dozens have been given lengthy jail terms. Prosecution is under way for the Lius and the Weis.\n\nTheir ignominious falls from grace are clear in the documentaries they feature in, from the glint of their handcuffs to the colour of their prison uniforms.\n\nIt is a far cry from the lives they were living just two years ago.\n\nThe godfathers of Laukkaing rose to power after Min Aung Hlaing, who now heads Myanmar's military government, led an operation to oust the town's then-dominant warlord.\n\nThe military leader had been looking for co-operative allies, and Bai Suocheng - then a deputy of the warlord - fitted the bill.\n\nBai was appointed the chairman of Laukkaing district and his family came to command a 2,000-strong militia, Chinese media reported.\n\nIn the power vacuum left by these changes, a handful of families swooped in, securing military and political power.\n\nAccording to Chinese investigators, the Wei family had one member of parliament and another military camp commander. Meanwhile, the Lius controlled key infrastructure like water and electricity and exerted strong influence over local security forces.\n\nFor years they made their money through gambling and prostitution.\n\nBut more recently they expanded to cyberscam operations, with each family controlling dozens of scam compounds and casinos that raked in billions of dollars.\n\nWhile the families lived large with grand banquets and luxury cars, a culture of abominable violence thrived behind the walls of their scam compounds, Chinese authorities said.\n\nTestimonies collected from freed workers point to a common pattern of abuse: fingers chopped off with knives, zaps of electric batons and regular beatings. Unco-operative workers were locked in small dark rooms and starved or beaten until they gave in.\n\nMany of the Chinese workers had been lured there with lucrative job offers - no doubt tempting amid China's economic slowdown and high youth unemployment.\n\nHorror stories of such scam centres have seeped into daily chatter in China, from taxi rides to social media and pop culture.\n\nNo More Bets, a 2023 blockbuster about Chinese people trafficked to a foreign scam farm, kept millions of Chinese tourists away from Thailand - which has gained a reputation for being a transit hub to scam centres in Myanmar and Cambodia.\n\nIn January this year, the national spotlight was on Wang Xing, a small-time Chinese actor who had flown to Thailand for an acting gig, only to be taken to a scam centre across the border in Myanmar.\n\nHis family's search for him went viral and he was ultimately rescued.\n\nBut Wang is in the lucky minority. Many Chinese people are still looking for their loved ones who have disappeared into South East Asia's scam centres.\n\n\"My cousin was lured there four or five years ago. We haven't heard from him at all. My aunt is in tears every day, it's hard to describe her current condition,\" a Weibo user wrote last month.\n\nSelina Ho, associate professor specialising in Chinese politics at the National University of Singapore, tells the BBC that \"by publicising the most recent crackdown, Chinese authorities are aiming to calm domestic sentiments and reassure the families of victims\".\n\nThe UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people are still trapped in scam centres worldwide.\n\nMuch to Beijing's chagrin, those running many such scam centres are often Chinese themselves.\n\nThis is common knowledge among Chinese citizens. \"Once you're abroad, the people you should least trust are your own countrymen,\" reads a comment on Weibo.\n\n\"The fact that Chinese nationals are the masterminds behind many of these operations has been deeply damaging to China's image on the international stage,\" Ivan Franceschini, co-author of Scam: Inside Southeast Asia's Cybercrime Compounds, tells the BBC.\n\nAs anxieties rise at home, Chinese authorities are eager to show their resolve in eradicating these massive scam networks.\n\nSince 2023, Chinese and Myanmar authorities have arrested more than 57,000 Chinese nationals for their role in cyberscams, state media reported.\n\nAnd they've made it clear that it's not just the Godfathers they're after.\n\nIn October, China announced the prosecution of another syndicate which they described as a \"new generation of power\" in Laukkaing that's \"no less violent\" than the infamous families.\n\nIn - yet another - state media documentary, a Chinese official investigating this syndicate recalled what his team leader had told him: \"If this case can't be solved, there will be a permanent stain on your career.\"\n\nFor all the effort that China is putting into its crackdown and the ensuing publicity, the numbers offer some optimism: cyberscams reported in China have declined steadily over the past year, and authorities say such crimes have been \"effectively curbed\".\n\nAs one official told documentary viewers, investigating scam gangs in Myanmar has made him realise \"how happy we are in China, and how important a sense of security is to Chinese people\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Kelly Ng"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c993k9y2l4zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"00:25:51.873+00:00","title":"South Africa-G20: The challenge of cleaning up 'filthy' Johannesburg ahead of world leaders' arrival","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahead of the G20 summit in Johannesburg, the city faces a severe crisis of urban decay, with over 100 derelict buildings in the inner city—many hijacked by criminal gangs and unfit for human habitation.

2025-11-10T00:25:51.873+00:00\n\nTitle: South Africa-G20: The challenge of cleaning up 'filthy' Johannesburg ahead of world leaders' arrival\n\nIn just under a fortnight, leaders from some of the world's major economies will gather in South Africa's economic heartland, Johannesburg, for the G20 summit.\n\nBut just a few kilometres from the spruced-up, highly secure venue is a city centre which the authorities are struggling to improve and keep safe.\n\nThey face major challenges in cleaning up more than 100 derelict buildings, many plagued by rubbish and open sewage, some of which have been taken over by criminal gangs.\n\n\"There's guns, there's drugs, there's prostitutes, there's everything here,\" said Nelson Khetani, resident of a building known as MBV1, located in Joubert Park.\n\nNeglect and a lack of maintenance have left vandalised communal kitchens stripped of their fittings, while overflowing human waste covers parts of what used to be the laundry area.\n\nMr Khetani told BBC Africa Eye that rooms in MBV1 had been hijacked – a phenomenon where spaces or entire residential units are taken over and controlled by criminals to collect rent for themselves and, in some circumstance, provide a base for illegal activities.\n\nThe BBC has located and confirmed that there are 102 derelict or abandoned buildings in the inner city, an area of about 18 sq km (seven sq miles), but other media reports have cited much higher figures. Some of these have been hijacked and are unfit for human habitation.\n\nThe state of the city was on the mind of President Cyril Ramaphosa when talking about the G20 summit to the city council in March.\n\n\"I found the city filthy,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a painful sight to go through the centre of the city… you have a number of abandoned buildings, buildings that have been hijacked, that are not paying your rates and taxes.\"\n\nJohannesburg Mayor Dada Morero said at the time that the city was \"ready to host the G20\".\n\nLast month, as part of a \"clean-up\" campaign across Johannesburg, the city council said the inner city had been \"targeted...  for the systemic removal of pervasive lawlessness, illegal activities, hijacked properties, and critical by-law infringements\".\n\nBut the challenges ahead of the world event are huge.\n\nA fire at one of these derelict buildings that killed 76 people two years ago was supposed to spur people into action, but it seems not much has changed.\n\nThe BBC visited another inner-city building, Vannin Court, where rooms were covered in dirt and strewn with litter. A strong smell of human faeces permeated the building.\n\nResident Sinethemba Maqoma told the BBC that council-owned Vannin Court had been hijacked, and that the city council had cut off the water.\n\n\"The municipality was angry about the crime from this building... that's why they took [away] the water,\" said another resident, Sinqhiwe Goodman Sithole.\n\nJohannesburg's city council did not respond to the BBC's request for comment about Vannin Court's water supply.\n\nThere is also no electricity supply, Mr Maqoma said, adding that they use gas and solar lights.\n\nThe lack of utilities means residents cook food using portable gas tanks to power stoves. But without water or fire extinguishers nearby, the fire risks are huge.\n\nCars abandoned in the building's basement were partly submerged in human waste that was overflowing into an adjacent alleyway. Litter was floating on top of this slow-moving sludge of sewage.\n\nMr Maqoma showed the BBC a dark, unsanitary bathroom with a toilet that he said he flushes by pouring a bucket of water down it.\n\n\"When you flush [the toilet], it goes through to the basement,\" he said.\n\nThe city's housing problems are not a recent phenomenon.\n\nSince apartheid and white-minority rule ended in 1994, many black and mixed-race residents moved from townships outside the city to the centre to be closer to their workplaces.\n\nThis large influx of people put intense pressure on the supply of adequate housing. Coupled with under-investment and the departure of many wealthy landlords, this led to many buildings falling into neglect, and some became havens for illegal activity like hijacking.\n\nJoseph, which is not his real name, is a former hijacker who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity. He said he was hired by local criminals to \"clean\" a building and then \"put posters and write 'flat to rent'\". But collecting the rent was not the main business.\n\n\"The main business about the building is cooking the drugs,\" he said. \"They cook nyaope neat. Many buildings, plenty of them here in Jo'burg - they've been hijacked like that.\"\n\nNyaope is a highly addictive street drug in South Africa, often containing substances like low-grade heroin, cannabis, antiretroviral drugs, and in some cases even rat poison. It can cause abdominal pain, respiratory issues and depression.\n\nJoseph said he was haunted by those who may have suffered as a result of what happened where he operated.\n\n\"Some of the time, when I'm sleeping, I can see people, I see people. People died in these buildings. People went missing. I'm sorry for the wrong path in my life,\" he told the BBC.\n\nJoseph said he had left the gang because he discovered other gang members were plotting to kill him, adding that he was relieved to leave his criminal life.\n\nBut he gave some insight as to one possible reason that the hijacked building was not cleared by the authorities: corruption.\n\nJoseph claimed that evictions were prevented by \"having a good relationship with [the] city council and police\", which was a \"matter of [a] cash\" bribe.\n\nWhen asked about the allegations of collusion with building hijackers, the City of Johannesburg's deputy director of communications, Nthatisi Modingoane, said the council had no \"physical\" or \"credible reports\" that suggested there was \"any wrongdoing\".\n\nWhen it came to cracking down on criminal activities in hijacked buildings, the spokesperson said there had been \"operations where we found people with drugs... [and] illegal weapons and those cases are currently sitting with the South African police services for further investigation\".\n\nMr Modingoane added that the council \"will intensify\" its operations tackling criminal activity in hijacked buildings and \"make sure that we clean the city\".\n\nThe Johannesburg police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on bribery and intimidation.\n\nThe eviction of the residents of these derelict and hijacked buildings sounds like the simple answer to the problem.\n\nThat could lead to much-needed redevelopment. But it would be an expensive exercise and legally not straightforward.\n\nIn the first place, South Africa's constitution protects the right of people to have a home.\n\nThis means once a person is settled in a building and they can prove they have nowhere else to go, they cannot be forced out unless the state provides alternative accommodation.\n\nThis imposes a cost on the local authority, and moving people out of a building is expensive in itself.\n\nJohannesburg Central's sheriff, whose jurisdiction covers part of the inner city, said evictions could not be carried out on a larger scale or frequently because of financial constraints.\n\nSheriff Marks Mangaba's role is to carry out instructions from courts, which includes dealing with evictions from buildings once a property owner obtains an eviction order.\n\nLandlords - either private or state - must pay for moving people out once they have obtained that order. But Mr Mangaba said larger scale evictions were a \"very costly exercise, it's millions of rands\".\n\nBut even if the City of Johannesburg could afford to evict people in large numbers, it would create a mass homelessness crisis and the council would then have to provide accommodation.\n\nFurthermore, South Africa's Prevention of Illegal Eviction Act means that every eviction has to come with a court order meaning that attempts to move people can get snarled up in the legal system.\n\nBack in March, the president highlighted the importance for Johannesburg's hijacked buildings to be \"turned into living accommodations where our people can live lives of dignity\".\n\nBut for many residents here, that vision remains hollow.\n\nAt the MBV1 building, Mr Khetani said he had been living there since 2008 even though it was supposed to be temporary accommodation.\n\nThe city council had told him that there was no permanent accommodation \"to go and put us into\", he said.\n\n\"The city has no money and nobody cares.\"\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6n0k4x68no","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"00:32:23.692+00:00","title":"A Kremlin target?

I have never had any tasks or duties or requests on their part,\" says the former head of foreign relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion.\n\nHilarion has broken his silence after a series of allegations levelled against him by a former aide.\n\n\"Working for the Church is not compatible with working for intelligence. Those are two very different allegiances,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMetropolitan Hilarion was for many years a high-flyer in the Church and seen as likely successor to Patriarch Kirill. He fell from grace very quickly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and was sent into exile in Hungary.\n\nNo reason was ever given but close observers of the Orthodox Church were in little doubt. Patriarch Kirill warmly embraced Vladimir Putin's war, but Hilarion neither blessed nor opposed it.\n\nIn Putin's Russia, where criticism of the war is a criminal offence, such a stance from a top clergyman was enough to lose Hilarion his job.\n\nThe allegations against Hilarion began in June 2024, from 23-year-old Japanese citizen George Suzuki, who began working for him after his arrival in Budapest.\n\nThe former theology student accuses him of sexual misconduct as well as working for Russia's FSB intelligence agency.\n\nHe runs his own YouTube channel, and has posted further allegations using video and audio clips recorded in Budapest.\n\nSome of these, Hilarion says, have been doctored. He told the BBC he would refute each in turn in court.\n\nMetropolitan Hilarion admits mistakes in his treatment of Suzuki, but denies sexual harassment as well as spying.\n\nThese are difficult moments for a man who, during his 13 years as the Church's \"foreign minister\", engineered a rapprochement with the Catholic Church that led to a historic summit between Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill in Cuba in 2016.\n\nIt was the first meeting between the heads of the two Churches since the great schism of 1054.\n\nHilarion's case was given added urgency this week when the Czech government said it was considering imposing sanctions on him in response to the allegations against him.\n\nHis position on Russia's war in Ukraine has not changed.\n\n\"Any war is a tragedy, and the Church is always with the suffering people. That's as much as I can say.\"\n\nHilarion's supporters fear that Kremlin hardliners are now out to destroy him.\n\n\"Given the way Putin's regime operates, it would hardly be surprising if, in addition to his dramatic demotion in ecclesiastical terms, there had also been a determination to make sure that his reputation was damaged in whatever ways could be arranged,\" the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, told the BBC.\n\n\"The full facts remain unclear, but there is a Kremlin  modus operandi  that seems recognisable here.\"\n\nThe BBC has been in contact with George Suzuki. He alleges that Hilarion began sexually harassing him soon after his arrival in Budapest.\n\nHilarion denies harassment of any kind.\n\nAccording to him, in August 2023, his aide returned to Japan to visit his family, and returned to Budapest three weeks later \"a changed man\", tense, and unfriendly.\n\nHilarion also says that he has information that Suzuki visited Moscow the same month.\n\nAround this time a new character, Veronica Suzuki, enters the story - his aide's grandmother, who had taken custody of George Suzuki as a child.\n\nShe joined him in Budapest and stayed for weeks in luxury hotels, paid for by Hilarion.\n\nIn January 2024, George Suzuki suddenly disappeared, then wrote to Hilarion from Japan, pleading illness and family problems.\n\nHilarion offered to send €2,000 (£1,760)  a month, then received an email from Veronica Suzuki, demanding €384,000 - to be paid into her account, in exchange for destroying \"evidence\" her grandson had collected.\n\nHe reported her to the Hungarian police for extortion, then found that three expensive watches had been stolen, and cash worth in total €90,000 (£79,000).\n\nHe told police, and on the basis of fingerprints, DNA and security camera footage, an international warrant was issued for George Suzuki's arrest.\n\nThe stolen goods were later returned, but the former aide turned down Hilarion's offer of mediation to have the arrest warrant against him removed.\n\nIn June 2024, Suzuki began accusing Hilarion of sexual harassment, ostentatious wealth, and most recently, collaboration with the FSB.\n\nIn one video posted on YouTube, Hilarion can be seen getting into a bed where another figure is lying, apparently asleep.\n\nIn another, Hilarion fires a pistol in a shooting range which George Suzuki alleges belongs to the FSB headquarters in Moscow.\n\nIn an audio clip, Hilarion can be heard apparently warning his aide that things will go badly for him if he leaves his service and returns to Japan.\n\nIn his BBC interview, Hilarion says that he has evidence that the video and audio clips have been doctored, but refuses to go further.\n\n\"My lawyers advised me not to comment publicly on any material, be it textual, visual or audio, released by him or taken by journalists from [George Suzuki's] collection, before they are examined by the court.\"\n\n\"My first mistake was that I allowed him to come to Hungary,\" Hilarion told the BBC. He also regrets agreeing to the family's \"financial demands\".\n\nDespite what he describes as his ordeal, Hilarion remains loyal to the Russian Orthodox church, and to Patriarch Kirill.\n\nHe was investigated by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church and last December he was retired from his position as head of the Budapest diocese and transferred to the Church in the Czech city of Karlovy Vary.\n\nBut the Czech government's decision to consider imposing sanctions on him puts his future there in jeopardy and could force him to return to Russia.\n\n\"It is their liberty to decide who they want in the Czech Republic and who they don't want,\" Hilarion said. He would just like to talk to them before they do."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50pjzg0pyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"23:52:50.875+00:00","title":"Two Major League Baseball pitchers charged in sports gambling scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two Cleveland Guardians pitchers, Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, have been charged with conspiring to rig pitches in order to take bribes from sports bettors, allegedly beginning in May 2023 and June 2025, respectively.

million evacuate\n\nTyphoon Fung-wong has made landfall in the Philippines, where more than 900,000 people have been evacuated and two people have died.\n\nThe storm hit as a super typhoon, with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph).\n\nThe eye of the storm hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT). By 02:00, the storm weakened to a typhoon and was over La Union in western Luzon.\n\nThe country's meteorological service warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.\n\nFung-wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left  nearly 200 people dead.\n\nEastern parts of the Philippines had already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds on Saturday evening, a weather official said.\n\nResidents in Catanduanes, an island in the east of the Bicol region, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning.\n\nThe storm passed near the eastern Bicol region on Sunday morning, before making its way past the Polillo Islands on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe civil defence office reported that one person drowned and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris in Catbalogan City.\n\nThe civil aviation regulator has closed several airports, and almost 300 flights have been cancelled.\n\nFung-wong was expected to weaken after making landfall, but is likely to remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon.\n\nMore than 200mm of rain is forecast for parts of Luzon, with even 100-200mm in the Metro Manilla area. This is expected to cause severe flooding and landslides.\n\nIn the Aurora region, in eastern Luzon, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang.\n\nHe said police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm. The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning.\n\nWhile the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said he would stay as long as he could to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety.\n\nStaff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind.\n\nIn central Aurora, more than 200 people arrived at a shelter in a sports centre. Many parents have brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013.\n\n\"We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,\" Jessa Zurbano told the BBC.\n\nAnother evacuee Patry Azul said: \"Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe.\"\n\nFung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.\n\nHeavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.\n\nAt least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing.\n\nFive people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.\n\nThe Filipino government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.\n\nIt has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.\n\nFor some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Kalmaegi has left them even more anxious about the storm to come.\n\n\"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.\n\nHe is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.\n\nAnother resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge.\"\n\nThe Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.\n\nAbout 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.\n\nClimate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.\n\nHowever, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.\n\nAre you in the Philippines?

talks have a point any more?\n\nThere is a photograph, taken ten years ago in Paris, that today seems like something of a relic.\n\nIn it, dozens of men and women line up in dark suits, in front of an enormous sign that reads COP21 Paris.\n\nRight in the middle the UK's then-Prime Minister, David Cameron, grins widely, as he stands beside the future King Charles III, just in front of China’s Xi Jinping. Far off to the right is the then US President Barack Obama, deep in conversation with someone who is cut off from the frame - because there were so many leaders lining up that day that it was difficult for the photographer to capture them all at once.\n\nWhat a far cry from the family photograph taken on Thursday with this year's line-up at the COP30 summit in Brazil, with just 30 leaders in the picture.\n\nXi and Modi were no-shows, along with the leaders of around 160 other countries. And notably absent was the US President Donald Trump.\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration has exited the process entirely and has said it will not send any high-level officials this year.\n\nWhich raises the question, why have a two-week-long multinational gathering at all if so many leaders aren’t there?\n\nChristiana Figueres, the former head of the UN's climate process under whose leadership the Paris Agreement was struck, said during last year's gathering that the COP process was \"not fit for purpose.\"\n\n\"The golden era for multilateral diplomacy is over,\" agrees Joss Garman, a former climate activist who now heads a new think tank called Loom.\n\n\"Climate politics is now more than ever about who captures and controls the economic benefits of new energy industries,\" he tells me.\n\nSo, with carbon dioxide emissions still rising even after 29 of these meetings - which are, after all, aimed at bringing them down - will more COPs make any difference?\n\nOn his first day back in office, Trump used his trademark marker pen to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, the 2015 UN treaty under which nations agreed to work together to try to keep global warming below 1.5°C.\n\n\"This 'climate change' - it's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,\" he told the UN General Assembly in September. \"If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.\"\n\nHe has rolled back restrictions on oil, gas, and coal, signed billions of dollars of tax breaks for fossil fuel firms, and opened up federal lands for extraction.\n\nPlus Trump and his team have called on governments around the world to abandon their \"pathetic\" renewable energy programmes and buy US oil and gas - in some cases with the risk of punitive tariffs if they don't. Japan and South Korea as well as Europe have agreed to buy tens of billions of US hydrocarbons.\n\nThe objective is clear: Trump says he wants to make the US the \"number one energy superpower in the world\".\n\nMeanwhile, he has set about dismantling his predecessor Joe Biden's clean energy agenda.\n\nSubsidies and tax breaks for wind and solar have been slashed, permits withdrawn, projects cancelled. Research funding has been cut too.\n\n\"Wind power in the United States has been subsidised for 33 years - isn't that enough?\" US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said when I asked him to explain the administration's policy when we met in September. \"You've got to be able to walk on your own after 25 to 30 years of subsidies.\"\n\nJohn Podesta, a senior adviser on climate to both Obama and Biden, sees it differently. \"The United States is taking a wrecking ball to clean energy,\" he argues.\n\n“They're trying to take us back not to the 20th Century, but the 19th.\"\n\nLast month, a landmark deal that would have cut global shipping emissions was abandoned after the US, along with Saudi Arabia, succeeded in ending the talks.\n\nMany supporters of the COP talks are concerned. What happens if the US path leads to other countries dialling down their commitments?\n\nAnna Aberg, a Research Fellow in Chatham House's Environment and Society Centre, describes COP as \"taking place in a really difficult political context\" given Trump's position.\n\n\"I think it's more important than ever that this COP sends some kind of signal to the world that there are still governments and businesses and institutions that are acting on climate change.”\n\nTrump's strategy puts the US on a collision course with China, which has also been working for decades to dominate the world's energy supplies - but through clean technology.\n\nIn 2023, clean technologies drove roughly 40% of China's economic growth, according to the climate website Carbon Brief.  After a slight slowdown last year, renewables accounted for a quarter of all new growth and now make up more than 10% of the entire economy.\n\nAnd, like Trump's America, China is engaging internationally well beyond participation in COP - it is taking its entire energy model global.\n\nThe split has transformed the climate debate. It is now one that pits the world's two superpowers against each other for control of the most essential industry on Earth.\n\nAnd it leaves the UK and Europe - as well as major emerging powers like India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil - caught in the middle.\n\nSpeaking at this year‘s conference, a source in government at a major developed country said: “Of all the things they're most terrified of, the biggest is being seen to criticise Trump.”\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, warned last month that Europe must not repeat what she termed the mistakes of the past and lose another strategic industry to China.\n\nShe called the loss of Europe's solar manufacturing base to cheaper Chinese rivals \"a cautionary tale we must not forget\".\n\nThe European Commission has forecasted that the market for renewables and other clean energy sources will grow from €600bn (£528bn) to €2 trillion (£1.74tn) within a decade and wants Europe to capture at least 15% of that.\n\nBut that ambition may come too late.\n\n\"China is already the world's clean-tech superpower,\" says Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Policy Institute. Its dominance in solar, wind, EVs, and advanced battery technologies, he says, is now \"virtually unassailable”.\n\nHe likens it to trying to beat the Chinese national team at table tennis: \"If you want to surpass China, you had to get your act together 25 years ago. If you want to do it now, you have no hope.\"\n\nChina produces over 80% of the world's solar panels, a similar share of advanced batteries, 70% of EVs, and more than 60% of wind turbines - all at phenomenally low prices.\n\nThe EU's recent move to raise tariffs on Chinese EVs reflects the scale of the dilemma. Open the market and Europe's car industry could collapse; close it and green targets may not be met.\n\nRestricting Chinese access to these markets may slow emissions reductions, says Joss Garman, but he argues, \"If we ignore questions about economic security, jobs, national security, that risks undermining public and political support for the entire climate effort.\"\n\nNow, with these shifts in direction of global politics and priorities, Anna Aberg says she expects COP to become an annual forum for \"holding to account\" countries and other organisations, something she believes remains an \"important role”.\n\nThe gathering in Brazil follows the acknowledgement by UN Secretary-General António Guterres that the 1.5°C target set in Paris will be breached - this, he has said, represents \"deadly negligence\" on the part of the world community.\n\nLast year was the hottest ever recorded, and 60 leading climate scientists said in June that the Earth could breach 1.5°C in as little as three years at current levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Yet more people are questioning the need for an annual gathering.\n\n\"I think we need one big COP every five years. And between that, I'm not sure what COP is for,\" says Michael Liebreich, founder of energy consultancy Bloomberg New Energy Finance and host of a green energy podcast, Cleaning Up.\n\n\"You can't just expect politicians to go and make more and more commitments.

Among other things, it aims to get an agreement for a multi-billion-dollar fund to support the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin.\n\nMichael Jacobs, who advised Gordon Brown on climate policy and is now a politics professor at Sheffield University, believes that continued collective support for the process is crucial.\n\n\"It's a big political message, because Donald Trump is trying to undermine the collective process, but it's also a message to businesses that they should continue to invest in decarbonisation because governments will continue to enact climate policies.\"\n\nThe UK's Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband believes these meetings have delivered real progress by getting countries to engage with tackling climate change and enact policies that have made the renewable revolution possible.\n\n\"It's dry, it's complicated, it's anguished, it's tiring,” he says - “and it's absolutely necessary”.\n\nMany now do, however, accept there is a strong argument for these international gatherings to be scaled down.\n\nUltimately, however, the real choice underlying it, for so many nations in attendance, simply comes down to the extent to which they align with a China-led clean energy revolution - or double down on the fossil fuels–first agenda.\n\nWhich is why many observers say the process of decarbonisation is going to be less about the multi-country commitments of COPs past, and far more about big-money deals between individual countries as we look ahead to this year’s summit - and how COPs may well play out in the future.\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

2025-11-10T00:17:37.214+00:00\n\nTitle: How the US has overtaken China's investments in Africa\n\nYou probably don't give much thought to the device that you're reading this article on, as long as it looks good and keeps working.\n\nBut the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm.\n\nThe African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten  - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems.\n\nChina has long been the  biggest player  in the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa.\n\nBeijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission.\n\nThis is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa,  according to the latest annual figures.  The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data.\n\nIt marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead.\n\nThis American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of  \"countering China's presence in strategic regions\".\n\nWhat does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries?\n\nLast year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metals  secured a $3.9m grant  from the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten.\n\n\"The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,\" says company chairman Shawn McCormick.\n\nTrinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania.\n\nMr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US.\n\n\"This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market.\"\n\nTrinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder.\n\nMr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards.\n\n\"We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity\".\n\nSepo Haimambo is an economist at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours.\n\n\"To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,\" she says. \"So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants.\"\n\nMs Haimambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. \"There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,\" she says.\n\n\"You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc.\"\n\nShe also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative.\n\nOne US company that is building a critical minerals and metals refinery in Africa is ReElement Africa, a subsidiary of US group American Resources. ReElement Africa is  constructing the refinery  in South Africa's Gauteng province.\n\n\"It was extremely rewarding to realise that we could partner with countries in Africa to put refining facilities alongside the resource in the mining projects, so you could actually capture more value, upskill labour, build an economy around that zone, and lay the foundation for further industrial development,\" says Ben Kincaid, CEO of ReElement Africa.\n\nHowever, Prof Lee Branstetter, an international economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the US has missed a trick.\n\nHe argues that Trump's trade tariffs on African nations have reduced enthusiasm for the US across the continent at a time when some in sub-Saharan African nations have complained that Chinese investment is not benefiting local populations enough.\n\n\"Had the current administration not indiscriminately slapped tariffs on large numbers of African countries for no apparent reason, the United States would probably have been in a better position to benefit from African disaffection with Chinese  projects,\" says Prof Branstetter.\n\nGoing forward, the US and China may also see increased competition in Africa from others, adds Ms Haimambo. She points to increased interest in the continent by countries such as Brazil, India and Japan."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4p2yzmem0o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"21:38:26.296+00:00","title":"Iran faces unprecedented drought as water crisis hits Tehran","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iran is experiencing an unprecedented drought in the autumn of 2025, with Tehran and other major cities like Mashhad facing near-total water shortages due to record-low rainfall, depleted reservoirs, and aging infrastructure.

unprecedented drought as water crisis hits Tehran\n\nIran - especially its capital, Tehran - is facing an unprecedented drought this autumn, with rainfall at record lows and reservoirs nearly empty. Officials are pleading with citizens to conserve water as the crisis deepens.\n\nPresident Masoud Pezeshkian has warned that if there is not enough rainfall soon, Tehran's water supply could be rationed. But he said that even rationing might not be enough to prevent a disaster.\n\n\"If rationing doesn't work,\" Pezeshkian said, \"we may have to evacuate Tehran.\"\n\nHis comments have prompted criticism in Iranian newspapers and on social media. Former Tehran mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi called the idea \"a joke\" and said \"evacuating Tehran makes no sense at all\".\n\nIran's meteorological officials say no rainfall is expected over the next 10 days.\n\nMeanwhile, the water crisis is already affecting daily life in the capital.\n\n\"I'm planning to buy water tankers to use for toilets and other necessities,\" a woman in Tehran told BBC Persian.\n\nIn the summer, Iranian rapper Vafa Ahmadpoor posted a video on social media showing a kitchen faucet with no running water.\n\n\"It's been four or five hours,\" he said. \"I've bought bottled water just to be able to go to the toilet.\"\n\nThe manager of the Latian Dam, one of Tehran's main water sources, says it now holds less than 10% of its capacity. The nearby Karaj Dam — which supplies water to both Tehran and Alborz provinces — is in a similarly dire condition.\n\n\"I have never seen this dam so empty since I was born,\" an elderly local resident told Iranian state TV.\n\nAccording to Mohammad-Ali Moallem, the manager of the Karaj Dam, rainfall has plummeted dramatically.\n\n\"We had a 92% decrease in rain compared to last year,\" he said. \"We have only eight per cent water in our reservoir — and most of it is unusable and considered 'dead water.'\"\n\nThe government is now pinning its hopes on late autumn rain, but forecasts are bleak. Iran's Minister of Energy, Abbas Ali Abadi, has warned the situation could soon force authorities to cut water supplies.\n\n\"Some nights we might decrease the water flow to zero,\" he said.\n\nOfficials have also announced plans to penalise households and businesses that consume excessive amounts of water.\n\nIran's energy minister Ali Abadi has said Tehran's water crisis is not only due to a lack of rainfall. He blamed water leakage caused by the capital's century-old water infrastructure and even pointed to the recent 12-day war with Israel.\n\nDuring that conflict, Israel targeted the northern Tehran neighbourhood of Tajrish on 15 June.  Afterwards videos showed heavy flooding in the area.\n\nThe day after the strike, the Israel Defence Forces said it had targeted Iranian military \"command centres\".\n\nBut the crisis extends far beyond the capital.\n\nThe head of Iran's National Centre for Climate and Drought Crisis Management, Ahmad Vazifeh, has warned that, apart from Tehran, dams in many other provinces — including West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Markazi — are also in a \"worrying state\", with water levels in the single-digit percentages.\n\nIn Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, officials are sounding the alarm as well.\n\nThe Governor of Khorasan Razavi Province in north-east Iran, said the water reserves in Mashhad's dams have dropped to \"less than eight percent,\" warning that the province faces a \"mega-challenge of drought.\"\n\nCEO of Mashhad's Water and Wastewater Company put the figure even lower.\n\n\"The storage level of the city's main dam is below three percent,\" Hossein Esmaeilian said.\n\n\"Only three percent of the combined capacity of Mashhad's four water-supplying dams — Torogh, Kardeh, Doosti, and Ardak — remains. Apart from Doosti Dam, the other three are out of operation.\"\n\nIran's water crisis has been decades in the making.\n\nEven Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly acknowledged the looming threat — speaking about water shortages in his Nowruz addresses in 2011 and on other occasions in the following years.\n\nYet little has changed.\n\nToday, Tehran, Karaj and Mashhad — home to more than 16 million people combined — are facing the real possibility of their taps running dry."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn9jwqzy8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"23:41:56.514+00:00","title":"‘Chaos has gone’ - quiet streets on Texas border after Trump crackdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In El Paso, Texas, the once chaotic US-Mexico border has become unusually quiet, with migrant encampments and detentions dropping to a 50-year low.

debate has spilled into the streets, sparking almost daily demonstrations while immigration agents ramp up arrests.\n\nBut in El Paso - a city in Texas on the US-Mexico border - the streets are unusually quiet.\n\nA year after the BBC last visited the border to understand the impact of the migrant crisis on the border, sites that were once teeming with migrants lay largely silent.\n\nJust a few years ago, as many as 2,500 migrants once camped outside the city's historic Sacred Heart Catholic church. Many lined the streets sleeping on donated blankets, idling while they waited for food and water to be distributed by local charities.\n\nNow, only a handful of parishioners can be seen coming in and out of the church.\n\nThe same is true of a nearby park and of shelters throughout the city, where migrants once huddled to exchange their experiences of trudging through jungles and deserts or being detained, robbed or nearly kidnapped on their long journeys through Latin America to the border.\n\nThe influx prompted El Paso's government to declare a state of emergency in late 2022 as local shelters ballooned beyond capacity.\n\nThen, when US President Donald Trump came into office in January - elected in part because of his promise to fix the border - the regular flow of migrants into El Paso slowed to a trickle.\n\nIt is a trend that has repeated itself along the length of the 1,900-mile (3,145km) border, from the Pacific Coast in California toTexas' Gulf coast.\n\nFigures for detentions of border crossers are at a 50-year low.\n\nIn September alone - the last month for which complete data is available - 11,647 people were detained along the entirety of the US-Mexico border, compared with 101,000 in September 2024 and 269,700 the same month in 2023.\n\nOne volunteer network, Annunciation House, once ran as many as 22 shelters throughout the region, catering in large part to thousands of migrants paroled into the US to await court dates, often years in the future.\n\nThere are now only two. The relative trickle of migrants - 15 to 20 in each location on a given night - is composed, in part, of those headed back home after years in the US.\n\n\"We have people who entered and were given employment authorisation, or temporary protected status that Trump has taken away, and they can't renew their employment. Then they can't pay rent,\" Annunciation House director Ruben Garcia told the BBC.\n\nOthers, he added, are simply in need of a place to stay while \"they can do the logistics\" of leaving the country.\n\nFor some along the border, the new reality comes as a relief.\n\nDemesio Guerrero, a naturalised US citizen originally from Mexico who lives in eastern Texas, described the border as \"chaos everywhere\" under the Biden administration.\n\n\"There were encampments everywhere along the border, with women, children and old people,\" he said. \"It was totally out of control.\"\n\nThat chaos had now gone, he said, because Trump had a vision for how to fix the problem and did it. \"He did what he had to do, where he had to do it.\"\n\nFor six straight months, administration officials say, not a single undocumented migrant who was arrested was released into the US. Many have been deported, while others remain in immigration detention.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem often declare that, for the first time in US history, the government has full \"operational control\" of the border.\n\nFor the White House, the figures represent a victory - fufilling a campaign promise that the president himself has touted as the one that led him back to the White House for a second term at a time when many Americans were concerned that Joe Biden had lost control.\n\n\"So far, this strategy has proven to be wildly successful,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the BBC. \"We're undoing the pro-illegal immigration policies from the Biden administration that allowed countless illegals into the country. We've secured the border.\"\n\nThe reasons for the low figures - which began falling in Biden's last year in office and rapidly accelerated under Trump - are complex.\n\nOfficials and experts point to a range of factors, including a Mexican crackdown on migrant flows north, the end of most humanitarian parole programmes, much tighter asylum restrictions and increased surveillance with the help of the US military.\n\nTrump's deportation drive in the US interior has also served as a deterrent to would-be migrants.\n\n\"Not many people are crossing the border, and not that many are even trying,\" one undocumented immigrant, who asked to remain anonymous, said.\n\n\"With Biden, people knew that sooner or later they would be able to come across and stay. It's not like that now.\"\n\nSome Trump supporters living in El Paso said that at times they feared for their safety, and accused the Biden administration of creating an atmosphere that endangered both local residents and migrants.\n\n\"We didn't feel comfortable going out by ourselves anymore,\" said Lorie Randazzo, a lifelong El Paso resident and the president of Greater El Paso Republican Women. \"Almost as soon as Biden hit office, it got bad.\"\n\nIt's not that we don't want the immigrants coming in, she added, but only the best ones, the ones who want to work.\n\nElizabeth Amy Posada, an El Paso native and a former aide to the local Republican congressman, said there used to be \"death everywhere\", referring to migrants dying in the desert or in the Rio Grande, and those who fell victim to cartels.\n\n\"Everyone should be happy about this [border security], no matter what their political persuasion.\"\n\nBut for others, Trump's border security drive brings mixed feelings.\n\nMany local conservatives are sympathetic to the plight of migrants. Other locals, vehemently opposed to Trump, say they understand the need for stronger border protections and recognise the important role that federal officers play in their communities.\n\n\"We absolutely live in the grey area here,\" said Marisa Limon Garza, the executive director of the Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, an El Paso non-profit that provides free and low-cost legal services to immigrants and refugees.\n\nAccording to Ms Garza, the prospect of long-time residents being removed from the country is particularly galling to border residents, many of whom have family on both sides of the border or come from immigrant families that came to the US generations ago.\n\nWhile Trump and other officials have repeatedly said that immigration officials are going after \"the worst of the worst\", data shows that is not the case.\n\nThe Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse - which tracks immigration data - found that just over 70% of the nearly 60,000 people held at the end of September had no criminal record. Many have been in the country for years.\n\n\"Now what we know to be true is that some people are waking up and realising they got scammed,\" said Ms Garza, referring to locals who voted for Trump.\n\n\"Realising that they screwed their families, their loved ones, and their neighbors… and now have to wrestle with that.\"\n\nRoss Barrera, a 29-year-veteran of the US Army and a Republican who lives in Rio Grande City, told the BBC that most people in his small border community are broadly in favour of strong border security, given that legal travel and commerce across close-knit US and Mexican towns continues unabated.\n\nBut Mr Barrera added that images of harsh immigration enforcement raids across the US \"upset a lot of people\" and have caused friction.\n\n\"That upsets me too,\" he said. \"People are human. It bothers people that the lady who's been here 20 years is getting deported, or the dad who's been here 40 years is getting deported.\"\n\nOthers are more blunt.\n\n\"There's a lot of people that are having second thoughts about the way they voted,\" said Jesse Fuentes, an activist in Eagle Pass, another town that found itself in the middle of America's border battle in mid-2023.\n\n\"But people are afraid to say or do anything.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07m2v1z4evo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"23:30:53.394+00:00","title":"Katie Razzall: A seismic moment that shows rift at top of BBC","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC is facing a seismic leadership crisis after the simultaneous resignations of its Director General, Tim Davie, and CEO of BBC News, Deborah Turness.

To lose both the director general and the CEO of BBC News at the same time is unprecedented. It's an extraordinary moment in the history of the BBC.\n\nIt can't be underestimated.\n\nOn the face of it, Tim Davie's resignation makes some sense.\n\nI have wondered for some time whether he was weighing up how much longer he wanted to stay in a job that is highly pressurised.\n\nThere have been occasions when I have interviewed him this year, as the controversies mounted, and he didn't seem his usual Tigger-ish self.\n\nIn his resignation statement he referenced \"the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times\".\n\nMy assessment is that the latest controversy felt one too many after a succession of crises (two Gaza documentaries, the Bob Vylan Glastonbury issue amongst them) and he didn't have enough oil in the tank for another fight.\n\nAs former head of BBC comms, John Shield put it to me \"the DG job is one of the hardest in public life\".\n\n\"It has been relentless for him. He is a very capable leader who has driven real change, but at some point it becomes unsustainably attritional.\"\n\nI'm told there was still real shock when Tim Davie shared his decision with colleagues over the weekend.\n\nDeborah Turness' statement makes clear she has resigned on a point of principle. With the ongoing controversy around the President Trump Panorama causing damage to the BBC, she said \"the buck stops with me - and I took the decision to offer my resignation to the director general last night\".\n\nBut, as with any resignation, and certainly with two, I can't help thinking there is more to this than meets the eye. And there is another story emerging about the functionality and make up of the BBC Board and its role in what has happened.\n\nIt appears there has been a rift between the Board and the news division with some arguing the BBC has, for too long, failed to address institutional bias inside the BBC and others questioning whether what's unfolded has been an orchestrated - and politicised - campaign against the corporation which has claimed two big scalps.\n\nFor the best part of a week, since the Telegraph first broke its story, I haven't been able to understand why the BBC did not get on the front foot in the face of a deluge of damaging headlines about claims of systemic bias.\n\nIt needed to divide the allegations into two distinct stories.\n\nThe first, about the edit of the Trump speech in the Panorama programme, needed addressing immediately. Either with a swift apology - or indeed a case made for why the BBC believed it had not mischaracterised the president's words.\n\nThat would have allowed the BBC to come out fighting more widely on behalf of its journalism. Remember, it was being accused of institutional bias. Of a lack of impartiality. Accusations that cut to the heart of its news operation.\n\nWith an apology for the mistake around the Panorama (or a robust defence), it could have gone on to try to refute the other claims about institutional bias.\n\nIt could have said that the BBC had already been taking action to ensure editorial impartiality, and had already acted, for example, on issues at BBC Arabic.\n\nInstead the BBC allowed the story to fester - and we ended up in a situation where the Trump White House was calling the BBC \"fake news\" and it had some traction.\n\nMy understanding from multiple sources inside the BBC is that a statement on Panorama had been ready to go for days.\n\nThe BBC planned to say on the Trump edit that it hadn't intended to mislead the public, but that in light of looking at it again, it believed there should have been some kind of white flash or wipe, to make clear to audiences that these were two distinct parts of the speech.\n\nI understand Deborah Turness became more and more angry and frustrated as the week went on because she was prevented by the Board from putting out that apology.\n\nInstead the BBC Board decided a letter to the Culture Media and Sport Committee was the way to go.\n\n(Others have told me it's not as clearcut as this characterisation. That it took some time for news bosses to accept the Panorama edit had been an error and that there were discussions on all sides on how to respond.)\n\nMany, both inside and outside the BBC, see the failure to respond as a grave mistake. The Telegraph's drip feed of allegations was damaging - and the BBC wasn't tackling them head on.\n\nI have been told that Turness then went into a board meeting on Thursday to discuss the crisis around the Telegraph stories and was \"ripped apart\", as some have described it.\n\nThose who have called the BBC's journalism into question would call that accountability.\n\nBut another source characterised it as the culmination of a \"relentless critique of BBC journalism over two years by members of the Board and advisers - all of whom come from same political persuasion\".\n\nThey point to Robbie Gibb, a former BBC editor who left to become Downing St director of communications for Theresa May and who is now a member of the Board.\n\nThe former Sun editor, now BBC presenter David Yelland has called it \"nothing short of a coup\". He claims the BBC Board has been undermined and \"elements close to it have worked with hostile newspaper editors, a former PM and enemies of public service broadcasting\".\n\nBut another former Sun editor, Kelvin MacKenzie, had a very different take. Speaking on the BBC News Channel, he said the resignations were \"the right thing to do - this was an issue that was never going away\".\n\nThe editing of the speech, he said, could have led to Trump suing or the BBC being banned from the White House. \"If you can't be trusted on that [the speech of the US president] what can you be trusted on?\" he said.\n\nAnd the US president himself has weighed into the debate for the first time. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he celebrated the resignations and accused the BBC of \"doctoring\" his speech and \"trying to step on the scales of a presidential election\".\n\nI'm struck by a line in Tim Davie's statement. He said this about the BBC: \"We should champion it, not weaponise it.\"\n\nTonight, some are asking whether the resignations of both the director general and the CEO of News suggests the BBC has been weaponised."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/07/us/flight-cancellations-airports.html","dateOfPublication":"0000-01-01","timeOfPublication":"00:00:00-00:00","title":"See Where Flights Have Been Canceled Across the U.S.","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hundreds of flights across the United States were canceled on Sunday, the third day of flight reductions due to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

Two Top BBC Leaders Quit Over Editing of Trump Documentary\n\nPublished: 2025-11-09T18:33:05-05:00\n\nTwo of the top executives of the BBC resigned abruptly on Sunday following a report suggesting the public service broadcaster had misleadingly edited a speech by President Trump that preceded the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nThe surprise resignation of the director general, Tim Davie, and Deborah Turness, the chief executive of BBC News, came several days after The Daily Telegraph published details of a leaked internal memo arguing that a BBC Panorama documentary had juxtaposed comments by Mr. Trump in a way that made it appear that he had explicitly encouraged the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Like all public organizations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable,” Mr. Davie said in a statement. “While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision.”\n\nMr. Davie added: “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility.”\n\nMs. Turness, in her announcement, said, “The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC — an institution that I love.”\n\nShe said that “the buck stops with me” and conceded that “mistakes have been made” but insisted that “recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.”\n\nMr. Trump welcomed the resignations in a post on his Truth Social account.\n\nWith about 21,000 employees, the BBC calls itself the world’s leading public service broadcaster, and is funded primarily from a license fee paid by Britons who watch TV, supplemented by commercial revenue. It produces a huge range of material, from news to entertainment, and has reach outside Britain through its international broadcasting operations.\n\nPressure had been building on Mr. Davie and senior management of the BBC after the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reacting to the leaked memo, accused the broadcaster of being “purposefully dishonest” over its depiction of the Capitol Hill insurrection.\n\nThe leaked memo was written by Michael Prescott, a former journalist who, until June, was an independent external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee. The documentary, called “Trump: A Second Chance?” was broadcast last year and, in one section, spliced together footage from comments Mr. Trump made about 50 minutes apart.\n\nMr. Prescott’s critique also included claims that the broadcaster did not cover stories that raised difficult questions about transgender rights, and that BBC Arabic gave a platform to a journalist who had posted antisemitic comments.\n\nMr. Davie was director general for five years  and survived a number of other crises at the broadcaster, earning the nickname “Teflon Tim.”\n\nThis year, the broadcaster was criticized for having failed to cut away during live coverage of the Glastonbury music festival when the performer Bob Vylan led the crowd in chants  against the Israeli military.\n\nOfcom, Britain’s media regulator, ruled this year that the BBC had committed a “serious breach” of broadcasting rules by failing to disclose that the narrator of a documentary about Gaza was the son of a Hamas official. And there were controversies over the behavior of several TV stars employed by the corporation.\n\nThe BBC’s senior leadership was widely expected to issue an apology in front of a parliamentary committee on Monday over the documentary about President Trump, and Mr. Davie appears to have calculated that his position was becoming untenable.\n\nSome of the BBC’s senior staff have said they believe that the broadcaster is under attack from partisan opponents.\n\n“It’s clear that there is a genuine concern about editorial standards and mistakes,” wrote Nick Robinson, a presenter on Today, the flagship morning radio show, on social media. “There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organization.”\n\nIn a statement issued after Mr. Davie’s resignation, Lisa Nandy, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, thanked him for his service, described the BBC as “one of our most important national institutions.”\n\nBut earlier on Sunday Ms. Nandy, in an interview with the BBC, said that decisions about the broadcaster’s editorial standards and guidelines, and the sort of language used in reporting, was “not always well thought through.” She added: “Often it’s left to individual journalists or newsreaders to make decisions.”\n\nIn a statement, Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, welcomed the resignations but added that Mr. Prescott’s report “exposed institutional bias that cannot be swept away with two resignations — strong action must be taken on all the issues it raised.”\n\nOn social media, Ms. Leavitt reacted to Mr. Davie’s resignation by posting screenshots of two news articles, the first reading “Trump goes to war with ‘fake news’ BBC,” the second from the broadcaster’s own website on Sunday reporting “Tim Davie resigns as BBC director general over Trump edit.”\n\nAbove the first article, Ms. Leavitt wrote: “Shot,” above the second, “Chaser.”\n\nIn response, Ed Davey, leader of Britain’s centrist Liberal Democrat party wrote, also on social media: “To see Trump’s White House claiming credit for his downfall and attacking the BBC should worry us all.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/us/politics/duffy-faa-air-travel-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:59:58-05:00","title":"Safety Officer or Administration Messenger?

Sean Duffy Juggles Roles in Shutdown.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-09T18:59:58-05:00\n\nAt the end of October, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had measured words about the government shutdown’s impacts on air travel thus far. The system had weathered the funding impasse better than expected, he said, despite air traffic controllers working for weeks unpaid.\n\nNevertheless, he warned there was the potential for “a disaster in aviation” in the near future. And within days, Mr. Duffy was taking action. He issued threats to shut down parts of the airspace and ordered a reduction of 10 percent of flights at 40 airports — a move that caught airlines, aviation experts and lawmakers by surprise.\n\nThe aggressive action comes as Mr. Duffy solidifies his status as one of the most visible faces of the Trump administration through the shutdown, which began more than a month ago. He has made near-daily appearances in news conferences and television interviews to highlight the plight of controllers working unpaid amid the impasse, while hammering Democrats to make a deal.\n\nAnd as he has juggled his dual roles of chief transportation safety officer and administration messenger on the shutdown, he has drawn accolades from those who see them as prudent and skepticism from those who question his motives.\n\nMr. Duffy has said his decision to reduce flight traffic resulted from the mounting challenge of keeping air traffic control facilities adequately staffed, combined with troubling F.A.A. assessments of how often planes were coming into dangerous proximity, as well as confidential filings from airline pilots.\n\nThe Transportation Department has declined to publicly release the data, and neither the department nor the F.A.A. responded to requests by The New York Times to disclose it.\n\n“Our 10 percent reduction is a data-driven decision made by nonpolitical safety experts at the F.A.A. who proactively presented their analysis and shared their concerns about the strain the system is currently seeing,” Nathaniel Sizemore, a spokesman for Mr. Duffy, said in a statement.\n\nThe major airlines have not objected to the order to cut flights, though according to one industry estimate, it could cost them $100 million a day. Officials from many airlines, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private communications, told The Times that they also had not yet seen the data Mr. Duffy has cited.\n\nHundreds of flights were canceled on Sunday, as the reductions continued. So far in November, flight delays have been tracking close to October, according to numbers provided by Cirium, an aviation data firm, on Saturday, with 18.71 percent of flights delayed.\n\nControllers have been calling out sick as missed paychecks force some to seek side jobs, leaving a number of air traffic facilities short-staffed, according to administration officials. Mr. Duffy’s moves also followed a particularly bad day of staffing and weather-related delays on Halloween that served as a warning of what might come if the shutdown continues into the busy holiday travel season.\n\n“We’re working overtime to make sure that it is safe to travel,” Mr. Duffy said in an appearance on CNN Sunday. He said the F.A.A.’s safety team had noticed disturbing trends and brought them to his attention, and noted that delays were likely to worsen.\n\n“The safety team looked at data, made a recommendation to me, and it’s a hard decision, but that’s what we’ve done to keep people safe,” he added. “This is not political; this is strictly safety.”\n\nBut Democrats have accused Mr. Duffy of exploiting his position to inflict tangible pain on the flying public as a way of trying to force Democrats to capitulate to the G.O.P. and end the shutdown.\n\n“This isn’t about safety — it’s about politics masquerading as safety,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said Saturday on the Senate floor. He called Mr. Duffy’s restrictions “a stunt.”\n\n“Instead of negotiating with Democrats to reopen the government, they’d rather ground flights,” Mr. Schumer added.\n\nThe air traffic controllers’ union has not taken a position on the air travel cutbacks, but some retired controllers say Mr. Duffy’s changes won’t make much of a difference to the professionals they are supposed to be helping.\n\n“It’s a pittance, 10 percent,” said Harvey Scolnick, a retired controller who spent part of his career in the tower at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens.\n\n“You can’t just pick 40 airports and say we’re going to reduce the traffic 10 percent, because that’s just not an efficient way to control delays,” he said, adding: “You think the controllers are going to look at that and feel bad and come to work? No, I don’t think so.”\n\nBefore the shutdown, some Democrats privately praised Mr. Duffy’s efforts to upgrade air safety and supercharge the hiring of new controllers. They noted that Mr. Duffy championed the controllers at a time when few in the Trump administration spoke out in support of federal workers.\n\nMr. Duffy inherited an air safety system under extreme stress. Even before the shutdown, most certified air traffic controllers were working mandated overtime shifts to make up for the fact that about 20 percent of their positions, nationally, were vacant. The controllers’ staffing woes worsened during the shutdown, as an uptick in absences put extra pressure on the controllers who did show up to work. Officials have warned attendance might flag even more as controllers face their second missed paycheck on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Duffy has been unequivocal about whom he blames for that state of affairs: Democrats, who are seeking the restoration of expiring health care subsidies.\n\n“We have done all we can to make sure we minimize disruption, that we keep the airspace safe,” Mr. Duffy said on Fox News Sunday. “I didn’t create the problem, it’s Senate Democrats who did.”\n\nBut some say his moves are not a solution.\n\n“It’s kind of ludicrous to say, because you’re going to give this controller two less airplanes, he’s not going to make a mistake,” said David Riley, a former controller and union representative, who retired five years ago after an air traffic career spent mostly in the Denver Airport tower.\n\n“They’re just creating a fake outrage to make the flying public feel this pain and hoping that the flying public then in turn contacts their elected officials and puts pressure on them to go to the table,” Mr. Riley said. “Air traffic controllers are being used as pawns in this game.”\n\nMr. Duffy has said that if the shutdown continues, he could be forced to increase the cuts to 15 or 20 percent of air traffic.\n\n“The problem is that as I try to reduce the problem by lowering flights, I have more controllers that keep not coming to work, and so the pressure goes back up again,” he said on CNN Sunday.\n\nA concerning number of experienced controllers have elected to retire during the shutdown, he said. “Yesterday, 18 to 22 controllers in Atlanta didn’t show up,” he added, noting that Saturday had seen a spike in so-called staffing triggers — that is, when controller absences hit a point that necessitates proactive delays.\n\nPart of what is driving critics’ skepticism is that Mr. Duffy has at times highlighted the F.A.A.’s most alarming-looking data without greater context.\n\nEven some of Mr. Duffy’s supporters say his warnings last week of impending “mass chaos” represented a worst-case scenario. But they defended his approach as strategic, and Mr. Duffy’s airport restrictions as vital.\n\n“His job is to plan for the worst and hope for the best,” Chris Sununu, the chief executive of Airlines for America, a trade group and a former New Hampshire governor, said in an interview last week. Mr. Sununu added in a statement Saturday: “Americans should have increased confidence in our airspace because the F.A.A. has taken these measures.”\n\nThe chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, a career Democrat, has also joined Republicans in praising Mr. Duffy for making a prudent move.\n\n“This is safety management, the very foundation of our aviation system,” Jennifer Homendy, the chair, wrote on social media, calling Mr. Duffy’s moves “the right thing to do.”\n\nAviation experts were of mixed minds about whether the transportation secretary’s moves were responsible.\n\n“The fact that you’re doing it now, and you’re doing it the way you’re doing it with the language that’s being used, tells me it’s as much politics as anything else,” said Bob Mann, an industry consultant and former airline executive.\n\nBut Greg Raiff, the chief executive of Elevate Aviation Group, a private charter and aviation logistics firm, said the secretary had little choice but to plan for a worst-case scenario.\n\n“All it will take is one mishap to think that the Secretary Duffy should have ordered a complete closure of the airspace,” Mr. Raiff said.\n\nNiraj Chokshi contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p4gjwmxko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"13:32:55.510+00:00","title":"What airports could reduce flights because of shutdown?

The cuts won't apply to international flights, but specific airlines may choose to also cancel some of those flights, too, the FAA said.\n\nThe rollout began Friday and created  chaos at airports across the countr y as panicked travellers awaited updates on their flights, more than 5,000 of which were cancelled or faced hours-longs delays.\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, that the decision to reduce flight capacity will take \"pressure\" out of the system.\n\nSeveral of the largest US airlines have said customers will be allowed to adjust their flights or cancel them pre-emptively for free.\n\nHere is what we know as the US makes the cuts\n\nFlights will be cut at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, in Georgia. Frequently ranked as the busiest airport in the world, it saw more than 108 million passengers get on and off flights there in 2024.\n\nAlong with the Atlanta airport, Dallas Fort Worth International, Denver International, Chicago O'Hare, and Los Angeles International are the five busiest airports in the US. All of them are expected to see flights reduced.\n\nThe FAA said the cancellations will be gradual. The cuts began on Friday with a 4% reduction in flights. The figure will rise to 6% by 11 November and 8% by 13 November, before hitting a full 10% by 14 November.\n\nHere is the full list.\n\nMajor airlines have raced to assure customers that they will not be caught for the costs of cancelled flights.\n\nIn a memo to staff that was shared with the BBC, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said any customer can get a refund on a flight, even if it isn't being cancelled, including customers with non-refundable tickets and basic economy tickets. United, the largest airline in the country, says that, in addition to waiving fees, it will also waive any fare differences on a rebooked flight.\n\nDelta Airlines has implemented a similar policy. allowing customer change, cancel or receive refunds for their flights, including those flying basic economy, without penalty.  If the rebooked flight occurs on or before 16 November, any difference in fare will be waived, the company said in a statement.\n\nAmerican Airlines will allow customers to change a flight or request a refund, without penalty, whether or not their specific flights have been cancelled. It does not mention if customers will have to pay a difference in fare on rebooked flights.\n\nSouthwest Airlines says that if customers' flights are cancelled, they can rebook or request a refund. For flights between 7 November and 12 November that have not been cancelled, customers can still rebook with no fee and without having to pay a fare difference, or they can request a refund.\n\nFrontier Airlines will let customers change or cancel their flights without a fee, but they will be required to pay any difference in fare on a rebooked flight.\n\nThe BBC has also reached out to Alaska Airlines and JetBlue."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyk7ylpd5o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:02:23.647+00:00","title":"Tim Davie: A 20-year BBC career that finally ran out of road","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tim Davie, the BBC's 17th Director General and a long-time executive with a 20-year career at the corporation, resigned in 2025 after a series of high-profile controversies, including editorial errors such as the misleading Panorama documentary involving Donald Trump, allegations of misconduct involving presenters like Huw Edwards, Gary Lineker, Gregg Wallace, and John Torode, and a controversial live broadcast of Bob Vylan’s Glastonbury performance.

end his 20-year career at the corporation.\n\nHe stepped down on Sunday  after saying \"mistakes were made\"  following criticism a Panorama documentary misled viewers by editing a speech by US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 58-year-old reached the top of the organisation in June 2020, when he was named the BBC's 17th director general.\n\nAt the time of his appointment, he said: \"I have a deep commitment to content of the highest quality and impartiality,\" and when he took the helm, said one of his top priorities would include negotiating with the government over the future of the licence fee.\n\nOne of the BBC's longest-serving executives, he first joined the broadcaster from Pepsi to become director of the Marketing, Communications & Audiences division in 2005.\n\nHe then took over responsibility for radio stations including Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4 as director of the Audio & Music division in 2008.\n\nA month after being named chief executive of the corporation's commercial arm BBC Worldwide in 2012, he stepped in to become acting director general after the resignation of George Entwistle.\n\nDavie returned to BBC Worldwide after Tony Hall was appointed as George Entwistle's permanent successor, with Davie overseeng the merger of BBC Worldwide with the BBC's production arm to form BBC Studios in 2018.\n\nAfter landing one of the most high-profile jobs in Britain - and globally - his tenure as director general saw huge challenges.\n\nFormer BBC media editor Amol Rajan described the job as \"hellish\"  when Davie first took over.\n\nAnd while Davie has won praise for successfully overseeing the BBC's move towards digital, putting measures in place to change its workplace culture and focusing on boosting the BBC's commercial success, overall, it's not been an easy ride.\n\nIn 2024, the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted charges of making indecent images of children.\n\nDavie told the press in September last year  that there was \"shock\" and \"a lot of upset\" within the BBC over Edwards, who had been the BBC's highest-paid journalist.\n\nThere was also controversy over comments made online by former Match of the Day host Gary Lineker.\n\nLineker left the BBC  sooner than planned in May 2025  after sharing a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult.\n\nDavie said at the time of Lineker's exit that the former footballer had \"acknowledged the mistake made\" but thanked the presenter and former footballer for \"his passion and knowledge\" in sports journalism.\n\nFurther scrutiny over his leadership came over the summer, as more unwelcome headlines dogged the corporation.\n\nThere was a crisis at BBC flagship series MasterChef, after both of its presenters -  Gregg Wallace and John Torode - were sacked  following a report which upheld allegations against them.\n\nAsked about poor workplace culture as he faced questions from the Culture, Media and Sport Committee,  Davie said he thought \"we're at a moment in society where we're calling it out\".\n\nDavie added he was \"not letting anything lie\" when it came to rooting out abuses of power within the corporation.\n\nThe spotlight also fell on Saturday night stalwart Strictly Come Dancing, with Davie  apologising to contestants after complaints of abusive behaviour on the show.\n\nThe BBC has also faced strong criticism for  a live broadcast of Bob Vylan's performance at the Glastonbury festival , during which the band's singer led crowds in chants of \"death, death to the IDF [Israel Defence Forces]\" and made other derogatory comments.\n\nDavie said that what had happened was \"deeply disturbing\", adding: \"The BBC made a very significant mistake broadcasting that.\"\n\nHe said that he had done the \"right thing\" at the time, by pulling it off the iPlayer and that the measures which have since been put in place would \"categorically prevent what happened\".\n\nDavie also said he thought  the corporation made the \"right decision\" to not air Gaza: Doctors Under Attack,  a controversial documentary which was later picked up by Channel 4.\n\nThe BBC shelved the programme due to impartiality concerns it had surrounding the production.\n\nEarlier in the year, a separate documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone, was pulled from iPlayer after it was found that the narrator was the son of a Hamas official.\n\nThe film, made by independent production company HOYO Films, was later found by a review to have  breached editorial guidelines on accuracy.\n\nThe BBC board also had to apologise  over \"missed opportunities\" to tackle \"bullying and misogynistic behaviour\" by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood.\n\nAn independent report into what the BBC knew about Mr Westwood's conduct was published in February, highlighting a series of incidents and allegations it said amount to a \"considerable body of evidence\" which it failed to investigate properly.\n\nWestwood, who has always denied claims of misconduct, has since  been charged with four counts of rape.\n\nDavie's tenure also included overseeing cuts to BBC local services which he defended as being \"the right thing\", but admitted were \"very difficult and unpopular\".\n\nHe's also had to deal with issues surrounding equal pay at the BBC.\n\nIt was only six months ago,  in a speech to civic and community leaders in Salford , that Davie insisted the BBC could help tackle a \"crisis of trust\" in British society.\n\nHe set out measures he said would allow the broadcaster to play a leading role in reversing a breakdown in trust in information and institutions, as well as tackling division and disconnection between people.\n\nBut in his resignation letter on Sunday, Davie said \"the BBC is delivering well but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility\".\n\nBBC chairman Samir Shah described Davie as \"a devoted and inspirational leader and an absolute believer in the BBC and public service broadcasting\".\n\n\"He has achieved a great deal,\" Shah added. \"Foremost, under his tenure, the transformation of the BBC to meet the challenges in a world of unprecedented change and competition is well under way.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lpgen877ko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"02:00:26.614+00:00","title":"Gurinder Chadha on Bend

Bollywood have to do with Christmas?\n\nI put this question to film director Gurinder Chadha and the answer, it turns out, is quite a lot.\n\n\"Bollywood is all about singing, dancing, joy,\" she said. \"So I think that for me, the idea of making a joyful Christmas film, with singing and dancing, it comes naturally for this time of year.\"\n\nAnd that's exactly what Chadha - best known for directing the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham - has just done.\n\nWith a cast including Kunal Nayyar, Hugh Bonneville, Pixie Lott, Boy George, Danny Dyer, Charithra Chandran and Eva Longoria, her new musical film Christmas Karma is a Bollywood spin on Charles Dickens' classic, A Christmas Carol.\n\nBut Chadha says it's also \"a British film\" celebrating a wide range of musical traditions.\n\nThe 65-year-old, who wrote and directed it, has also been busy working on her sequel to Bend It Like Beckham. This summer,  she confirmed to the BBC  that a revival is in the works.\n\nSpeaking to me at a central London hotel earlier this week, she indicated she was feeling the pressure to get it right.\n\n“I’m working on the characters. These are big boots to fill,” she said. “I don’t want to rush it. The last thing I want is people to go, 'it's not as good as the original'.”\n\nFirst published in 1843, A Christmas Carol tells the story of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, who hates Christmas, but is transformed after a series of ghostly visits.\n\nIn Christmas Karma, we are met with a modern-day Scrooge called Mr Sood, who goes on a similar journey of redemption.\n\nNayyar, best known for playing Raj in The Big Bang Theory, plays Mr Sood - but says he is nothing like Scrooge in real life. \"I love Christmas,\" he tells me. \"Who doesn't love Christmas? Of course I love Christmas.\"\n\nThe actor said he always celebrated Christmas growing up in New Delhi. \"Indians have a beautiful procurement to celebrate all festivals,\" he said.\n\nThe first ghost to visit Mr Sood is his former partner, Jacob Marley, played by Paddington and Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville.\n\nHe's also visited by American singer and actor Billy Porter, who acts as The Ghost of Christmas Present.\n\nPorter says that up until this film, he was \"definitely\" more of a Scrooge.\n\nBut Bonneville professes to be a huge Christmas fan. He also rejects suggestions that November is too early for a festive film to come out in cinemas.\n\n\"I used to be Bah Humbug about it, and want Christmas decorations to go up on, frankly, Boxing Day, but I'm getting earlier and earlier,\" he said.\n\n\"Although I do draw the line at certain Christmas songs being played too early, I think they should be banned.\"\n\nAs a sidenote, I had to ask Bonneville about whether he's planning to go and see  the new Paddington musical . \"I'm going next week,\" he told me. \"I'm looking forward to seeing that equally timeless story being told.\"\n\nIn Christmas Karma, Mr Sood is depicted as being among the 28,000 Ugandan Asian refugees  who came to the UK in 1972  after being given 90 days to leave the African country by military dictator Idi Amin.\n\nIn later life, we see Mr Sood being dismissive of refugees seeking asylum in the UK. \"The rich ones always forget their roots,\" one bystander remarks.\n\nBut after being guided by the ghosts of Christmas - played by Eva Longoria, Billy Porter, and Boy George - Mr Sood reconnects with his past.\n\nChadha says the inspiration for her Scrooge came from a “Grinch-like” family member who used to criticise them for celebrating Christmas. “‘I don’t know why you’re all doing this. You’re not white’,” she says he would tell them.\n\nLater, she came to understand that, like Mr Sood, he was “carrying the trauma” of having been forced to leave his home country as a child.\n\nBut she also says she was inspired by certain politicians.\n\n“It also made sense to me to make my Sood say slightly right-wing things, because when I was writing it [during lockdown], we did have a government that had members of the Asian community who would have a similar background,” she said.\n\nFor Leo Suter, who plays Mr Sood's underpaid employee Bob Crachett, there’s an important message he hopes people take away from the film.\n\n“Dickens's work has lasted… a very long time, because of the message at the core of it.

Reding Quiñones — to pursue long-promised charges of a “grand conspiracy” against President Trump’s adversaries.\n\nTheir theory of the case, still unsupported by the evidence: A cabal of Democrats and “deep-state” operatives, possibly led by former President Barack Obama, has worked to destroy Mr. Trump in a yearslong plot spanning the inquiry into his 2016 campaign to the charges he faced after leaving office.\n\nBut that narrative, which has been promoted in general terms by Mr. Trump and taken root online, has emerged in a nascent but widening federal investigation.\n\nLast week, Mr. Reding Quiñones, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, issued more than two dozen subpoenas, including to officials who took part in the inquiry into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nAmong them, they said, were James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; Peter Strzok, a former F.B.I. counterintelligence agent who helped run the Russia investigation; and Lisa Page, a former lawyer at the bureau.\n\nThe investigation in Florida appears to focus, for now, on a January 2017 intelligence community assessment about Russian interference in the 2016 election, particularly the role played by John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, in drafting the document.\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr. Brennan has received a similar request to turn over records to investigators. But over the past two months, the investigation into his actions has widened to encompass other actions in a broader time frame, according to officials with knowledge of the situation.\n\nMr. Reding Quiñones did not return a request for comment. Mr. Brennan’s lawyer had no comment.\n\nThe investigation started earlier this year after criminal referrals to the Justice Department by top Trump intelligence officials. It was assigned to David Metcalf, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, who was given special authority to scrutinize and possibly prosecute Mr. Brennan, according to four people with knowledge of his actions who requested anonymity to discuss an open matter.\n\nMr. Metcalf, a veteran prosecutor who held senior Justice Department positions during the first Trump administration, was given a relatively narrow mandate in his authorization, limited to examining Mr. Brennan’s work on the intelligence assessment in 2017. He struggled to advance a case that was regarded as weak by current and former department officials.\n\nIt is not clear if Mr. Metcalf believed a prosecution of Mr. Brennan was viable. But he never got the chance to complete his work.\n\nThis fall, senior Justice Department officials transferred the investigation from Mr. Metcalf to Mr. Reding Quiñones, as part of a decision to greatly expand the scope of the Brennan investigation into other, unspecified activities, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nThat kind of internal maneuvering, once highly unusual, has become commonplace under Mr. Trump, who has personally and publicly directed top department officials to go after people he reviles, often over the objections of experienced investigators who have found insufficient evidence to proceed.\n\nIn September, Mr. Trump installed an inexperienced White House lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, to bring charges against James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, in Alexandria, Va., for lying to and obstructing Congress, after her Trump-appointed predecessor had refused to do so. Last week, the federal magistrate judge handling the case accused prosecutors of trying “to indict first, investigate second.”\n\nThe Florida subpoenas seek documents or communications related to the intelligence community assessment from July 1, 2016, through Feb. 28, 2017, according to people familiar with them. It commands the recipients to provide them to prosecutors in Miami by Nov. 20.\n\nSome of the people who have reviewed the subpoenas said they did not mention specific crimes being investigated. Most federal crimes have a five-year statute of limitations, and offenses must be charged in a venue where the conduct occurred. It is not clear how the preparations of the intelligence assessment, which took place in and around Washington, would be connected to Florida, apart from Mr. Trump’s residence there.\n\nWhether the subpoenas will lead to charges, much less to convictions, is impossible to know. But merely creating an aura of criminality around Trump foes by celebrating incremental prosecutorial moves is a trophy in itself to die-hard Trump supporters, who have said that naming and shaming targets is a legitimate aim of law enforcement.\n\n“Justice is coming,” Mike Davis, an influential former Republican Senate staff aide who has prodded the Justice Department to use Florida as an arena for anti-Trump conspiracy cases, wrote on social media on Friday. His message was accompanied by a photo of himself with a smiling Mr. Reding Quiñones.\n\nMr. Reding Quiñones, a military veteran, has pursued his mandate to hunt down Mr. Trump’s foes with a gung-ho attitude that has endeared him to the president and the small but influential cadre of loyalists pushing hardest for prosecutions.\n\nRight-wing activists believe he has broad jurisdiction to bring a wide array of charges involving investigations into Mr. Trump, because Mar-a-Lago, the president’s private club and residence in Palm Beach, Fla., is in his district.\n\nAsked for comment, Chad Gilmartin, a Justice Department spokesman, praised the work of Mr. Reding Quiñones and Mr. Metcalf.\n\n“While we do not confirm or comment on the existence of specific investigations, the American people should know that this department will continue to follow the facts and pursue justice in every case,” he said in a statement.\n\nPeople familiar with the nascent inquiry say there have been signs in recent days that it is ramping up.\n\nThe Justice Department, for example, has begun to recruit line prosecutors in Florida to work on the case, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Mr. Reding Quiñones has also moved his office’s national security unit out of its traditional home inside the criminal division, the person said. Prosecutors in the office read that move as an effort to create a stand-alone section that could potentially house the prosecutors assigned to the new investigation.\n\nThe 2017 intelligence assessment said that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had ordered a multifaceted information operation targeting the U.S. presidential election. That included hacking Democratic emails and releasing them, as well as seeding social media with messages promoting Mr. Trump and denigrating his rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Trump and his allies have long chafed at a judgment in the assessment, which stated that Mr. Putin aspired to improve Mr. Trump’s chances of winning — not just sow chaos and undermine Mrs. Clinton.\n\nEfforts to bring charges against Mr. Brennan or others involved in the Russia inquiry are almost certain to run into serious hurdles.\n\nTwo previous investigations — one by the Justice Department’s inspector general and the other by the special counsel John H. Durham — have already scrutinized the actions of law enforcement and intelligence officials and found no evidence to support charges against high-level officials like Mr. Brennan.\n\nThe statute of limitations would also likely be an issue. The intelligence assessment occurred nearly nine years ago. The Russia inquiry ended in 2019, when the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III issued a report.\n\nStill, influencers like Mr. Davis have floated theories about how federal prosecutors could extend the statute of limitations. They have claimed, without providing evidence, that the August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago, during which the F.B.I. found reams of highly sensitive classified documents, was somehow connected to the Russia investigation.\n\nIf that seemingly far-fetched notion were somehow proven true, it could push the statute of limitations until at least 2027.\n\nIn their efforts to connect the Mar-a-Lago search to the Russia inquiry and other investigations into Mr. Trump, Trump-aligned influencers and right-wing media figures have seized on an internal F.B.I. memo made public last week in the case of Mr. Comey.\n\nThe document, dated from July, recorded the opening of an investigation into the discovery of Trump-related records three months earlier inside Room 9582 at the bureau’s Washington headquarters, a space designed for the storage of highly sensitive materials.\n\nThe records, found in so-called burn bags and “presumably intended for destruction,” the memo said, included printouts of investigative records and at least one page of handwritten notes, including materials related to the Russia inquiry, Mr. Durham’s investigation and the Mar-a-Lago search.\n\nAdam Goldman contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/business/trump-administration-states-undo-full-snap-food-stamps.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"00:56:00.552Z","title":"Trump Administration Demands States ‘Undo’ Work to Send Full Food Stamps","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a record-long government shutdown in 2025, the Trump administration issued a directive requiring states to immediately reverse any actions that provided full benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), threatening financial penalties for non-compliance.

That guidance threatened to impose harsh financial penalties on states that did not “comply” quickly with the new federal orders.\n\nThe memo surprised, vexed and frustrated many state leaders, and by Sunday, some had begun to explore their legal options to prevent any further disruptions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. But the Trump administration held firm in its refusal to fund food stamps in full, telling a court in a strongly worded filing that states would be “responsible for the consequences” of their actions.\n\nCaught in the middle were the roughly one in eight Americans who depend on monthly federal assistance to purchase groceries — aid that has been imperiled for days in a record-long shutdown. Multiple lawsuits to loosen that money remained unresolved, leaving many families at growing risk of hunger and financial hardship.\n\nSome of the 42 million people enrolled in SNAP began to receive their full benefits on Friday, after a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to fully fund the program this month amid the shutdown. New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were among states that raced to release the aid to residents, some of whom had been without nutrition assistance for days.\n\nSoon after, though, the Supreme Court temporarily paused the judge’s order so that an appeals court could further review it, leaving the entire program in legal limbo. That review was still underway by Sunday night, and the outcome could determine whether the government must tap its ample reserves — totaling into the tens of billions of dollars — to preserve full SNAP benefits this month.\n\nThe Agriculture Department did not respond to a request for comment. The White House budget office also did not respond.\n\nRepresentative Angie Craig of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, said in a statement that she believed that the Trump administration was “demanding that food assistance be taken away from the households that have already received it.”\n\n“They would rather go door to door, taking away people’s food, than do the right thing and fully fund SNAP for November so that struggling veterans, seniors, and children can keep food on the table,” she said.\n\nThe legal wrangling punctuated an anxious weekend for low-income Americans around the country who rely on food stamps. Many reported delays or difficulties in getting their benefits — if they received them at all — impinging on their ability to buy groceries.\n\nEven in states that had raced to furnish full benefits in the short window before the Supreme Court intervened, some families had yet to receive any payments and were unsure when they would arrive.\n\n“I’m still struggling to eat,” said Tyrone Green, a 25-year-old student in Niagara Falls, N.Y., who normally receives about $127 each month under SNAP.\n\nBy Sunday, friends of hers had received their benefits in New York, which started to release funds on Friday before the Supreme Court weighed in. But Ms. Green said she was not due to receive her allotment until Tuesday. She said she had already skipped meals and borrowed money from friends.\n\nEven for those who did receive food stamps, there was still a fear that the money might not be available when they needed it.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Jeanne Nihart, 44, of Anoka, Minn., received a text message from a friend, who said she had received her food stamp payments for the month. Ms. Nihart immediately logged into an app that allows people enrolled in the program to track their benefits.\n\nAfter app crashes, login difficulties and about an hour of waiting, Ms. Nihart saw that she had received her full monthly benefit of $436, covering both her and her daughter. She said it came as a surprise, as she thought her payment might be delayed for weeks.\n\n“I had never, until this shutdown, ever worried about SNAP not being funded before,” she said.\n\nThe food stamp program is federally funded but largely managed by states. To provide benefits, states send files to processors, which administer the electronic benefit transfer system, known as E.B.T. These vendors then make the funds available on E.B.T. cards, which are the primary way that SNAP recipients purchase groceries.\n\nIn its guidance, the Agriculture Department late Saturday said states may not send E.B.T. processors the files that would be required to provide full benefits. Rather, the agency said states must only send files for “partial” benefits, meaning that food stamp recipients would see their payments substantially cut.\n\n“To the extent states sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” wrote Patrick A. Penn, a top official at the Agriculture Department. “Accordingly, states must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n\nDavid A. Super, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, said it would not be “legal” for the government to claw back benefits that it had already provisioned without affording people due process.\n\nBut, Mr. Super added, the federal government sought to thwart the states that hadn’t completed their work to release full SNAP allotments to low-income families. He said the memo could serve to “scare states partway along the process, and it’s telling the states to turn back.”\n\nIn the hours after receiving the memo, some state leaders either publicly refused to comply with the Trump administration or threatened to fight its orders, citing the financial harm that it might inflict on their residents.\n\n“No,” Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, said in a statement. He said his state would continue to fight “against the Trump administration’s efforts to yank food assistance away from Wisconsin’s kids, families, and seniors.”\n\nWisconsin officials also criticized the federal government on Sunday for trying to obstruct some of the complicated, behind-the-scenes transactions that help to reimburse grocers that accept SNAP. They brought it to the attention of a federal judge in Massachusetts who is considering a request by roughly two dozen states, including Wisconsin, to force the Trump administration to restore all SNAP funds.\n\nAs part of that lawsuit, state leaders also asked the judge on Saturday to shield them from any federal punishment over their handling of food stamps during the current period of legal uncertainty. In a filing, they pointed to a series of conflicting instructions from the Agriculture Department, which at one point had signaled that it was preparing to release the funds for full food stamp payments after all.\n\nLawyers for the Justice Department strongly opposed the states’ request in a formal reply to the court on Saturday. Their filing came as the Trump administration also ratcheted up its threats to punish local officials for allocating full food stamp payments.\n\nIn its memo, the Agriculture Department said that states could lose access to some federal money to manage the SNAP program if they failed to comply, and may be “liable” for funding full benefits that the federal government did not authorize.\n\n“The cruelty is the point,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who leads her party on the chamber’s top agriculture committee. In a post on Sunday on social media, she added: “It is their choice to do this.”\n\nSonia A.

require support from state lawmakers in Albany.\n\nOn Saturday, Gov. Kathy Hochul raised doubts about one of his signature proposals — making city buses free.\n\nMs. Hochul, who controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that operates the city’s public transit, told reporters in San Juan, P.R., that she was not ready to move forward with his plan and that she would prefer to subsidize fares only for low-income riders.\n\n“I cannot set forth a plan right now that takes money out of a system that relies on the fares of the buses and the subways,” she said. “But can we find a path to make it more affordable for people who need help? Of course we can.”\n\nHer comments came after Ms. Hochul and Mr. Mamdani, both Democrats, struck a tone of unity at an annual gathering in Puerto Rico for New York’s political class. Ms. Hochul praised Mr. Mamdani and said that she was looking forward to working with him on issues like universal child care.\n\n“It’s a new day in New York,” Ms. Hochul said at a labor breakfast earlier in the day. “I am so proud that this individual is going to work with me shoulder to shoulder to deliver for New York City the way it’s never seen in its lifetime.”\n\nMr. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, ran on three straightforward promises: free buses, universal free child care and a rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments. The first two would need support from the state; the third he could probably do on his own.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Mamdani, Dora Pekec, said in a statement, “The mayor-elect looks forward to working with the governor to fund and deliver on our popular affordability agenda, including universal child care and fast and free buses.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Ms. Hochul, Jen Goodman, said on Sunday that discussions were continuing on all of Mr. Mamdani’s proposals.\n\n“The governor is focused on achieving universal child care and will continue to have ongoing conversations on other proposals, including making transit more accessible and affordable, while ensuring the M.T.A. has the resources it needs to serve New Yorkers,” she said.\n\nMaking city buses free could cost more than $800 million per year. Ms. Hochul told reporters on Saturday that she had been a “great champion of public transit.”\n\nMs. Hochul said she was preparing to make child care a priority during the state legislative session that starts in January. She said the program could cost $15 billion annually statewide, and that she was looking at phasing it in over time, starting with 2-year-olds or neighborhoods with the most need. Mr. Mamdani has proposed free child care for all New York City children ages 6 weeks to 5 years.\n\nMs. Hochul said she had to balance the demand for new programs with the reality of federal funding cuts from Washington.\n\n“It’s kind of a collision course right now,” she said. “Our ambitions are big, and I believe in them, and I want to accomplish them.”\n\nMs. Hochul, who endorsed Mr. Mamdani in September, said she had been having conversations with him that “led to an understanding of what’s in the realm of possibility.” They had “shared ambitions,” she said, “but what is doable is the question.”\n\nJanno Lieber, the M.T.A. chairman, has also expressed concerns about the cost of making buses free and said poor New Yorkers should come first.\n\n“I want to make sure that people of limited income get priority in this discussion, and we’re not just giving a ton of money to people who are riding the 104 on the Upper West Side,” he said in a recent interview on NY1.\n\nJohn Samuelsen, the international president of the Transport Workers Union, which represents bus drivers, said in San Juan that he supported Mr. Mamdani’s free bus plan and that it was worth the cost, especially when so many riders already skip the fare.\n\n“I don’t think Hochul understands how easy it is to say yes,” he said, adding that the city could try to make some buses free on its own.\n\nMr. Mamdani and Ms. Hochul also disagree over whether to raise income taxes. When they appeared together at a rally on Thursday, Ms. Hochul was greeted with chants of “tax the rich,” to which she responded, “I’m the type of person — the more you push me, the more I’m not going to do what you want.”\n\nMs. Hochul said she was listening, and later told reporters: “I’m from Buffalo. We don’t put up with a lot of crap.”\n\nThe governor said she would meet with Mr. Mamdani soon to discuss the prospect of President Trump sending a surge of immigration agents or the National Guard into New York City after Mr. Mamdani takes office. She said she appreciated that Mr. Mamdani had said he would keep Jessica Tisch, the police commissioner, as she had recommended.\n\nMs. Hochul said she had spoken to Ms. Tisch about staying and believed that she would.\n\n“I really don’t want to speak for her, but I wouldn’t be standing here saying I think she’ll be the next commissioner if I didn’t think so,” she said.\n\nBenjamin Oreskes contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/us/politics/mark-wolf-federal-judge-resigns.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:05:31-05:00","title":"Federal Judge, Warning of ‘Existential Threat’ to Democracy, Resigns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal Judge Mark L.

He accused Mr. Trump of “using the law for partisan purposes, targeting his adversaries while sparing his friends and donors from investigation, prosecution, and possible punishment.”\n\nThe judge, Mark L. Wolf, wrote in The Atlantic magazine that Mr. Trump’s actions were “contrary to everything that I have stood for in my more than 50 years in the Department of Justice and on the bench.”\n\nThe publication of the essay by Judge Wolf, 78, came two days after an announcement by the Federal District Court for Massachusetts that he was leaving his post as a senior-status judge.\n\nAn appointee of President Ronald Reagan who also served in the Justice Department during the Ford administration, Judge Wolf offered one of the most explicit expressions of concern for the rule of law to come from a member of the federal judiciary amid Mr. Trump’s efforts to vastly expand the scope of presidential power.\n\nHis seat on the court was filled by Judge Indira Talwani, a nominee of President Barack Obama, in 2014, after he stepped down from active service to senior status, a form of semi-retirement.\n\nIn a phone interview, Judge Wolf said he had resigned not only to speak more freely about his own views, but also those of colleagues who were still on the bench. “I hope to be a spokesperson for embattled judges who, consistent with the code of conduct, feel they cannot speak candidly to the American people,” he said.\n\nLower court judges have repeatedly issued rulings blocking Mr. Trump’s initiatives, provoking an aggressive response from administration officials who have accused them of engaging in partisan politics, going as far to call for some of them to be impeached.\n\nIn many cases, those judges have seen their decisions effectively reversed on a preliminary basis by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Responding to a New York Times questionnaire, dozens of lower-court federal judges — including some nominated by Mr. Trump — criticized the role that those emergency rulings by the Supreme Court, on the so-called shadow docket, have played in the ongoing conflict between the judiciary and the executive branch.\n\n“There are judges who anonymously expressed concerns about the unreasoned decisions on the shadow docket, which I also expressed in this article,” he said.\n\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said that judges who sought to “inject their own personal agenda into the law have no place on the bench.” She added, “Any other radical judges that want to complain to the press should at least have the decency to resign before doing so.”\n\nTrump-aligned legal figures echoed that sentiment. Robert Luther III, a professor at Antonin Scalia Law School who helped choose judicial nominees as a lawyer in the office of the White House counsel’s during Mr. Trump’s first administration, said he hoped other judges engaged in what he called “anti-Trump activism” would follow Judge Wolf’s lead and leave the bench. “Step right up, please!” he wrote on social media.\n\nJudge Wolf had a long and storied career on the federal bench. As the Massachusetts district’s chief judge, he presided over the trial of the Boston mobster James (Whitey) Bulger and wrote a 661-page opinion detailing misconduct by the F.B.I. related to Mr. Bulger, who had been a confidential informant.\n\nIn 2023, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he raised questions about the judiciary’s handling of Justice Clarence Thomas’ decision not to disclose lavish gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms.\n\nThe code of conduct for federal judges requires that they “act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary,” a rule that has been interpreted to limit their public statements. In a letter last week to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio asked that the judges who responded to the Times questionnaire be investigated for potentially violating that rule.\n\nBut in the eyes of Judge Wolf and other judges who have put warnings in their opinions, the actions of the administration deserve urgent scrutiny. In addition to claiming unilateral powers to spend, deport, and kill, Mr. Trump’s administration has also undertaken a far-reaching campaign to investigate and prosecute the president’s adversaries.\n\nJudge Wolf, who served in the Justice Department in the years after the Watergate scandal, wrote that Mr. Trump was “routinely and overtly” doing what President Nixon had done “episodically and covertly.”\n\nHe cited a social media post by Mr. Trump that called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute James Comey, the former F.B.I. director; Senator Adam Schiff of California, and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Mr. Comey and Ms. James were subsequently indicted, and investigations of senior intelligence officials from the Obama administrations were also said to be underway.\n\n“Americans proudly say that we live in the longest-lived democracy in the world,” Judge Wolf said in the interview. “But that should teach us that all the others failed.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/arts/design/trump-national-center-civil-human-rights.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"05:00:07-05:00","title":"As Trump Recasts History, a Civil Rights Museum Sticks to a Messy Past","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta is reopening after a $58 million renovation, presenting an unvarnished, immersive account of American civil rights history.

Black candidates are elected to public office. Institutions of higher learning, like Morehouse College and Atlanta University, are established to serve Black students. The Greenwood District of Tulsa, Okla., emerges as a hub of prosperity known as Black Wall Street.\n\nThen, the exhibit abruptly shifts.\n\nGreenwood is shown ravaged by fire and bloodshed in an outbreak of racial violence. Across the South, white leaders orchestrate a web of laws that enforce segregation, block access to the polls and keep would-be Black politicians out of positions of power for generations.\n\n“It’s the story of Black progress and white backlash,” said Kama Pierce, the chief program officer and curator of the exhibit at the center in Atlanta, which is reopening on Saturday after a $58 million overhaul and expansion. “We feel like we’re still in this cycle in this country.”\n\nIt is not lost on the center’s leaders that a museum devoted to the push and pull of the country’s fitful civil rights history is reopening at a moment when President Trump has used the force of the federal government to dismantle diversity programs and promote a sunnier version of America’s story.\n\nFor several years there had been widespread pressure for cultural institutions to wrestle with the enduring reach of racism after the murder of George Floyd. The pendulum has now swung in the other direction.\n\nThis year the president issued an executive order assailing a “revisionist movement” that “deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame.” His administration has sought to scrub the Smithsonian Institution of “divisive or ideologically driven language” and replace it with “unifying” descriptions. The leader of the National Portrait Gallery stepped down after the president attacked her public comments about racial and gender inequality.\n\nThe work of preserving and amplifying civil rights history in the Deep South has always been fraught. But museum officials and civic leaders in Atlanta said providing an unvarnished depiction of the movement required a renewed level of perseverance in the current climate.\n\n“We learn from our history — some of it we celebrate, some of it we grieve over,” said Shirley Franklin, a former mayor of Atlanta and longtime champion of the center, which first opened in 2014. “The stories always needed to be told,” she said, adding that now “the challenge of telling these stories might be greater, but institutions like the center have an opportunity to fill the gap.”\n\nThe museum’s curators said their intention was to neither sensationalize nor sanitize history, but to still have it resonate in a visceral way. To achieve that, they have relied heavily on documentary evidence including photographs and video, statements from participants in important events, and contemporaneous accounts from journalists.\n\nAmong the changes is an update to one of the museum’s most popular, and most emotionally taxing, exhibits: a simulation of a sit-in protest at a diner. Visitors perch themselves on stools, put on headphones and place their hands on the counter while listening to taunting and threatening voices.\n\nNow visitors are introduced to the intensive training that demonstrators went through, instilling the need to stick together and remain unflappable. Built-in tissue dispensers were also added, in recognition of how many people walk away shaken and tearful — often before the one-minute, 25-second recording ends.\n\nThe museum also created a larger space dedicated to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose papers the museum has exclusive rights to display. King’s daughter Bernice curated the first of the rotating exhibits. It includes some handwritten correspondence and is focused on lessons on civil disobedience and her father’s broader activism on improving economic opportunity and working conditions and challenging the Vietnam War.\n\nMuseum leaders said they refrained from too much interpretation in the exhibits to encourage visitors to draw their own conclusions.\n\n“We don’t exaggerate the sins any more than we exaggerate the triumphs,” said Jill Savitt, the center’s chief executive.\n\n“We’re not putting our thumb on the scale,” she added. “But we’re telling you what the rights are. We’re telling you where in the world people have felt those rights weren’t being respected, and how they mobilized around it.”\n\nThe funding for the renovation came largely from private sources, including the foundations of wealthy patrons and large corporations, as well as from the city of Atlanta. With the new offerings, including vastly expanded event space, the center is seeking new revenue streams to insulate it from a harsher landscape.\n\nIt does not directly rely on federal support, yet it has still felt the squeeze as the Trump administration slashed funding for arts and humanities. As nonprofits scramble to replace money from lost grants, there is more competition for financial help from independent foundations.\n\nSome have argued that Atlanta’s history, as King’s home base and a nucleus for the civil rights movement, demands it maintain a certain steadfastness, even if it comes at a cost. Mayor Andre Dickens has continued with diversity, equity and inclusion programs despite a federal imperative to disavow them.\n\nChoices such as those have been cast as an extension of an unwritten compact reached generations ago by Atlanta’s political, business and religious leaders to prioritize the pursuit of shared prosperity over racial divisions.\n\nThe “Atlanta Way,” as it is known, has been an imperfect bargain. It did not entirely spare the city from deep imbalances rooted in racism and could be deployed as a shiny veneer to paper over entrenched problems. Still, it is widely credited as fueling Atlanta’s success as a capital of commerce and culture.\n\nThe National Center for Civil and Human Rights is a manifestation of that mind-set.\n\nThe museum shares a parking deck with the World of Coca-Cola and the Georgia Aquarium, two of the city’s most popular attractions. It was built on land donated by the Coca-Cola Company, and other major corporations and philanthropies in Atlanta have been consistent backers, including the family foundation of Arthur M. Blank, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot.\n\nThe center was also designed to join a cluster of offerings that have made Atlanta a destination for soaking up civil rights history, including the national park encompassing King’s birthplace and the old sanctuary of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he was pastor.\n\n“We see ourselves as a beacon for those kinds of values,” said Fay Twersky, the president of the Blank Family Foundation.\n\nMuseum leaders wanted the exhibits to make clear that their themes are not distant history, but also part of the present.\n\nThe center’s mandate covers the broader umbrella of human rights, including disability rights, L.G.B.T.Q. issues and the work to ensure access to basic human needs, like food and water. More attention has been paid to women and gay people, namely the pioneering activists Dorothy Height and Bayard Rustin.\n\nCurators have also dedicated more space to Black empowerment. A modern take on a jukebox was installed to play songs reflecting that collective pride, like James Brown’s “Say It Loud — I’m Black and I’m Proud.”\n\nAn elaborate interactive section is being added for children, who had been unserved by past iterations. A secret passage behind a bookcase leads them to a lair for “change agents,” where they learn about the influence of young people in activist movements.\n\nMuch of the history the museum covers is despairing, but its leaders want it to be threaded with hope. After all, unsteady progress is still progress. One display has small cards highlighting ways for visitors to become more civically involved, like volunteering with groups helping refugees or supporting local news organizations.\n\nFor those unhappy with how things are, the museum has a message: Be engaged, but also be patient. Something different will emerge soon enough.\n\n“No matter where you stand, it’s reform and resistance,” Savitt said.\n\n“You can believe the reforms are positive reforms or negative, but we’re telling a story about that forward march and push back,” she added. “That’s the story of America.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/us/politics/democrats-midterms-senate-house.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"05:01:51-05:00","title":"Where Democrats Will Duel Next for the Party’s Future","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Democratic Party is undergoing a profound ideological and generational realignment, with progressive candidates challenging moderate incumbents in key Senate and gubernatorial races in 2025 and 2026.

In battleground states, they have recruited, elevated and cleared the field for candidates they believe will be the strongest nominees. Some of that has still happened this year, in states like Ohio and North Carolina.\n\nDemocrats may be united in opposition to Mr. Trump and around the issue of affordability, but the Democratic base is deeply unhappy with its leaders in Washington.\n\nAn impatient next generation of ambitious politicians is ratcheting up the pressure on the old guard. These Democrats are chafing over style, substance and strategy — just as the party’s ideological direction is at an inflection point.\n\nSo far, Mr. Sanders himself has endorsed Senate candidates in Michigan and Maine, holding rallies in both states and joking in Kalamazoo, Mich., that he was there for the selfish reason that he gets “lonely” in the left wing of the Senate. “I need some friends,” he told the crowd.\n\n“I’d like 99 more friends,” Mr. Sanders deadpanned in the interview when asked how many allies he was hoping to add. “Probably not going to happen tomorrow.”\n\nStill, national progressives see 2026 as a rare opportunity to assert their power. Moderates warn that nominating more stridently liberal candidates could fritter away otherwise winnable races at a moment when the party desperately needs every seat it can to slow or stop Mr. Trump.\n\n“It’s not just about the stakes for the party but for the country,” said Caitlin Legacki, a centrist Democratic strategist advising a moderate Senate candidate in Michigan, where there is a fierce fight to hold the seat of a retiring Democrat. “A lot of these primaries are going to determine whether we win general elections.”\n\nOf course, an even bigger election looms: the 2028 primary race for president. Potential Democratic candidates are already traversing the country.\n\nThe energy and enthusiasm are on the left right now, and Mr. Mamdani is Exhibit A.\n\nTurnout in New York City doubled that of the last general election for mayor. He drew upon more than 100,000 volunteers — a shocking number for a municipal race. Mr. Sanders has brought more than 300,000 people to his “fighting oligarchy” tour this year, most recently packing a stadium with Mr. Mamdani.\n\nIn Michigan, Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders-endorsed progressive Senate candidate, said in an interview that he feared his party’s takeaway from the 2025 elections would be that opposing Mr. Trump was sufficient to fuel a comeback.\n\n“You have to take on the system that enabled Donald Trump,” Mr. El-Sayed said. “Are you working to give me something that I can believe in about what the future will look like? Or are you just opposing the Republican — a particularly odious and terrible Republican — who’s currently in the White House?”\n\nHis elevator pitch: “It’s money out of politics, money in your pocket and ‘Medicare for all.’”\n\nMr. El-Sayed, a former public health official, is locked in a three-way primary race. His rivals are Mallory McMorrow, a state senator who has been an MSNBC regular and a strong online fund-raiser, and Representative Haley Stevens, a moderate who, like Ms. Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, the new governor-elect of New Jersey, flipped a Republican-held House seat in 2018.\n\nThe Democratic women who won G.O.P.-held House seats that year — including Tuesday’s two winners and two 2026 Senate candidates — are part of a group chat that lit up this past week. Ms. Stevens sent a congratulations with 11 exclamation points, one person who saw the message said.\n\nIn an interview, Ms. Stevens likened her campaign to those of Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill, saying that she, too, would silence critics who argue that she is not exciting enough.\n\n“The same pundits and prognosticators went after my colleagues,” she said, noting that both had won overwhelmingly.\n\n“They did what I’m doing, which is they stayed laser-focused on what mattered to their communities,” Ms. Stevens said. “If manufacturing isn’t cool enough for the online class, then they don’t understand Michigan.”\n\nThe contest that has drawn the most attention is Maine, which represents the party’s best chance in 2026 to pick off a Republican: Senator Susan Collins.\n\nIn years past, the recruitment of Gov. Janet Mills, a moderate who has won repeatedly in a swing state, would have been a field-clearing coup. But Ms. Mills, 77, would be the oldest freshman senator ever in a party convulsed by calls for generational change. She has drawn several challengers.\n\nChief among them is Graham Platner, a military veteran and oyster farmer, who has wowed the progressive base, drawn gobs of donations and won an early endorsement from Mr. Sanders. More recently, his campaign has been hit by questions about old Reddit posts and a tattoo with Nazi symbolism that he recently covered up.\n\nMr. Platner’s campaign includes some top Mamdani strategists. Ms. Mills notably congratulated Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill, posting a photo of herself with the two women, calling them “my good friends.”\n\nIn Minnesota, a Democratic primary has begun to fracture along ideological lines. Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan has refused corporate PAC donations and earned Senator Elizabeth Warren’s only Senate primary endorsement so far outside Massachusetts, her home state.\n\nOn the other side is Representative Angie Craig, a member of the same 2018 class of House Democrats who flipped Republican seats as Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Sherrill. Ms. Craig served as a co-chair of the New Democrat Coalition, a centrist group in the House.\n\nMs. Flanagan said it was crucial for Democrats to take on “bold fights.”\n\n“It’s really a choice between someone who has the guts to fight for working people and refuses to take corporate PAC money, and a more corporate Democrat who’s been happy to get along and accept the status quo that I think has gotten us into this mess,” said Ms. Flanagan, who praised Mr. Mamdani’s “incredible campaign” and who supports “Medicare for all.”\n\n“This isn’t just about 2026,” she said. “it’s about 2028 and 2030 and 2032 and what it is that we are, frankly, building.”\n\nMs. Craig called herself a “gets stuff done” Democrat who takes on the “status quo,” including unseating an older Democrat to lead the House Agriculture Committee.\n\n“This is not a moment where ideology matters in the Democratic Party,” she said. “People just want to know who you are willing to throw down for and, for me, that’s been I’m willing to throw down to take on costs for my constituents.”\n\nA very different contest is unfolding in Massachusetts.\n\nA moderate 47-year-old Democrat, Representative Seth Moulton, is challenging a progressive stalwart, Senator Ed Markey, 79, by making an argument for generational change. Now a third candidate, Representative Ayanna Pressley, an original “Squad” member with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, is considering entering the race, potentially further scrambling the contest.\n\nThe race isn’t so much about voters yet as about party delegates who will determine who gets on the ballot.\n\nMr. Moulton has been paddling left — returning donations from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and signing on to support a transgender bill of rights, after causing a stir in the aftermath of 2024 with comments opposing transgender athletes. He will need the support of 15 percent of delegates to qualify for the ballot.\n\nMr. Moulton has argued that effectiveness is most important. “It isn’t progressive without actual progress,” he said in an interview.\n\nDemocratic primaries are also taking shape in redder states the party hopes to compete in.\n\nIn Texas, James Talarico, a state legislator, raised more than $6 million in just three weeks as his brand of progressive religiosity captured the imagination of small Democratic donors. He is running against Colin Allred, a former football player and congressman who lost last year’s Senate race.\n\nOne of the party’s fiercest liberal voices, Representative Jasmine Crockett, is talking about joining the Texas contest and asking advisers whether she could expand the electorate.\n\n“My name ID is super high,” she told a local TV station this week. “We’ll already be on second base.”\n\nAnother Democratic primary is underway in Iowa, among Josh Turek, a state representative and Paralympic gold medalist; Zach Wahls, a state senator; and Nathan Sage, a mechanic and Marine veteran.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, has emerged as a flashpoint across the map, endorsing Ms. Mills in Maine as candidates elsewhere seek an edge by opposing him as leader.\n\n“Hell no,” Mr. Sage said of supporting Mr. Schumer. “Hell no, hell no.”\n\nJess Bidgood contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/opinion/josh-shapiro-democratic-party.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"06:00:05-05:00","title":"Josh Shapiro Knows What the Democrats Need","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article argues that Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s governor, represents a viable and growing political model for the Democratic Party.

Josh Shapiro Knows What the Democrats Need\n\nPublished: 2025-11-09T06:00:05-05:00\n\nThis essay is the fourth installment in a series on the thinkers, upstarts and ideologues battling for control of the Democratic Party.\n\nA cardboard cutout of a presidential candidate could win California on the Democratic line and another 15 deep blue states. The question Democrats need to answer, the question that matters for the future of the Democratic Party and quite possibly for the future of democracy in America, is what kind of Democrat can win Pennsylvania.\n\nAs it happens, we already know the answer. His name is Josh Shapiro.\n\nIn his last three elections, beginning in 2016, Pennsylvania’s governor has drawn more votes than anyone else running in the state — presidential candidates, Senate candidates, other candidates for statewide office — and outperformed other Democrats in the exurban and rural areas where the party is struggling.\n\nCentrist Democrats govern several of the states that President Trump won in 2024, including Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, who won office on a promise to “fix the damn roads,” and Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, who has championed a bipartisan “Team Kentucky” approach to attracting corporate investment to the state.\n\nMr. Shapiro intrigues me because, in an era of widespread distrust in government, he has become the most popular politician in the nation’s most important battleground state by insisting that government can work.\n\nHe has a record of delivering clever political compromises, and he’s good at making centrism sound urgent. His political persona is a constant performance of vigor. As he reminds Pennsylvanians at every opportunity, he gets stuff done. His most celebrated achievement is reopening a collapsed highway in just 12 days.\n\nTuesday’s election results have supercharged the debate among Democrats about whether the road to political recovery runs toward the middle or the left. The reason the argument persists is not because the answer is unclear but because, for many Democrats, the clear answer is unpalatable. The party will not return to the White House, nor reclaim Congress, until it learns to embrace centrist politicians like Mr. Shapiro.\n\nZohran Mamdani’s victory in New York does not demonstrate the viability of progressive candidates outside of a few big cities and coastal states. Nor can Democrats solve their problems by wrapping the same ideas in better paper. The party has marginalized itself so thoroughly that even Mr. Trump’s unpopular presidency isn’t doing much to make Democrats more popular. Everything Democrats want to accomplish is downstream from figuring out how to persuade voters in places like Pennsylvania — and in a bunch of places where the Democratic brand is held in even lower regard — that the party deserves another chance.\n\nMr. Shapiro’s recipe is a plausible basis for the party’s renewal. Democrats are the party that believes in government; they have to show that government can work. They have to deliver the stuff they’ve already promised: education, security, opportunity.\n\nAs Pennsylvania’s attorney general in 2020, Mr. Shapiro repeatedly battled Mr. Trump’s legal assaults on the integrity of the state’s election results, delivering the kind of confrontations that many Democrats crave. But the way to beat Mr. Trump is to show Americans that you have a better alternative.\n\nMr. Shapiro’s version of the Democratic Party is more patriotic than the G.O.P. and, in some sense, more conservative. It is a party that wants to improve public institutions rather than blowing them to smithereens, and to carry forward the basic elements of the American experiment: liberal democracy, a pluralistic society, free markets regulated in the public interest.\n\nHistory teaches that people will readily sacrifice democracy to regain a sense of safety and stability. Mr. Shapiro recognizes the urgency of convincing people that democracy is still the better bet.\n\nOne of the most durable patterns in American politics is that voters trust Republicans more than Democrats to fight crime and deliver economic growth. It’s no coincidence that on a recent Friday, Mr. Shapiro was in Pittsburgh to talk about crime and economic growth.\n\nStanding on a bluff above the Allegheny River, he delivered a progress report on a package of investments in downtown Pittsburgh, which loomed photogenically behind him.\n\nIt was a surprisingly hot day, and much of the crowd had retreated under a canopy. Aides handed out water bottles to the municipal workers who had been rounded up to stand with Mr. Shapiro. The governor, dapper and trim, hair slicked back, grin like a Cheshire cat, didn’t seem to notice the heat. He looked as if he was having fun.\n\n“These projects are moving fast,” Mr. Shapiro told the cameras. “We are not wasting any time.”\n\nThe Pittsburgh plan is a relatively modest intervention into the city’s fortunes, but it’s a good illustration of Mr. Shapiro’s political formula. The first rule of improvisational comedy is “yes, and ….” You accept what the last person said, and then you build on top of it. Mr. Shapiro takes a similar approach to forging political compromises. He’s in favor of more money for the police and for public defenders. He has pushed to increase funding for public schools and to provide school vouchers to parents. He has delivered some high-profile wins for businesses, notably a cut in the state’s corporate tax rate. He also has retained strong support from unions by backing a higher minimum wage and vowing to block any right-to-work legislation.\n\nHis Pittsburgh plan is a standard set of economic development and public safety proposals, with some distinctly Democratic touches: subsidies for the redevelopment of office buildings and housing for the homeless; more police officers working downtown and increased collaboration with social services agencies.\n\nA second tenet of Mr. Shapiro’s approach is telling people, repeatedly, what he is doing to help them, and that he is doing it as fast as possible. In June 2023, a tanker truck caught fire underneath an elevated section of Interstate 95 in northeast Philadelphia, causing a portion of the highway to collapse. The road was expected to be closed for months, but Mr. Shapiro declared a state of emergency and approved a plan to fill the area underneath I-95, allowing rapid construction of a temporary replacement on top. He went before the cameras and promised to reopen the highway in two weeks. It reopened in 12 days.\n\nGovernment often doesn’t work because the left cares more about procedures than outcomes, and the right opposes the outcomes. One side wants to start building a modern railroad between Los Angeles and San Francisco just as soon as all the paperwork is done; the other side wants to kill the project. Neither approach helps to move people between the cities.\n\nMr. Shapiro rejects both the proceduralism of the left and the nihilism of the right. In a recent conversation, he told me that he was “someone who believes the government can be a force for good in people’s lives.” A substantial majority of voters no longer trust government to pursue big projects, and Mr. Shapiro was quick to add that he understands and shares the frustration with government in its present shambolic condition. “Our institutions are important, but need to be reformed,” he said. “Our fundamental responsibility is to show our work and deliver for our people — to get stuff done.”\n\n(Mr. Shapiro often uses a different word in place of “stuff.” He told me that he was censoring himself because he was talking to The Times.)\n\nOn his first day as governor in January 2023, Mr. Shapiro signed an executive order eliminating college degree requirements for most state jobs. It was an effort to help lower-income Pennsylvanians — and a corrective, he said, for his party’s elitist tendencies. “For the last more than a decade, the Democratic Party has been saying to people that you’re not really successful unless you go to college,” he said. “I think that’s offensive.”\n\nThe best case for Mr. Shapiro’s brand of politics is that it works. The last time he lost an election was in 1990, when he was an 11th grader at a high school outside Philadelphia and he finished third in the race for student body president.\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Law and working on Capitol Hill, Mr. Shapiro returned to Pennsylvania in 2004 and won a seat in the state House. In 2012 he traded that job for a seat on the board of commissioners in Montgomery County, a Philadelphia suburb, and in 2016 he became the state’s attorney general. His defining chapter in that job was his defense of the integrity of the 2020 election. He repeatedly beat back the attempts by Mr. Trump’s campaign to make voting more difficult, and then to prevent the counting of votes that already had been cast. In 2022 Democrats regarded him as the obvious choice to run for Pennsylvania governor, and he won in a landslide.\n\nMr. Shapiro’s most immediate political challenge is running for re-election next year, but it may not be much of a challenge. Polls shows that he’s more popular today than when he was elected. His approval rating stood at 60 percent in a poll published last month by Quinnipiac University, with 28 percent disapproving.\n\nWhen I asked Mr. Shapiro if he is interested in taking his brand of politics national, he demurred in the way that a practiced politician does when he is keeping his options open. “I’m humbled and flattered that you view the way in which we govern in Pennsylvania as a model for others,” he said.\n\nThere are some obvious reasons to worry about his national appeal. He is a career politician in a country that disdains the profession, a proponent of better government in an era defined by bipartisan suspicion of the state, and a practicing Jew in a nation that prefers presidents who are at least nominally Protestant. Mr. Shapiro has angered some Democrats by backing school vouchers and defending Israel, although he has criticized its current government. And Pennsylvania — while similar demographically to swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin — is less racially diverse than the United States as a whole, and in particular has a relatively small share of Latinos.\n\nPerhaps his biggest challenge, certainly in pursuing the Democratic nomination, is simply that a lot of progressives don’t want a centrist. They see the party as defined and held together by its commitments to change; they believe it is those commitments that motivate people to vote for Democratic candidates. “Progress is our heritage,” Ted Kennedy declared in his 1980 speech conceding the party’s nomination to the centrist candidate, President Jimmy Carter. “What is right for us as Democrats is also the right way for Democrats to win.” For progressives, it is always 1980, always on the cusp of that fateful choice between integrity and tepid centrism.\n\nHealthy political parties, however, cannot be solely progressive or conservative. They must be both. They necessarily embody a set of judgments about what to preserve and what to change. Democrats may prefer to describe themselves as “conservationists” committed to protecting the natural environment or “preservationists” opposed to development that disrupts established communities. But those are fundamentally conservative projects, devoted to protecting what already exists. Almost a century after Franklin Roosevelt created Social Security, it is no longer progressive to defend the program. It will soon be older than all of its beneficiaries.\n\nThe first great exponent of modern conservatism, the Anglo-Irish politician Edmund Burke, would have had no trouble recognizing Mr. Trump’s Republican Party as embodying the political tendencies he regarded as most dangerous. Burke, writing during the French Revolution, saw conservatism as a bulwark against radicalism, a defense of society against the ravages of men who had lost their moral compasses and were wielding power almost as an end in itself. He would have loathed Mr. Trump.\n\nI think Burke also would have recognized Mr. Shapiro as something of a kindred spirit. Burke understood that change was necessary. States that lacked the capacity to change, he wrote, also lacked the capacity to survive. What he argued, however, was that societies should address problems by improving existing institutions rather than knocking them down.\n\nWhen I put this to Mr. Shapiro, he was understandably reluctant to embrace “conservative” as a description of any part of his politics. “I do believe in the institutions,” he told me, “but they’ve got to be reformed so they can work for the people.”\n\nCall it what you will: Mr. Shapiro’s challenge will be to persuade people that the best way to address our problems — the best way to make America great again — is to double down on the things that got us here in the first place. Not incidentally, these are also the things that voters routinely say they care about most.\n\nWe were the best educated nation in the world. We need to invest in education.\n\nOur infrastructure was the envy of the world. We need to invest in infrastructure.\n\nWe ensured that prosperity was broadly distributed. We need to do that again.\n\nIn April, on the first night of Passover, a man named Cody Allen Balmer scaled the fence around the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion. He smashed windows and threw Molotov cocktails into the building, setting it ablaze. Mr. Shapiro, his family and some guests were home at the time but escaped without injuries.\n\nMr. Shapiro talked about the attack in a speech he gave a few months later, at the Eradicate Hate Global Summit. He said a lot of familiar things, but also something that was less familiar. He said that people, especially younger Americans, are not getting what they need from the government, and that is part of the reason some of them conclude that violence is the only path forward. Referring to his administration’s work to streamline the process of applying for permits, he said, “I realize a permit won’t end violence, but maybe it causes someone to have a bit more faith that the system can work for them.”\n\n“Think of it,” he said, “the one time someone turns to government for help — and gets it.”\n\nThere’s a becoming modesty in that thought. And a lot of stuff to get done.\n\nSource photograph by Sarah Yenesel/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

a series of giant photographs imagining dystopian lifestyles. Each symbolized the near-future outlook of a certain niche ideology. The “cyber nihilist anarchoprimitivist” naps in an electric car packed with survival supplies; the “transhumanist” enjoys a blood cocktail in a high-rise apartment tended by machines. One 8-by-12-foot image is a self-portrait of the artist as an “anarchocapitalist.” It shows Citarella in a dormlike room stocked with solar panels, jars of food and a desktop computer. Out the window, a figure canoes through a flooded Manhattan alley.\n\nThe scene also reflected the artist’s circumstances. “That work was shot in my Chinatown apartment, but it could not fit in the apartment,” Citarella, 38, said in an interview. At the time, his work wasn’t selling and he had given up his studio. The speculative bubble buoying post-internet artists like Citarella and Parker Ito had burst. Friends of his started working smaller. “I made the work bigger,” he said. “That meant that it had to be stored or it had to sell.” (It did eventually sell, at steep discounts.)\n\nCitarella’s painstaking, ambitious path speaks to the economic and political challenges that have shaped millennial artists. Instead of cold-water lofts and rolls of canvas, they had cramped apartments and cracked Adobe software. The internet, with its particular mix of irony and sincerity, crudeness and high culture, was their salon.\n\nCitarella sympathizes with survivalists on at least one point: When old structures fail, you must build new ones. He has become well known in the art industry for founding Do Not Research, a digital magazine and discussion board that analyzes politics and culture. He has helped run newsletters, classes and a gallery. He describes these projects as life rafts for the Titanic, meaning slow-moving institutions like museums and schools: “You’re hopeful that the mainstream legacy establishment can avert the crisis of the iceberg,” he said, “but you don’t know if it’s going to.”\n\nOver the past year, Citarella has brought the insights of a socially engaged digital artist to the crowded ecosystem of political commentary. Some episodes of his lefty podcast, “Doomscroll,” draw hundreds of thousands of viewers on YouTube. Guests range from marquee names like the New York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein and the economist Francis Fukuyama to the hosts of more gonzo broadcasts including TrueAnon and “Chapo Trap House.”\n\nAfter Donald Trump wooed the manosphere in last year’s election, appearing with Joe Rogan and Theo Von, Democrats yearned for a Rogan of their own: a podcasting pied piper for disillusioned male voters. Citarella, an earnest and strategic democratic socialist, has spent almost a decade pointing out the lack of leftist influencers who can divert young people from what he calls the conservative online “funnels” that expose them to increasingly extreme ideas. With “Doomscroll,” he’s vying to become one of those influencers.\n\nIn person Citarella presents as quietly muscular. He and his small team often film “Doomscroll” in a studio with a view of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and its rusting cranes. A wardrobe consultant helps style him in dark jeans and layered shirts, aiming somewhere between soldier and professor.\n\nFor Citarella, artists are uniquely able to gather ideas from different social spheres. Likewise, “Doomscroll” contrasts its mostly left-leaning guests with the occasional right-wing figure, including the “Red Scare” podcaster, actor and Trump supporter Dasha Nekrasova.\n\nIt’s a bid to appear in the algorithmically recommended YouTube feeds of the fans of his guests and, maybe, change their minds. To that end, “Doomscroll\" has been relatively nonconfrontational. “That is the meta tactical media portion of it,” Citarella said. “If I bring someone on and immediately in the first 10 minutes I’m pushing back and arguing with them, people are going to click out.”\n\nCitarella is an informed listener. Instead of lobbing gotcha questions, he urges guests on with well-timed quips. He projects genuine curiosity about other people’s worldviews, and how their explanations fit with his.\n\nThere’s a long game here. The clean, calm aesthetic and high production value of “Doomscroll” are meant to seem authoritative. Citarella studies his guest’s past appearances and figures out which issues they “really sing” on. “I’ll try to cue them up to give the best performance, the best version of this they’ve ever given,” he said. When historians make documentaries about this moment, Citarella is betting they’ll choose clips of “Doomscroll.”\n\nFor his fans, Citarella helps make sense of a confusing, fragmented culture, in which the spectrum from Republican to Democrat has diminishing explanatory power. In October, when he interviewed the professional bodybuilder Mike Israetel, they discussed seed oils, testosterone levels and physical fitness — concerns shared by health-conscious people across political parties. On other occasions, Citarella notes that the far-right pundit Alex Jones and the wellness guru Gwenyth Paltrow sell the same supplements.\n\nMany of Citarella’s insights come from his deep study of obscure, online political factions, with their farcical lexicon of ideologies. Citarella’s 2018 book, “Politigram and the Post-Left,” explores how Instagram meme accounts help teenagers develop political beliefs, sometimes building incoherent collections of arcane ideas.\n\nFor a transhumanist, he writes, “The ultimate objective is to create a master race via technology.” A cyber-nihilist anarchoprimitivist would sacrifice human civilization to save the planet. These aren’t opposites, but complements.\n\nCitarella took the influence of online culture seriously at a time when mainstream institutions were put off by the dark humor and jargon of memes and message boards. Christiane Paul, an art historian and curator of digital art at the Whitney Museum, pointed out that forums like 4chan, known for incubating hacktivists and the alt-right, also influenced digital artists.\n\nCitarella’s evenhanded involvement in internet discourse provides “a counterpoint to the edgelords,” Paul said. She added that Citarella and Brad Troemel — Citarella’s confidant and collaborator, now known for video essays skewering cultural trends — were “influential in theorizing the post-internet and post-digital,” making sense of how physical and networked life increasingly blur together.\n\nAs a kid in Westchester County, N.Y., Citarella would splice images together on his family’s bulky computer. When he was 18, he moved to New York City and studied photography at the School of Visual Arts. But his career took off online. In 2012, when he was 25, he joined The Jogging, an absurdist Tumblr founded by Troemel and Lauren Christiansen that fostered an art scene.\n\nIn 2016, Citarella and Troemel made Ultra Violet Production House, a web store where patrons could buy kits for prankish sculptures like a “New Economy Chess Board” (vertical, all pawns) or a tent for dangling from your fire escape while you Airbnb your apartment. They sold a few, including a tent to Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum, but most of these ideas were pure content, images satirizing the tendency to conflate consumption and politics.\n\nTheir most popular product was “Spiders for Change.” One dollar, supposedly, would sponsor the release of six poisonous spiders at the 2016 NADA art fair in New York. Citarella told me no spiders were deployed.\n\nInstead, for those in on the joke, the work functioned as a tip jar. Citarella realized that hundreds of small, steady donations might replace the occasional large gallery sale. By the 2020 pandemic lockdowns, Citarella was unpacking the sort of cultural theory taught in elite graduate art programs on free Twitch streams, and on Patreon for followers paying about $5 a month. Now, he continues to make art, but “Doomscroll” subscribers pay his rent.\n\nYancey Strickler, a founder of the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, has collaborated with Citarella on a podcast and a book. Citarella started out trying to succeed in the gallery system, Strickler observed, but “didn’t win in that setting.” In the end, though, Citarella has gained a much bigger audience than most artists can hope for. “We’re in a world now that’s built on top of internet values,” Strickler said, “and it’s going to continue to be.”\n\nIn today’s networked landscape, a Joe Rogan has more influence than most publishing organizations. “We can’t flip a switch and go back to the old media model,” Citarella said. But you can bring a countervailing voice to the debate. The artist has used broadcasting formats known for fomenting outrage to build a brand that resembles a traditional, moderate institution.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, Citarella decided to test the manosphere theory that working out makes you more self-reliant, and more conservative. He undertook a performance called “Auto-experiment: Hyper-masculinity” in which, among other things, he abstained from sex, ingested InfoWars-brand supplements and exercised his jaw to see if increased physical confidence would change his views. (It didn’t. In March, Citarella was one of the hosts of a fund-raiser for his fellow democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who was elected mayor of New York on Tuesday.)\n\nBut Citarella found that muscle mass earned him credibility with young men online. Catherine Liu, a film and media studies professor at University of California at Irvine and the only returning guest on “Doomscroll,” described raising her son at a time when “toxic masculinity” was a buzzy phrase in liberal circles. Liu told me that Citarella’s masculine presence offers “a more reflective alternative” to far-right, macho voices like Andrew Tate or Jordan Peterson, “one that allows progressive young men to find their role in the world and with their bodies.”\n\nCitarella hones his public persona like an artwork. “The strange thing about making art on the internet as compared to galleries is that you are crafting a kind of influencer character in collaboration with your audience,” he told me.\n\nDuring a period of intensive weight lifting, Citarella began sharing semi-ironic gym selfies. His followers joked that the now beastly artist would become a bodybuilding influencer. So he played along, posting a cultural theory reading list combined with a weight lifting plan. Now, muscles are a part of his brand. The joke’s on him, he said, “because I have to go to the gym and exercise all the time.”\n\nCitarella also sees bodybuilding as “an aesthetic pursuit. I think it’s beauty and it’s art,” he told me. “Art never needs to be justified.” He has noted that weight lifting, with its tables of gains and calories, appeals to his taste for metrics — arguably, an itch that tracking the number of “Doomscroll” viewers also scratches. In fact, his sincere taste for pumping iron and steady progress summarizes his approach to an irony-drenched, partisan mediascape.\n\nThis summer, one of Citarella’s fans ribbed him with a meme depicting a wet and ripped model, tagged with his name, emerging from the sea, ready to save men from depression.\n\nHe reposted it.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/climate/jamaica-hurricane-solar-power.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"13:43:10-05:00","title":"After Jamaica’s Disastrous Storm, Solar Power Is a Bright Spot","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm that devastated Jamaica, residents like Jennifer Hue and Annabelle Todd found that their rooftop solar panels provided critical resilience by keeping power on during outages, enabling them to maintain refrigeration, communication, and safety.

Hue, a retired tax auditor living close to hard-hit Treasure Beach, woke up to devastation. Her mango, breadfruit and papaya trees were lost, their tops snapped off by 180-mile-per-hour winds. There was water everywhere.\n\nBut her roof was intact, and just as importantly, so were the solar panels she had installed two years ago. Most of her neighbors didn’t have electricity. But she did.\n\nNeighbors began stopping by to charge their phones, to take a cool drink from the refrigerator, to message loved ones to let them know they were safe. Ms. Hue is still hosting a cousin and his mother, as well as two medical students from the local university, whose accommodations were damaged.\n\n“The wind was like a tornado, and water came through every crevice,” Ms. Hue said. “But we didn’t lose any solar panels, and the next morning, the sun was shining bright and early,” she said. “We had our power back.”\n\nA small but vibrant market for rooftop solar panels in Jamaica has long been seen as a promising way to wean the nation off imported fossil fuels. The country is reliant on oil and gas from abroad for its power plants, which not only is polluting but also makes Jamaica’s electricity some of the priciest in the world per kilowatt-hour.\n\nBut now, solar power is also seen as a way for Jamaica and other nations in one of the world’s most hurricane-prone regions to become more resilient to ever-intensifying storms.\n\nRooftop solar has grown significantly in Jamaica over the past decade, from less than 1.4 megawatts in 2015 to nearly 65 megawatts in 2023, a significant amount for a small island, experts say. Overall, solar and other forms of renewable energy made up about 10 percent of Jamaica’s power generation in 2023.\n\nThe hope is that growth will start to cut down on Jamaica’s dependence on imported oil and liquefied natural gas, which is shipped in tankers to the island nation, at a time when ports, refineries, power plants and transmission lines are becoming vulnerable to extreme weather worsened by a warming planet.\n\nWide swaths of the country remain without electricity after Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 storm last week, killing at least 32 people and destroying an untold number of buildings and homes. “You’re talking about restoring a very lengthy, complex and expensive infrastructure,” said David Gumbs, an expert on energy in the Caribbean at the Rocky Mountain Institute and the former chief executive of the Anguilla Electricity Company.\n\n“With solar, you maintain some ability to continue generating electricity” without relying on hundreds of miles of damaged power lines, he said. “And in the Caribbean context, when the hurricane passes, if I have rooftop solar and batteries and if I can keep my refrigerator running, my entire neighborhood benefits.”\n\nThe solar panels must survive the high winds, of course. Jason Robinson, who runs Solar Buzz, an installer based in Kingston, Jamaica’s capital, has been surveying the damage this week, navigating roads on the west side of the island strewed with downed trees and power lines. “With nearly 200 mile-per-hour winds, you’re in the universe’s hands,” Mr. Robinson said.\n\nBut so far, none of his nearly 300 clients have reported extensive damage, he said. Panels installed flat against the roof, in particular, fared well. Some rooftop solar owners have taken to removing their panels ahead of strong winds. Many were already back online.\n\n“As long as you install to code, and your roof stays on, you have a chance of surviving extremely long power outages,” Mr. Robinson said. “Resiliency is becoming even more important than lowering your bill.”\n\nSolar panels remain beyond the reach of many Jamaicans, but prices are falling rapidly as Chinese gear floods into the market. In recent years the Jamaican government has also started providing a solar income-tax credit, and banks have begun to offer more financing. Jamaica’s electric utility also now compensates solar households for excess electricity they put back into the grid.\n\nThat’s helping Jamaica make progress toward its goal of generating 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nAnnabelle Todd manages an oceanfront guest villa on Treasure Beach, where two dozen panels and battery storage were installed two-and-a-half years ago. The panels survived, apart from one that was punctured by flying debris. She had electricity and air-conditioning the morning after the storm, much to the envy of her neighbors.\n\nThe system wasn’t cheap, costing about $30,000. But it has virtually eliminated electricity bills that used to top $1,000 a month, because her guests “would run that A.C. morning and noon and night,” she said. “Honestly, we could pay it off in two, three years,” she said.\n\nMore than that, not losing power has been a relief, she said. It’s the second year in a row that the seaside community, known for its black sand beaches, has been ravaged by a hurricane.\n\n“Now everyone who runs villas here wants solar. I already see solar suppliers driving up and down Treasure Beach,” Ms. Todd said. “They got hit two years in a row, and they’re not going to fool around anymore.”\n\nTwila-Mae Logan, deputy executive director of the University of the West Indies’ business school, spent about $20,000 to install panels at her Kingston home two years ago. The capital was spared the worst of Hurricane Melissa, but even then, her neighborhood lost power, making her home one of the few with electricity. Ahead of the storm, her brother and her niece rushed to her home to store food in her freezer so it wouldn’t spoil.\n\n“We’re a third-world country and our government is significantly under-resourced, but I really do think our government has put some fair degree of priority behind solar,” she said. “Most people would go solar, save for the expense.”\n\nLeaders across the Caribbean have demanded more financial assistance from the world’s rich countries to help Jamaica contend with the consequences of climate change. Caribbean island nations will suffer the most from climate change, despite being least responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the world, they say. The International Monetary Fund says the region requires about $100 billion in economic investment to build resilience to climate-fueled disasters.\n\nMs. Hue, the retired tax auditor, doesn’t expect to quickly make back the tens of thousands of dollars she paid for her solar panels in 2023. But “it was never about that,” she said. “It was about having very reliable power, and having peace of mind.”\n\n“We were just fortunate to have the sun out the next morning,” she said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/nyregion/mlb-pitchers-gambling.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:00:05-05:00","title":"2 Major League Baseball Pitchers Are Charged in Gambling Investigation","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two Major League Baseball pitchers, Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, have been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, honest services fraud, money laundering, and influencing sporting contests through insider information about pitch types and speeds.

Investigation\n\nPublished: 2025-11-09T18:00:45-05:00\n\nOn June 7, 2023, one of Major League Baseball’s best relief pitchers started his outing with a three-run lead and an array of pitches in his arsenal that kept hitters guessing.\n\nBut sports bettors knew exactly what pitch was coming from the reliever, Emmanuel Clase of the Cleveland Guardians, according to federal prosecutors. They bet that it would be a ball and slower than 95 miles per hour.\n\nMr. Clase’s pitch landed in the dirt, well outside the strike zone. The bettors made $58,000. And it wasn’t the only time, according to prosecutors.\n\nMr. Clase and his Guardians teammate Luis Ortiz have been charged with sharing inside information about their pitches with sports bettors, who then gambled on the pitches and made hundreds of thousands of dollars on online betting platforms, according to a federal indictment that was unsealed on Sunday in the Eastern District of New York.\n\nEach man agreed with sports bettors on the types of pitches he would throw in upcoming games, according to the indictment. The bettors, who were not identified by prosecutors, then placed bets on the pitches being of a certain speed or type and whether they would result in balls or strikes. Mr. Clase and Mr. Ortiz received thousands of dollars in bribes from the bettors, prosecutors said.\n\nEach man was charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery.\n\n“They defrauded the online betting platforms where the bets were placed,” said Joseph Nocella Jr., the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. “And they betrayed America’s pastime.”\n\nIt is the latest indictment involving gambling to rock the world of professional sports, and the third in the past month brought by federal prosecutors in the Eastern District. The charges add to concerns about how the widespread legalization of sports betting — which sports leagues have embraced and profited from — has encouraged illicit activity that is affecting public trust in the games loved by millions of Americans.\n\nLast month, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn brought charges against nearly three dozen defendants in two criminal cases involving gambling that featured current and former N.B.A. players. One involved an insider-trading scheme in which sports bettors used nonpublic information about the availability of players to make wagers on player and team underperformance.\n\nMr. Ortiz, 26, was arrested on Sunday in Boston and will appear in federal court there on Monday. Mr. Clase, 27, was not in custody as of Sunday afternoon. Kelvin Nova, Mr. Clase’s agent, declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Clase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Chris Georgalis, a lawyer for Mr. Ortiz, said his client was “innocent of the charges.”\n\n“He has never, and would never, improperly influence a game — not for anyone and not for anything,” Mr. Georgalis said.\n\nMr. Clase has made three All-Star Games since his debut in 2019. Mr. Ortiz, a hard-throwing relief pitcher, made his major-league debut in 2022 for the Pittsburgh Pirates and joined the Guardians in 2025.\n\nThe scheme described by prosecutors involved microbets, in which gamblers wager on smaller events, like a pitch’s speed, that are often resolved quickly in the middle of a game, instead of on the outcome of the game itself.\n\nThe commissioners of several sports leagues have spoken out about curtailing such bets. Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., said last month that he had asked the league’s partners to “pull back some of the prop bets” — betting on individual players’ performances. The N.F.L. has also worked to ban certain live bets, like betting on whether a kicker will miss a field goal.\n\nRob Manfred, the M.L.B. commissioner, told reporters in July that certain bets were “unnecessary and particularly vulnerable.”\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the scheme stretched back to May 2023, when Mr. Clase started agreeing with bettors to throw certain pitches in forthcoming games and at-bats. Sometimes, Mr. Clase used his phone in the middle of games to coordinate bets, prosecutors said.\n\nOften, according to the indictment, Mr. Clase would throw a fraudulent pitch on the first pitch of his relief appearance. It would usually be a ball, off-speed and in the dirt, prosecutors said. For the next two years, according to the indictment, Mr. Clase provided information to gamblers that led to more than 100 fraudulent bets being placed on his pitches.\n\nIn April 2025, Mr. Clase started asking for and receiving payments for making the agreed-on pitches, according to the indictment. After one pitch that netted $15,000 from an online platform, Mr. Clase told the bettor to send some of the winnings to a contact in the Dominican Republic, for “repairs at the country home.”\n\nDuring the 2025 season, Mr. Ortiz joined the scheme, prosecutors said. Before a June 15 game against the Seattle Mariners, Mr. Ortiz agreed to throw a ball as his first pitch of the second inning in exchange for $5,000, with another $5,000 going to Mr. Clase.\n\nOverall, the bettors netted at least $450,000 from betting on Mr. Clase’s and Mr. Ortiz’s pitches, according to the indictment, with at least $400,000 coming from Mr. Clase’s throws.\n\nThe two players were placed on paid leave in July after Major League Baseball began an investigation into suspicious wagering activity on individual pitches in their games.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Major League Baseball said it had cooperated with federal authorities and was aware of the indictment. It said its own investigation was continuing. A statement from the Guardians said the team was also aware of the indictment and would cooperate with law enforcement and with the M.L.B.’s investigation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at this year’s M.L.B. All-Star Game, Mr. Manfred said the legalization of sports betting had helped protect the integrity of the game, rather than compromising it. Before legalization, he argued, there were fewer safeguards.\n\n“We had no idea — no idea — what threats there were to the integrity of the play because it was all nontransparent,” Mr. Manfred said.\n\nAccording to the federal indictment, sometimes the bettors would place parlay bets — wagers that include two or more bets that both must be successful for the bettor to win — on a selection of Mr. Clase’s pitches being balls. In one such wager, on a May 28, 2025, game between the Guardians and the Los Angeles Dodgers, Mr. Clase threw seven of the eight selected pitches out of the strike zone.\n\nBut on the eighth pitch, the batter swung and missed, making it a strike and meaning the bettors, who had waged $4,000, lost.\n\nAfterward, one bettor sent a Mr. Clase a GIF of a man hanging himself with toilet paper, according to prosecutors. Mr. Clase responded by sending a GIF of a sad puppy-dog face.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/opinion/right-wing-america-politics-culture.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"06:00:15-05:00","title":"Cruelty, Bigotry and Rage.

What’s Not to Like?\n\nPublished: 2025-11-09T06:00:15-05:00\n\nKevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, must be confused.\n\nLast month, he turned to the most reliable move in the Republican crisis-management playbook, and it didn’t work. On Oct. 30, three days after his friend Tucker Carlson released a softball interview with Nick Fuentes, a Holocaust denier and perhaps the most notorious fan of Adolf Hitler in American public life, Roberts posted a video online that decried cancel culture.\n\n“We will always defend truth,” Roberts said. “We will always defend America, and we will always defend our friends against the slander of bad actors who serve someone else’s agenda.”\n\n“That includes Tucker Carlson,” Roberts continued, “who remains — and as I have said before — always will be a close friend of the Heritage Foundation. The venomous coalition attacking him are sowing division. Their attempt to cancel him will fail.”\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how much this approach tends to work in the modern Republican Party. The hatred of the left — and of conservatives who are critical of Donald Trump — is so overwhelming that even the most basic acts of moral hygiene are considered weak or woke, or worse.\n\nEven if you are uncomfortable with the words or actions of your fellow Republicans, there is relentless pressure to swallow your tongue. There should be no enemies to your right. The left is the true existential threat to the United States.\n\nWhen Roberts, who was also a guiding force of Project 2025, recorded his video, he could be forgiven for thinking that neither Carlson nor Fuentes was particularly toxic on the right. After all, Carlson spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention and at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, and he hosts one of the top rated podcasts in the nation.\n\nFuentes, for his part, dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago along with Kanye West in 2022, and Marjorie Taylor Greene spoke at Fuentes’s America First Political Action Conference that same year.\n\nBut Roberts miscalculated. His statement tore the Heritage Foundation apart. Facing a staff revolt, he issued a new statement more clearly condemning Fuentes (but still leaving Carlson alone), and when that didn’t quell the uprising, he held an all-staff meeting that quickly degenerated into an airing of grievances, with some Heritage employees eviscerating Roberts and passionately condemning the moral decline of the conservative movement and others — often with equal emotion — standing by his side.\n\nRoberts remains Heritage’s president and has vowed to stay, but senior foundation employees have resigned, the National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism has severed its ties with the group, and vast segments of the right are in open revolt against both Roberts and Carlson.\n\nReaders might be a little bit stumped. Wait, this is what’s splitting the right? A podcast conversation? It’s not that dialogues like this don’t matter (they do), but after everything that America has seen and endured since 2015, why now?\n\nThe answer is rooted in part in the unstable bargain that millions of conservatives made with themselves and with America to keep supporting Trump.\n\nFirst, as a bit of background, Trump’s rise not only eviscerated the idea that there should be any kind of character test for participation in Republican politics, it also resulted in an aggressive, vicious purge from the party and the movement of anyone who attempted to hold Trump accountable for depravity and lawlessness. Some of us have even been told that we’ve abandoned our Christian faith for opposing Trump.\n\nMany of the conservatives who remained didn’t want to abandon the president, but they also didn’t want to completely abandon decency, either. So they chose a third way. Trump receives special dispensation (witness the much more muted response to Trump’s dinner with Fuentes, especially among Republican lawmakers), but standards still apply to everyone else. Other Republicans have to toe the line.\n\nThe most consequential example of Republicans refusing to hold Trump accountable is, of course, the second impeachment conviction vote in 2021. Mitch McConnell punted Trump’s political future to the Biden Department of Justice and Republican primary voters. We know how that worked out.\n\nYou could see this dynamic in play more recently in the response to the Trump administration’s about-face on releasing the Epstein files. There was immense fury on parts of the right, but much of it was directed at Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and not at Trump, the man who now calls the lingering Epstein scandal a “Democrat hoax.”\n\nBut this approach suffers from a fatal flaw. A movement, especially one that verges on an outright cult of personality, is defined by its leader, not by its rank and file. And when the leader is lawless and depraved, then efforts to contain his influence while preserving his power are doomed to fail.\n\nThe proof is everywhere. Throughout the Trump era, many of the most prominent voices of right-wing America have only become shriller, angrier and, yes, more racist and more antisemitic. The right-wing media universe is culturally different in 2015 than it was in 2025 — substantially so.\n\nThe balance of power has flipped upside down. The fringe has become mainstream, and the mainstream has become fringe.\n\nAnd now, with the end of Trump’s presidency coming into view, there is an increasing number of conservatives who fear that the movement has been and is being completely redefined — not just in Trump’s image, but in Carlson’s and Fuentes’s as well. And now some of these conservatives are speaking up.\n\nA great deal is riding on their ability to win this fight. Trump will not be president for a third term, and the question of who will represent the Republican Party in the years to come is of immeasurable importance.\n\nI want to believe that a large number of conservatives are in the process of waking up. They’re finally questioning what their movement has become.\n\nBut I’m rather afraid that they’re too late. One sign that might be the case is that virtually every person who’s raised a voice against Carlson has a far smaller audience than he does. Since Carlson posted his interview with Fuentes less than two weeks ago on X, it has racked up almost 18 million views. On YouTube it has 5.6 million views.\n\nIn fact, the Fuentes interview is already Carlson’s fourth most popular video, despite being online for less than two weeks. (If you’re wondering, his most popular one is his friendly interview with the even more vile Vladimir Putin.) To put those numbers in context, they top the viewership of his prime-time Fox News show, when he was the top-rated cable television host in America.\n\nCompounding the problem, there are many prominent right-wing influencers who won’t explicitly defend Carlson or Fuentes but will scold the people who are confronting them.\n\nSean Davis, the chief executive of The Federalist, for example, attacked Ben Shapiro after Shapiro condemned both Carlson and Fuentes, writing, “Not really sure I’m willing to be lectured on who is allowed to talk to who and why by someone yukking it up with Jake Tapper, one of the most corrupt, hateful, and dishonest left-wing-operatives-masquerading-as-a-journalist in all of media.”\n\nGot that? We can’t condemn good old Tucker for elevating an actual fan of Hitler in front of many millions of people because that will distract from taking on the real enemy, Jake Tapper.\n\nI’m tempted to just laugh about it, but the stakes are too high and Davis’s sentiments are too popular for me to face the future with anything but real alarm.\n\nMaking the problem worse, the fight for the future of the Republican Party is taking place only after many of its most thoughtful and decent members have been excommunicated. Millions upon millions of Republicans have been told that these brave men and women — Mitt Romney, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, to name just three — are traitors to the cause.\n\nThe Republican rank and file have also been conditioned to dismiss moral arguments against MAGA as sanctimonious and complaints about Republican racism and antisemitism as inherently leftist. Hearts are hardened, ears shut.\n\nI don’t know if Roberts will survive at Heritage, but I do know that Carlson and Fuentes and their constellation of friends and allies are far too popular to cancel or even to contain.\n\nThe fight for the future of the Republican Party is underway, but until the demand for decency reaches toward the very top of the movement, then Trump’s malignant influence will continue to metastasize, and he’ll hand the baton to a woman or a man (including, possibly, Carlson himself) who extends Trump’s legacy of cruelty, bigotry and rage.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

by Blue Origin, the space company founded by Jeff Bezos, is on a launchpad in Florida. It is ready for its second mission.\n\nTucked inside the rocket is NASA’s ESCAPADE mission — two identical spacecraft that will orbit Mars to measure the dynamics of that planet’s magnetic field and atmosphere.\n\nBut that is only one goal for the launch. Blue Origin will attempt to land the rocket’s booster stage on a floating platform in the Atlantic, a feat that only Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX, has so far achieved.\n\nLiftoff from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida is scheduled for Sunday afternoon during an 88-minute launch window that begins at 2:45 p.m. Eastern time and ends at 4:13 p.m.\n\nBlue Origin will provide online coverage of the launch starting 45 minutes before liftoff.\n\nIf the launch is delayed by weather or a technical glitch, it may be grounded indefinitely. In an attempt to relieve congestion in the nation’s airspace during the ongoing federal government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that, beginning on Monday, no commercial rockets can lift off between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time.\n\nBlue Origin officials said they were talking with the F.A.A. to see if they could obtain an exception if Sunday’s launch attempt were to be called off.\n\nAt 321 feet tall, New Glenn is a giant. It is taller than the Falcon 9 rockets regularly flown by SpaceX, but shorter than the Starship vehicle the company is testing in Texas.\n\nThe rocket is named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth.\n\nIts payload nose cone, at seven meters wide, offers at least twice as much space for payloads as other rockets currently in operation.\n\nThe booster stage — the lower part of the rocket that lifts off the ground and carries the upper stage through the densest part of the atmosphere — is designed to land and to be reused.\n\nAfter it propels the rocket up through the dense, lower part of the atmosphere, the giant New Glenn booster stage will drop away and try to set down on a floating platform named Jacklyn, after Mr. Bezos’ mother.\n\nThat boat is already positioned about 375 miles off the coast in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nYes, SpaceX regularly recovers the booster stages of its Falcon 9 rockets, then reflies them, a feat it first accomplished a decade ago. Since then, SpaceX has successfully landed the boosters more than 500 times. One of its boosters has flown 31 times.\n\nNo other company has landed a stage of an orbital-class rocket. Blue Origin does land and reuse the boosters of its much smaller New Shepard rockets, which send tourists and science experiments on up-and-down, suborbital flights to the edge of space, but not to orbit. Reusing the booster stage of New Glenn will be key to speeding the pace of launches if Blue Origin is to become a serious competitor to SpaceX.\n\nIn the near future, a Chinese company, Landspace, is also aiming to land the booster of its new Zhuque-3 rocket, which, at first glance, looks like a clone of the Falcon 9.\n\nThis rocket is carrying ESCAPADE, or Escape and Plasma Acceleration Dynamics Explorers, a NASA-financed mission developed by the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. The mission consists of two identical spacecraft named Blue and Gold — the school colors of Berkeley.\n\nThe two spacecraft will take a long, slow trip to Mars, arriving in September 2027. After they reach their destination, Blue and Gold will spend at least a year orbiting the red planet to take measurements of the magnetic field around it, as well as the dance of charged particles in the thin atmosphere.\n\nThe rocket is also carrying a NASA communications technology demonstration from the company Viasat.\n\nESCAPADE was originally scheduled to launch on the first New Glenn mission in October 2024. However, when it appeared that New Glenn would not be ready in time, NASA decided to pull the mission off that flight and put the spacecraft into storage.\n\nThe first New Glenn finally launched in January, and its primary mission was a success. The payload — a demonstration of Blue Ring, a technology that Blue Origin is developing to move payloads around in space — made it to orbit and successfully completed its tests.\n\nBut the secondary goal of landing the booster was not successful. The booster’s engines failed to reignite as it re-entered the atmosphere, and it crashed into the Atlantic instead of landing on the Jacklyn floating platform.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/obituaries/paul-tagliabue-dead.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"15:01:22-05:00","title":"Paul Tagliabue, Who Led the N.F.L. for 17 Prosperous Years, Dies at 84","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Tagliabue, who served as the commissioner of the National Football League (N.F.L.) from 1989 to 2006, led a period of unprecedented financial success, labor peace, and league expansion, including the addition of four new franchises.

Dies at 84\n\nPublished: 2025-11-09T15:01:12-05:00\n\nPaul Tagliabue, who presided over an era of labor peace, soaring revenues and expansion for the National Football League in his 17 years as commissioner while facing rising concerns over a lack of minority hiring, the effects of concussions and the use of drugs, died on Sunday at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 84.\n\nThe cause was heart failure, said his daughter Emily Rockefeller, who added that he had also had Parkinson’s disease.\n\nMr. Tagliabue succeeded Pete Rozelle in November 1989 after having spent 20 years as the league’s outside legal counsel, working mostly on antitrust cases but advising on many other issues as well.\n\nHe moved quickly on two fronts: the N.F.L.’s troubled labor relations and the impending renewal of its network television contracts.\n\nThe league had been hit with a pair of players’ strikes in the 1980s and had resorted to fielding “replacement” players in the early part of the 1987 season, when talks on a new collective bargaining agreement collapsed. The regulars returned without a new contract and still lacked one when Mr. Tagliabue became commissioner.\n\nHe took a direct role in negotiations with the players’ union, something Mr. Rozelle had left largely to the club owners’ Management Council, which was dominated by hard-line owners who opposed free agency, like Hugh Culverhouse of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But Mr. Tagliabue built bridges with the players’ leader, Gene Upshaw, which led to a landmark agreement in 1993 granting players free agency after several years in the league while giving management a salary cap limiting each team’s total payroll.\n\nWith labor peace achieved, Mr. Tagliabue and the N.F.L. reached deals with ABC, CBS, NBC, TNT, ESPN and Fox that brought $4.4 billion in TV rights fees, far outstripping the network revenues earned by Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association at the time.\n\n“A lot of deals are negotiated with other people,” Sean McManus, then the president of CBS News and Sports, told The New York Times in March 2006, when Mr. Tagliabue announced plans to retire. “But you always knew the man making the final decision was Paul Tagliabue.”\n\nThe N.F.L. teams also prospered with ambitious marketing ventures and the construction of new stadiums that yielded new revenue from naming rights and luxury suites.\n\nFour expansion franchises joined the league during Mr. Tagliabue’s tenure — the Carolina Panthers; the Jacksonville Jaguars; a new Cleveland Browns team, successor to the original Browns, who had moved to Baltimore to become the Ravens; and the Houston Texans, added as the 32nd franchise in 2002.\n\nBut Mr. Tagliabue also had to deal with a chaotic realignment when the original Browns franchise, a cherished institution in Cleveland, left Ohio. Los Angeles, the country’s second-largest media market, lost both its teams in 1995. The Rams moved to St. Louis and the Raiders went back to Oakland, Calif., their original home. The Houston Oilers went to Tennessee, becoming the Titans.\n\nMr. Tagliabue, though, saved another franchise. After Hurricane Katrina drove the New Orleans Saints from their battered city in 2005, the team played some of its home games in San Antonio and it appeared it might relocate there permanently. But Mr. Tagliabue forced its owner, Tom Benson, to keep the team in New Orleans.\n\nWhen Mr. Tagliabue was elected commissioner, he said one of his major priorities would be to secure more minority-group head coaches, “to get more Art Shells in the National Football League,” a reference to the league’s only Black head coach at the time (with the Los Angeles Raiders) and the second in league history.\n\nAfter Johnnie Cochran and Cyrus Mehri, two civil rights lawyers, threatened to sue the league for discriminating against coaches of color, Mr. Tagliabue created a committee on minority hiring that adopted a rule, named after the owner Dan Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, requiring teams to conduct at least one good-faith interview with a minority candidate when seeking a new coach — a mandate later extended to the hiring process for general managers and other top coaches.\n\nIn 1991, acting on Mr. Tagliabue’s recommendation, the N.F.L. owners voted to move the 1993 Super Bowl out of the Phoenix area after an Arizona referendum rejected marking the birthday of Martin Luther King as a state holiday. (The game was shifted to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Arizona voters approved the holiday in 1992, and the state hosted the Super Bowl in 1996.)\n\nPerhaps the biggest stain on Mr. Tagliabue’s tenure was his handling of players’ safety.\n\nFor years, Mr. Tagliabue and the owners denied there were any lasting risks from concussions. At a panel discussion in 1994, when reporters were beginning to ask questions about players in cognitive decline, Mr. Tagliabue called worries about concussions “one of those pack-journalism issues.” Years later, he apologized for the remark.\n\nMr. Tagliabue created a committee to study brain trauma in 1994, but the group consistently minimized evidence from scientists and physicians that repeated blows to the head could have long-term effects. Many players thought to have sustained concussions in a game were still being allowed to return during the same game, a practice the league’s committee maintained was safe.\n\nIt wasn’t until December 2009, after Mr. Tagliabue retired, that the N.F.L. announced it would support research by its most vocal critics and conceded publicly that concussions could have lasting consequences.\n\nIn May 2006, Sylvia Mackey, the wife of the Baltimore Colts’ Hall of Fame tight end and former players’ union president John Mackey, wrote to Mr. Tagliabue, telling of her husband’s decline with dementia and the financial ruin faced by her family and those of other former players similarly stricken.\n\nThe N.F.L. and its players’ union responded by creating the 88 Plan — named for Mackey’s number and implemented in 2007, Roger Goodell’s first full year as commissioner. The initiative initially provided up to $88,000 a year, a sum that has vastly increased, for treatment of former players with disorders including dementia, A.L.S. and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nMr. Tagliabue was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020 as a contributor to the game. But the league’s failure to acknowledge the consequences of concussions during his tenure sowed the seeds of years of confrontations with retired players, thousands of whom sued the league for fraud and negligence for hiding the dangers of head hits. This resulted in a settlement that has cost the N.F.L. more than $1.5 billion in payouts, a sum that has continued to rise.\n\nMr. Tagliabue was also involved in initiatives aimed to address drug abuse among players. The N.F.L. had begun testing in 1987 under Mr. Rozelle. Acting in coordination with the players’ union, it started suspending violators in 1989 upon their first positive steroid test and it instituted a year-round random testing program expanding its list of banned substances during Mr. Tagliabue’s tenure.\n\nMr. Tagliabue also responded to difficulties faced by female sportswriters.\n\nHe fined Sam Wyche, the Cincinnati Bengals’ head coach, nearly $28,000, a week’s pay, for barring a female reporter from the team’s locker room after a game in Seattle. A few weeks before that, Lisa Olson, a reporter for The Boston Herald, said she had been sexually harassed by three players in the New England Patriots’ locker room. The players were fined by the league.\n\nPaul John Tagliabue was born on Nov. 24, 1940, in Jersey City, N.J., one of four sons of Charles and May (Parmigiani) Tagliabue. His mother worked as a seamstress. His father owned a construction company, but the family lived modestly in a rowhouse whose upper story they rented out.\n\n“My early interest in pro football involved the Giants-Browns rivalry,” he once said. “Charlie Conerly, Kyle Rote, Otto Graham, Marion Motley.” He was also an avid fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nAt 6 feet 5 inches, he was an outstanding basketball player at St. Michael’s High School in Union City, N.J., and he became Georgetown University’s No. 2 career rebounder and the team captain in his senior season, 1961-62.\n\nBut other pursuits beckoned.\n\n“By my junior year, my love for basketball was losing out to my love for the library,” Mr. Tagliabue told Georgetown students in a 2006 speech. “I was more interested in debating communism and democracy with the political science faculty than in shooting baskets.”\n\nHe graduated from New York University Law School in 1965, worked as a policy analyst at the Pentagon, and then joined the law firm of Covington & Burling, which had long been advising the N.F.L., and took on dozens of league cases for it.\n\nMr. Rozelle, who had a background in public relations, had gained acclaim for pro football’s ascent to what became the No. 1 sport in America during his 29 years as commissioner. In contrast, Mr. Tagliabue, a corporate lawyer, may have seemed uncomfortable at times in dealing with the news media.\n\n“Authoritative and confident in daily life, he had a tendency to look stiff and a bit goofy in front of TV cameras, his conservative suits and oversized tortoiseshell glasses hiding an athlete’s physique, and his legalistic answers at times obscuring deep convictions,” Michael MacCambridge wrote in “America’s Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation” (2004).\n\nIt had taken club owners seven months to choose Mr. Tagliabue as commissioner over Jim Finks, then the general manager of the Saints. But by the time Mr. Tagliabue retired after the selection of Mr. Goodell as his successor in August 2006, the league was enjoying unparalleled financial success.\n\nMr. Tagliabue returned to Covington & Burling. In 2012, he was named by Mr. Goodell to handle appeals of suspensions he handed out to four Saints players who purportedly had been offered money by members of the coaching staff for hits that knocked opponents from games. Mr. Tagliabue found that a bounty system did exist but overturned the penalties on the players, citing “broad organizational misconduct” by management.\n\nIn addition to his daughter, Mr. Tagliabue is survived by his wife of 60 years, Chandler (Minter) Tagliabue (known as Chan); a son, Andrew; his brothers John, Charles and Robert; and three grandchildren.\n\nMr. Tagliabue faced many tough issues as a lawyer and N.F.L. commissioner, but long before that he had toughened himself on another front — basketball.\n\nAs a youth, he put cellophane tape on his fingertips to keep them from cracking during workouts in cold weather.\n\nWhen he was elected N.F.L. commissioner, his younger brother, John, the Warsaw bureau chief for The Times, told the paper how Paul used to prepare himself for defense and rebounding by banging his elbows against a wall and how he repeatedly stood on tiptoe to strengthen his calf muscles.\n\n“It used to drive our mother crazy,” John recalled.\n\nAlex Traub contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/weather/cold-snow-weather-forecast.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"15:36:59-05:00","title":"Arctic Blast Is Sweeping East, Bringing First Snow of the Season","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sudden and intense cold snap is sweeping across the central and eastern United States, bringing temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below average, with widespread winter storm conditions.

Season\n\nPublished: 2025-11-09T15:36:59-05:00\n\nA frigid air mass sweeping across the central United States is set to push eastward by Monday, delivering a sharp and widespread cool down.\n\nTemperatures are expected to plunge 10 to 20 degrees below normal, forecasters said, with the chill reaching deep into the South, where overnight lows could dip to freezing.\n\nBrian Hurley, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, said on Sunday that temperatures had already started to fall, particularly in northern North Dakota, where readings had dipped to below zero.\n\n“The cold air is going to continue to filter across the central part of the United States today,” he said. “Then tonight, and then on Monday, many areas in the Eastern part of the United States are really going to feel the effects.”\n\nConditions will also turn wintry and blustery as a storm system brings the first significant snow of the season to the Great Lakes, parts of the Northeast and the Appalachians. Some areas could get more than a foot of snow, while ice and frost could bring additional hazards.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nThe cold snap has already settled in, with the sharpest chill coming from late Sunday into Monday. More than 7.5 million people were under a winter storm warning as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nChicago, Detroit, Milwaukee and Minneapolis will see highs in the 30s before a gradual warm-up on Tuesday. Topeka and Jefferson City, Kan., will reach the mid-30s to low 40s.\n\nLight snow will continue around the Great Lakes on Sunday, but “extremely fast and heavy” snowfall rates above three inches per hour are expected Sunday night through Monday, forecasters said.\n\nThe greater Chicago area will see “intense lake effect snow” Sunday evening and into Monday with more than three inches of snow falling per hour, according to forecasters. That may extend to Lake and Porter Counties in Indiana. There is a strong probability of more than eight inches of total snowfall in some parts.\n\nWinter storm warnings cover northeast Illinois, northern Indiana, southwestern and northern Michigan through Monday. Marquette, Mich., and Chicago could get more than a foot of snow by Tuesday.\n\nElsewhere near the Great Lakes, one to three inches of snow is expected, with local amounts up to five inches.\n\nStrong winds will cause blowing snow and low visibility across the Upper Midwest through Monday afternoon.\n\nThundersnow — snow with lightning and thunder — is possible because of the sharp temperature contrast over the lakes.\n\nThe Northern Indiana office of the National Weather Service warned that travel could be “very difficult” during Monday’s commutes.\n\nFrom late Sunday onward, the arctic air will begin to spread into the region.\n\nOvernight lows will fall into the 20s and 30s through Monday night, with highs only reaching the 40s.\n\nWinter weather advisories for a mix of freezing rain, sleet, snow and ice are in effect for northern and western New York State and northern Maine through Monday morning. Around one tenth of an inch of ice could form in those areas, affecting the Monday morning commute.\n\nSnow totals up to three inches are expected, with four to six inches possible in northern New York counties, including Chautauqua, Jefferson and Lewis.\n\nThe cold air arrives Sunday night, dropping lows near 20 degrees by Monday morning.\n\nHighs will remain in the upper 20s to low 50s Monday, before a widespread freeze Monday night, when lows fall into the teens and 20s.\n\nSnow showers will develop early Monday, lingering mainly in the mountains through Tuesday, with heavy snow forecast for western parts of Virginia as well as West Virginia.\n\nFour to seven inches are likely in higher elevations, with up to six inches in western Greenbrier County in West Virginia.\n\nWinter storm warnings are in effect from Sunday evening through Tuesday morning, with up to four inches possible elsewhere in the region.\n\nWinds could gust up to 40 miles per hour in West Virginia, causing blowing snow and reduced visibility.\n\nFrost is likely through Tuesday night and slick roads could affect Monday travel.\n\nThe cold moves in Sunday night, with temperatures expected to drop into the 50s, and for parts of northwest Georgia and Alabama, possibly into the 30s.\n\nNorthern Florida will remain warmer, with highs into the upper 50s and low 60s on Monday, but lows could plunge to the upper 20s by Monday night.\n\nMr. Hurley said some temperature records may be challenged, especially on Monday night into the early hours of Tuesday for Jacksonville, Fla., where 30 degrees is forecast.
