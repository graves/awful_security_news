It now moves to a parliamentary committee for further debate and preparation ahead of the second and third readings.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Gvir has argued the measure would “ create substantial deterrence ” against terrorism and he threatened to withdraw his party from Israel’s coalition government if the bill was not put to a vote.\n \n\n   \n  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously opposed the bill, citing concerns over potential retaliation against Israeli hostages held in Gaza. However, he has since reversed his stance following the implementation of a fragile ceasefire.\n \n\n   \n  Israel currently allows the death penalty only in exceptional cases, including for crimes such as treason and war crimes committed under the Nazi regime, but it has not been used for decades.\n \n\n   \n  The only person ever executed in Israel was Adolf Eichmann, a key architect of the Holocaust,  who was hanged in 1962  after he famously was  captured by Israeli intelligence agents in Argentina  and subsequently convicted in a landmark trial.\n \n\n   \n  Before Monday’s vote, Ben Gvir  declared on X  that “History will judge anyone who dares today to raise a finger against the death penalty law for terrorists.”\n \n\n   \n  The bill also amends the military courts law, with jurisdiction over the occupied West Bank, allowing courts there to impose the death penalty by a simple majority vote on the judge’s panel instead of a unanimous vote. It also rules out any option of allowing extenuating circumstances in the sentencing. Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to military law, while Israeli settlers are subject to Israeli civilian law.\n \n\n   \n  The UN has previously condemned Israel’s military courts in the occupied West Bank, saying that “Palestinians’ right to due process guarantees have been violated” for decades, and denounced “the lack of fair trial in the occupied West Bank.”\n \n\n   \n  UN experts said last year that, “in the occupied West Bank, the functions of police, investigator, prosecutor, and judge are vested in the same hierarchical institution – the Israeli military.”\n \n\n   \n    Foreign media bill\n \n\n   \n  In the same session, lawmakers also approved the first reading of a separate bill that would allow the Israeli government to shut down foreign media outlets without a court order.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal seeks to formalize what has been dubbed the “Al Jazeera Law,” after the Qatari network’s operations in Israel  were shuttered in 2024  by the Ministry of Communications. The ministry accused Al Jazeera of anti-Israel bias and of supporting Hamas through its coverage of the Gaza war.\n \n\n   \n  Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied those accusations and  condemned its closure  in Israel. Multiple Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza have also been killed by Israeli forces over the last two years.\n \n\n   \n  The new foreign media legislation, introduced by Likud lawmaker Ariel Kallner and backed by Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition, would make such powers permanent — even outside times of war or national emergency — and remove the requirement for judicial oversight.\n \n\n   \n  Reporters Without Borders (RSF)  condemned the proposal , calling it “the first nail in the coffin of broadcast media’s editorial independence in Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  “Against a backdrop of war and an upcoming election campaign, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is seeking to silence voices critical of the far-right coalition in power,” said RSF editorial director Anne Bocandé. “These legislative attacks will have lasting, negative consequences on Israel’s media landscape,” she warned.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/government-shutdown-trump-rebate-checks-gop-health-care-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:04:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump’s shutdown win just landed Republicans with a huge political headache","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article analyzes how President Donald Trump’s failure to deliver on health care reform — particularly in the face of expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies — has created a major political crisis for Republicans.

just landed Republicans with a huge political headache \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:04 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s the Trump ship that never sails.\n \n\n   \n  The president was back at it on Monday, promising an imminent solution to America’s growing health care crisis — on which he has repeatedly failed to deliver in the past.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell you, we’re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time, where the people get the money,” President Donald Trump said, referring specifically to Americans thrown into crisis by  expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies . “We’re talking about trillions and trillions of dollars, where the people get the money,” he added, without giving details about a vague idea to  send cash to affected policyholders  to replace subsidies while bypassing insurance firms.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s off-the-cuff answer was a typical example of the waffle he sometimes conjures to escape a jam in a photo-op. But he could not disguise the downside of his “win” in the government shutdown, which looks set to end after Democrats failed to secure their top demand: the extension of  those enhanced Obamacare subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Republicans once again own the issue of health care, with millions of citizens —  not just those on ACA plans  — afflicted by rising premiums and high deductibles against the backdrop of a  wider cost-of-living crisis . And just as in his first term, Trump lacks a comprehensive, detailed plan to bring relief to citizens who lack health care, who can’t afford the plans they have or who know that the loss of a job could leave them without any coverage at all.\n \n\n   \n  If the GOP cannot fix the immediate issue of the subsidies — and convince voters they have a serious solution to this and other affordability questions — their  2026 midterm election hopes  could take a dive.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s fogginess on health care is nothing new. Repeated unfulfilled promises to act took their place alongside his much-lampooned “ infrastructure weeks ” as punch lines in his first term. Trump’s pledges to replace Obamacare shimmered with hyperbole but delivered nothing, and the 2010 law survives despite multiple Republican efforts to destroy it.\n \n\n   \n  During the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “terrific.” At rallies, he promised Americans new health care that would cost less but be far better. If that sounds impossible, it’s probably because it is.\n \n\n   \n  Early in his first term, Trump promised that change was on the way. “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!”  he wrote  on the website formerly known as Twitter in March 2017. The GOP failure to repeal Obamacare, partly because it couldn’t come up with an alternative, didn’t stop Trump’s sunny predictions. “The Republican Party will be soon be known as theparty of health care,”  the president declared  in March 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Second term, same as the first. In his debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024, Trump was mocked for  saying he had  “concepts of a plan” to make health care “better and less expensive.” More than a year later — and despite some significant efforts by Trump to bring down the cost of some prescription drugs — Americans are still waiting for his wider solutions.\n \n\n   \n    Republican divisions boil over health care\n \n\n   \n  The fight over health care was not just at the center of the government shutdown battle with Democrats. It’s tearing at Republican Party unity. It’s even estranged Trump and one of his most outspoken supporters,  Marjorie Taylor Greene . The Georgia representative broke ranks early in the shutdown to highlight  ACA insurance premiums  for her family that she said would double in price due to expiring subsidies. While no fan of the ACA, she lashed out at her own party. “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene wrote on X in October.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s persistent criticism is a warning sign for House Speaker Mike Johnson after he called back the House to vote on the Senate plan to reopen the government this week. It might explain why he was so keen to keep the chamber dark during a shutdown that set internal GOP dissent simmering. Greene further distanced herself from Trump on Monday, saying on X that he should spend less time meeting foreign leaders and instead hold “nonstop” meetings on domestic policy.\n \n\n   \n  The president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I don’t know what happened to Marjorie. She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think.” Greene then told CNN, “I haven’t lost my way. I’m 100% America first and only!”\n \n\n   \n  Greene might now be regarded as a MAGA heretic by some in Trump’s orbit. But her comments on health care raise another possibility — that she’s far more in tune with the economic insecurity felt by regular Americans than a billionaire president and his wealthy Cabinet.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not alone. During the shutdown, a group of endangered House Republicans  wrote to Johnson  to urge him to address expiring enhanced ACA subsidies when the government reopens. “While we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republican leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on extending enhanced Obamacare subsidies as part of the deal with moderate Democrats to reopen the government.Chances of a Democrat-written bill passing are slim. But the vote will put GOP senators on the record and on a political spot.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson hasn’t pledged to hold a similar vote — one reason why progressive Democrats are angry about centrist Senate Democrats’ compromise to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” Monday that he’d always been willing to talk about rising health care costs, but that Democrats had squandered weeks of valuable time by triggering the shutdown last month. He promised debate on a plan to get to the “root cause” of the health care issue. But that is unlikely to help ACA policyholders forced to decide now whether to give up health plans they can’t afford or pay punitively rising premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson could not tell Tapper whether there’d be a vote on this issue soon. “I’m not committing to it or not committing to it. What I’m saying is that we do a deliberative process. It’s the way this always works and we have to have time to do that,” the speaker said. But the tiny GOP majority gives little cause for optimism that an issue as complex and divisive as health care reform is something the fractious GOP and an absent president could handle.\n \n\n   \n  One tangible gain for Democrats in the shutdown drama was their highlighting of the ACA issue and attacks on Republicans for failing to fix health care. In  an NBC News poll  taken last month during the shutdown, 10% of respondents cited the cost of health care premiums as the single top issue deciding their vote for Congress next year. And 49% of respondents said Democrats would do a better job dealing with health care compared with 26% who thought the same of Republicans\n \n\n   \n   Many Democrats are furious  that their moderate Senate colleagues made a deal with Republicans to reopen the government because they see it as a betrayal of Americans on the health care issue. But Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who helped broker the deal and joined seven others in the Democratic caucus to back it, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan the deal would show whether Republicans were serious.\n \n\n   \n  “Finally, because of the shutdown fight, we’ve had a number of Republicans who have figured out that this is an issue for them,” the New Hampshire Democrat said. “So, now we’ll see. We’ll see if they are really going to work with us to make sure that Americans can afford their health insurance.”\n \n\n   \n  Viewing Democratic tactics, a cynic might wonder whether the party, which failed to make the enhanced Obamacare credits permanent during the Biden administration, laid a trap for Republicans on an issue their rivals always failed to solve, especially under Trump.\n \n\n   \n    How Trump has tried to lower some health care costs\n \n\n   \n  Republicans argue that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” domestic policy law had already made significant steps to make health care more affordable by loosening the power of insurance companies and by restoring choice and control, partly by  handing more responsibility to the states . But multiple health care analysts and groups say that the bill’s  cuts to Medicaid funding  could leave millions vulnerable to losing coverage and threaten many rural hospitals with closure.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has several initiatives designed to reduce the costs of prescription drugs for Americans. It plans to launch  TrumpRx , a direct-to-consumer website, early next year. Last week, the president unveiled a plan to make  certain obesity drugs  available for as little as $149 in an arrangement that gives pharmaceutical firms like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk tariff breaks. If this plan works, it could be lifesaving for many patients who can’t get the drugs through their insurers and can’t afford out-of-pocket prices to buy them.\n \n\n   \n  The initiative reflects Trump’s willingness to use government power to intervene in markets, which has also been seen in other sectors, and which flies in the face of conservative orthodoxy. A plan he recently floated to send money directly to ACA policyholders, instead of offering subsidies, also seems to spring from a similar motivation to shake up the industry.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the idea is fraught with uncertainties, including whether such payments would cover the shortfall of all the subsidies. Another question is whether it would simply make up the shortfall in subsidies to pay for premiums. Or would it be a separate payment that patients could use to pay for the costs of treatment directly?\n \n\n   \n  In the latter case of a payment that bypasses insurance firms, recipients might be exposed to massive costs if they get an adverse diagnosis.\n \n\n   \n  And spiking health costs don’t only afflict ACA policyholders. If the government sent cash to certain Americans, how would that be fair to other taxpayers? And wouldn’t state-financed payments for health care go against everything the GOP believes?\n \n\n   \n  Such thorny questions, and the president’s past failures to deliver on health care, explain the Republican Party’s new but familiar political nightmare on an issue that causes anxiety for tens of millions of voters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/small-plane-crash-coral-springs-fl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00.000Z","title":"2 Dead After Small Plane on Hurricane Relief Mission to Jamaica Crashes in Florida Neighborhood","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small Beechcraft King Air plane, registered to International Air Services, crashed shortly after takeoff from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport in Coral Springs, Florida, during a hurricane relief mission to Jamaica following Hurricane Melissa.

pond in a gated residential neighborhood of the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Coral Springs, killing two people shortly after takeoff and narrowly missing homes, authorities and a local resident said.\n \n\n   \n  The Coral Springs Police Department confirmed the deaths in a statement Monday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The victims were identified as a father and daughter: Alexander Wurm, 53, and his daughter Serena, 22, according to  Ignite the Fire Ministry .\n \n\n   \n  “Together, their final journey embodied selflessness and courage, reminding us of the power of service and love,” the group, which was founded by Alexander Wurm, said.\n \n\n   \n  Coral Springs-Parkland Fire Department Deputy Chief Mike Moser said emergency crews responded within minutes of a call reporting the crash. Initially, no victims were located during rescue efforts and they shifted to a recovery operation.\n \n\n   \n  Moser said no homes were damaged, but crews spotted some debris near the retention pond. Local aerial televised footage showed a broken fence in the backyard of one home bordering the pond where the plane went down.\n \n\n   \n  “There was no actual plane to be seen,” Moser said. “They followed the debris trail to the water.”\n \n\n   \n  Kenneth DeTrolio told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that he and his wife were in their home when the plane crashed through their backyard, destroying his fence and toppling palm trees before hitting the water. He said the impact left debris scattered across his yard and that his pool and back porch were “contaminated” with spilled fuel.\n \n\n   \n  The fuel smell was so strong inside his home that it took a few hours to dissipate, he added.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard the strangest sound. I never heard anything like it before, and apparently that was when this plane must have flown between my home and my neighbor’s house,” DeTrolio told the newspaper.\n \n\n   \n  Officials cautioned residents that police would maintain a significant presence in the area throughout Monday and Tuesday as investigators continue collecting evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Broward County, where the plane took off from and where the crash occurred, is home to a vibrant Caribbean American community that sprang into action to collect relief supplies following Hurricane Melissa. A powerful Category 5 hurricane, Melissa slammed into Jamaica late last month, leaving a path of destruction.\n \n\n   \n  Moser said police would take over recovery efforts, and federal aviation officials would investigate the cause of the crash.\n \n\n   \n  The small Beechcraft King Air plane took off from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport at approximately 10:14 a.m., according to a spokesperson for the City of Fort Lauderdale, which owns and operates the airport.\n \n\n   \n  The crash occurred soon after takeoff, with Coral Springs police officers and firemen responding at 10:19 a.m., just five minutes later.\n \n\n   \n  According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the plane was manufactured in 1976. King Air models can seat between seven and 12 people, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.\n \n\n   \n  Federal records showed the registered owner of the plane is listed as International Air Services, a company that markets itself as specializing in providing trust agreements to non-U.S. citizens that enable them to register their aircraft with the FAA.\n \n\n   \n  A person who answered the company’s phone Monday afternoon declined to answer questions from a reporter, stating “no comment” and ending the phone call.\n \n\n   \n  The flight tracking website FlightAware shows the plane made four other trips to or from Jamaica in the past week, traveling between George Town in the Cayman Islands and Montego Bay and Negril in Jamaica, before landing in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. It was not immediately clear who was organizing the trips.\n \n\n   \n  Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on October 28, tied for the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane in history. The storm also caused devastation in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic and prompted relief organizations to mobilize.\n \n\n   \n  Local government officials in Jamaica said in the days after the storm that Melissa had ripped the roofs off 120,000 structures, affecting some 90,000 families in the island’s especially hard-hit western region. A week after Melissa’s landfall in Jamaica, more than 2,000 people were still reported to be in shelters.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/india/india-new-delhi-pollution-diwali-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"02:50:00-04:30","title":"After festival of lights, New Delhi plunged into toxic darkness and world’s most polluted air","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Diwali celebrations, New Delhi recorded the most polluted air in the world, with PM2.5 levels exceeding 40 times the World Health Organization’s guideline.

typically worst, when millions of farmers in surrounding regions burn stubble in their fields to clear the way for the next crop.\n \n\n   \n  The sharp deterioration in air quality this week comes following celebrations for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, which traditionally involves the widespread use of firecrackers which release sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides into the air, as well as harmful heavy metals.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, authorities enacted a complete ban on making, selling or using firecrackers in New Delhi, citing hazardous pollution levels.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the Supreme Court permitted the use of so-called “green” firecrackers – which manufacturers claim are less polluting – but only within a certain time window. However, residents reported that this curfew was poorly enforced, with people bursting firecrackers long after the deadline, and that “non-green” firecrackers still appeared to be available.\n \n\n   \n  “Year on year, it goes from bad to worse,” said resident Anushka Singh.\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year-old graphic designer said she usually stays at home at Diwali with her dog, to “help him through the incessant noise that doesn’t stop until late at night or early morning.”\n \n\n   \n  She described how her throat becomes scratchy, and her eyes begin to burn as she steps out of her home the day after Diwali.\n \n\n   \n  “Living in Delhi is a pain… I just wish that given the decades of data we would at least have stricter rules, ones that are actually implemented,” Singh said.\n \n\n   \n  Chandra Tandon, 52, who owns a corner store in the capital, said bursting crackers are “part of the fun and happens once a year,” but agreed that it becomes “difficult” for people who must endure the aftermath.\n \n\n   \n  “I was breathing in those fumes throughout and it’s definitely not good,” she said. “It would be good if we left the crackers burning to the kids… If you’ve lived in Delhi long enough, you know how bad it gets every year with the pollution. So, adults at least should do their part.”\n \n\n   \n    A long-term crisis\n \n\n   \n  Despite the city being the political heart of the country, officials have had little success in cleaning up Delhi’s toxic air.\n \n\n   \n  Previous attempts to curb pollution have included sprinkling water on the roads, restricting traffic by requiring vehicles with odd or even license plates to travel on alternating days, and constructing in 2018 two smog towers worth 200 million rupees ($2.4 million), intended to act as giant air purifiers.\n \n\n   \n  But a lack of strict enforcement and coordination means progress has been slow, experts suggest.\n \n\n   \n  India is also desperate to fuel its booming economy and meet the energy needs of its 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, three Indian cities, including New Delhi, were ranked among the world’s most polluted, according to air quality tracker IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  Kolkata in the east was in fourth place, while Mumbai in the west ranked number 10.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/asia/thailand-suspends-peace-accord-cambodia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:39:00-11:39","title":"Thailand ‘halts’ peace agreement with Cambodia hailed by Trump after landmine explosion injures troops","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thailand has reversed course on a peace agreement with Cambodia, signed in late October 2025 in Malaysia with the involvement of US President Donald Trump, after a landmine explosion on the border injured four Thai soldiers.

Winthai Suvaree, spokesperson for the Royal Thai Army.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand accused Cambodia of laying fresh landmines following the removal of a barbed wire fence, which was discovered on November 9.\n \n\n   \n  Winthai said the discovery “violates the signed joint declaration and will inevitably impact Thailand’s stance and various agreements.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot independently verify the claims that Cambodian troops laid fresh landmines.\n \n\n   \n  The Cambodian government said in a statement it “categorically denies the allegations,” adding that it has not deployed new landmines “and will never do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia also said it is “gravely concerned” about reports that Thailand has suspended the peace declaration and it remains committed to implementing the peace accord.\n \n\n   \n  “Most minefields, from nearly three decades of Cambodia’s civil wars of the 1970s and 1980s, along the Cambodia-Thailand border have not yet been cleared due to the difficult terrains and the un-demarcated status of the border areas,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The situation remains calm,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense spokesperson said Tuesday after military forces from both sides communicated following the landmine explosion.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement from Thailand also calls into question the already tentative release of 18 Cambodian prisoners of war, who were scheduled to be handed over under the terms of the declaration.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile peace agreement\n \n\n   \n  In late October, Trump traveled to Malaysia as part of his three-leg tour of Asia and presided over the signing of a  peace declaration  between the leaders of Thailand Cambodia amid lavish praise of the US president for his mediation efforts in the border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was considered by Trump as a major diplomatic victory, and another fillip to his much vaunted –  and often over-exaggerated  – campaign to have ended several wars.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought brief skirmishes in recent decades over their disputed border and the fighting earlier was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the latest border flare-up and traded blame for the clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had warned the two leaders that he would not make trade deals with either if the conflict continued – a threat that came as both faced elevated tariffs from the US under Trump’s global trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration included a commitment to withdraw heavy weapons from the border, de-mining efforts, and to de-escalate tensions that erupted into the brief but deadly border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement was built on the truce signed in July, but fell short of a “peace treaty,” despite Trump  repeatedly describing  it as such. And  analysts had cautioned  of a long road ahead before a lasting peace deal would be achieved.\n \n\n   \n  Anutin had qualified the signing ceremony as a “concrete step towards peace” that would hinge on “full implementation” of the declaration. And Thai diplomats were carefully reticent about the joint declaration, calling it a “reaffirmation” of a ceasefire  both sides agreed  to in July.\n \n\n   \n  Hun Manet, the prime minister of Cambodia announced at the time “a strong commitment to fully and faithfully implementing this joint declaration.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue of landmines along the Thai-Cambodia border has also been a major point of contention for the Thais. The most recent border flare-up came after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion, with the incident prompting Thailand to downgrade diplomatic relations with its neighbor.\n \n\n   \n  In recent decades, Thailand and Cambodia have had a complicated relationship of both cooperation and rivalry. The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border – largely mapped by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony – that has periodically seen military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia has previously sought a ruling from the UN’s International Court of Justice over disputed areas. However, Thailand does not recognize the ICJ’s jurisdiction and claims that some areas along the border were never fully demarcated, including the sites of several ancient temples.\n \n\n   \n  The site of the most recent landmine explosion was in an area close to Cambodia’s Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site that has been at the center of previous military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration did not resolve the territorial dispute over the two countries’ shared border.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/new-delhi-explosion-red-fort-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:58:00Z","title":"India on edge after deadly car explosion in capital","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly car explosion occurred in a historic part of Delhi, India, near the Red Fort on November 11, 2025, killing at least 10 people and injuring over 30 others.

The area, a major tourist hub known for its crowded bazaars and street vendors, was immediately thrown into chaos.\n \n\n   \n  The incident, a rare occurrence for the sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million people, unleashed a scene of devastation in the heart of Delhi.\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the aftermath showed thick, orange flames billowing into the pitch-black sky, vehicles twisted and charred from the blast and victims strewn across the street.\n \n\n   \n  The cause of the blast is not yet known, and the Indian government has yet to blame any specific group. Comments from top government officials on Tuesday have begun to suggest the act was a deliberate one.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from Bhutan, where he is on a visit, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the “horrific incident” in Delhi “has deeply saddened everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was in touch with all the agencies investigating this incident throughout last night. Our agencies will get to the bottom of this conspiracy,” he said in Hindi, before breaking out into English: “All those responsible will be brought to justice.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s defense minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the “findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice and will not be spared under any circumstances,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Delhi police are investigating the case under various sections of India’s anti-terror law, North Delhi deputy commissioner of police, Raja Banthia, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  More than 30 other people were “badly injured” in the blast, said Dr. Manish Kumar Jha, a physician at the local Lok Nayak Hospital. “Many are not in a position of recovering,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  Before the explosion, a “slow-moving” vehicle “came to a stop” near a red light around 6:42 p.m. local time, Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “An explosion occurred in that vehicle. The passengers in the vehicle and people in surrounding vehicles were impacted,” Golcha said.\n \n\n   \n  At least six vehicles and three autorickshaws were set on fire, Reuters reported, citing Delhi’s deputy fire chief.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency crews then arrived at the scene and extinguished the blaze – after receiving a call at 6:55 p.m. local time, Sumit Kumar, a Delhi fire services official, told CNN. Survivors were taken to a nearby hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Residents recalled hearing a loud bang in the neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard a big sound. Our windows shook,” one resident who did not give a name told Indian broadcaster NDTV, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  An ambulance driver said he could “only find bodies” when they reached the site of the blast.\n \n\n   \n  “The bodies were in parts, and we had to pick different parts and bring them back in the ambulances, and later brought them to the hospital,” he told local news agency ANI.\n \n\n   \n  One man said his nephew, an e-rickshaw driver, died in the blast. His family tried calling him late Monday but couldn’t get through.\n \n\n   \n  “When we came here, we had to identify the body,” he told ANI.\n \n\n   \n  Relatives of the casualties could be seen weeping outside a local hospital.\n \n\n   \n    India on edge\n \n\n   \n  The ripple effect from Monday’s blast has been felt across India.\n \n\n   \n  Airports, railway stations, government buildings and heritage sites across the country have been put on high alert, according to the Central Industrial Security Force, and the Red Fort will remain  closed  for three days as the investigation continues. The US embassy in New Delhi is advising Americans to avoid the surrounding area as well as large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  The states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which neighbors Delhi, has also been put on high alert, according to police.\n \n\n   \n  Security arrangements “of important establishments, religious sites, crowded places, and other sensitive points” will be reviewed, Uttar Pradesh police  wrote  on X. The state, India’s most populous, is home to the Taj Mahal and other major tourist attractions.\n \n\n   \n  Haryana’s head of police, OP Singh, urged residents to “remain calm” and report any “suspicious person or unclaimed object” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  The northwestern state of Rajasthan is also on high alert, its police department  said  on X.\n \n\n   \n  In the financial capital of Mumbai, train stations have been put on high alert, Reuters reported, citing authorities.\n \n\n   \n    Historic monument\n \n\n   \n  The Red Fort stands as one of India’s most significant historical landmarks.\n \n\n   \n  Originally built by Emperor Shah Jahan as the palace-fort of his capital, it served as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.

Apple’s App Store as of Tuesday and the apps had been erased from locally adapted platforms that serve Android devices.\n \n\n   \n  The Google Play Store app is blocked in China as part of the government’s vast censorship apparatus known as the ‘Great Firewall’.\n \n\n   \n  China operates one of the world’s  most extensive  online censorship and surveillance regimes that scrubs political dissent and criticism of the ruling Communist Party’s leadership and  ideologies , including a drive against feminine portrayals of men in pop culture.\n \n\n   \n  China’s LGBTQ+ community has faced an intensifying crackdown since Xi Jinping came to power more than a decade ago. Authorities have ramped up control over what they consider the undue influence of Western values, with  Pride parades canceled,  films and TV shows featuring same-sex themes banned, and China’s most popular messaging app WeChat  shutting down dozens of LGBTQ accounts. \n \n\n   \n  There has been no official announcement about the apps’ removal from the app stores in China, where regulators routinely remove content without explanation. But a source familiar with the matter told CNN that it appeared to be related to compliance issues.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Apple, Blued, Finka and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment.\n \n\n   \n  The apps have been accused of carrying pornography or “vulgar content” on its platforms, the source said.\n \n\n   \n  Apple said it removed the apps from its China store after a request from the country’s internet regulator,  tech website Wired reported .\n \n\n   \n  “Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,” the phone maker said in a statement to Wired, adding: “We follow the laws in the countries where we operate.”\n \n\n   \n  Blued’s international version HeeSay remains searchable on app stores outside of China, while Finka operates solely within the country.\n \n\n   \n  The apps are hugely popular, with Blued reported as having 54 million registered users worldwide in 2020 and Finka 2.7 million, according to state media CGTN.\n \n\n   \n    Tightening space\n \n\n   \n  The latest narrowing of LGBTQ+ space came as the Supreme Court in the US  declined to revisit  its landmark precedent recognizing same-sex marriage. The Trump administration, however, has been scaling back federal diversity programs while piling pressure on the private sector to end similar initiatives.\n \n\n   \n  China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 but does not recognize same-sex marriage.\n \n\n   \n  This is not the first time China has reined in gay-dating apps. Grindr, which targets the international market, was removed from mobile app stores in China in 2022, citing difficulties to comply with a new privacy law.\n \n\n   \n  Blued, launched in 2012 to offer the local market a more approachable alternative, continued to operate alongside its rival Finka, which targets a younger demographic.\n \n\n   \n  Blued’s parent company BlueCity acquired Finka in 2020, a year after its debut.\n \n\n   \n  One user, surnamed Zhao, told CNN that the two apps enabled friends to meet especially in the less cosmopolitan parts of the country where places for gay people to gather are almost non-existent.\n \n\n   \n  “I just feel that there hasn’t been that much space offline for the gay community to begin with. Now that the online space is also being restricted, I feel that the space of the community is getting smaller and smaller,” said the 30-year-old, who gave only his family name for fear of speaking out against the authorities.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear if their removal from Chinese app stores is permanent.\n \n\n   \n  Reinstatement is possible if the companies take steps to comply with Chinese regulators, the source who spoke to CNN said, although they were not optimistic, citing the tightening “ideological environment.”\n \n\n   \n  “Things are just difficult right now,” the source said, adding that Blued would likely have to “lay low and even transform” to survive.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-inflation-us-tension-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:01:00-05:00","title":"Amid tensions with US, high inflation is back on Venezuela’s streets","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela is facing a severe economic crisis as inflation soars to 270% annually and the bolivar depreciates by 70% against the US dollar since mid-2025.

inflation is back on Venezuela’s streets \n       \n  By Stefano Pozzebon, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:01 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces growing US  military pressure  and calls for his resignation, an old foe is returning to haunt him in his own backyard: Inflation, one of Venezuela’s chronic economic maladies, is on the rise again.\n \n\n   \n  “Prices are growing every day,” said Yon Michael Hernandez, 25, a motorcycle taxi driver in the slum of Petare, east of Caracas.\n \n\n   \n  “Corn flour is 220 bolivars today, it may be 240 tomorrow and 260 the day after, and the same package that might have cost you one dollar 15 days ago is worth three now,” Hernandez told CNN. He referred to the Venezuelan currency and to the pre-cooked flour used to make  arepas,  the ubiquitous corn pancakes that are a daily staple.\n \n\n   \n  In the three months since the Pentagon deployed warships and aircraft in a campaign that the White House said was aimed at drug traffickers from Venezuela, the bolivar has depreciated around 70% against the US dollar, according to data from the central bank, hemorrhaging one point every day.\n \n\n   \n  In the illegal but widely used currency black market, the drop has been just as steep. At the official rate, the US dollar is pegged at about 231 Venezuelan bolivars. On the black market, a dollar is worth roughly a third more. The Venezuelan government prohibits publishing black market exchange rates.\n \n\n   \n  The surge in inflation is linked – although only partially – with the growing tensions between the Trump administration and the Maduro government, which has been under US Treasury Department sanctions for almost a decade.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has accused the United States of seeking to oust him after more than 12 years in power and one year after he controversially claimed to win a presidential election that many international observers accused him of stealing.\n \n\n   \n  While a military attack on Venezuelan soil may not materialize, the economic outlook is firmly in the red once again, after a change of policies gave the country a much-needed boost in the years immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Only last year, Maduro boasted about the results of those reforms, claiming his country’s GDP was growing at 8% and that inflation was at the lowest rate in four decades. The autocratic leader no longer makes such claims.\n \n\n   \n  According to the United Nations, Venezuela historically does not produce enough food to meet its needs, and many products must be imported from abroad and paid for in foreign currencies.\n \n\n   \n  This also means the market is particularly exposed when the bolivar loses value.\n \n\n   \n  For many Venezuelans, still reeling from years of hyper-inflation before the pandemic lockdowns, the new price hikes revive a familiar nightmare.\n \n\n   \n  “Not many people are purchasing these days. Those who can try to buy as little as possible,” said Marjorie Yanez, 40, a street-food seller in Caracas. “Dollars get more expensive every day, and that is bad for retailers like us because we also must raise our prices every day.”\n \n\n   \n  A typical breakfast of croissant and  café con leche  now can easily cost the equivalent of $8 to $10 at a bakery in Caracas, while the country’s official minimum wage is less than a dollar a month.\n \n\n   \n  The stream of remittances from relatives abroad, a consequence of more than 7 million Venezuelans fleeing the country under Maduro to look for better opportunities elsewhere, is also falling short.\n \n\n   \n  “I had to increase how much I send back to my parents every month, but even with that, it’s not enough. They can barely make ends meet,” said Diego Mejias, 35, an architect in neighboring Colombia who provides for his parents in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n    War on inflation, one detention at a time\n \n\n   \n  The central bank stopped publishing inflation reports in October last year, when the country had managed to keep the rate at single digits for 20 straight months.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly afterward, things began to unravel.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Venezuelan security forces briefly detained several economists, including former finance minister Rodrigo Cabezas, for sharing pessimistic views. The interior minister called their comments destabilizing. Critics denounced the arrests as baseless.\n \n\n   \n  The economists were later released, but publishing economic figures remains taboo.\n \n\n   \n  For this report, CNN spoke with two private consultants who have access to reliable economic data. Both spoke anonymously for fear of government retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also contacted Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who is in charge of Venezuela’s finances, and is waiting for a response.\n \n\n   \n  Both consultants estimated that inflation in Caracas is currently running between 20% and 30% a month and is destined to keep rising as long as the bolivar depreciation continues.\n \n\n   \n  Prices are slightly cheaper outside the capital in regions such as Tachira or Zulia, closer to the Colombian border, where many imported products cross into Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Faced with the economic malaise, the government has cracked down on the black market for US dollars. In June, Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced the detention of 58 people on charges of “manipulating exchange rates.” Authorities also seized a dozen web pages advertising the sale of dollars and euros at rates different from the official one by the central bank.\n \n\n   \n  The moves have done little to stop the bolivar’s fall.\n \n\n   \n    Several causes\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s annual inflation at about 270%, the highest in the world and a sharp increase from the 180% rate it estimated in April.\n \n\n   \n  For 2026, the outlook is even bleaker. The IMF forecasts Venezuela’s inflation to top 600% by next October.\n \n\n   \n  The bolivar’s plunge can be partially explained by the US military’s show of force, as nervous Venezuelans seek to purchase hard currency as a hedge against an uncertain future. But that is only one of the causes, the consultants told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  US sanctions against the Venezuelan oil sector, which is the nation’s largest source of foreign exchange by far, are also partially to blame.\n \n\n   \n  In July, the Trump administration renegotiated a license authorizing Chevron, a major US oil company, to export Venezuelan crude. Under the new terms of the license, Chevron was authorized to pay fees and royalties to Venezuela in oil but not in cash, effectively reducing Chevron’s crude exports from the country by half, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  CNN contacted Chevron for comment but has not received a response.\n \n\n   \n  The change has proved costly because Venezuela lost one of its few remaining sources of legitimate income. As a result, the government is now forced to sell even more oil on the black market at a discount to evade US government sanctions, one of the economists in Caracas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The future is crypto\n \n\n   \n  To make up for the missing income, the government recently allowed private companies to sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for the depreciated bolivar, with exchange houses openly supported by a new crypto-managing regulator, the National Superintendence of Crypto Assets, known as Sunacrip.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Reuters reported that the government was preparing to increase usage of crypto assets in its oil exports to overcome the US sanctions. According to the specialized data collector Chainanalysis, Venezuela is second only to Brazil for crypto adoption rates in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Today, thousands of Venezuelans – from corporate bankers to retirees – regularly purchase US dollars on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It is even common to see shoppers at grocery stores trading currencies in the checkout lines.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone has embraced the new normal. “Sending money to Venezuela has always been a mess,” said Mejias, the architect in Colombia. “Now it’s even more confusing to understand what rate is good and what is not, and for old people like my parents, even more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/senate-vote-government-shutdown-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:50:00.000-05:00","title":"Senate votes to end government shutdown, sending funding bill to the House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate narrowly approved a bipartisan funding measure to end a 41-day government shutdown, with eight Democratic senators and one independent voting with Republicans.

Rimmer, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:50 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A small band of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans on Monday night to approve a funding measure to reopen the federal government — without securing their party’s demand to guarantee an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which help millions of Americans afford insurance.\n \n\n   \n  The funding compromise will now go to the House, where GOP leaders are hopeful it could pass as soon as Wednesday and end the longest-ever US shutdown. The recently struck deal, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign, would restore critical services like federal food aid, as well as pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  Eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus crossed the aisle to join with Republicans in the 60 to 40 vote. One Republican voted in opposition: Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  That shutdown has been politically painful on Capitol Hill. Republicans have repeatedly shouldered blame in  recent polling  for the funding lapse. And the deal, struck by Democratic centrists in the Senate, has ignited a fight within the party about its strategy in the already 41-day funding fight — and where they go next.\n \n\n   \n  Most Democrats were eager to keep fighting even as centrists declared that with Trump dug in, there was no real chance of securing policy wins on health care. Instead, those centrists secured the promise of a future vote on a health care bill of their choosing, which Democrats are determined to win GOP support on. It is far from guaranteed, however, that the bill will survive the Senate, let alone the House.\n \n\n   \n  The vote late Monday night caps a frenetic few days of negotiations inside the US Capitol, with quiet negotiations between the Senate centrists, GOP leaders and the White House throughout the weekend before formally unveiling their deal on Sunday. A bloc of eight members of the Democratic caucus took a critical first step to support that measure Sunday night, and all eight gave it final approval on Monday night.\n \n\n   \n  Those eight lawmakers were: Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin, Maggie Hassan, Tim Kaine, Jeanne Shaheen, Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman, Jacky Rosen and Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  While he did not vote for the final deal, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has drawn fury from the party’s left for allowing those centrists to strike the deal without any real wins on the Affordable Care Act subsidies that will soon expire and hike premiums for millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Many Democrats in both chambers believe the party will be forced to relive the fight again on January 30, when the next tranche of funding runs out. The broader legislative package, however, would fund several key agencies, including ones that run federal food aid, as well as the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program, and veterans programs, through the remainder of fiscal year 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Now, attention will turn to House Speaker Mike Johnson and members of the House, who are making their way to Washington after being in their districts since mid-September.\n \n\n   \n  The House plans to vote on the Senate-passed bill to reopen the federal government as early as 4 p.m. on Wednesday, according to a notice from Majority Whip Tom Emmer. The notice forecasts multiple votes that day.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican speaker is likely to need the president’s help to muscle the package through his fractious conference in the coming days. But in an optimistic sign Monday, Trump told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins “I would say so” when asked if he personally approved of the deal making its way through the process on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, based on everything I’m hearing, they haven’t changed anything, and we have support from enough Democrats, and we’re going to be opening up our country,” Trump said. “It’s too bad it was closed, but we’ll be opening up our country very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ellis Kim contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/weather/arctic-blast-chicago-snow-climate-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"03:19:00-05:00","title":"Over a foot of snow piles up in the Great Lakes as Arctic blast peaks in the eastern US","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A record-breaking cold snap driven by an Arctic air mass pushed south and east across the United States, creating extreme winter conditions in the Midwest and southeastern states.

in the Great Lakes as Arctic blast peaks in the eastern US \n       \n  By CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Chris Dolce\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:19 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Intense lake-effect snow is creating dangerous travel conditions   in the Great Lakes   and it’s all   being fueled by a record cold snap sending the eastern half of the United States into a brief bout of winter.\n \n\n   \n  The snow developed Sunday night into Monday in Chicago along with thunder and strong winds. Forecasts for the city on Sunday called for potentially historic November snow totals over 10 inches, but the heaviest bands of snow have spared the downtown area from those kinds of totals Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Lake-effect snow totals  often swing wildly from location to location  depending on where heavier bands develop because of how narrow they are.\n \n\n   \n  That’s what happened Monday near Lake Michigan. Up to a foot of snow fell more than 50 miles south of Chicago, and totals north of the city from far northeast Illinois into southeast Wisconsin topped 10 inches. Dangerous travel conditions from snow and strong winds were reported early Monday along Interstate 57 south of Chicago in Kankakee and northern Iroquois counties in Illinois, the  National Weather Service said. \n \n\n   \n  The snow threat stretches beyond Chicago across the Great Lakes. It’s being spawned by a rush of Arctic air that’s unusually cold for November pushing south and east and threatening dozens of low temperature records as far south as Florida over the next couple of days.\n \n\n   \n  Over a foot of snow fell in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and northwest Indiana. Several inches of snow are piling up   in the eastern Great Lakes through Tuesday, particularly in the snow belts of northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and southwest New York. Places like Cleveland, Ohio; Erie, Pennsylvania and Buffalo, New York will likely still be dealing with snow falling during the morning commute on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n    Record-setting cold to start the week\n \n\n   \n  This brutal winter-like setup in the Midwest is being driven by the same Arctic air mass that’s crashing across the eastern two-thirds of the country. This isn’t just a “cold front.” This is a full-scale polar plunge.\n \n\n   \n  Some southeastern cities could face some of their coldest early-November temperatures in decades on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n  Daily record lows will be threatened in parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, the Carolinas, southeast Louisiana and even Florida. That includes places like Birmingham and Huntsville in Alabama, Baton Rouge in Louisiana, Savannah in Georgia and Tampa and Fort Myers in Florida.\n \n\n   \n  Jacksonville, Florida, is predicted to hit 30 degrees Tuesday morning, marking the earliest it’s been that cold in fall since 1976. That would also be the case in Savannah, Georgia, if the low drops to 28 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  Tuesday daytime highs in Florida could be some of the coldest on record for the date. Melbourne, Florida, could see its earliest day below 60 degrees since records began there more than 85 years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Cold weather advisories for wind chills in the 20s or lower 30s have been issued in Florida for Monday night into Tuesday morning as far south as Naples. Freeze warnings cover parts of several other states in the Southeast.\n \n\n   \n  Washington, DC, and New York City are also likely to log their coldest morning of the stretch on Tuesday. DC could wake up near 30 degrees﻿ with New York City near freezing. Morning wind chills in both cities could sit in the lower to mid-20s.\n \n\n   \n  Snow has spread to other regions as well. Lake-effect snow continues downwind of the Great Lakes. Places like Charleston, West Virginia, on the west slopes of the central Appalachians picked up several inches Monday. Higher elevations from West Virginia through the border of North Carolina and Tennessee also saw snow pile up quickly. A few flakes even fell as far south as Atlanta on Monday afternoon.\n \n\n   \n  The good news: The cold snap won’t stick around long. Temperatures across the central US rebound quickly on Tuesday, and most of the East warms up again on Wednesday.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/asia/suharto-indonesia-national-hero-explainer-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"02:39:00-11:11","title":"He Was a US-Backed Dictator Who Led Sweeping Massacres.

Why is he now being named a national hero? \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:39 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For decades, he was a feared US-backed dictator whose regime oversaw bloody Cold War-era massacres, accused of diverting huge amounts of state money to propel his family into luxury and political power.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, he was posthumously named a national hero of Indonesia – prompting protests from human rights groups and victims who decried the award as whitewashing a repressive regime that left hundreds of thousands dead, according to historians.\n \n\n   \n  Former President Suharto was granted the title in a ceremony by Indonesia’s current leader, Prabowo Subianto – Suharto’s former son-in-law, himself a divisive figure as a former general who faced his own allegations of human rights abuses while in uniform.\n \n\n   \n  “A prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,” an announcer said during the award presentation,  according to Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  But as the roiling controversy shows, that characterization is hotly debated – and Suharto’s legacy is anything but straightforward.\n \n\n   \n    Who was Suharto?\n \n\n   \n  Born in 1921 when Indonesia was still a Dutch colony, Suharto rose to power after the country gained independence in 1949, climbing the army ranks to become a five-star general.\n \n\n   \n  Then came a bloodbath in 1965, sparked by a failed coup and the murder of a number of generals in the military.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto blamed the coup on communists, ousted then-President Sukarno – the country’s first post-independence leader – and sanctioned a hunt for those responsible.\n \n\n   \n  What ensued was a nationwide purge of alleged communists overseen by Suharto’s powerful military, with human rights groups and historians estimating that between 500,000 to one million people were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The United States supported the anti-communist massacres, providing lists of senior communist party officials, equipment and money to the Indonesian army, according to official documents that were  declassified in 2017 .\n \n\n   \n  In one document in late 1965, the US embassy in Jakarta sent a cable to Washington calling the crackdowns a “fantastic switch which has occurred over 10 short weeks,” along with an estimate that 100,000 people had been slaughtered, according to  the Associated Press .\n \n\n   \n  Many contend that those targeted during the purges were not communists but ethnic Chinese, or anyone with left wing views.\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, an international tribunal at the Hague found that the US, United Kingdom, and Australia were  all complicit  in the mass killings of 1965, which were deemed crimes against humanity.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto stayed in power for 31 years, during which he cracked down on critics and political opponents, and enforced his regime’s rule over territories including East Timor, Aceh, West  Papua  and the Maluku islands.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those territories were invaded with the tacit support of Western allies keen to prop up an anti-communist leader, at a time when proxy conflicts backed by the US and the Soviet Union raged across the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  He is praised by some for policies that fueled rapid economic growth and relative political stability. But at the same time, he siphoned off huge sums of money from state coffers, funding his family’s rich lifestyle and fueling public resentment.\n \n\n   \n  His rule finally came to an end in 1998 after the Asian financial crisis threw the country into economic turmoil, prompting widespread protests and forcing Suharto to resign – one of the last people power movements to sweep Southeast Asia and replace a Cold War-era autocrat with democracy.\n \n\n   \n  In the following years, Suharto’s children were prosecuted, and his youngest was convicted of corruption. In 2015, the Supreme Court ordered Suharto’s family to  pay back millions  in embezzled funds to the state.\n \n\n   \n  But Suharto himself never answered to his victims. Due to health problems in his final years, he died in 2008 without ever standing trial. He denied any wrongdoing until his death, at one point calling the embezzlement allegations “slander and defamation.”\n \n\n   \n    Why would Prabowo name Suharto a national hero?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not lost on many that Suharto was granted the posthumous honor by Prabowo – a longtime supporter of Suharto’s regime, and once a part of the strongman’s family.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo married Suharto’s daughter in 1983, though they divorced after Suharto was forced from power.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo was also a military commander during Suharto’s reign and served in controversial campaigns in West Papua and East Timor, casting doubts over his own human rights record. He is accused of kidnapping activists during the 1998 mass protests that led to Suharto’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo has always denied the allegations that led to his dismissal from the military in 1998, the same year Indonesia broke free from Suharto’s authoritarian rule.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo was  elected president in 2024  – with Suharto’s  former party, Golkar , throwing its support behind the candidate. During  his victory speech , Prabowo paid tribute to Suharto and thanked his ex-wife.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, some human rights experts voiced concerns that his presidency risked backsliding on the democratic gains made since Suharto’s authoritarian regime.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Prabowo has expanded the military’s role into what were considered civilian areas, measures  heavily criticized  by civil society groups who say it would bring Indonesia back to Suharto-era militarism and authoritarianism.\n \n\n   \n  Besides Prabowo’s involvement, there are also still a number of Suharto loyalists in Indonesia. His political heirs have also tried to  redeem his image  in the last decade, portraying him instead as a strong leader who brought stability to the country.\n \n\n   \n  In places like Kemusuk, a village near Yogyakarta where he was born, his image is everywhere – from museum memorabilia celebrating his life to the souvenir T-shirts with his smiling face.\n \n\n   \n  Discussion of his rule remains largely taboo in Indonesia, with mixed opinions about his legacy.\n \n\n   \n    What has been the response?\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the ceremony on Monday, activists gathered last week in Jakarta to protest against the act, holding placards that read: “Human rights violator” and “Suharto is not a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  Human rights groups lambasted the choice, with Amnesty International describing it as an attempt to rewrite history and pointing out Prabowo’s familial ties to Suharto.\n \n\n   \n  Andreas Harsono, the Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, also condemned the move.\n \n\n   \n  “The failure to hold (Soharto) and his abusive generals to account facilitates the whitewashing and distortion of history that is now taking place under Prabowo,” he wrote  in a statement .\n \n\n   \n  “This will make it even harder for Indonesian authorities now, and in the future, to end impunity for serious human rights violations and obtain justice for the victims and their families.”\n \n\n   \n  The title especially stings for the many survivors of violence and persecution under Suharto’s rule – and the families of his victims.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked, disappointed and angry with this government’s absurd decision,” Bedjo Untung told the  Associated Press.  Untong was imprisoned without trial for alleged Communist links between 1970-1979, during which he was tortured and his family faced hardship and discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels deeply unfair, we are still living with the suffering until today,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto’s defenders have taken a different view.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to defend it ourselves… nothing is being hidden,” Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, Suharto’s daughter, told journalists after the ceremony on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have expressed our gratitude to the president for appointing our father as the national hero and maybe because he is also a soldier so he knows what my father had done,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/senate-vote-negotiations-deal-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:11:00.000-05:00","title":"Bipartisan Deal Ends 38-Day Government Shutdown After Weeks of Negotiations","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After 38 days of a government shutdown, a bipartisan agreement was reached between moderate Democrats and Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, ending the crisis.

By Monday evening, the Senate had  voted 60-40   to pass the measure, which now heads to the House before  President Donald Trump  – who’s signaled support — can sign anything.\n \n\n   \n  The government could now be reopened by the end of the week. What comes next is far less certain, with questions looming about the fallout for both parties as Democrats face internal recriminations and Republicans are forced to grapple with the political liabilities of rising health care premiums.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has sought to limit its public comments on the deal, wary of disrupting a tentative agreement that still faces a tricky path through the House. But internally, the sudden end to the impasse prompted a sense of vindication that the outcome that officials had predicted for weeks had finally come to pass, people familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his top aides had decided in September to take a hard line against negotiating with Democrats, confident that the party would cave as soon as it became clear they wouldn’t win any concessions from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he made a mistake in going too far,” Trump told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in an interview Monday about Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against the deal later Monday but who had been kept in the loop on the moderates’ conversations with Thune, one of the sources familiar said.\n \n\n   \n  “He just went too far. He thought he could break the Republicans, and the Republicans broke him,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  But reaching that point took far longer than anyone in the White House anticipated; many officials believed Democrats would fold in a matter of hours to days. It also came at a cost, with Trump and Republicans taking the brunt of the public blame for the shutdown, culminating in a brutal set of state-level electoral losses last week.\n \n\n   \n  Spooked by those results, Trump in recent days had begun urging Republicans to abandon their strategy and unilaterally open the government by  eliminating the filibuster  — an idea that proved deeply unpopular with GOP leaders and succeeded only in dividing his party.\n \n\n   \n  Yet even as urgency built within the administration to find an end to the shutdown, officials contended that a similar level of pressure must be building on the Democratic side. In the weeks leading up to Sunday’s breakthrough, Trump aides  had privately discussed minor concessions  they might be willing to make to help Republican senators clinch an eventual deal, two people familiar with the deliberations said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, few expected the opportunity would come when it did, with Democrats riding high from the elections and their base louder than ever in urging them to hold the line.\n \n\n   \n  As the talks between Democratic moderates and Thune accelerated, some of the potential concessions that aides had contemplated quickly became a central component of the bipartisan agreement, as Democrats pressed for a reversal of the mass firings of federal workers that the administration had carried out during the shutdown and protections against future layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The White House agreed. On Monday, Kaine told CNN that a provision barring further reductions in force through January had been key to convincing him to sign on to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the one negotiating the federal worker protections, and when I got a yes from the White House at 4:45 yesterday on the key component of guaranteeing no future RIFs, that was very persuasive to me,” the Virginia Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats were also able to secure furloughed federal employees’ back pay — but not the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that had been their original and consistent demand.\n \n\n   \n  The acceptance of the deal came from a realization among Democrats that Republicans simply were not going to cave on that issue.\n \n\n   \n  “The question I was wrestling with is: if the tactic isn’t working and there were no prospects that it was going to work, then let’s move on, not make a lot of other people suffer in order to get a goal that wasn’t attainable,” King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said on CNN Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  There was immediate blowback. Leading Democratic figures and potential 2028 presidential candidates railed against the deal and its negotiators. House Democratic leadership even urged their members to put out statements calling on Democratic senators to hold the line Sunday night, a source familiar with the messaging push told CNN, and a range of House Democrats rushed to announce their “no” votes.\n \n\n   \n  But within the group of eight Democratic senators, the lawmakers argued that they’d made the only sensible move available, especially as the pain mounted for everyday Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I understand that not all of my Democratic colleagues are satisfied with this agreement, but waiting another week or another month wouldn’t deliver a better outcome,” said Shaheen, who’s not running for reelection to her New Hampshire seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  While the quartet of Democratic former governors had worked in overdrive through a combination of meetings and phone calls out of King’s Senate hideaway, those negotiations hadn’t just begun over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen, Hassan — also from New Hampshire — and King had been quietly talking with Republican leadership for weeks to lay the groundwork for a deal. Thune had long said that the path toward a deal would be through conversations with rank-and-file Democrats, not Democratic leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine told reporters that he spoke with Thune and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama throughout the negotiations over the weekend and made the case directly that the deal needed to include a moratorium on firings of federal employees.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether he wished Democrats had cut a deal sooner, Kaine, who didn’t truly join the negotiations until after Tuesday’s elections, said of Republicans: “I didn’t fully understand how dug in they were.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, moderate Democrats had agreed to give Schumer and their fellow Democratic senators one last shot to do it their way on Friday, filing into the chamber behind the New York Democrat as he presented his party’s latest offer to open the government in exchange for extending the ACA subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But Republicans rejected it as a nonstarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Plan A was over on Friday when Republicans ruled it out,” one of the sources familiar with the negotiations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The eventual deal they did accept, however, presents a new quandary for the GOP. With Thune promising a separate vote on the subsidies next month, White House aides are already turning their attention to hashing out a coherent position on health care.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the question is how they push back on the inevitable Democratic narrative that Republicans are killing health care in the US,” one of the people familiar with the matter said. “What is the Republican response to the inevitable refrain: ‘They don’t have a plan.’”\n \n\n   \n  Said Shaheen: “We have a guaranteed vote by a guaranteed date on a bill that we will write, not that the Republicans will write.”\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on Republicans’ message on health care during a Fox Business interview on Monday, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair indicated the answer remained a work in progress.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a good plan to be able to address some of these issues that will begin to be worked on in earnest now,” Blair said, without offering specifics. “I expect that we’ll see action on that very soon.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/trump-china-france-students-universities","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:55:00-05:00","title":"Trump defends enrolling Chinese students at US universities — and takes a swipe at France","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump defended the continued enrollment of Chinese students in U.S. universities, asserting that international students contribute positively to academic and cultural exchange, while criticizing France in response to a Fox News host's claim that French students are safer or more trustworthy than Chinese ones.

CNN\n \n   \n  Warren Buffett,  in his annual message  as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway to shareholders – a tradition dating back to 1965 – said that he will be “going quiet” after he steps down at the end of this year. But the 95-year-old is not going away just yet.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett will no longer write the message atop the company’s annual report, but he will continue to deliver an annual Thanksgiving message, and he will “step up” his philanthropy, giving away the $149 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock he continues to hold.\n \n\n   \n  “The Oracle of Omaha” has become an investing icon, a billionaire who has cultivated a folksy image, particularly through his letters to shareholders. Although his market moves are closely followed by investors around the world, Buffett has also worked to present himself as a cheerleader for America and ordinary Americans – and for capitalism.\n \n\n   \n  He is being replaced by Greg Abel next year. Abel, 63, is the vice chairman of non-insurance operations of Berkshire and was designated as Buffett’s successor in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett once again praised his successor, writing that he “has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire’s next CEO.”\n \n\n   \n  Buffett   also gave an update on his health, admitting that to his “surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people.”\n \n\n   \n  But the nonagenarian isn’t getting any younger. Acknowledging the limited time he has left and the giant sum of money he wishes to give away, Buffett said he converted 1,800 shares, worth a combined $1.35 billion, into the company’s cheaper “B shares” and delivered them to four of his family’s foundations Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “To improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them, I need to step up the pace of lifetime gifts to their three foundations,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett says he has high – but realistic – expectations that the conglomerate he led for six decades will continue to thrive after he steps down as CEO. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) shares have risen more than 10% this year, with the company sitting on a $1 trillion market cap.\n \n\n   \n  “In aggregate, Berkshire’s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems,” he wrote. “However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll.”\n \n\n   \n    The oracle and his ice cream\n \n\n   \n  Buffett has managed to become a symbol of two seemingly disparate things over his decades in the spotlight: a relentless dealmaker and capitalist, wrapped up in an avuncular figure dispensing practical advice.\n \n\n   \n  Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meetings are like those of no other company, dubbed Woodstock for capitalists, with an exhibit floor showing off many of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway’s businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Buffett himself makes a point to appear on the floor and hype up those companies, from eating Dairy Queen ice cream to putting his face and name on limited-edition event merch, all while his security keeps back hordes of shareholding fans trying to take pictures or get a word in with the so-called Oracle of Omaha.\n \n\n   \n  His investing strategy has turned on an incessant search for value, with Berkshire Hathaway often sitting on giant piles of cash until just the right deal comes through. Few other CEOs have earned that level of patience from investors in a market that more often turns on expectations for short-term returns.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett expects the company to move on from him. But so much of Berkshire’s identity has become intertwined with its CEO. It’s hard to imagine the low-profile Greg Abel, for example, putting  his face on a ketchup bottle  to spur sales. Woodstock for capitalists might get just a little less festive from now on.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-search-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:44:00-20:44","title":"Wig disguises, a swapped license plate and a 1,000-mile drive: Where the search for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard stands","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Melodee Buzzard, a 9-year-old girl from Lompoc, California, vanished on October 14, 2025, after her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, took her on a 1,000-mile road trip across at least six states from October 7 to 10.

That was  the last month  she was seen by the school, the sheriff’s office has said.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear whether the school last saw Melodee virtually or in person, but the sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  The school’s August sighting helped narrow detectives’ timeline at the beginning of the investigation, when authorities were working with outdated childhood photos and family members who said they had not seen Melodee for years.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years. The aunt said their extended family largely lost contact with the child after her father died in a motorcycle accident when she was a baby.\n \n\n   \n  When Melodee’s school asked for a welfare check on October 14, officers arrived at her mother’s home but only found Buzzard, who “provided  no verifiable explanation  for Melodee’s whereabouts,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found.\n \n\n   \n  The  sheriff’s office  said this week Buzzard “has remained uncooperative and has not confirmed Melodee’s location or welfare.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n    Melodee likely disappeared during a whirlwind multistate road trip\n \n\n   \n  Detectives have narrowed their investigation to a small but very eventful three-day window from October 7-10, in which they believe the mother drove Melodee more than 1,000 miles away — as far as Nebraska — crossing at least six states and trading license plates and disguises as they went.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the three-day trip, Buzzard returned home with the rental car, this time without Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Melodee was seen was on October 9 in an area around the Colorado and Utah state line. Here’s what  investigators say happened  on their trip:\n \n\n   \n  Finding Melodee now hinges on detectives unearthing what happened to the girl after she was last seen on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office released a  travel-route map  of where they believe the mother and daughter traveled between October 9 and 10, and is asking businesses, gas stations, hotels, rest stops and residents along the route to review surveillance camera footage that may catch a glimpse of the child.\n \n\n   \n    A series of wigs may have provided quick disguises, investigators say\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who came across the mother and daughter may not recognize them in some publicly released pictures, as authorities believe Buzzard may have taken steps to conceal their identities, including tucking her daughter’s ringlet curls under a smooth wig.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc on October 7 showed Buzzard and Melodee in what appeared to be wigs, the sheriff’s office said in a release that  shared a clip  of the video.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next three days, authorities say Buzzard appeared to swap wigs, trading fake, honey blonde curls for a darker wig closer to the style Melodee was seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel,” the release said.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s grandmother, Lilly Denes, told CNN affiliate  KSBY  that when she first saw the surveillance images, she was overwhelmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was totally numb and in shock. … This is just so shocking to me in that my granddaughter is dressed in a disguise,” Denes told the affiliate.\n \n\n   \n  “If she’s listening, we love you. We’re here for you, and we just want you to be happy,” the grandmother said. “Call me. There are numbers on the TV that you can call, and I will come pick you up.”\n \n\n   \n    Mother is accused of falsely imprisoning someone in unrelated charge\n \n\n   \n  In a sudden turn of events on Friday, the sheriff’s office  announced  while they were investigating Melodee’s disappearance, they learned her mother had recently “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  “Although this arrest occurred during the course of the missing person investigation, it is not directly related to Melodee’s disappearance,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard has been charged with a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office. She is being held at a county jail with bail set at $100,000, records show.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say the incident happened in Lompoc on November 6 and involved a person who is not Melodee, but investigators have so far been reluctant to share more details.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest comes about a week after the  FBI served search warrants  at Buzzard’s home and a storage locker, as well as the rental car Melodee was last seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheriff’s detectives remain fully focused on locating Melodee and confirming her safety,” the Friday release said.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who has seen Melodee or may have information about her whereabouts is encouraged to call the sheriff’s office or leave  an anonymous tip .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/europe/british-journalist-hamdi-ice-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"19:58:00Z","title":"British Journalist Sami Hamdi Expected to Be Released from ICE Detention and Return to UK","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"British journalist Sami Hamdi, a Muslim commentator known for his critical analysis of Israel’s actions in Palestine, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at San Francisco International Airport on October 26, 2025, after being accused of overstaying his visa.

went through San Francisco International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. But Muslim advocacy groups say that his visa was revoked during his trip without cause or prior notice. Hamdi’s family believe his public criticism of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories was the real reason behind the decision.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said Hamdi had opted to accept a US government offer to leave the country voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  “The government has agreed to release Sami,” Hamdi’s family said in a statement posted on social media Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”\n \n\n   \n  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Hamdi had voluntarily requested removal from the US and ICE was “happily arranging his removal from this country” in a statement Monday. McLaughlin characterized Hamdi as “an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer” and said “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE records show Hamdi was still in custody in California Monday afternoon. He was detained on October 26, a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.\n \n\n   \n  CAIR’s California chapter and Hamdi’s lawyer on Monday welcomed the US decision to release the British national.\n \n\n   \n  “This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said the US government provided “no evidence” to justify his detention.\n \n\n   \n  “If they want him out of the country, why not simply let him go?” she posted to Instagram. “Why is the US government holding a British journalist without charge?”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his analysis on developments in the Middle East and appearances on British TV.  He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.\n \n\n   \n  At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said on Monday. “His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the Israel-Hamas war.

That day, surveillance footage captured the girl at a local car rental agency dressed in  what seemed to be a disguise .\n \n\n   \n  Melodee was wearing a hoodie pulled over her head and “what appears to be a wig that is darker and straighter than her natural hair,” the  sheriff’s office  said. “Investigators believe the wig may have been used to alter her appearance.”\n \n\n   \n  Investigators also believe that the mother  swapped wigs  throughout the trip, possibly “to avoid recognition during travel,” the sheriff’s office said Thursday.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next three days, the rental car traveled through Nebraska, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and Kansas, at some point seen with “a false or switched” license plate, according to the sheriff’s office.\n \n\n   \n  The rental car then returned to the family’s home in Lompoc, about 55 miles northwest of Santa Barbara, authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  “Ashlee was seen returning to her Lompoc residence on October 10, driving the same rental vehicle she departed with on October 7 — but Melodee was not in the car,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  The child was last seen a day before on video surveillance in the region between the Colorado and Utah state line.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee was reported missing days later on October 14 – not by a family member, but by  a school administrator concerned  about her long absence.\n \n\n   \n  When authorities visited her mother’s home, “Melodee was not at the home, and  no verifiable explanation  for her whereabouts was provided,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Ashlee has remained uncooperative and has not confirmed Melodee’s location or welfare,” authorities said on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Though the mother’s arrest Friday did happen during the missing persons investigation, “it is not directly related to Melodee’s disappearance,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheriff’s detectives remain fully focused on locating Melodee and confirming her safety,” the Friday release said.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who has seen Melodee or may know something about her whereabouts is encouraged to call the sheriff’s office or leave  an anonymous tip .\n \n\n   \n  It was not immediately clear whether Buzzard has an attorney. She will be booked at a Santa Barbara County jail with bail set at $100,000, officials said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/camp-mystic-texas-flooding-lawsuits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00.000-05:00","title":"Families of 9 Camp Mystic Flooding Victims File Lawsuits Alleging Gross Negligence After 27 Girls and Counselors Died","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the deadly flash flooding of Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas on July 4, 2025, which killed 27 people including campers and counselors, the families of the victims have filed three lawsuits against the camp and its owners, alleging gross negligence.

counselors who died in the catastrophic flooding that swept through Camp Mystic this summer are suing the Texas camp and its owners, accusing them of gross negligence, according to three lawsuits filed Monday.\n \n\n   \n  One lawsuit was filed by the families of five campers and two counselors who perished in the  July 4 tragedy : Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory.\n \n\n   \n  A second lawsuit was filed by the family of Eloise “Lulu” Peck, an 8-year-old who also died in the disaster, an attorney for the family said. The third was filed by the family of 9-year-old Ellen Getten.\n \n\n   \n  Each lawsuit seeks more than $1 million in damages.\n \n\n   \n  They mark the first legal action taken by victims’ families against the camp since the flooding that claimed their daughters’ lives.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuits’ defendants include Camp Mystic and members of the Eastland family, which owns the 99-year-old camp in Kerr County, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “We continue to pray for the grieving families and ask for God’s healing and comfort,” a statement from the camp read Monday evening.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen campers and staffers –  the “Heaven’s 27,”  as they are known – died in the predawn hours of July 4 after torrential rainfall caused flash flooding at the century-old summer camp in Texas Hill Country.\n \n\n   \n  Many of the  youngest victims were housed  in cabins along the banks of the Guadalupe River.\n \n\n   \n  Richard “Dick” Eastland, who co-owned the  all-girls Christian  camp with his wife, Tweety, died while he was trying to save some of the girls, a family spokesperson has said.\n \n\n   \n  The flooding killed at least 136 people across the region, as parts of the Guadalupe River rose from about  3 feet to almost 30 feet in just 45 minutes .\n \n\n   \n     What the lawsuits allege \n \n\n   \n  The first lawsuit, filed by the families of five campers and two counselors, accuses Camp Mystic of not having adequate safety plans and prioritizing money over safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, campers Margaret, Lila, Molly, Lainey, and Blakely should be third graders, and counselors Chloe and Katherine should be freshmen at the University of Texas. They all are gone,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,” the filing says. “The Camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins. The Camp chose not to make plans to safely evacuate its campers and counselors from those cabins, despite state rules requiring evacuation plans, and not to spend time and money on safety training and tools.”\n \n\n   \n  “On July 4, the Camp chose to take no steps to protect its campers and counselors while it knew a storm and ‘life threatening flash flooding’ were approaching,” the first lawsuit states. “Instead, with the river rising, the Camp chose to direct its groundskeepers to spend over an hour evacuating camp equipment, not its campers and counselors. The Camp chose not to evacuate its campers and counselors, even as floodwater reached the cabins, until counselors demanded it.”\n \n\n   \n  The “Camp chose not to evacuate the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins when other campers and counselors had been moved to safe, higher ground just 300 feet away,” the suit says. “Instead, the Camp chose to order its campers and counselors to remain in the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins while the flood waters overwhelmed the camp. Finally, when it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster in which 25 campers, two counselors, and the Camp director died.”\n \n\n   \n  “We carry the memory of our daughter in everything we do. This legal step is one of honoring her, and we believe that truth and justice are essential to finding peace – not only for our family, but for every family affected,” said Ryan DeWitt, who lost his daughter, Molly.\n \n\n   \n  The second lawsuit, filed by the family of Eloise “Lulu” Peck, accused Camp Mystic of “gross negligence” by “failing to implement modern safety measures or update its own flood protocols in light of known dangers.”\n \n\n   \n  “These terrifying last moments and then deaths were proximately caused by the negligence and gross negligence of Defendants,” the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants knew that camp facilities were located in a flood zone, knew of the history of flash flooding in Kerr County, knew of repeated prior flood events at the Camp, and received warnings from family members about flood risk.”\n \n\n   \n  A third lawsuit was filed by the parents of Ellen, one of the youngest girls at the camp and who was housed at Bubble Inn cabin.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges the camp’s directors and owners should have been aware of an emergency response activation in the area ahead of the major flooding and should have been on “high alert.”\n \n\n   \n  The defendants had enough time to evacuate all the campers and prevent injuries and death, the lawsuit alleges.\n \n\n   \n  “At the very least, Camp Mystic had more than enough time to train, educate, and instruct counselors and campers alike of a true evacuation plan should the weather continue to grow in severity through the day and into the night,” the lawsuit states. “However, the Defendants chose to do nothing after this alert to protect Ellen’s and the other campers’ lives.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, a plan to evacuate the campers came more than 12 hours after a flash flood warning, the lawsuit alleges. That plan was “wholly inadequate and purposefully left some of the youngest children in Bubble Inn completely stranded without instruction, direction, or adult emergency assistance before their tragic deaths,” according to the lawsuit.\n \n\n   \n  “The Camp’s failure to act led to utter chaos and mass panic,” the lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuits seek a jury trial in Travis County District Court. And they demand compensation for “mental anguish,” among other damages.\n \n\n   \n    The camp responds\n \n\n   \n  “We empathize with the families of the campers and counselors and all families in the Hill Country who lost loved ones in the horrific and unprecedented flood of July 4,” Jeff Ray, legal counsel for Camp Mystic, said in a statement Monday after the lawsuits were filed.\n \n\n   \n  “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area,” the statement continued. “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also reached out to Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts for comment on the lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview with CNN last month , Watts addressed some of the questions and concerns that had been raised by families.\n \n\n   \n  He said the first warning came at 1:14 a.m., but “there’s some question as to who got it and who didn’t, because this is a very remote area with limited cell phone coverage.”\n \n\n   \n  At 1:47 a.m., Dick Eastland and his son Edward “immediately convened the ground crew and started securing equipment, started coming up with a plan at about 2” a.m., Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “At about 2:19, we got the first information that one of the houses was having water coming,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Before 3 a.m., “there was a very orderly evacuation process of 10 different camps or cabins,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  He also challenged the notion that evacuating children during flash flooding is always the best option.\n \n\n   \n  “You shelter in place. That’s first and foremost what you ought to do,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n   “ Do not take 9-year-old girls who weigh 63 pounds on average into raging floodwaters. They’re going to get washed away.”\n \n\n   \n    Anger and grief lead to change\n \n\n   \n  The deaths at Camp Mystic have led to sharp questions from parents and lawmakers about the camp’s safety and evacuation plan in an area known to flood on a regular basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Obvious commonsense safety measures were absent. Protocols that should have been in place were ignored,” said CiCi Williams Steward, the mother of 8-year-old Cile, who remains missing. “She was stolen from her family, from her future, from the world she lit up with her independence and spunk.”\n \n\n   \n  In September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed  tougher camp safety laws  that require local governments to install outdoor sirens and warning systems in flood-prone areas.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the Camp Mystic attorney  offered an in-depth timeline  of how camp leaders responded to the flood warnings and rising waters. They safely evacuated 166 girls thanks to their quick efforts, Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “This was an unprecedented, once-in-a-thousand-year event, that nobody thought was even possible,” he said. “It’s never happened before.”\n \n\n   \n   Camp Mystic has announced plans to partially reopen  this coming summer for its 100th anniversary. The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/chess-vladimir-kramnik-daniel-naroditsky-fide-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"19:03:00Z","title":"Former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik to Face Probe Over Online Comments About Rival","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik is under formal investigation by FIDE for bullying and harassment after repeated accusations of cheating against American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who died at age 29.

chess  champion Vladimir Kramnik is being investigated for bullying and harassment following the death of fellow player  Daniel Naroditsky , world chess governing body  FIDE has announced .\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who amassed a large online following through streaming and teaching, died unexpectedly at the age of 29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Center on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator. He was loved by many.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/trump-pardons-political-transactional","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:12:00Z","title":"Trump’s Pardons Aren’t Just Political; More Importantly, They’re Transactional","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has issued a large number of pardons — over 1,650 — to individuals who played significant roles in politically motivated actions, including efforts to overturn the 2020 election and involvement in investigations into Russian interference.

more importantly, they’re transactional \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:12 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  So much of the coverage of President Donald Trump’s pardons is focused on how political they are. And they are certainly political — extraordinarily so.\n \n\n   \n  But as Trump’s  latest batch of pardons  reinforces, that’s only half the story.\n \n\n   \n  The more ominous trend is not just that he’s pardoning political allies; it’s that he’s pardoning allies  in very transactional ways .\n \n\n   \n  He’s pardoning lots and lots of people who helped Trump, specifically.\n \n\n   \n  After previously dangling pardons over allies involved in sensitive investigations involving Trump himself — and later delivering those pardons — he’s now pardoned oodles of people who took illegal or legally dubious action on his behalf.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is creating a permission structure in which people will credibly think they can’t be held accountable in federal court, as long as what they’re doing benefits Trump. He’s been cultivating this for a long time, but he seems to be getting more brazen about it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s most recent pardons, which were announced overnight by Justice Department official Ed Martin, are for 77 people who played roles in trying to overturn his 2020 election loss. These officials include former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and the president’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, along with many of the people involved in the so-called fake electors scheme.\n \n\n   \n  The pardons are symbolic, in that these people haven’t actually been charged with federal crimes. Some of them face state-level charges, for which Trump cannot pardon them.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s also what makes these so notable. Trump is using this symbolic gesture to expand the ranks of people who went to great and legally dubious lengths to help him try to overturn the 2020 election and who later received pardons.\n \n\n   \n  When you combine these new pardons with the pardons and commutations given to  January 6, 2021, defendants  and Trump allies who testified in cases involving the president, across his two terms Trump has now pardoned more than 1,650 people who played significant roles in matters involving him personally.\n \n\n   \n  Those people account for more than 84% of pardons and commutations awarded by Trump. (Trump has otherwise  been remarkably stingy  with his clemency powers, when the matters didn’t involve him or his allies.)\n \n\n   \n  And many of these people engaged in violence,  including against police , in the name of helping Trump.\n \n\n   \n  What message does that send to other people who might go to remarkable lengths to help Trump carry out his agenda? To participate in legally dubious administration actions — things like  its boat strikes in the Caribbean ? To carry out his deportation agenda in rather brutal ways? Or to perhaps even try to help him stay in power, as more than 1,600 people did before receiving pardons for their actions?\n \n\n   \n  The sheer volume of these self-serving pardons is hardly the only indicator that Trump is wielding them for political and transactional purposes.\n \n\n   \n  Official reports from the various Russia investigations referred to how Trump  appeared to dangle pardons  over people who were in positions to provide potentially derogatory information about him. These people included former advisers Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.\n \n\n   \n  Special counsel Robert Mueller  said in his report  that Trump’s repeated comments about potentially pardoning Manafort “had the potential to influence Manafort’s decision whether to cooperate with the government.”\n \n\n   \n  All were later pardoned by Trump in his first term. And perhaps most notably, Trump’s pardon of Manafort came after Manafort lied to investigators in ways that threw them off in a key portion of the probe.\n \n\n   \n  Manafort’s lies came after he cut a deal to cooperate with investigators. A bipartisan Senate report seemed to  regard these lies as particularly inexplicable , given they opened Manafort up to much more prison time.\n \n\n   \n  But ultimately, Manafort’s gamble appeared to pay off with Trump, when the president gave him the pardon he had repeatedly dangled as a potential reward for staying loyal.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Mueller report and the Senate report also referred to how Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said he was led to believe the Trump White House would help him with his pardon  if he stayed in line.\n \n\n   \n  Cohen told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he discussed a potential pardon with a  fellow Trump lawyer more than half a dozen times. He said the lawyer told him after he testified to Congress that Trump “heard that you did great, and don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine. He loves ya.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani himself also publicly floated pardons related to witnesses in the Russia investigation. He at one point  told the New York Daily News  that when “the whole thing is over, things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons.” He  told CNN  around the same time that “When it’s over, hey, he’s the president of the United States. He retains his pardon power. Nobody is taking that away from him.”\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the comments of another lawyer who figured prominently in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, John Eastman.\n \n\n   \n  Just a few days after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Eastman  emailed Giuliani , saying, “I’ve decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works.”\n \n\n   \n  We still don’t know who was keeping such a “pardon list,” or why. But it signaled that those around Trump seemed to sense their actions were at least legally problematic and were preparing accordingly very shortly after January 6.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, some involved had either been  told their plans were illegal or acknowledged it  in the days and weeks beforehand, but they pressed forward anyway. Then they rather quickly seemed to start talking about pardons.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly five years later, Eastman has joined Giuliani in actually being on a Trump “pardon list.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/style/david-szalay-flesh-booker-prize-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:57:00Z","title":"Writer David Szalay wins prestigious Booker Prize for fiction with his earthy novel ‘Flesh’","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canadian-Hungarian-British writer David Szalay has won the 2025 Booker Prize for his novel 'Flesh', a sparse and physically grounded story about István, a taciturn Hungarian immigrant who navigates life from adolescence to London high society.

writer David Szalay won the Booker Prize for fiction on Monday for “Flesh,” the story of an ordinary man’s life over several decades in which what isn’t on the page is just as important as what is.\n \n\n   \n  Szalay, 51, beat five other finalists, including favorites Andrew Miller and Kiran Desai, to take the coveted literary award, which brings a 50,000-pound ($66,000) payday and a big boost to the winner’s sales and profile.\n \n\n   \n  He was chosen from 153 submitted novels by a judging panel that included Irish writer Roddy Doyle and “Sex and the City” star Sarah Jessica Parker.\n \n\n   \n  Doyle said “Flesh” – a book “about living, and the strangeness of living” – emerged as the judges’ unanimous choice after a five-hour meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Szalay’s book recounts the life of taciturn István, from a teenage relationship with an older woman through time as a struggling immigrant in Britain to denizen of London high society. The author has said he wanted to write about a Hungarian immigrant, and “about life as a physical experience, about what it’s like to be a living body in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Accepting his trophy at London’s Old Billingsgate – a former fish market turned glitzy events venue – Szalay thanked the judges for rewarding his “risky” novel.\n \n\n   \n  He recalled asking his editor “whether she could imagine a novel called ‘Flesh’ winning the Booker Prize.”\n \n\n   \n  “You have your answer,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Doyle, who chaired the judges, said István belongs to a group overlooked in fiction: a working-class man. He said that since reading it, he looks more closely when he walks past bouncers standing in the doorways of Dublin pubs.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m kind of giving him a second look, because I feel I might know him a bit better,” said Doyle, whose funny, poignant stories of working-class Dublin life won him the 1993 Booker Prize for “Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha.”\n \n\n   \n  “It presents us with a certain type of man that invites us to look behind the face.”\n \n\n   \n  Szalay, who was born in Canada, raised in the UK and lives in Vienna, was previously a Booker finalist in 2016 for “All That Man Is,” a series of stories about nine wildly different men.\n \n\n   \n  “Flesh” was praised by many critics but frustrated others with its refusal to fill in the gaps in István’s story – great swathes of life, including incarceration and wartime service in Iraq occur off the page – and its stubbornly unexpressive central character, whose most common remark is “Okay.”\n \n\n   \n  “We loved the spareness of the writing,” Doyle said. “We loved how so much was revealed without us being overly aware that it was being revealed … Watching this man grow, age, and learning so much about him – despite him, in a way.\n \n\n   \n  “If the gaps were filled, it would be less of a book,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Szalay was considered an outsider for this year’s prize but had been rising up bookmakers’ odds in the days before Monday’s ceremony.\n \n\n   \n  The front-runners according to betting markets were British writer Miller for early-1960s domestic drama “The Land in Winter” and Indian author Desai for globe-spanning saga “The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny,” her first novel since “The Inheritance of Loss,” which won the Booker Prize in 2006.\n \n\n   \n  The other finalists were Susan Choi’s twisty family saga “Flashlight”; Katie Kitamura’s tale of acting and identity, “Audition”; and midlife-crisis road trip “The Rest of Our Lives” by Ben Markovits.\n \n\n   \n  The Booker Prize was founded in 1969 and has established a reputation for transforming writers’ careers. Its winners have included Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan, Arundhati Roy, Margaret Atwood and Samantha Harvey, who took the 2024 prize for space station story “Orbital.”\n \n\n   \n   This is a developing story and will be updated. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/baseball-mlb-announces-gambling-safeguards","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:50:00Z","title":"MLB Announces New Gambling Safeguards After Guardians Pitchers Indicted in Betting Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the indictment of Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz on multiple counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, and bribery for allegedly rigging pitches to benefit sports bettors, Major League Baseball announced new gambling safeguards.

In June, Trump  lost an effort   to have the appeal reviewed by the full bench of judges.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has claimed Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the civil trial, made numerous errors by allowing the jury to hear testimony from two women who alleged Trump sexually assaulted them years ago.\n \n\n   \n  His lawyers also said the judge should not have let the jurors see the  “Access Hollywood tape, ” which captured Trump in 2005 on a hot mic saying he gropes and kisses women.\n \n\n   \n  Carroll sued Trump alleging he sexually assaulted her in a New York department store in the mid-1990s and defamed her when in 2019 he denied the assault, said she wasn’t his type, and claimed she made it up to boost sales of a book.\n \n\n   \n  “There were no eyewitnesses, no video evidence, and no police report or investigation,” Trump told the Supreme Court in the appeal filed Monday viewed by CNN. “Instead, Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th president, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself.”\n \n\n   \n  The appeal has not yet been formally docketed at the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Whether the Supreme Court takes up the case is yet to be seen, but it likely won’t be the last time the justices are asked to review litigation involving Carroll.\n \n\n   \n  A different jury found Trump liable for defaming Carroll for repeating his statements in 2022 and ordered him to pay $83 million in damages. A federal appeals court panel  affirmed the damages award  finding it “reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts” and rejected several of Trump’s legal challenges. Among them, the appeals court found that Trump had previously waived any claim of presidential immunity and said the Supreme Court’s decision last year involving criminal cases did not alter their view.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has asked for the full bench of judges to review the case. The Justice Department filed an amicus brief supporting review of whether presidential immunity can be waived “from civil damages liability predicated on official acts.”  Carroll’s response is due in the next few weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/west-virginia-national-guard-dc-deployment-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:23:00Z","title":"Judge Allows Continued Deployment of West Virginia National Guard in Washington, D.C.","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. judge in West Virginia ruled that Governor Patrick Morrisey’s deployment of over 300 West Virginia National Guard members to Washington, D.C., is lawful under both state and federal law, following a lawsuit by the West Virginia Citizen Action Group that claimed the deployment violated state statutes restricting out-of-state National Guard deployment.

Lindsay made the ruling after hearing arguments in a lawsuit by a civic organization that argued Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey exceeded his authority when he authorized the Guard’s deployment in August.\n \n\n   \n  “The question before this court is whether or not state law allows West Virginia to do this,” Lindsay said. “The court has found that.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge added: “This court believes that the federal law allows for the request made by the president to the governor.”\n \n\n   \n   West Virginia is among several states  that sent National Guard members to the nation’s capital. While the state National Guard has said its deployment could last until the end of November, it is consulting with the governor’s office and others on the possibility of extending the stay.\n \n\n   \n  Formal orders were issued last week  extending the deployment  of the District of Columbia’s National Guard in the city through the end of February.\n \n\n   \n  “We are pleased with the judge’s decision,” Jace Goins, the state’s chief deputy attorney general, said outside the court in Charleston. “The National Guard are going nowhere. They’re staying in D.C. They’re not going to be redeployed to West Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  “The judge made the determination that the governor made a lawful decision deploying the National Guard to D.C. by a lawful request of the president.”\n \n\n   \n  The West Virginia Citizen Action Group, which filed the lawsuit, argued that under state law the governor could deploy the National Guard out of state only for certain purposes, such as responding to a natural disaster or another state’s emergency request.\n \n\n   \n  The civic group claimed that it was harmed by the deployment by being forced to refocus its resources away from government accountability and transparency. The state attorney general’s office sought to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacked standing to challenge Morrisey’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a simple issue of a broad, lawful request by the president and a lawful deployment by the governor. That’s all,” Goins said.\n \n\n   \n  Aubrey Sparks, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s West Virginia chapter, said she didn’t believe it was the correct decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that West Virginia law is clear,” Sparks said. “I think what the state was permitted to do here is to skirt past West Virginia law simply because Trump asked them to. And that’s not how the law works. We remain deeply concerned about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump issued an executive order in August declaring a crime emergency in the nation’s capital, although the Department of Justice itself says violent crime there is at  a 30-year low .\n \n\n   \n  Within a month, more than 2,300 Guard troops  from eight states  and the District of Columbia were patrolling under the Army secretary’s command. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist them.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, a federal judge heard arguments Oct. 24 on District of Columbia Attorney General  Brian Schwalb  ’s request for an order that would remove National Guard members from Washington streets.

Trump being urged to intervene in Tina Peters case, sources say \n       \n  By Kaitlan Collins, Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:34 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fresh off of  pardoning a slew of allies  who helped him try to overturn the 2020 election, President Donald Trump is being strongly encouraged to intervene in the conviction of Tina Peters, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Peters, the former Republican clerk of Mesa, Colorado, was found guilty last year on state charges of participating in a scheme that hoped to prove Trump’s false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is serving her sentence at a women’s prison in Pueblo, Colorado. However, because she was found guilty on state charges, Trump cannot outright pardon her — that power belongs to Colorado’s Democratic governor. But that hasn’t stopped her allies from trying to get her out of prison.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people making the biggest push internally on her behalf is Ed Martin, who is serving as the pardon attorney at the Justice Department after he failed to get enough support to serve as the US attorney in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has continued to advocate for relief for Peters in recent weeks, several people familiar with the push told CNN, even though it is extremely unusual for the Justice Department to intervene in a state case this way. The department has already  involved itself  in a long-shot federal case, known as a habeas petition, that Peters filed in March, and urged a federal judge to free her from state prison while she appeals her conviction. That matter is still pending, but a decision is expected this year.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has worked behind the scenes, over the objections of some of his colleagues, to find a way to grant relief for Peters. Responding Sunday to a post about the case on X, Martin wrote, “We are working on it!”\n \n\n   \n  During her sentencing hearing, Peters continued to argue that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. Colorado state Judge Matthew Barrett told Peters that he was convinced she was not apologetic for her behavior and “would do it all over again if you could.”\n \n\n   \n  “You are no hero,” Barrett told her. “You abused your position and you’re a charlatan.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump lost in 2020, Peters got involved with other right-wing activists who tried to prove Trump’s fraud claims by allegedly breaching voting systems in Colorado,  Michigan ,  Georgia  and other states. They were acting based on false information, including from Trump’s own lawyers, that the 2020 results were rigged against him by machines belonging to Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  Peters was  indicted  by a Republican prosecutor and convicted by a jury in her ruby-red county of felonies tied to a data breach in Mesa related to the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly threatened “harsh measures” against Colorado if Peters isn’t freed and has  called  her an “innocent political prisoner.”\n \n\n   \n  He has criticized Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and state Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats. Polis  has said  he won’t pardon Peters as part of any quid-pro-quo deal.\n \n\n   \n  From the La Vista Correctional Facility — a medium-security women’s prison in Pueblo — Peters has continued her advocacy through messages to her allies that they post on social media on her behalf. Last month, she directed her outrage at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “Where is everybody? I did what I was supposed to do” to “legally” expose supposed voter fraud in 2020, Peters wrote, adding, “The President has demanded my release four times… why is the DOJ defying Trump’s demands? Get off your a**es and get me out!”\n \n\n   \n  Peters has apparently latched onto an idea  recently floated  by those on the right that the Justice Department can move her from state prison into a more comfortable federal facility, because she needs protection as a witness in a potential federal probe into supposed 2020 voter fraud.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, her attorneys have claimed they have critical new evidence about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  They have used her habeas petition to publicize new depositions that they took over the summer, supposedly of anonymous Venezuelan informants who said Dominion and Smartmatic machines can rig American elections — the same false claim that Trump, Peters and other election deniers have peddled since November 2020.\n \n\n   \n  But at a recent hearing, Federal Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak ruled that the depositions weren’t admissible in the habeas case. He also observed that “we’ve seen neither hide nor hair” of the Justice Department in the months after DOJ officials participated an April hearing about its unorthodox intervention in Peters’ case.\n \n\n   \n  Martin confirmed Monday on Trump ally Steve Bannon’s podcast that the Justice Department wants to see Peters moved to a federal prison.\n \n\n   \n  “(Deputy Attorney General) Todd Blanche is the guy leading on this. We did it in a way that puts the right kind of pressure on them,” Martin said of the Trump administration’s contacts with Colorado officials. “If you’re Colorado … if the feds say we want something, you change your tune.”\n \n\n   \n  A person familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Polis and Weiser, who is defending Peters’ convictions in state and federal courts, are “fully synced up” on how to resist Trump’s pressure campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s doing her time,” the person said. “We don’t let threats affect us. We have a job to do and we’re going to do it. We are going to uphold the law.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Polis’ and Weiser’s offices for comment.\n \n\n   \n  One of Peters’ lawyers, Patrick McSweeney, previously told CNN that Peters hasn’t had any direct contact with Trump from behind bars, but she has heard about his desire to get her out, and “she appreciates the president’s interest in her case, which is unusual for him to be involved in an individual matter.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/hannibal-gadhafi-released-lebanon-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Hannibal Gadhafi, son of late Libyan leader Moammar, released by Lebanon after 10 years in detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hannibal Gadhafi, son of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, was released by Lebanese authorities in November 2025 after 10 years of detention, following a bail reduction from $11 million to $900,000 and the lifting of a travel ban.

Associated Press\n \n   \n  Lebanese authorities released the son of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Monday after he paid a $900,000 bail, ending his 10-year detention for allegedly withholding information about a missing Lebanese cleric, security officials and a member of his defense team said.\n \n\n   \n  One of  Hannibal Gadhafi ’s lawyers, Charbel Milad al-Khoury, told the Associated Press that Gadhafi was released Monday evening after necessary paperwork was finished. Two security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, also confirmed that Gadhafi was set free.\n \n\n   \n  “Hannibal is officially free and has the full right to choose the destination that he wants,” al-Khoury said. He refused to give further details about Gadhafi’s future movements out of security concerns.\n \n\n   \n  The release came days after Lebanese authorities lifted a travel ban and reduced the bail for Hannibal Gadhafi, paving the way for his release.\n \n\n   \n  Thursday’s decision by the country’s judicial authorities to lift the travel ban and reduce the bail from $11 million came days after a Libyan delegation visited Lebanon and made progress in talks for the release of Gadhafi.\n \n\n   \n  In mid-October, a Lebanese judge ordered Gadhafi’s release on $11 million bail, but banned him from traveling outside Lebanon. His lawyers said at the time that he didn’t have enough to pay that amount, and sought permission for him to leave the country.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, his bail was reduced to 80 billion Lebanese pounds (about $900,000) and the travel ban was lifted allowing him to leave the country once he pays the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The two judicial and one security official said the bail was paid by the Libyan delegation. The Justice Ministry of the Tripoli-based government also posted on its social media platforms that the Libyan delegation paid the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The judicial officials in Beirut said Gadhafi’s defense team withdrew a case against the Lebanese state that they had filed in Geneva last month over holding him without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Libya formally requested Hannibal Gadhafi’s release in 2023, citing his deteriorating health after he went on a hunger strike to protest his detention without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Detained in Lebanon in 2015, Gadhafi was accused of withholding information about the fate of Lebanese Shiite cleric Moussa al-Sadr who disappeared during a trip to Libya in 1978, although the late leader’s son was less than 3 years old at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Gadhafi had been living in exile in Syria with his Lebanese wife, Aline Skaf, and children until he was abducted in 2015 and brought to Lebanon by Lebanese militants who were demanding information about al-Sadr.\n \n\n   \n  Lebanese police later announced they had seized Gadhafi from the northeastern Lebanese city of Baalbek where he was being held, and he had been held ever since in a Beirut jail, where he faced questioning over al-Sadr’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  The case has been a long-standing sore point in Lebanon. The cleric’s family believes he may still be alive in a Libyan prison, though most Lebanese presume he is dead. He would be 96 years old.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sadr, who went missing with companions Abbas Badreddine and Mohammed Yacoub, was the founder of a Shiite political and military group that took part in the long Lebanese Civil War that began in 1975, largely pitting Muslims against Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi was  killed by opposition fighters  during Libya’s 2011 uprising-turned-civil war, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.\n \n\n   \n  Hannibal Gadhafi, who was born nearly three years before al-Sadr disappeared, fled to Algeria after his father was toppled and Tripoli fell to opposition fighters, along with his mother and several other relatives. He later moved to Syria where he was given political asylum and stayed there until he was abducted.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi had eight children from two marriages. Most of them had significant roles in his government. His son Muatassim was killed at the same time as the leader was captured and slain. Two other sons, Saif al-Arab and Khamis, were killed in the uprising.\n \n\n   \n   Saif al-Islam , the one-time heir apparent to his father, has been in Libya since his release from detention there in 2017. Gadhafi’s son Mohammed and daughter Aisha live in Oman. Al-Saadi, a former soccer player, was released from prison in Libya in 2021 after being jailed following repatriation from Niger in 2014, and is believed to be living in Turkey.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/americas/ecuador-prison-deaths-asphyxiation-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00Z","title":"At least 27 inmates killed by ‘asphyxiation’ in southern Ecuador in wave of prison violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A wave of prison violence in southern Ecuador, specifically at the Machala Detention Center, resulted in at least 31 inmate deaths on November 10, 2025.

Two officers suffered nonserious injuries as authorities stepped in to regain control of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the day, Los Lobos carried out a “reprisal” attack against Sao-Box, killing 27 of its members by asphyxiating them inside several cells that both groups shared, according to Reimberg.\n \n\n   \n  “In retaliation, Lobos asphyxiated members of the other organization to avoid leaving signs of violence on their bodies,” the minister said.\n \n\n   \n  Prison guards discovered the bodies around 6 p.m. while carrying out routine inspections.\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s penitentiary system SNAI said in a previous statement Sunday that the inmates had “committed asphyxiation among themselves, which resulted in immediate death by suspension.” Authorities did not immediately clarify what they meant by “asphyxiation” or say whether the inmates were hanged.\n \n\n   \n  In response to inquiries from the press, including CNN, SNAI said Sunday that “authorities, operational teams and forensic medical personnel continue working at the scene, verifying information and attending to reported emergencies.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked why rival gang members shared cells, Reimberg noted that they were initially part of the same group, before Sao-Box broke off from Los Lobos over management disputes. He did not specify why they were still kept in the same place after the split.\n \n\n   \n  The first attack on Sunday was prompted by the transfer of inmates to a new maximum-security facility, SNAI said without providing details.\n \n\n   \n  Reimberg suggested that inmates across the country have been causing chaos to prevent authorities from transferring them to the new prison.\n \n\n   \n  The attacks in Machala are the latest in a series of deadly prison clashes throughout Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n  In September, a confrontation between rival gangs at a prison in the coastal city of Esmeraldas left at least  17 dead , according to the National Police. Three days earlier, an additional 14 inmates were killed in Machala.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2021, more than 500 inmates have died in Ecuador’s prisons, according to official figures.\n \n\n   \n  The wave of prison violence is happening despite the deployment of military and police forces in several penitentiaries. It’s part of an ongoing state of internal armed conflict that the government declared in January 2024 to try to quell criminal violence nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  Los Lobos is one of two Ecuadorian criminal groups that the United States said it would designate as foreign terrorist organizations in September. The designation allows the US to impose sanctions and share intelligence with Ecuador “that can be actioned for potentially lethal operations,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/syrias-postwar-pivot-reaches-washington-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00Z","title":"Syria’s jihadist-turned-president caps extraordinary transformation with White House visit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ahmed Al-Sharaa, a former jihadist and Al-Qaeda-backed rebel leader, has emerged as Syria’s president and made history by becoming the first Syrian head of state to visit the U.S. White House.

PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Less than a year after his lightning power grab, Syria’s president is capping his transformation from jihadist to global statesman in a historic visit to the White House that says as much about the young leader as it does his push for his country’s diplomatic reinvention.\n \n\n   \n  Ahmed Al-Sharaa’s meeting on Monday – the first ever visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state – is his 20th foreign trip since appointing himself as president of  Syria  in January, and his second visit to the United States, following his attendance of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.\n \n\n   \n  But this meeting was  ﻿ the most high-profile and high stakes yet, a once-unthinkable encounter between the US commander-in-chief and a man who has faced American forces on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very strong leader,” US President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office following Monday’s visit, adding: “He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him. I get along with him … and we’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time Trump has praised the Syrian leader. In May, after a brief  meeting  brokered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump hailed the 43-year-old Syrian leader as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past,” and ordered the lifting of some of the crippling US sanctions on Syria, a country that for decades had been firmly aligned with key American foes Russia and Iran.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the US extended its pause on most sanctions for another 180 days. However, the most stringent sanctions on Damascus remain and cannot be fully lifted without congressional approval. Al-Sharaa’s immediate goal in Washington was to push for their removal while urging Trump to pressure Israel to halt attacks on Syria and withdraw its troops from the south of the country.\n \n\n   \n  His broader objective, reflected in his extensive global travel, is to reverse Syria’s isolation, a legacy of the previous regime that left the country economically devasted and diplomatically shackled to a narrow axis of allies.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop, the White House visit carries profound symbolic weight. Al-Sharaa played basketball with top US military officials after arriving in Washington on Sunday. But in his early twenties, he encountered the US as an enemy, joining Islamist insurgents battling American forces in Iraq. Captured and later released, he crossed into Syria in 2011 and established an Al-Qaeda-backed rebel army to fight forces loyal to then-President Bashar Al Assad.\n \n\n   \n  Trump nodded to Al-Sharaa’s multilayered past on Monday, saying: “We’ve all had rough pasts, but he has had a rough past. And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN last December, Al-Sharaa said he had gone through episodes of transformation through the years.  Using his nom de guerre , he said: “A person in their twenties will have a different personality than someone in their thirties or forties, and certainly someone in their fifties. This is human nature.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s visit demonstrated that shift: Syria is expected to announce that it is joining the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, a senior Trump administration official said, making Syria the 90th member of the D-ISIS Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sharaa’s Syria will partner with the US “to eliminate ISIS remnants and halt foreign fighter flows,” the official said, adding that the visit is focused on “counterterrorism cooperation, economic development, and advancing regional peace and security.”\n \n\n   \n  After more than a decade of a brutal conflict against Assad’s autocratic regime, Al-Sharaa ended Syria’s long-stalemated civil war by launching a surprise offensive that swiftly toppled the 53-year Assad dynasty, an Arab relic of the Cold War.\n \n\n   \n  In their decades of power, the Assads aligned Damascus firmly with Moscow, relying on aid, arms and unwavering diplomatic backing. In Hafez al-Assad’s first full year in power in 1971, the Soviet Union established its strategic Mediterranean naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. And it was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decisive military intervention in 2015 that enabled Bashar al-Assad to survive the civil war.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians, who killed scores of Syrians during their campaign to keep Assad in power, continue to retain control of their military base in Tartus even after Assad’s fall. And last month, Al-Sharaa visited Moscow to meet Putin.\n \n\n   \n  As he has sought to build ties with Western nations, Al-Sharaa has been careful not to antagonize Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Engaging in a conflict with Russia right now would be too costly with Syria, nor would it be in the country’s interest,” Al-Sharaa told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview aired in October.\n \n\n   \n  Once sanctioned for terrorism by the West, the leader now appears to be on a global diplomatic charm offensive, bolstered by aggressive lobbying from regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Turkey, US allies eager to fill a power and economic vacuum left by Iran and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  For the US, Syria represents both a strategic prize and a significant risk as neighboring Lebanon spirals into instability and Iraq remains a fertile ground for Iran’s proxy militias.\n \n\n   \n  “The US is taking a large gamble on Ahmed Al-Sharaa and Syria,” Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told CNN. “As (US) Ambassador (Tom) Barrack has stated numerous times, the US has no alternatives. Lebanon is a failed state according to his assessment. Iraq is deeply penetrated by pro-Iranian militias,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  And despite a clear westward outlook, the former jihadist leader remains adamant on balancing Syria’s foreign policy away from conflict in an increasingly polarized world – a policy now followed by several developing nations worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  “In this new era, one doesn’t align completely with any side. We saw that with (Al-Sharaa’s) visit with Putin, who is an active ally with the Assad regime … and you see that with diplomacy on behalf of the Syrian government globally,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Fox, Jennifer Hansler, Dalia Abdelwahab, Jomana Karadsheh, Eyad Kourdi contributed reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/football-nfl-new-york-giants-fire-brian-daboll","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:05:00Z","title":"New York Giants Fire Head Coach Brian Daboll","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The New York Giants have fired head coach Brian Daboll after a 24-20 loss to the Chicago Bears, which led to a 2-8 start in the 2025 NFL season.

at amid chaotic day of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago area \n       \n  By Zoe Sottile, Sarah Dewberry, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:58 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago Saturday, the agency said — as federal agents were also accused of using pepper spray and flash-bang grenades against protesters across the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The incidents come as Chicago has emerged as the center of tense standoffs between federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations and frustrated and  angry community members  protesting the Trump administration’s wide-ranging deportation campaign. A federal judge  issued a ruling Friday  limiting federal agents’ use of force in Chicago, after they repeatedly used tear gas and other forms of force against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood Saturday morning,  according to DHS . A male driving a “black Jeep” opened fire at Border Patrol agents, then fled the scene, said the agency. A suspect from Mexico was arrested in connection with the shooting, DHS said  in a post on X  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has framed the incidents as part of a series of attacks they say  target federal agents . “The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement shared with CNN. “These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media.”\n \n\n   \n  But immigrant advocates, local politicians, and legal groups said it is  federal agents  who are driving violence and chaos against angry but peaceful protesters and bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday was a day of terror,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, who says he witnessed flash grenades detonated in the street. “It follows an agenda of terror by this president.”\n \n\n   \n  Several DHS statements about its immigration crackdown in Chicago — “Operation Midway Blitz” — have  later been contradicted  by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing, fueling mounting skepticism of the agency’s claims. In Friday’s ruling, a federal judge said  Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino  “admitted that he lied” when he claimed he threw tear gas at protesters after a rock was thrown near his head, and said video disproved his account.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s evidence was “simply not credible” and its portrayal of Chicago “untrue,”  US District Judge Sara Ellis  said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Sunday  appealing  Ellis’  order  limiting the use of force by federal agents involved in the Chicago immigration crackdown. The court document did not include the grounds for appeal.\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear when the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case.\n \n\n   \n  The National Lawyers Guild Chicago said nine people in all were arrested and taken into federal custody Saturday. DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo. The Border Patrol chief had an interaction with “neighbors” and then got into his vehicle, DeMateo said.\n \n\n   \n  It was just days after Ellis said Bovino had lied about being hit before using tear gas and ordering restrictions on federal agents’ use of force.\n \n\n   \n  Video from the scene appears to show Bovino holding a shiny object and yelling “back up” after a flash bang went off. He then approaches a vehicle. Bovino isn’t seen throwing the object or deploying tear gas in any videos obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has not responded to CNN’s repeated questions about Bovino’s presence in Little Village and his role on Saturday.\n \n\n   \n    Community outrage\n \n\n   \n  At Sunday’s news conference, local politicians and activists expressed their anger and frustration at federal agents’ actions Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago’s mayor said Monday ICE raids “are meant to be provocative.”\n \n\n   \n  “They are trying to incite chaos,” Johnson said. “And they are putting our police officers right in the middle of it to clean up the mess that they are creating.”\n \n\n   \n  Victor Rodriguez, who described himself as a lifelong community resident, said he was struck by both the “anger” and the “great lament” of his neighbors Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have people here running home, mothers and fathers scared to leave their house,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who represents Illinois’ 4th Congressional district, decried the “unconstitutional, illegal and barbaric acts of federal agents who continue to inflict violence on our community.”\n \n\n   \n  He lauded the “nonviolent resistance” that Chicago protesters have engaged in and called the city “the forefront of a fight for new civility and civil rights in America.”\n \n\n   \n  State Sen. Celina Villanueva characterized Saturday’s operations as “state-sponsored terrorism” and praised community efforts to fight back.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t have tear gas, we don’t have pepper spray,” she said. “We literally have our bodies and whistles, and we’re fighting back with that because it’s about humanity.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, DHS blamed liberal politicians, saying they “fueled an environment of lawlessness and assault on federal law enforcement.”\n \n\n   \n  “Make no mistake: Our mission will continue despite the violence,” said Assistant Secretary McLaughlin in the agency’s statement. “And if you lay a hand on law enforcement, you will face the consequences.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/business/lukoil-iraq-russia-sanctions-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"16:57:00Z","title":"Russian oil firm’s multibillion-dollar assets overseas at risk as US sanctions begin to bite","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"US sanctions imposed on Russian oil company Lukoil, initiated by President Donald Trump on October 22, 2025, have severely disrupted its operations across Iraq and Europe.

BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness tendered their resignations on Sunday as stories about the edit scandal consumed British media.\n \n\n   \n  There is no indication that the misleading edit was politically motivated. Nor is there any reason to believe that Davie and Turness knew about it ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  However, a lawyer for Trump asserted Monday that the BBC defamed the president “by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election.”\n \n\n   \n  The letter, obtained by CNN, charges the broadcaster with defamation and claims that Trump has suffered “overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” despite no one seeming to call out the error at the time of the broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, The Telegraph, a longtime source of anti-BBC commentary, wrote about an “internal report” revealing the bad edit, and the story has since snowballed.\n \n\n   \n  The pre-election film spliced together different parts of Trump’s infamous January 6 speech at the Ellipse to make it sound like Trump told the crowd he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tone was certainly combative that day, but in the actual speech, his exhortations to “fight” were separate from his suggestion about walking to the Capitol to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  In a contrite letter to the head of a parliamentary committee on Monday, Shah said the BBC accepted that “the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘We are not perfect’\n \n\n   \n  The revelation about the misleading edit has contributed to an ongoing political fight over the BBC’s funding and future, with conservatives using the error as a new opportunity to denounce the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack,” BBC veteran John Simpson wrote on X Sunday night. He praised Davie and Turness and said, “We’ve now got a real fight on our hands to defend public service broadcasting, because that’s under threat too.”\n \n\n   \n  This is ultimately all about trust: Who trusts the BBC, who doesn’t, and why.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s adversaries, including politicians who detest its news coverage and media moguls who want to take its market share, say the BBC has lost trust, perhaps permanently.\n \n\n   \n  They cite a wide range of perceived wrongs. Former conservative party leader Liz Truss, who had a brief term as prime minister in 2022, wrote on Sunday, “I’m glad the US President and the rest of the world are seeing the BBC for what it is. failure to tell the truth on everything from transgender ideology to economics to Gaza has done huge damage to politics and government in this country. This should be the end of nationalised broadcasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Conservative activists in the UK have long railed against the license fee that British households pay for BBC programs and services. The government is currently reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, including the license fee structure, ahead of the current charter’s expiration at the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  That review presents an opening for the BBC’s many critics to demand changes — at the same time, the BBC is trying to establish new revenue streams and transform itself for the digital age.\n \n\n   \n  Last week’s story in The Telegraph was based on a lengthy memo by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines. Prescott’s memo warned the BBC board about what he called serious problems with news coverage and “inaction” by the broadcaster’s leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary was his first example, but he also cited concerns about coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, gender identity, racial diversity and other matters. He argued that “errors are repeated time and time again.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah responded on Monday and said the BBC has “published corrections where we have got things wrong; changed editorial guidance to make the BBC’s position on issues clearer; made changes to leadership where the problems point to underlying issues; and carried out formal disciplinary measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah also urged people to keep “a sense of perspective,” pointing to “thousands of hours of outstanding journalism” by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  But a sense of perspective is usually the first thing lost in a media feeding frenzy. Veteran British journalist Alan Rusbridger wrote Monday that the BBC now finds itself “in a fight for its survival.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary error was “serious,” Rusbridger wrote, but the BBC’s enemies want to see the entire organization “wither or die,” which “would leave us all far worse off.”\n \n\n   \n  Robert Shrimsley, UK chief political commentator and executive editor of the Financial Times, said on X that it’s important to recognize the political dimensions of the dispute.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that the BBC has made serious culpable errors does not negate the point that there is a real and concerted right-wing media campaign to destroy it,” Shrimsley said. “Both points can be true at the same time and the campaign would not end even if the errors did.”\n \n\n   \n  After reading all the press about the scandal from Kyiv, where he is on assignment, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale took to social media and expressed his pride in the organization.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not perfect; we must always strive to be better,” he wrote Monday. “But in a darkening world, we remain a shaft of light.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/canada-measles-elimination-status-removed","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:35:00Z","title":"Canada loses its measles elimination status amid large outbreak","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after sustained transmission of the measles virus — the same strain — continued for over a year since October 2024.

\n       \n  By Nadia Kounang, Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:35 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Canada has lost its measles elimination status amid a large ongoing outbreak of the virus, the Public Health Agency of Canada said Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Canada’s health agency was informed by the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, that it had lost its measles elimination status as viral transmission has continued uninterrupted since October 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Although it has slowed recently, according to the Canadian government, the outbreak is still ongoing, primarily within undervaccinated communities.\n \n\n   \n  “PAHO’s Measles and Rubella Elimination Regional Monitoring and Re-Verification Commission reviewed recent epidemiological and laboratory data, confirming sustained transmission of the same measles virus strain in Canada for a period of more than one year,” officials said in a statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n \n\n   \n  The Re-Verification Commission, or RVC, is an independent body of experts created by the Pan American Health Organization to analyze data and the current measles outbreak situation. The group met at the beginning of November and made its recommendations to the PAHO director, who makes the ultimate decision about Canada’s status.\n \n\n   \n  Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the virus strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months, the Public Health Agency of Canada  said on its website.  The agency said it is working with PAHO and local public health leaders to slow the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Canada  had been considered measles-free since 1998.  A measles vaccine was first approved to be used in Canada in 1963, and various vaccination campaigns were successful. But in more recent years, vaccine hesitancy has grown, and vaccination rates fell below the target of 95% coverage for all recommended childhood vaccines,  research shows .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to say that all the other 34 countries in the region, they keep their certification as measles-free,” PAHO Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa said Monday. “This loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible.”\n \n\n   \n  However, with the change in Canada’s status, the Americas region officially loses its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  There are no formal consequences to losing such status. But until measles is eliminated worldwide, countries will face the risk of reintroduction and the spread of the virus, Barbosa said. The virus is so contagious that one infected person can transmit the disease to up to 18 others.\n \n\n   \n  As of last month, Canada had tallied more than 5,000 cases for the year — more than twice as many as the country has recorded in the past 25 years combined.\n \n\n   \n  The US has also seen large outbreaks this year and is on the verge of losing its elimination status.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that the US is going to stop the transmission even before that deadline,” said Dr. Daniel Salas, executive manager of PAHO’s Special Program for Comprehensive Immunization.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s large US measles outbreak started in West Texas in January. It’s been declared over, but there is an investigation into whether a growing outbreak along the Arizona-Utah state line could be connected. Cases and outbreaks have also been reported in other states.\n \n\n   \n  “We are supporting all the actions that the US has been taking to actually control the outbreak to stop them,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico also has a recent outbreak, Salas said, concentrated mostly in Chihuahua, but there are also cases in Mexico’s southern states.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely, they need to continue vaccinating,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  With hard work, Barbosa said, he believes that Canada can regain its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  “As we have demonstrated before with political commitment regional cooperation and sustain the vaccination, the region can once again interrupt the transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/pregnancy-gun-homicide-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Women face a much higher risk of homicide, especially from guns, during pregnancy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pregnant women in the United States face a significantly higher risk of homicide, especially from firearms, with a new study showing a 37% increase in firearm homicide rates among pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women.

daily call to a prayer line, she went to work and got another call: from the police department in Richmond, Virginia. Her youngest daughter, Francesca Harris-Scarborough, had been killed the night before.\n \n\n   \n  Police had found the 31-year-old’s car still idling. Scarborough’s daughter, who was three months pregnant, had been shot twice in the heart.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t ready for it. I lost control of everything,” Scarborough said. “Everything went blank.”\n \n\n   \n  Francesca was part of a terrible trend in the United States: Homicide is the No. 1 way pregnant women die,  research  has  showed , but a new  study  finds that they are even more vulnerable than other women of childbearing age when there’s a gun involved.\n \n\n   \n  The study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open, looked at more than 7,000 homicides of women of childbearing age between 2018 and 2021. Pregnant women were found to have a 37% higher firearm homicide rate than women who weren’t pregnant, and more than two-thirds of pregnancy-associated homicides involved firearms.\n \n\n   \n  The presence of a firearm is known to be a key risk factor of intimate partner homicide. The new study showed that every 1% increase in state-level firearm ownership was associated with a 6% increase in all-cause homicide and an 8% increase in the firearm-specific homicide rate in pregnant women, even after adjusting for other factors.\n \n\n   \n  “Even incremental increases in firearm availability may contribute to measurable increases in homicide risk in pregnant women,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really not surprising, if you think about it, that if firearms are more available, then that certainly it does increase your risk of homicide in general,” said study co-author Dr. Lois Lee, a senior faculty adviser in the Office and Health Equity & Inclusion and an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. “So you could imagine, if you take away or at least decrease the number of firearms, then there would likely be many fewer deaths during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  “And unlike medical conditions, which, yes, we do have many medical advances and can save many lives, but in some ways, those conditions are much less preventable, like eclampsia and sepsis,” Lee added. “This is predictable and potentially preventable.”\n \n\n   \n  The highest proportion of homicides in pregnant women was among those 20 to 24 years old. Among women who weren’t pregnant, it was ages 25 to 29. Most homicide victims were Black, whether they were pregnant or not.\n \n\n   \n  “Those findings suggest that these risks of homicide during pregnancy are shaped not just by individual factors but by broader systems of inequity and structural racism,” Lee said. “So it’s not just a solution at the individual level that’s needed, but there needs to be urgent change at a policy level, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors recommend safe storage laws and domestic violence firearm prohibitions.\n \n\n   \n  Although most states prohibit people with final protective orders from purchasing or possessing firearms, such laws should be expanded to require people to surrender their firearms even when there’s an emergency protective order on the books, said Dr. Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, who was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Usually, the first stage of that order process is often the most dangerous time for individuals experiencing intimate partner or family violence, since it is usually the first indication that an individual is going to be separating from an abuser,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Roskam said the most successful gun surrender laws also have strong follow-up. She points to a program in King County, Washington, that created  a multidisciplinary team  of prosecutors, law enforcement and court administrators who serve on a regional domestic violence firearm unit. It scours court documents and databases to make sure every individual involved in a domestic violence offense gives up every firearm.\n \n\n   \n  According to  King County , firearms are used in domestic violence homicides more than all other weapons combined in Washington state.\n \n\n   \n  “They really show respondents that they are very serious about ensuring this firearm relinquishment compliance. And since they have started doing this, they have been recovering a much larger number of firearms from these protective orders,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Scarborough has been working on her own programs so more women are spared her daughter’s fate. She created a nonprofit called  Cry Loud, Spare Not, Speak Up  that’s dedicated to empowering women affected by domestic violence and abuse in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  In reading her daughter’s journals after her death, Scarborough said, she realized that although her daughter was successful and seemed happy, she had confidence issues that began when she was younger. Scarborough also started a program for girls  ages 12 and up  to cultivate self-esteem and grow their confidence.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, near the anniversary of Francesca’s death, Scarborough hosts another empowerment program for girls and women called “I Am Enough, I Know My Worth.”\n \n\n   \n  “This way she will never die. We can always try to help somebody,” Scarborough said. “Her death has really been my teacher. It’s changed my life.

Howard, Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a pivotal move, the US Food and Drug Administration said Monday that  it is taking steps to remove the lengthy “black box” warning  on many hormone treatments for women with menopause symptoms, a shift expected to give women more options for treatment and generate a flood of new prescriptions.\n \n\n   \n  Hormone therapy has long been on the market, but prescriptions plummeted after 2003, when the warning described increased risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, breast cancer and dementia.\n \n\n   \n  “After 23 years of dogma, the FDA today is announcing that we are going to stop the fear machine steering women away from this life-changing, even life-saving, treatment,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in announcing the change.\n \n\n   \n  Prescribing requires nuance, FDA officials said, especially around when women start hormone therapy. Some women still face some risks from hormone therapy, including those at increased risk of blood clots or who have previously had breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n  But for many women, the benefits may far outweigh the risks.\n \n\n   \n  “With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there’s no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,” Makary  posted on X  Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  It could take months for the labels to change, but drugmakers are “very excited” to make the update, Makary said.  Label changes  will include updated guidance that hormones should be initiated in women who are younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause to optimize benefits and risks, and removal of guidance to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time — clearing the way for women to stay on the treatments for years.\n \n\n   \n  “We want people to talk to their doctors, and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications,” Makary said.\n \n\n   \n  Women’s health experts praised the move to update the boxed warning to reflect newer scientific evidence around menopausal hormone therapy but said individualized discussions of risks and benefits will still be needed.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a past president of the Menopause Society, said the labeling change was overdue.\n \n\n   \n  “As a bottom line, I think given more than 20 years of class-wide labeling of hormone therapy, it is time to get the labeling right, and some of these changes that are proposed are very well-supported. Others may be controversial, but overall, it is a step in the right direction,” said Manson, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study that spurred the initial label change.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, this box warning is a one-size-fits-all summary that hormone therapy increases the risk of all these conditions,” Manson said. “It doesn’t take into account whether it’s local estrogen or systemic estrogen, the age of the woman, the type of the formulation.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, said she is among many doctors who advocated for label changes for years.\n \n\n   \n  “Removing the scary boxed warning from local vaginal estrogen is a victory for women’s health and for those who care for and about menopausal women,” Pinkerton said in a statement. “Regarding the removal of the boxed warning for systemic hormone therapy, which is absorbed into the bloodstream and has systemic effects throughout the body, we appreciate the FDA’s thoughtful, nuanced approach. Discussions will be more complicated and need to be individualized, as different menopause therapies differ in potential risks.”\n \n\n   \n    What changed around hormone therapy\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of  menopause treatments  that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warned about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning, or boxed warning, was added after  a large government-funded study , the Women’s Health Initiative, found in 2002 that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had some higher health risks compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.\n \n\n   \n  After the study and the label change, doctors became reluctant to prescribe them, and prescriptions for hormone therapy for menopause dropped by more than 70%. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25,  one study found .\n \n\n   \n  The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been a total horrible tragedy that so many millions of women have been deprived,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, a New York-based internist and author of the books “ Don’t Let Your Doctor Kill You ” and “ The New Hormone Solution .”\n \n\n   \n  “Hormone therapy is important because for about 10 to 15 years before you go into menopause, your hormones start leaving you. As your hormones start leaving you, you need more hormones. And you don’t need hormone replacement; you need hormone supplementation,” Schwartz said.\n \n\n   \n  “Chronic illnesses like heart disease, Alzheimer’s, osteoporosis, cancer, they are diseases of aging, and one reason is the loss of hormones.”\n \n\n   \n  More recent analyses of the Women’s Health Initiative,  as early as 2010 , have since shown that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, can more safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don’t have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “To this day, I still have patients coming in telling me their obstetricians or gynecologists have said to them they shouldn’t be taking hormones, because they’re going to get cancer. And not only will they not get cancer, the hormones will protect them from cancer,” Schwartz said. “We have the data.”\n \n\n   \n  In July, the FDA convened a panel of experts to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Makary  told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta  in an episode of the “Chasing Life” podcast that the agency was in “serious discussions” about what to do with the black box warning.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really a tragedy. It’s maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It’s resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”\n \n\n   \n    Changing views on menopause\n \n\n   \n  The FDA action follows a wave of policies introduced across the country to improve menopause care at the state level. Most of the legislation has been related to insurance   coverage for menopause care, awareness and education, clinician training or menopause in the workplace.\n \n\n   \n  “When we think about the timing of this announcement, it’s not just the FDA making a move. It comes in the good company of now 19 states, red and blue alike, introducing more than 35 bills to improve menopause care,” said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, executive director of the Birnbaum Women’s Leadership Center at the  New York University School of Law , who has been tracking menopause legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “All these things are happening at the same time, and that’s in part because there is a loud and proud movement making these demands now, insisting that menopause care be equitable and treatments accessible, that menopause no longer be in the shadows and that we not be subject to misinformation,” said Weiss-Wolf, author of the forthcoming book, “When In Menopause: A User’s Manual and Citizens Guide.”\n \n\n   \n  The removal of the warning on hormone for menopause has long been in the making, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Back in 2014, the Menopause Society and other leading menopause experts had actually started  a petition to the FDA  to remove the label,” Weiss-Wolf said. “This is something that the menopause medical community has been asking for.”\n \n\n   \n  The action will change the landscape of care to make hormone therapy, especially estrogen, more accessible for midlife women, said Dr. Jayne Morgan, an Atlanta-based cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs at Hello Heart, an app that specializes in women’s health and cardiovascular research.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact of the matter is, estrogen is one of the primary drivers of the heart. There are estrogen receptors on the heart, on the brain, in the bones, so it’s like the fuel that drives our body. Once that fuel runs out, it’s just like a car, the car begins to sputter,” Morgan said.\n \n\n   \n  “Women live about  six years longer  than men, but we spend about 25% of our lives in lower quality of life,” she said. “That’s where hormone therapy can help.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/business/visa-mastercard-deal-merchant-fees","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:47:00-05:00","title":"Visa and Mastercard Propose Fee Cut for Merchants, Sparking Retailer Pushback","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement to lower interchange fees by 0.1% over five years, offering merchants more flexibility such as the ability to add surcharges or refuse premium cards.

In 2024,  over a third  of all purchases were made with credit cards and those who use them might face new surcharges when they swipe or have to use another form of payment if businesses don’t accept their card.\n \n\n   \n  And because credit card companies finance credit card rewards, lower interchange fees may mean fewer perks. “If you were to lower interchange fees, you probably have to also lower rewards,” Joanna Stavins, principal economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston told CNN last month. That’s because “rewards are financed by interchange fees.”\n \n\n   \n  The two credit card giants have been entangled in a lawsuit brought by retailers for the last 20 years that alleged the companies have fixed the price of interchange fees — a large portion of the fees merchants pay when a customer makes a purchase with a credit card.

Brodie  rejected  the $30 billion proposal.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal announced this morning would see the two companies bring down interchange fees by 0.1% over the next five years, give merchants the choice to add surcharges when customers pay with credit cards as well as the option to refuse premium cards, which often charge substantially  higher fees .\n \n\n   \n  “After more than 20 years of litigation, Visa and Mastercard have reached a proposed settlement with U.S. merchants of all sizes that would provide meaningful relief, more flexibility and options to control how they accept payments from their customers,” Visa told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mastercard said that “smaller merchants will gain in this settlement – more acceptance choices, reduced costs and simplified rules.”\n \n\n   \n  The proposal from Visa and Mastercard specifically states that the deal is not an admission of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The National Retail Federation, a powerful trade group representing retailers, called the proposal “ window dressing .” A press release issued in response to reports of the proposal said the reduction in interchange fees doesn’t go far enough to address the rise in interchange fees, which they say average around 2.35%.\n \n\n   \n  The European Union capped credit card interchange fees at 0.3% in 2015.\n \n\n   \n  Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that they believe the proposal from Visa and Mastercard, which has accumulated widespread opposition from retailers, is unlikely to be enacted.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s remarkable that anyone could think a temporary 10 basis point reduction — barely more than last year’s increase — is fair compensation for allowing a credit card duopoly to maintain their pricing cartel for eight more years,” said the National Restaurant Federation.\n \n\n   \n  “If the courts can’t fix this, it’s time for Congress to take action,” said the National Retail Federation’s General Counsel Stephanie Martz.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/government-shutdown-deal-takeaways","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:48:00-05:00","title":"6 Takeaways from the Shutdown Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After eight moderate Democratic senators broke ranks and negotiated a deal with Republicans, the longest government shutdown in American history appears to be ending.

But it looks as though enough Democrats have given up on demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare tax credits and have accepted much more modest concessions.\n \n\n   \n  So how did this happen? What did we learn? And where do we go from here?\n \n\n   \n  Here are some takeaways from the politics of it.\n \n\n   \n    1. Democrats caved, full stop\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic Party isn’t leaving this process with nothing. They got a couple of significant concessions.\n \n\n   \n  One is a commitment to hold a Senate vote on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies by next month — a vote that could apply real political pressure on Republicans. Democrats also got Republicans to agree to undo President Donald Trump’s attempts to lay off thousands of federal workers and to block any other such efforts through January.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s no question Democrats are the ones who folded, and somewhat curiously so.\n \n\n   \n  Virtually every poll showed them winning the blame game. They were fighting for something — an extension of the subsides — that those polls showed more than 7 in 10 Americans wanted. About  half of Americans wanted Democrats  to hold the line — something we just haven’t seen in recent shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats could seemingly have drawn this out and forced the issue. But they didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  “The question was, is, as the shutdown progresses, is a solution on [the Obamacare tax credits] becoming any more likely?” said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and who voted to advance the deal. “It appears not.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s certainly disputable. What’s not disputable is that a handful of more moderate Democrats lost their nerve.\n \n\n   \n    2. Democrats face a new reckoning — at a really bad time\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps King and Democrats like Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  who threw in the towel  were right. Perhaps Democrats never would have won their main concession, and the shutdown would’ve gotten much uglier for the country in the days and weeks ahead — and unnecessarily so.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps worsening travel delays and Americans going hungry amid the legal fight over food stamps would ultimately have cost Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  We’ll likely never know.\n \n\n   \n  But what’s clear is that this cave came at a bad time for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  It was finally looking like the party had some unity, purpose and wind at their backs after a year of being riven and lost in the wilderness. Some polling suggested Democratic voters, whose dim views of their party rendered it more unpopular than it’s been in decades, were  warming to their party’s brand again . The election results last week, following millions of people turning out to protest Trump at  “No Kings” demonstrations  last month, were especially encouraging for the party.\n \n\n   \n  But now Democrats will endure recriminations over whether the party truly has the stomach to fight Trumpism. The lawmakers who’ve advanced this deal appear to be in for some real vitriol from the base, and it’s likely to renew efforts to cast aside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in some ways seem to be in a similar position to where the GOP was last decade, when a large portion of the party wanted to fight harder, but the more moderate and institutional ranks ultimately stood in the way of a bolder approach.\n \n\n   \n  None of which means this will sink Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. History suggests this shutdown will be a distant memory by then. Anybody who cares that much about the shutdown is probably a nailed-on Democratic voter anyway. And this issue could eventually redound to their benefit (for reasons we’ll get to).\n \n\n   \n  But it does complicate things internally right now.\n \n\n   \n    3. Trump’s hostage-taking worked\n \n\n   \n  One of the more frustrating aspects for the Democratic base will be how this ended.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t just that Democrats decided to give in; it’s that they did so in a way that appeared to reward Trump for heavy-handed tactics — again.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has in recent days ratcheted up the pressure points. It has fought in court to  avoid paying full SNAP benefits . And it has  reduced traffic at dozens of major airports , leading to  hundreds of canceled flights . (The administration said this move was about safety, but critics wagered it was  more about leverage .) Trump has also pushed the GOP to scrap the filibuster in ways that didn’t seem likely to go anywhere but might have concerned more institutionally minded Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  All of this comes after Trump explicitly targeted what he called “Democrat programs” with layoffs and funding cuts.\n \n\n   \n  This is a familiar tale by now. Trump has proved plenty willing to reach for all available leverage at his disposal, often violating political norms and possibly even the law in the process.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s worked for him. Institutions including colleges, law firms and media companies have repeatedly folded rather than fight Trump on these things, even when it appeared they had the upper hand. And that surely emboldens him.\n \n\n   \n  “Standing up to Donald Trump didn’t work,” King said Monday morning on MSNBC, “it actually gave him more power.”\n \n\n   \n  Expect plenty of Democrats to pull their hair out over that quote.\n \n\n   \n    4. Trump’s hubris was on full display\n \n\n   \n  The flip side of Trump’s approach, though, was that it betrayed some remarkable hubris.\n \n\n   \n  Just consider all that happened over the last six weeks — and how little care he took to mind the optics.\n \n\n   \n  The administration repeatedly fought to avoid paying full SNAP benefits. That provided lawmaking leverage, yes, but it also risked making it look like it  wanted  to use poor people and their hunger as leverage. The president attended  a “Great Gatsby”-themed party  at his Mar-a-Lago resort the night before Americans were due to start losing those SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House to build a $350 million ballroom that polls show the American people  are pretty skeptical of .\n \n\n   \n  He extensively promoted a  very marbled renovation  of the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s efforts to gild the White House seemed to  continue apace .\n \n\n   \n  These are all pretty questionable moves, given not just the shutdown but also a series of troubling economic signs. But Trump, who’s taken to talking about  “affordability”  of late, seems unperturbed by how it might look.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, his approval rating has  plumbed new depths   over the past two weeks .\n \n\n   \n    5. Republicans still have an Obamacare problem — and this could exacerbate it\n \n\n   \n  The best case for Democrats’ strategy is this: They were never going to get Trump and GOP leaders to commit to extending the Obamacare tax credits as part of a shutdown deal. But they could force an issue that’s a significant GOP liability, cast a spotlight on it and even force Republicans to take some tough votes and squirm a little.\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of whether that was actually the best Democrats could do, the pressure being applied on the GOP on health care isn’t insignificant.\n \n\n   \n  With around three-quarters of Americans supporting the tax credits, this issue poses very real political problems for Republicans. A recent Pew Research Center poll also showed  health care was the GOP’s worst issue  among a dozen tested, with 42% favoring the Democratic Party’s approach, compared with just 29% for Republicans’.\n \n\n   \n  Look at none other than  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia pleading with her party to renew these tax credits. Or the July  memo authored by Trump’s own pollster , Tony Fabrizio, making the case that letting the subsidies lapse could spell political disaster for the GOP in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else, this record-long shutdown could spotlight the choice Republicans are about to make. By voting for a deal that does not extend the subsidies and therefore allows premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans, Republicans will have made it clearer that this is what they fought hard for. They’ll be put on the record on the issue in an even starker way when the Senate takes a separate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  If that measure were somehow to pass, it could pressure Speaker Mike Johnson to allow a vote in the House too.\n \n\n   \n  (Johnson did not take questions at a news conference Monday morning, but he has previously declined to promise such a vote, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune has pledged.)\n \n\n   \n  While Democrats want these tax credits extended from a policy standpoint, you could argue that the best thing for them from a raw-politics standpoint is for Republicans to reject them — and for voters to remember it come 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are already having to deal with explaining the  major Medicaid cuts in Trump’s big agenda bill  over the summer. And unlike those cuts, which are delayed until after the 2026 midterms, these premium increases will go into effect quickly.\n \n\n   \n  At the very least, Democrats have continued to fertilize a potent political argument on bad issue for the GOP.\n \n\n   \n    6. Maybe shutdowns can actually work?\n \n\n   \n  Former Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell often says shutdowns simply don’t work. He said in 2023 that they “never have produced a policy change and they’ve always been a loser for Republicans, politically.”\n \n\n   \n  This shutdown should challenge that conventional wisdom.\n \n\n   \n  No, Democrats didn’t get all or even most of what they wanted. But their ability to largely win the blame game suggests future shutdowns could be successfully leveraged, if the party forcing them plays its cards right.\n \n\n   \n  The big problem with the GOP’s shutdown strategies last decade seemed to be that the things they were shutting the government down over — defunding Obamacare and building a border wall — just weren’t that popular.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats showed that if you push for something that enough people favor, you might have a shot.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/trump-pardon-allies-2020-election-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:57:00-05:00","title":"Trump pardons Rudy Giuliani, others involved in efforts to overturn 2020 election","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a significant political move, President Donald Trump has issued a sweeping pardon to numerous allies who were involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Mark Meadows, Jeffrey Clark, Ken Chesebro, John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Kelli Ward, Michael Ward, and Boris Epshteyn.

involved in efforts to overturn 2020 election \n       \n  By Karina Tsui, Michael Williams, Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:57 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump  has pardoned a long list of his political allies for their support or involvement in plans to overturn the 2020 presidential election, according to the Department of Justice’s Pardon Attorney, Ed Martin.\n \n\n   \n  The individuals listed in a proclamation, which Martin  posted on X  late Sunday, include high-profile figures like former   Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and the president’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, among dozens of others.\n \n\n   \n  “This proclamation ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election and continues the process of national reconciliation,” read the document, which gives the date of November 7 in its text and the president appears to have signed.\n \n\n   \n  It includes a “full, complete, and unconditional pardon” for those named, including some of the president’s co-defendants who were charged in Georgia for trying to  subvert Trump’s 2020 election defeat .\n \n\n   \n  The pardons mark the latest step Trump has taken to absolve or protect his allies who tried to overturn the 2020 election. Those efforts culminated in the violent riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. One of his first official acts in his second term was to pardon over 1,000 people who were charged or convicted in the January 6 ​attack.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential pardons only apply to federal charges, not state or local charges. None of the people on the list are currently charged with federal crimes, though some were named as unindicted co-conspirators in special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion case against Trump, which prosecutors withdrew after Trump’s 2024 election victory.\n \n\n   \n  However, state-level criminal charges are still pending against Giuliani, Meadows, many of the 2020 fake electors, and others on the pardon list. (They deny wrongdoing.) These 2020-related state prosecutions are ongoing in Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. These figures will likely try to use the pardon to aid their defense, though a presidential pardon doesn’t cover state crimes.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon also explicitly states that it does not apply to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon covers Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official in 2020 who  tried to weaponize   the department’s powers to overturn the election. (Clark is now a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget.) Like Giuliani and Powell, Clark was an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal 2020-related indictment against Trump,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Clark said in  an X post  Monday that Trump had called him on Friday to inform him about the pardon. He said that he never asked for a pardon, defended his actions in 2020, and thanked Trump. But he also acknowledged the limits of clemency action.\n \n\n   \n  “I wish I could be declaring this legal nonsense over for good — a pardon should totally and abruptly kill off these federal bar and Georgia-federal attacks on me and many others,” Clark wrote. “Sadly, that’s not immediate reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Powell and Giuliani, both of whom served as Trump’s personal lawyers, were at the center of the sprawling conspiracy theories which baselessly claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. Giuliani  played a leading role  in the “fake electors” scheme which sought to block then-President-elect Joe Biden from taking office by presenting certificates from battleground states which falsely said Trump won the election, during the Congressional counting of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman said in a statement that the former New York City mayor “stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election,” adding that he “never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump’s decision.”\n \n\n   \n  Two of the architects of the fake electors scheme — lawyers  Ken Chesebro  and John Eastman — were also pardoned. Chesebro previously pleaded guilty in the Georgia election racketeering indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Also pardoned were Jenna Ellis, Trump’s 2020 campaign lawyer, and former Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward and her husband, Michael Ward.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis had been accused of working to spread false claims about widespread voter fraud. She  pleaded guilty  in the Georgia case and struck a cooperation deal that led to her Arizona charges  being dropped . The Wards were accused of acting as fake electors in Arizona. Also pardoned was Boris Epshteyn, a Trump campaign lawyer who prosecutors alleged  helped organized  the scheme and later served as one of Trump’s personal lawyer during his New York criminal trial in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the people Trump pardoned as “great Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  “These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,” Leavitt said. “Getting prosecuted for challenging results is something that happens in communist Venezuela, not the United States of America, and President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime’s communist tactics once and for all.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Martin’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Also last week, the president  granted clemency  to a retired New York City police officer who was convicted in 2023 for stalking a New Jersey family on behalf of the Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also pardoned former Major League Baseball star  Darryl Strawberry  for a 1995 tax evasion charge.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/nicolas-sarkozy-released-prison-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:29:00Z","title":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Released from Prison Pending Appeal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from prison pending an appeal after being convicted in September 2025 for criminal conspiracy involving the use of Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors.

for cutting his dreadlocks \n       \n  By John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:23 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court appeared unconvinced Monday that a  devout Rastafarian whose dreadlocks  were forcibly cut in prison five years ago should be able to sue correction officials for damages.\n \n\n   \n  Damon Landor had a few weeks left in his sentence for drug possession when guards at a Louisiana prison handcuffed him to a chair and shaved off the knee-length dreadlocks he had grown over nearly two decades. Minutes earlier, Landor had handed them a judicial opinion requiring prisons to allow dreadlocks for religious purposes.\n \n\n   \n  On the one hand, the case appeared tailor-made for a conservative Supreme Court that has consistently sided with religious interests in recent years. But over the course of nearly two hours of argument, it became clear that the conservative wing is far more concerned with allowing people to sue individual state officials as a way to  enforce federal spending laws .\n \n\n   \n  That’s largely because, several justices suggested, those individual state employees were not likely aware of the agreements states had made in exchange for federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, the facts of this case are egregious,” said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court’s conservative wing. But, she said, “we can’t decide a case just based on these facts.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Neil Gorsuch, another conservative who is among the court’s most ardent supporters of religious rights, suggested that under Landor’s theory, a cisgender woman trying out for a sports team on a college campus that receives federal funding could sue a coach personally for $1 million in damages for allowing a transgender woman onto that team.\n \n\n   \n  It was a notable question in part because the court is expected in coming weeks to hear arguments on whether states may ban transgender athletes from competing on teams consistent with their gender identity.\n \n\n   \n  “As I understand it,” Gorsuch said, the federal appeals courts “are unanimously against you and have been for many, many, many years.”\n \n\n   \n  A panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals  ruled that Landor was not entitled to sue  under a 25-year-old law intended to protect prisoners’ religious interests.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative New Orleans-based 5th Circuit said that it “emphatically” condemned “the treatment that Landor endured,” but an earlier appeals court precedent settled the case against him. The full 5th Circuit ultimately  decided against  rehearing the case.\n \n\n   \n  Landor, who began serving a five-month prison sentence in 2020 for drug possession, had previously taken a promise known as the Nazarite vow to not cut his hair.\n \n\n   \n  He was incarcerated without incident at two other facilities before he was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center with only a few weeks left in his sentence. And he came armed with a copy of an appeals court ruling from 2017 that allowed prisoners to have dreadlocks.\n \n\n   \n  Landor’s case at the Supreme Court rests on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA. Congress passed that law, and another that dealt with religious accommodation more widely, in response to a landmark but controversial 1990 precedent from the court. Five years ago, the  justices ruled that the other law , which has nearly identical language, does allow people whose religious rights have been burdened to seek damages against government officials acting in their individual capacity.\n \n\n   \n  But Louisiana countered that RLUIPA is effectively a spending contract between the federal government, which provides funding for state prisons, and state officials. The individual officials involved in Landor’s forced shaving were not a party to that contract, Louisiana said, so they can’t be held personally liable.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Justice John Roberts said Landor’s argument that state employees had received notice rested on a “legal fiction.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think when the prison guard is hired, he says, ‘well, I want to see the federal conditions that you agreed to under the contract,’” Roberts said.\n \n\n   \n  The court’s three-justice liberal wing saved most of its toughest questions for Louisiana’s attorney.\n \n\n   \n  The court is likely to hand down a decision in the case next year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/military-teachers-pay-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-04:00","title":"Teachers Working Without Pay in U.S. Military Schools During Shutdown Receive Debt Letters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the 2025 U.S. government shutdown that began on October 1, civilian employees of the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA), including teachers and administrators, were required to work without pay.

\nUpdated: \n        11:22 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Teachers and other employees of US military schools who have been working without pay during the  government shutdown  received letters this week telling them they owed money to the government, CNN has learned.\n \n\n   \n  Debt letters outlining that personnel have been “overpaid” by various amounts ranging from several hundred dollars to more than $1,000, according to letters viewed by CNN. The letters, sent by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, told employees they have 70 days from the date of the letter to pay the debts.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) told employees that the letters were sent out in error due to a glitch that will be corrected once the government is funded. But impacted employees told CNN the letters added to the stress of Defense Department civilians who have been deemed essential and have worked without pay since the shutdown began on October 1. Sources familiar with the letters told CNN it was sent to not only teachers, but principals and other administrative DoDEA employees.\n \n\n   \n  “DoDEA claims it will be corrected at some point after the shutdown ends but gave no indication of when or what the process to correct it will be,” one employee said. “So, in the meantime, DoDEA teachers will continue to not only work for no pay but also be charged a debt for each day we are forced to work without pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Another DOD civilian pointed to longstanding issues with the military’s pay system and said they have little faith the issue will be resolved quickly. A third individual living overseas posted on social media that they received the letter and said the stress “is becoming overwhelming.”\n \n\n   \n  The DoDEA system has 161 schools at home and abroad at US military installations, according to the agency’s website, and teaches more than 60,000 students. As of 2022, there were more than 11,000 full-time personnel within DoDEA.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has ensured active members of the military are being paid throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The director of the DoDEA, Beth Schiavino-Narvaez, told employees in an email on Thursday, which was obtained by CNN, that the agency is aware of the “various pay-related issues.” DoDEA is “working closely with the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) to obtain all necessary information regarding the problems that are employees are experiencing due to payroll status changes,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue largely was due to a coding error due to the shutdown, Schiavino-Narvaez’s email said. All employees must be identified by a code for “Leave Without Pay” during the lapse in appropriations for timekeeping purposes, she said. Teachers and administrators’ salaries are based on the number of days in a school year they are paid for, the email goes on to explain, and therefore when a Leave Without Pay code is entered into the pay system, “the payroll system automatically adjusts for overpayment because fewer than the required number of days will be recorded.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, due to the age of its system and regulatory requirements, DFAS is unable to override these adjustments, and a debt letter is automatically issued,” the director’s email said.\n \n\n   \n  Schiavino-Narvaez specifies in the email that once the government is funded, timecards will be corrected – but she also told employees that it may take “several pay periods to fully reconcile and cancel” any outstanding debt.\n \n\n   \n  Employees “are not required to make any payments on debt letters at this time,” she said, adding that she recognizes “we are all experiencing extraordinary challenges due to the lapse in appropriations.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  previously reported  that the morale of civilian employees around the globe — many of whom are veterans or military family members themselves — is dropping rapidly with many considering leaving government service.\n \n\n   \n  The first affected DoDEA employee told CNN that to say the director’s reassurances “don’t mean much is an understatement.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have no urgency to correct this and just tell us to basically wait and hope for the best,” the employee said, “because they don’t know how to fix this and don’t seem overly concerned with finding a method to fix this.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/senators-government-shutdown-votes-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:20:00-05:00","title":"Senate Advances Deal to End Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Senate advanced a funding deal to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history by extending federal operations through January, tied to a broader package that fully funds key agencies.

     1:24 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Woody Harrelson, the acclaimed actor known for his mellow and jovial energy, was breaking down, barely able to string together coherent sentences because his mouth was on fire from the ludicrously spicy hot sauce that coated his fried cauliflower. Of course, the pain is what you order by coming on Hot Ones, the beloved hot wings YouTube show.\n \n\n   \n  Once it was over, Harrelson still coughing, admitted to  host Sean Evans , “You nearly killed me, dude … and I say that with all due respect, because I know you nearly kill people on the daily.”\n \n\n   \n  Harrelson said that he never thought he’d do the show because he used to think he didn’t have what it took to get to the end of the  poultry gauntlet . “And now, here we are,” he said, victorious.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment, while proclaimed in jest, captures a current appetite among many celebrities and fans alike to break away from conventional interviews in favor of more authentic and flavorful content.\n \n\n   \n  And what else like breaking bread – or chicken wings or, you know,  yeast extract  – has the ability to break that artifice, foster trust and entice celebrities to lower their guards for a playful exchange to which audiences can relate.\n \n\n   \n  “The hardest part of the interview is penetrating all of that artifice to get something real,” Evans told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  Ollie Kendal, one-half of the food content creator duo, JOLLY, put it even more succinctly in a separate conversation with CNN: “It’s the language everyone speaks: Food…Everyone’s got to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  And trust that people eat up the chance to see Gordon Ramsey serenade Evans with his trademark colorful language while chugging bubblegum-pink stomach soother on what has become Hot Ones’ most watched episode, or John Cena stoically brave the potent musk of British Black pudding (blood sausage) with JOLLY as he declares it a sign of sophistication.\n \n\n   \n  Hot Ones, JOLLY and Amelia Dimoldenberg’s  Chicken Shop Date  – with billions of combined total views and tens of millions of subscribers – are some of the most visible examples of the genre’s popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Many descendants have followed, including traditional media companies that are still trying to find new spins on the concept. (See: The NYT’s launch of “The Pizza Interview,” which asks press-touring celebrities to toss some dough while trying not to get their likely borrowed outfits covered in sauce.)\n \n\n   \n  In what is arguably the boom of the feed-the-famous frenzy, a natural question has emerged: Is it reaching the point of being bloated or is there more to feast on?\n \n\n   \n    Spicing up the press tour\n \n\n   \n  Food’s place within entertainment has never been a gimmick. In fact, it’s an interviewing tradition that dates back decades and has taken many forms.\n \n\n   \n  Jessa Moore, a media specialist with experience in food and tech, points out that culinary hosts like Martha Stewart and Ina Garten have featured celebrities on their shows since the nineties and early aughts. Even  I Love to Eat , the first network TV cooking show to air in the US back in 1946, featured famous designer and actress, Elsie de Wolfe.\n \n\n   \n  Morning shows, too, have for decades welcomed celebrities into their set kitchens for early-morning meal-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is entertainment, it’s something you bond over,” Moore told CNN, “Food is culture. People want to interact with each other, and food provides the glue for that.”\n \n\n   \n  In the mid-2010s, the format saw a new iteration of the approach emerge with a gourmet of YouTube shows featuring hungry celebrities – a disruption to what Evans called a “boring,” “PR-driven flight pattern.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hot Ones” mixed up the media blitz. Ten years after its first episode, it is now a desired destination for megastars such as Jennifer Lawrance, Idris Elba,  Lady Gaga  and Shaquille O’Neal, whose reactions to the exponential Scoville levels have been immortalized in internet lore.\n \n\n   \n  “What these food-driven formats reveal is that adding a slice of real life to the interview process (a meal, a drink, or any shared activity) invites authenticity, connection and unexpected honesty,” Lindsay Colker, founder of Elevate Communications, a Los Angeles-based public relations and consulting boutique, told CNN. “And that’s where the magic and the viral moments tend to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Colker highlighted the format’s ability to blur the lines between “press appearance and personality showcase,” which is aided by hosts who are “often culture-shapers in their own right - disarming, conversational and curious.”\n \n\n   \n  “They know how to draw out personality instead of polished talking points,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But she emphasized that food-themed interviews – and the wave of new media at large – are complementary and not a replacement to traditional celebrity coverage.\n \n\n   \n  What’s remarkable about these YouTube food-themed interviews is the fact that the ingredients to their success aren’t concealed in secret family heirloom or fabled recipes; no 11 herbs and spices kept away from the other online creators. It’s a straightforward blend of originality, ingenuity and accessibility.\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY had already invested years in creating food content prior to featuring celebrities in their videos. Josh Carrott, the other half of JOLLY, and Kendal said that getting celebrities to share food and culture away from the “sterile, sanitized junket world,” is not a fading gimmick they’re squeezing for views.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is like the great connector,” Carrott said. “I think over the years, our content has evolved into sharing culture through food.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Like’ and subscribe\n \n\n   \n  Evans likens the growth of food-themed interviews to that of podcasts, which were once relatively obscure but are now omnipresent.\n \n\n   \n  “The landscape is going to shift,” said Evans, “But, overall, if you like interview shows, you have certainly tons of options, and I think at a higher quality now than 10 years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Evans celebrates the growth of the niche from “barren, empty shelves” to a marketplace filled with great offerings, but he also acknowledges the concerns that it might be too much, conceding that audience fatigue is plausible in the midst of what he described as the “boom times” of the genre.\n \n\n   \n  Moore said that no matter how famous a host or a guest is, or how elaborate and slick a production is, an unauthentic product will not resonate with audiences.\n \n\n   \n  Colker echoed the sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  “These types of appearances only fatigue clients when they start to feel repetitive or disconnected from their story,” Colker said. “The sweet spot is where creativity meets comfort and when it feels natural, not performative.”\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY’s approach to content creation has always centered the fans as its North Star, which they try to follow through endless trial and error, as well as excruciating analysis of audience metrics. This includes an examination of the kinds of brands and celebrities JOLLY looks to associate with, the best platforms to reach their audience and even the lengths of videos.\n \n\n   \n  “The focus for us has been: Can we make good content that people want to see?” Kendal said, “We’re not really interested in doing content for content’s sake.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether food-themed interviews have reached their inflection point, let alone oversaturation, is yet to be determined. For now, the proof is in the pudding as more online creators and legacy media outlets continue to add to the loaded pantry of this genre.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, Vogue revived an infrequent online cooking segment under a new title,  Now Serving.  YouTuber Quenlin Blackwell’s rebranded her FEEDING STARVING INFLUENCERS series to now feature celebrities. And across the pond, broadcaster Nick Grimshaw and Michelin star chef Angela Hartnett launched  Dish,  where celebrities enjoy conversations over one of Hartnett’s acclaimed creations.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, other creators and outlets have seemingly started to  abandon the concept. Harper’s BAZAAR’s online series,  Food Diaries , was abruptly discontinued in 2023 after a six-year run, and internet personality, Joey Camasta, concluded his raunchy take on the concept after only one season of  Could I Get in Your Pantry?  \n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Hearst and Camasta for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But as long as the media climate provides the perfect temperature for these shows to grow and expand, and until audiences are satiated to the point of nausea, creators will continue to cook up fresh ideas.\n \n\n   \n  Carrott and Kendal are already manifesting their dream episodes: southern biscuits and gravy versus English tea and biscuits with Matthew McConaughey, and going through the Waffle House menu with Prince Harry.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of a perfect example of what we want to achieve,” said Carrott. “Sharing culture and authentic passion over a meal with someone.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/economy/tariff-rebate-check-proposal-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-05:00","title":"Trump floats $2,000 tariff rebate checks.

What you need to know \n       \n  By David Goldman, Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:22 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump, embattled by America’s growing  affordability problems , has once again floated a unique solution: Sending Americans rebate checks for the tariffs that his administration has collected.\n \n\n   \n  “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump  posted on Truth Social  Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold promise with several significant complications.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump proposed\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently floated the idea of tariff rebate checks. Prior to this weekend’s proposal, Trump in August had said Americans could  receive a portion of the tariff revenue .\n \n\n   \n  “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While American importers foot the initial tariff bill, they’ve been passing along some of those added costs to consumers, meaning Americans are indirectly paying for tariffs, too.\n \n\n   \n  The idea sounds similar to stimulus checks that went out in the wake of the pandemic recession — once towards the end of Trump’s first term, in 2020; and again in 2021 when former President Joe Biden was in office. But Trump suggested that these tariff rebate checks could be funded not by a general pool of taxpayer funds but instead from the money collected by US importers who pay the historic tariffs Trump has imposed on a vast number of goods from overseas.\n \n\n   \n    What the Treasury says\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s top economic adviser threw some cold water on the rebate checks.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was noncommittal about the proposal on Sunday in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” Bessent said no formal proposals have been made to distribute tariff revenue and suggested Trump’s mention of a $2,000 payment “could come in lots of forms,” including making up for lost revenue from not taxing tips, overtime and Social Security payments.\n \n\n   \n    Is there even enough money for this?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue, which includes a mix of various tariffs Trump has imposed and previous tariffs that were in place before Trump took office, according to the US Treasury.\n \n\n   \n  More than 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, the  IRS said .\n \n\n   \n  So a back-of-the-envelope calculation would put $2,000 stimulus checks at a total cost of about $326 billion. That’s more than the tariff revenue America has collected since Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he would exclude wealthy Americans, but it’s not clear where the cut-off would be and whether that could make up for the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an income threshold of $100,000 — far from the highest income tax bracket — around 150 million adults would qualify. That would cost the administration roughly $300 billion, wrote Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  According to a Monday morning social media post, the president seems to think there would be enough money left after tariff rebate checks are doled out to help pay down the nation’s nearly $40 trillion in debt.\n \n\n   \n  “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official didn’t specify what requirements would need to be met to qualify for a check. “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What about the Supreme Court?\n \n\n   \n  Another complicating factor: The  Supreme Court appears skeptical  of the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. About $100 billion of the total tariff revenue so far has been collected through this method.\n \n\n   \n  If the court rules against the Trump administration, it may have to  return that money to businesses , which would significantly reduce the amount of tariff money available as a rebate for American households.\n \n\n   \n  It could also complicate the process of refunding businesses if money has already been distributed to individuals.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do this unilaterally?\n \n\n   \n  Almost certainly not.\n \n\n   \n  Congress maintains the power of the purse, and past stimulus checks have required Congressional approval, and it’s unclear if Trump has enough support to pass something like this.\n \n\n   \n    Would Congress support it?\n \n\n   \n  Although stimulus checks have proven politically popular in the past, they have come almost exclusively during recessions or emergencies. The American economy is in neither at the moment.\n \n\n   \n  Rebate checks could exacerbate rising prices at a time when Americans say  inflation and affordability  are their top concern. Sending out checks could give America’s economy a sugar rush at the worst possible time and could ultimately ding American households if the Federal Reserve needs to hike its benchmark interest rate to counteract rising prices.\n \n\n   \n  That could lose Trump some key votes among fiscal conservatives in his own party.\n \n\n   \n    When would my check come?\n \n\n   \n  Even if the rebate checks get approval, don’t hold your breath.\n \n\n   \n  During the pandemic, Americans who elected to receive direct deposit checks had the money in their bank accounts within about a week of the first stimulus package passing. Where it got much more dicey was for the Americans who elected to receive paper checks. That process took around 20 weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-obergefell-kim-davis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:58:00.000+00:00","title":"Supreme Court declines to revisit landmark same-sex marriage precedent","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court declined to revisit its 2015 landmark decision in Obergefell v.

Hodges  allowed same-sex couples to marry.\n \n\n   \n  The court did not explain its reasoning to deny the appeal, which had received outsized attention – in part because the court’s 6-3 conservative majority three years ago overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion that 1973 decision established. Since then, fears about Obergefell being the precedent to fall have grown.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, love won again,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “When public officials take an oath to serve their communities, that promise extends to everyone – including LGBTQ+ people. The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, the legal group that represented Davis, said the former clerk would now face “crippling monetary damages based on nothing more than purported hurt feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  “Like the abortion decision in Roe v. Wade, Obergefell was egregiously wrong from the start,” Staver said. “We will continue to work to overturn Obergefell. It is not a matter of if, but when the Supreme Court will overturn Obergefell.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court today is far different and far more conservative than the one that decided Obergefell in 2015, which is part of what had given LGBTQ advocates pause about the Davis appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key swing vote who authored the Obergefell decision, retired in 2018 and was replaced by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon who was also in the Obergefell majority, died in 2020 and was succeeded by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative.\n \n\n   \n  Three current justices – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – were in dissent in Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s opinion spoke eloquently of the most fundamental values of family, love and liberty.\n \n\n   \n  “No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,” Kennedy wrote. “In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.”\n \n\n   \n  The Obergefell decision prompted a massive celebration that began outside the Supreme Court on the day it was decided in late June of 2015. That evening, the White House was lit in rainbow colors. Many same-sex couples rushed into courthouses to wed. Nearly 600,000 same-sex couples have since married, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.\n \n\n   \n  But some conservatives viewed the outcome as a betrayal and predicted future conflicts with religion. Davis, who at the time was the clerk of Rowan County in Kentucky, cited her religious objection to same-sex marriage as justifying her decision to withhold marriage licenses to all couples. She was sued by multiple couples in the county, and a jury ordered her to pay $360,000 in damages and legal fees.\n \n\n   \n  After a federal court found she had violated a court order to issue licenses, Davis was also thrown in jail for several days.\n \n\n   \n  Writing in dissent, the late Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the court’s decision as a “threat to American democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The substance of today’s decree is not of immense personal importance to me,” he wrote. “But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today’s judicial Putsch.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis had argued that it was time “for a course correction” on Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  While virtually all of the focus on Davis’ appeal was aimed at her request to overturn Obergefell, the bulk of case actually dealt with a series of more technical questions. In appealing the damages verdict against her, the former clerk argued that the First Amendment’s religious protections should shield her from legal liability, particularly since she is no longer a public official. The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Several conservatives justices had signaled in recent weeks that there was no great appetite to reopen Obergefell. Barrett  told the  New York Times  last month there are “very concrete reliance interests” at stake when it comes to same-sex marriage. Alito, while criticizing the precedent broadly during an address in Washington earlier this fall, stressed that it was a “precedent of the court that is entitled to the respect afforded by the doctrine of stare decisis.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, there have been worrying signs for LGBTQ rights groups – particularly when it comes to cases involving transgender Americans. In recent months, the high court handed down a major decision allowing states to ban the use of  puberty blockers and hormone therapy  for trans youth, allowed the Trump administration to bar transgender Americans from serving in the military and allowed the administration to require US passports to include sex markers consistent with a  person’s sex at birth .\n \n\n   \n  Mary Bonauto, a veteran civil rights attorney at GLAD Law who argued the Obergefell case, celebrated the court’s quick rejection of Davis’ appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that has changed since  Obergefell  was decided is that people across the country have seen how marriage equality provides protection for families and children, and that protection strengthens communities, the economy and our society,” Bonauto said. “Today millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of relief for their families, current or hoped for, because all families deserve equal rights under the law.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s decision to decline to hear the Davis appeal sets no precedent. If another appeal arrives threatening to undermine or overturn Obergefell, the court will review that appeal from scratch.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional details and reaction. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/reopen-federal-government-next-steps","dateOfPublication":"1110-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:20:00-05:00","title":"The Senate Cleared a Key Hurdle.

This could move quickly, or be held up by senators who want to drag out the process.\n \n\n   \n  For example, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who voted against advancing the measure, wants a vote on an amendment related to hemp grown in his state. It’s unclear if that will happen.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it “remains to be seen” when the Senate will be able to vote on final passage of the bill, though he hopes it passes early this week.\n \n\n   \n  The final package would fund the government until January 30 and some key agencies through the remainder of fiscal year 2026. So that means if the government were to shut down again over the next few months, key federal food assistance known as SNAP would continue to be funded.\n \n\n   \n  Once it passes the Senate, the package heads to the House, which will present its own host of complications.\n \n\n   \n    Then it’s the House’s turn\n \n\n   \n  Members of the House were advised to expect votes this week.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has to sell this package to his razor-thin majority, and he’ll likely need the president’s help to muscle it through his fractious conference.\n \n\n   \n  Praising the Senate for reaching a deal to reopen the government and warning his members to make their way back to Washington, Johnson said Monday: “I’m stating the obvious all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  Johnson said he will give 36-hour notice to House members for a vote as soon as the Senate has final passage of the CR in the Senate.\n \n\n   \n  “At least some Democrats,” he said, “now finally appear ready to do what Republicans and President Trump and millions of hard-working American people have been asking them to do for weeks.”\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats’ health care demands, so it’s not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson approve it.\n \n\n   \n  House Democrats are set to huddle as a caucus on Monday, according to a personal familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  Though the next few days will be critical, a source familiar with the matter said GOP leaders are optimistic about the funding bill’s chances for passage in the House. And a Democratic source familiar expects some in the party will cross lines to support it, though it remains to be seen how many.\n \n\n   \n  Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the bill?\n \n\n   \n  The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The package does not include a guarantee from Republicans to extend the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal struck between Republicans and the Senate Democratic centrists, there’s expected to be a future Senate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also includes an agreement to reverse all of the federal firings during the shutdown and ensure that all federal workers get paid what they were owed while the shutdown occurred.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-project-athena","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:11:00-05:00","title":"A plan written by Trump’s NASA pick was leaked.

was leaked. Here’s what to know about ‘Project Athena’ \n       \n  By Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:11 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 62-page document written by President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again pick to run NASA,  billionaire Jared Isaacman , outlines a sweeping, ambitious, and at times controversial plan for the space agency.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman, who was  tapped  to be NASA administrator after Trump was elected in 2024, only to see his nomination  retracted  months later, was  renominated  for the top job last Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  While Isaacman has publicly acknowledged the leaked document, which is labeled May 2025 but was recently leaked to several news outlets, he  said  in a social media post that “parts of it are now dated.” He did not specify which portions were obsolete.\n \n\n   \n  It nonetheless set off a flurry of speculation about how the space agency would function with Isaacman at the helm. A copy of the document was obtained and authenticated by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement, which was posted the day of his renomination, Isaacman  said  that “Project Athena,” as the paper is titled, “was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.”\n \n\n   \n  “I would think it is better to have a plan going into a responsibility as great as the leadership of NASA than no plan at all,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  Among the proposed goals are revamping some NASA centers to focus on nuclear electric propulsion, establishing a new Mars exploration program, and embracing an “accelerate/fix/delete” philosophy to reshape the agency.\n \n\n   \n  If enacted, many of the policies laid out could significantly alter the day-to-day lives of NASA workers and transform the 67-year-old agency.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is presenting a more dramatic set of changes than many in the space community were expecting,” said Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society, of the document.\n \n\n   \n  Some lawmakers have also expressed concern about how Isaacman might seek to reform NASA campuses across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman still faces a confirmation vote in the Senate and would need Congressional approval for many of the objectives mapped out in the document.\n \n\n   \n  As a tech CEO — who made his fortune by founding payments company Shift4 at age 16 and has twice  flown to orbit  on self-funded SpaceX missions — Isaacman is an unorthodox pick for NASA’s top role.\n \n\n   \n  Space agency administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics and public servants.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman has also garnered broad support within the commercial space industry, where he’s perceived as an energetic outsider ready to usher NASA into a new era.\n \n\n   \n    A power struggle\n \n\n   \n  According to a source familiar with the matter, the original Project Athena document was more than 100 pages. Isaacman made only three hard copies of a truncated 62-page version and distributed them to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and his chief of staff. The leak — according to a recent Ars Technica report and a source who confirmed the account to CNN — looked to have been part of an effort by Duffy, who is temporarily running NASA, to spur controversy and potentially thwart Isaacman’s renomination.\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously  reported  that Duffy has said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Duffy previously denied that he’s said he wishes to remain in the NASA administrator job, and Isaacman said in his social media statement, posted after the “Project Athena” document was leaked, that he believes Duffy has “great instincts and is an excellent communicator.” (The spokesperson for Duffy did not offer comment for this story.)\n \n\n   \n  “If there is any friction, I suspect it is more political operators causing the controversy,” Isaacman said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman was renominated for the NASA post on November 4, one day after reports about the Athena document began circulating in the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I think (the people who leaked Project Athena) thought this would ruffle feathers amongst the delegations that care about human spaceflight,” said one former NASA official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private document. “I will tell you — it hasn’t worked.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to nearly a dozen senators whose home states have NASA centers that could be pegged for major changes, according to the Project Athena document. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland — the home of Goddard Space Flight Center — offered the most detailed responses.\n \n\n   \n  Van Hollen said in a statement that he had met with Isaacman earlier this year and he “looks forward to another hearing to discuss further with him why the next space race and the search for habitable planets runs through Maryland.”\n \n\n   \n  “To protect our nation’s innovation leadership, he must be more than a rubber stamp for the Administration’s chainsaw approach to our space science initiatives,” Van Hollen said.\n \n\n   \n  Warner, whose state houses NASA’s Langley campus, urged Isaacman to “engage with Congress and reconsider any plan that threatens these world-class facilities and the communities that depend on them.”\n \n\n   \n  “The reported proposals to downsize or privatize key missions at Langley and Wallops would be a serious mistake, jeopardizing critical scientific capabilities and the talented workforce whose expertise keeps the United States at the forefront of aerospace research,” Warner’s statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  No lawmaker reached by CNN indicated how they intended to vote on Isaacman’s confirmation.\n \n\n   \n    A Mars shot and nuclear propulsion\n \n\n   \n  One eye-popping proposal in Project Athena is to set up a new Mars program, dubbed “Olympus.”\n \n\n   \n  Much of that vision, the source familiar with the document told CNN, was intended to align NASA with SpaceX’s goal of sending an uncrewed Starship spacecraft to the Martian surface next year.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX’s plan, which CEO Elon Musk  discussed  publicly in May, “was going to be a more-or-less free mission that SpaceX was going to do anyway,” the source said. The thinking was that NASA could step in to provide support through the Olympus program at minimal cost to taxpayers, according to the source.\n \n\n   \n  The document also includes numerous mentions of setting up an expansive program to pursue nuclear electric propulsion — which involves powering spacecraft engines with electricity from small nuclear reactors. The technology could one day provide steady, long-lasting power for faster and more flexible deep-space missions, including Mars travel.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has pushed publicly for expanding such research, writing in an August op-ed for  RealClearScience  that he coauthored with Newt Gingrich that the space agency should focus on tasks and research “no other agency, organization, or company is capable of accomplishing.”\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear electric propulsion is an example of such a focus area, the op-ed argues.\n \n\n   \n  “Our competitors are not waiting. China and Russia are investing heavily in nuclear space technologies. If America wants to lead, NASA must take on the hard problems again and do the near-impossible,” Isaacman and Gingrich wrote in the article.\n \n\n   \n  Project Athena also suggests setting up a demonstration mission to dock a nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft with a crewed vehicle in orbit, according to the leaked paper.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s nuclear vision also proposes that NASA centers working on projects like the  Space Launch System rocket  — including the Marshall and Michoud facilities in Alabama and Louisiana — shift their focus to nuclear electric propulsion development when the SLS program concludes.\n \n\n   \n  When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said Tuberville had not met with Isaacman yet but he “will, of course, ask about Marshall.”\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the document noted that it was crafted around the same time the Trump White House drafted the President’s Budget Request, or PBR, which called for canceling NASA’s SLS rocket and some other major projects that could have left multiple NASA centers without a cornerstone program.\n \n\n   \n  The source said that Isaacman began compiling the Project Athena document in late 2024 and updated it as he had conversations with policymakers. The source also said that Isaacman did not help draft the PBR.\n \n\n   \n  With this summer’s “Big Beautiful Bill” expressly extending the SLS program through at least the next four missions, it appears Isaacman may delay implementing a bold new focus on nuclear electric propulsion research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman  said  November 4 on social media that he hopes to zero-in on those pursuits only after a “foundation” of lunar exploration has been built.\n \n\n   \n    To the moon\n \n\n   \n  When the Project Athena document was drafted in early 2025, Trump had already signaled a renewed interest in Mars — even mentioning exploration of the planet in his  inaugural address  while staying silent on NASA’s ongoing efforts to return astronauts to the moon.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman echoed Trump’s Mars ambitions during a confirmation hearing in April, saying he intended to pursue exploration of the red planet in tandem with NASA’s moon program. However, questions about how he would fund such projects  loomed .\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, however, the moon has emerged as the  clear policy priority  amid a renewed space race with China, which is aiming to land its taikonauts on the lunar surface by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  The recent push to bolster NASA’s moon missions, including a $10 billion influx Congress gave the agency’s human spaceflight efforts in July, “brings clarity to the topic,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman is back in the running for the top NASA job at a time when the agency’s plans for a crewed moon landing, called Artemis III, are  in flux .\n \n\n   \n    Shifting lunar plans\n \n\n   \n  The Artemis III mission, which is slated to launch later this decade, currently hinges on SpaceX’s Starship ferrying NASA astronauts down to the lunar surface.\n \n\n   \n  But some policy experts have grown increasingly  concerned  that Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — is too large, novel and complex to meet NASA’s urgent timeline.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy recently signaled  a willingness to boot SpaceX  off the project, saying he would ask the company and its chief competitor, Blue Origin, to show how they could expedite development of their respective lunar landers.\n \n\n   \n  Those remarks prompted an acerbic response from Musk, a friend of Isaacman’s, who referred to the interim NASA leader as “ Sean Dummy .”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has not publicly said whether he would support sidelining SpaceX from the Artemis III mission. But a source familiar with the matter said that Isaacman has expressed an intention to partner with whichever company most quickly produces an astronaut-worthy lunar lander.\n \n\n   \n  The Project Athena “plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The plan valued human exploration as much as scientific discovery,” Isaacman said. “It was written as a starting place to give NASA, international partners, and the commercial sector the best chance for long-term success.”\n \n\n   \n    Uncertainty for science\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the Project Athena document said some of the more controversial aspects of the plan warrant more explanation.\n \n\n   \n  One line item in the document, for example, states that Isaacman intends to take “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine” — a proposal that critics say said could impede the nation’s ability to gather crucial environmental data.\n \n\n   \n  The document also maps out similar policies that could be applied across many of NASA’s initiatives, such as recommendations to embrace “science-as-service” for future projects.\n \n\n   \n  Such measures, calling for researchers to focus on purchasing data from the private sector, could mark a significant change for the agency.\n \n\n   \n  Similar policy philosophies have been tried at NASA, particularly in the 1990s during a “better, faster, cheaper reformulation,” Dreier noted. But enthusiasm waned for that approach when a  pair of Mars missions  were lost.\n \n\n   \n  And the commercial space industry may not be in a position to take up all the tasks Isaacman’s Athena document suggests it can, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It places a lot of faith on the commercial marketplace to deliver in ways that it hasn’t had the chance to fully be tested on,” Dreier said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s social media statement also acknowledges his “science-as-a-service” concept “got people fired up” but clarified that he intended to focus on purchasing data from Earth observation satellites: “Why build bespoke satellites at greater cost and delay when you could pay for the data as needed from existing providers and repurpose the funds for more planetary science missions (as an example)?”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has also publicly defended science programs such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was slated for budget cuts in the PBR. And he stated he’d be willing to spend his own money to get the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope off the ground. “I was prepared to personally cover the cost to launch Roman — if that’s what it took to get to the science,” Isaacman said in a June social media  post . (That same promise appears in the Project Athena document.)\n \n\n   \n  “Anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue,” Isaacman’s November 4 statement reads.\n \n\n   \n    A rankled workforce\n \n\n   \n  Among the other proposals in the Project Athena document are plans to hasten NASA’s reorganization. The agency has already lost roughly 4,000 of its 18,000 employees as part of the Trump administration’s deferred resignation program.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman said in his social media statement last week that he wishes to move away from rolling out piecemeal change and instead implement “a single, data-driven reorganization aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy between leadership and the engineers, researchers, and technicians.”\n \n\n   \n  Extensive changes, however, could further disgruntle a workforce that has been  reeling  from looming budget cuts and what employees have  described  as political distractions and discordant communication from leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s document also details myriad other plans to change how the agency operates — such as conducting a sweeping review of NASA’s boards and committees to suspend any that “delay decision making,” and reimagine the space agency’s approach to risk assessment.\n \n\n   \n  “We will ensure safety is at the forefront of our decisions but achieving the mission of NASA means accepting that some risks are worth taking,” the document reads.\n \n\n   \n  Former NASA astronaut and SpaceX advisor Garrett Reisman, who has long said he believes NASA may have become too risk-averse in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster, told CNN in a November 8 phone interview he was encouraged to see that Isaacman hopes to reevaluate that aspect of the agency.\n \n\n   \n  It would be unwise, he added, to start eliminating safety organizations — but they could be revamped to create a “healthy tension” between risk assessors and engineers seeking to push boundaries.\n \n\n   \n  However, he cautioned that “it’s really hard to know in the moment if you’re going too far or not,” Reisman said. “It’s a very difficult thing to do, so I wish him good luck.”\n \n\n   \n    A leader of change\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman is generally well regarded across the space industry, where he has largely been viewed as a passionate leader who can enact visionary change.\n \n\n   \n  In an emailed statement, Dreier, the Planetary Society executive, acknowledged that the Project Athena document “was prepared in a different era.” NASA has since received billions of dollars for projects including lunar exploration, Dreier noted, and science advocates have demonstrated an outpouring of opposition to Trump’s proposed cuts to research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s renomination to the NASA chief job now presents “a good opportunity to engage on some of these proposals, particularly as they relate to science,” Dreier added.\n \n\n   \n  In his social media post, Isaacman said that, if the Project Athena document becomes public, “I will stand behind it,” adding that he believes “there are many elements of the plan that the space community and NASA would find exciting.”\n \n\n   \n  But he did not wish to debate the plan “line-by-line while NASA and the rest of the government are going through a shutdown,” according to the November 4 post.\n \n\n   \n  More broadly, Isaacman has suggested he intends to enter the NASA job with an open mind and adjust course based on feedback.\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post in June, for example, Isaacman wrote that he “didn’t love” being approached by “people who thought they were uniquely NASA’s savior.” He added: “I have little interest in doing the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/mail-in-ballots-supreme-court-mississippi","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Agrees to Decide if Mail-in Ballots Can Arrive After Election Day","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has agreed to rule on whether states can count mail-in ballots received after Election Day, in response to a Republican-led lawsuit over Mississippi’s post-Election Day ballot law.

Monday  to decide whether states may count mail-in  ballots received after Election Day , taking up a Republican-led lawsuit that could affect election laws in more than a dozen states across the country.\n \n\n   \n  It is the latest of several high-profile voting cases to make it on to the Supreme Court’s docket this year as the justices are asked to deal with controversies dating back over the past several elections.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen states allow regular mail ballots to be accepted after Election Day, including  presidential battleground Nevada . Most of the nation’s battleground states – including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – require ballots to be received by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other states accept military ballots after Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  A Mississippi law, enacted during the Covid-19 pandemic, allows ballots to be received up to five days late, so long as they are postmarked by Election Day. The Republican National Committee and others sued over that law, claiming the provision violated a federal law that fixes the date for the election.\n \n\n   \n  “With rare outliers, the states mandated that ballots must be received by election officials by election day,” the RNC told the Supreme Court in written arguments this year. “But recently, an increasing number of States – including Mississippi – have deviated from that practice by permitting at least some ballots to be received after election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Officials in Mississippi, where  Trump carried more than 60% of the vote , have questioned the RNC’s logic. An election, they told the Supreme Court, is the choice of an official.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters make that choice by casting – marking and submitting – their ballots by election day. The election has then occurred, even if election officials do not receive all ballots by that day,” Mississippi officials said in written arguments. “Under Mississippi law, voters cast their ballots by election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Raising doubts about ballots that were not counted until after Election Day was key to President Donald Trump’s efforts to delegitimize the 2020 election. The question in the case is about ballots that were received after the election, not ballots that are received before the election but not counted until later.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that Mississippi was  violating federal law by counting mail ballots that arrived after Election Day , but the court notably stopped short of blocking the state’s policy before the 2024 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court is already considering other important cases involving voting and elections. It heard arguments in October in a case challenging the power of the Voting Rights Act to limit  discrimination in redistricting . The Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority  signaled deep skepticism  in that case over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana in a case that could have nationwide implications.\n \n\n   \n  And a majority of the court late month indicated it would likely back a Republican congressman from Illinois who is challenging a state law that allows  mail ballots to be received after Election Day , a decision that would let him proceed with a potentially explosive lawsuit that lower courts had rejected.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-special-treatment-commutation-raskin-whistleblower","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:43:00-05:00","title":"Ghislaine Maxwell gets special treatment in prison, Rep.

Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:00 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s second nature for some people to pour a glass of wine on a nice evening or to pop open a can of beer during a sports event — but when does drinking become too much?\n \n\n   \n  Heavy alcohol use, which researchers defined as regular alcohol consumption of three or more drinks per day, is linked to more severe brain bleeds (or a bleeding stroke) and earlier long-term brain damage, according to a study published November 5, in the journal  Neurology .\n \n\n   \n  “A bleeding stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage, is when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing blood to leak out and damage the surrounding brain tissue. Bleeding strokes account for about (15% to 20%) of all strokes,” Dr. Mitchell Elkind, chief science officer of brain health and stroke at the American Heart Association, said in an email. He was not part of the study.\n \n\n   \n  “The other kind of stroke, about 80%, is an  ischemic stroke , in which a clot or blockage of the blood vessel occurs and there is a lack of blood flow to part of the brain, causing it to die from lack of oxygen and nutrients,” Elkind said. “Bleeding strokes are typically more dangerous and disabling.”\n \n\n   \n  Some  17%  of adults in the United States binge drink and 6% drink heavily, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024,  29.7 million  Americans ages 12 and older had alcohol use disorder, a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption that can cause impairment of physical or mental health.\n \n\n   \n  “People who were drinking an average of three glasses of alcohol per day had their brain bleeds on an average of 11 years younger than compared to people who were drinking less glasses of alcohol,” said Dr. M. Edip Gurol, the study’s lead author.\n \n\n   \n    Who is at risk of a bleeding stroke?\n \n\n   \n  In the United States,  795,000 people  experience a stroke each year, and 10% of those are bleeding strokes.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, anyone — even children — can have a bleeding stroke. But the risks go up quickly with age, especially after age 55 or so,” said Elkind, professor emeritus of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University. “The most important risk factor for brain hemorrhage overall is high blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension increases with age. Recently we have been seeing more strokes in younger people due to increasing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in young adults.”\n \n\n   \n   Nearly half of American adults , or 119.9 million people, have hypertension or high blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Some  symptoms  of high blood pressure include headaches, shortness of breath and nosebleeds.\n \n\n   \n  “Another important cause of strokes in younger people is the use of illicit substances: so not just alcohol, but use of cocaine, methamphetamine and other stimulants, heroin and other injected drugs, can lead to strokes and brain hemorrhages,” Elkind said. “Alcohol — and stimulants, in particular — can increase blood pressure, leading to higher risk of strokes of all types, including bleeding.”\n \n\n   \n  Other than stroke,  hypertension  can also cause chronic kidney disease, heart disease and artery disease.\n \n\n   \n  “For patients who had a brain bleed or patients who have MRI markers of higher than usual brain bleeding risk such as brain microbleeds, I recommend them to completely stop alcohol intake or use it very sparingly,” said Gurol, a vascular neurologist at Mass General Brigham, suggesting no more than up to six times per year and never exceeding more than a glass over 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n    Decreasing your risk of a bleeding stroke\n \n\n   \n  Elkind recommends getting your blood pressure under control to help prevent a stroke.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it checked by a doctor or at a local pharmacy,” he said, “and if elevated, get it under control through lifestyle change and medication, if needed.”\n \n\n   \n  An easy way to lower blood pressure is to do aerobic exercises, such as  walking . Following good  walking form  by standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms and practicing  conscious or nasal breathing  will help regulate your body.\n \n\n   \n  Changes in your diet, such as  reducing salt intake  and following a  Mediterranean diet , can also improve heart health and lower blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  The new study’s findings were based on data collected from 1,600 adults with a median age of 75 who were hospitalized for intracerebral hemorrhage. Participants were all admitted patients at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and were predominantly White.\n \n\n   \n  Since data was collected retrospectively, it “could be biased by the occurrence of the hemorrhage itself: people or proxies may report higher levels of alcohol consumption after a life-changing event like a cerebral hemorrhage. This could lead to biased estimates of the effect,” Elkind said. “In a true prospectively designed study, the data about alcohol consumption would be collected before the hemorrhage had occurred.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/boat-strike-76-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:07:00-05:00","title":"US military strikes 2 boats, killing 6 in Eastern Pacific","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. military launched two strikes in the Eastern Pacific targeting suspected drug boats linked to illicit narcotics trafficking, killing six people and continuing a broader campaign that has resulted in 76 deaths and 20 boats destroyed since September 2025.

revealed: Meet the stylish teen dresser snapped at scene of heist \n       \n  By Caroline Baum and Saskya Vandoorne, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:25 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As all eyes turned to the Louvre after the  shocking theft  of the  French crown jewels , one especially stylish figure on the museum grounds caught the internet’s attention: a sharply dressed young man, wearing a three-piece suit and a fedora tilted just so.\n \n\n   \n  As speculation swirled about the identity of the so-called “French detective” pictured at the scene, 15-year-old Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, who featured in the photo, was enjoying his new double life.\n \n\n   \n  The teenager met CNN at his home in Rambouillet, about 30 miles southwest of the French capital, to discuss the social media furor.\n \n\n   \n  Though he may cite fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot as a style icon, Pedro confirmed that he was not involved in any investigations and that he had not been able to locate any of the €88 million ($102m) stolen crown jewels.\n \n\n   \n  He learned about the viral photo when a friend showed him a TikTok video with the now-famous image. The video had nearly 6 million views.\n \n\n   \n  “In the moment, it was, like, very funny. And we went back to the Louvre to see the reaction of the people,” he told CNN. “People maybe recognized me, but I’m not sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Pedro had planned to spend October 19, the day of the Louvre heist, at the famed museum with his mother and grandfather. When the trio arrived to find the museum closed, the stylish highschooler was unknowingly photographed by an AP journalist documenting the crime scene.\n \n\n   \n  What many online commentators had deemed a detective outfit is simply Pedro’s everyday look.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s important to dress classic. And I like to dress like that because I love history, especially the 20th century,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The young history buff has been embracing 40s-era fashion for almost a year now, he said. His obsession with the style began when he dressed as Jean Moulin, a hero of the French resistance during World War II, for carnival, a festive period celebrated in many countries ahead of Lent. Amid the parades and costumed festival-goers, he found a liking for the new look.\n \n\n   \n  “He realized the effect he had on other people,” his mother, Félicité Garzon Delvaux, explained. “Everyone looked impressed. Okay, something is happening there.”\n \n\n   \n  Since then, he has adopted the vintage style everywhere, even at school.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many of his classmates, Pedro does not own sweatpants. He is not, however, above reaching for the cargo pant on occasion.\n \n\n   \n  Good taste has long been a topic of discussion for the Garzon Delvaux family.\n \n\n   \n  Pedro’s mother, who brought him to the Louvre on that eventful day, grew up in Chartres, about 50 miles southwest of Paris, “in a museum” with an art curator for a mother and a prolific French storyteller for a father.\n \n\n   \n  In their home in Rambouillet, paintings, antiques and knick-knacks line walls and shelves in a manner reminiscent of an exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  “The beauty of things is always very important in our family,” Félicité affirmed.\n \n\n   \n  Due to her husband’s job as a diplomat, the family moved often, living in England, Spain, Bangladesh, and eastern France before returning to Rambouillet four years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the Pedro’s most striking pieces have been gathered from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  His vintage Soviet watch, for example, was bought in an antique store in Calcutta and repaired with parts that he sourced from Bulgaria with his father.\n \n\n   \n  His first tailored suit was commissioned at the age of 12 during a year spent in Bangladesh.\n \n\n   \n  Asked what he wants to do in the future, Pedro said he was interested in pursuing diplomacy like his father and paternal grandfather, or perhaps joining the military.\n \n\n   \n  The young man conceded that the uniforms may have something to do with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  But despite his carefully cultivated appearances, Pedro remains an enthusiastic young man of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  When asked if his friends at school appreciate his style, he was quick to respond.  “Yeah, I think I have a lot of aura.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/nfl-wrap-week-10","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:52:00-05:00","title":"The week of the upset: Everything you might have missed from NFL Week 10","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During NFL Week 10 in November 2025, several upsets and notable performances occurred, including the Indianapolis Colts winning a historic international game in Berlin against the Atlanta Falcons, the New England Patriots regaining dominance with a 28-23 win over the Buccaneers, and the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins securing wins to improve their standings.

Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the days grow shorter and darkness comes on quicker, the  NFL  season continues with a pivotal Week 10 delivering the same madness to which fans are accustomed.\n \n\n   \n  The week was more eventful than usual, starting with the NFL trade deadline that was highlighted by the New York Jets making headlines after a shocking fire sale that saw Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams find new homes in Indianapolis and Dallas respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday got started bright and early with Jonathan Taylor leading the Colts to an overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons in Germany, which led right into multiple teams in the bottom of the standings finding a way to secure victories.\n \n\n   \n  It also saw the New England Patriots officially commandeer their spot among the league’s elite and many blowouts in the late-game slate, including an appearance from President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Colts run all over Falcons in Germany\n \n\n   \n  The NFL’s penultimate international game of the season took place at Berlin’s Olympiastadion and delivered one of the best games of the season.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor powered the Colts to a 31-25 overtime victory over the Falcons in the first regular-season NFL game in the German capital.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old rushed for 244 yards and three touchdowns, becoming just the fourth player in league history to record at least 200 rushing yards and three rushing scores in a game twice in his career, joining Jim Brown, Adrian Peterson and Derrick Henry.\n \n\n   \n  An 83-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter put the Colts ahead 22-17, but Atlanta answered with a one-yard touchdown from Tyler Allgeier to retake the lead with just over a minute left. Colts quarterback Daniel Jones then led an eight-play drive, setting up Michael Badgley’s 44-yard field goal to force overtime.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor sealed the win for Indianapolis with a walk-off eight-yard touchdown in overtime, moving the Colts to an AFC South-best 8-2 record while the Falcons dropped to 3-6.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Commanders and Miami Dolphins will close out the international slate on November 16 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.\n \n\n   \n    The week of the upset\n \n\n   \n  The Jets, New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins haven’t had much to celebrate this season.\n \n\n   \n  But on Sunday, all three teams managed to pick up a victory.\n \n\n   \n  The Jets secured their first win of the season two weeks ago against the Cincinnati Bengals and were well-rested coming off their their bye week.\n \n\n   \n  Riding that momentum, the Aaron Glenn-led squad faced the other Ohio-based team – the Cleveland Browns – and won 27-20 for their second consecutive win.\n \n\n   \n  Special teams played the hero for Gang Green, scoring touchdowns on a kickoff return and a punt return with running back Breece Hall’s 42-yard receiving touchdown to cap it all off. Both teams are now 2-7. The Jets will look for their first three-game win streak since 2023 when they face the Patriots on Thursday Night Football next week.\n \n\n   \n  Questions are swirling throughout the NFL about the futures of head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa after the firing of general manager Chris Grier a week ago.\n \n\n   \n  And a tough task was on hand for the Fins, facing the Buffalo Bills – a team that Miami had lost to seven-straight time entering the game at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Fins blew out Buffalo 30-13 to snap the losing streak to their divison rivals and easing any qualms – at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  The Saints turned to their rookie, second-round pick Tyler Shough, against division rivals Carolina Panthers and did he deliver.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old, out of Louisville, threw for 282 yards and two touchdowns in their 17-7 win to improve to 2-8 on the season.\n \n\n   \n    Patriots are back. Are they here to stay?\n \n\n   \n  Times were tough for the Patriots in the years following the departure of Tom Brady and Bill Bellichick.\n \n\n   \n  With Mike Vrabel returning to Foxborough as head coach—a place where he won multiple Super Bowls as a player—and rookie quarterback Drake Maye emerging as the franchise leader they hoped for, New England has reestablished itself among the league’s elite teams.\n \n\n   \n  The Pats marched into Tampa Bay and defeated Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers 28-23 as Maye passed for two touchdowns and rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson rushed for two more on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  After a 4-13 record last season, New England finds themselves with a 8-2 record and an AFC East division lead.\n \n\n   \n    A late-game slate filled with blowouts and the president\n \n\n   \n  All the excitement fans were presented with earlier in the day was completely wiped up by the three-game late slate, which all featured blowouts.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump became the first sitting president to attend a regular-season NFL game since President Jimmy Carter when he arrived Sunday at Northwest Stadium in Maryland for the  Washington Commanders  game against the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  While the President was met with boos, so were the Commanders as they were crushed 44-22 by the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  Sam Darnold is yet again proving why he is one of the most underrated quarterbacks in the league after leading the Seattle Seahawks to a 44-22 win over the Arizona Cardinals.\n \n\n   \n  The former first round pick 178 yards and a touchdown while defensive lineman DeMarcus Lawrence returned two fumbles for touchdowns in the win. Seahawks find themselves in a race for the NFC West division with the Los Angeles Rams, who also won Sunday in convincing fashion.\n \n\n   \n  Matt Stafford threw for four touchdowns in the team’s 42-26 win over the short-handed San Francisco 49ers.\n \n\n   \n  Both teams find themselves with a 7-2 record with seven games remaining.\n \n\n   \n  There is still one game to go in the week with the reigning Super Bowl champions Philadelphia Eagles visiting Titletown, USA, to face the Green Bay Packers on Monday Night Football.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/uk/bbc-leaders-resign-amid-scandal-over-trump-speech-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"08:04:00-05:00","title":"BBC leaders resign amid scandal over misleading edit of Trump speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Two top BBC executives, director general Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness, resigned amid a major scandal involving the misleading editing of a January 6, 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump.

Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Two top leaders at the BBC resigned on Sunday amid an escalating scandal over impartiality and bias that plunged Britain’s public broadcaster into one of its biggest crises in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s most senior executive, director general Tim Davie, and the chief executive of the news division, Deborah Turness, both quit after the leak of a deeply critical memo that, among other things, revealed that the BBC had misleadingly edited a  speech  by US President Donald Trump to make it appear that he had directly called for violence on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In a note to staff on Sunday afternoon, Davie said his resignation was “entirely my decision.” He added that as director general, he took “ultimate responsibility” for mistakes made by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  Turness said the controversy over a documentary made by the BBC’s “Panorama” series had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Samir Shah, chair of the BBC, on Monday apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over the way Trump’s speech was edited.\n \n\n   \n  The resignations come after the Telegraph newspaper published details of a leaked internal BBC dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines.\n \n\n   \n  In an internal whistleblowing memo, Prescott revealed that last year the BBC had broadcast a “doctored” Trump speech, making it seem that the president had encouraged Capitol Hill rioters, telling them he was going to walk with them to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Trump said in his speech in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, that “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump welcomed the news of the resignations and thanked the Telegraph for “exposing” corruption, which he called a “terrible thing for democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a presidential election,” he  wrote  on his Truth Social platform.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to British lawmakers on Monday, Shah, the chairman, conceded that “the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action,” for which the BBC apologized. He stressed “it is absolutely clear the BBC must champion impartiality,” adding that the broadcaster will take action to make sure it “retains the trust and confidence of the public we serve.”\n \n\n   \n  The allegations led White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt to blast the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine.”\n \n\n   \n  British taxpayers are being “forced to foot the bill for a leftist propaganda machine,” Leavitt said in a recent interview with the Telegraph.\n \n\n   \n  On Sunday, Leavitt posted a  brief response  to X, presenting the headline from the Telegraph article, followed by the BBC article announcing Davie’s resignation.\n \n\n   \n  After the report of the dossier emerged, Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., shared it on X, writing: “The FAKE NEWS ‘reporters’ in the UK are just as dishonest and full of s— as the ones here in America!!!!”\n \n\n   \n  Lisa Nandy, the British secretary of state for culture, media, and sport, thanked Davie for his work at the BBC after he announced his resignation.\n \n\n   \n  “He has led the BBC through a period of significant change and helped the organisation to grip the challenges it has faced in recent years,” Nandy said in a  post on X .\n \n\n   \n  “Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch applauded the resignation but said that there is a “catalogue of serious failures that runs far deeper” at the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  “The new leadership must now deliver genuine reform of the culture of the BBC, top to bottom - because it should not expect the public to keep funding it through a compulsory licence fee unless it can finally demonstrate true impartiality,” Badenoch  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is largely  funded  by a £174.50 ($228) license fee paid annually by every household in the United Kingdom that owns a television or watches its streaming content.\n \n\n   \n  As a public broadcaster, the organization is held to standards on its editorial independence and fairness.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC, whose charter  describes  its mission as providing “duly accurate and impartial news” in the public interest, has been pulled into controversy repeatedly over the years.\n \n\n   \n  BBC chairman Richard Sharp  resigned  in 2023 after a report found he failed to disclose his involvement in facilitating a loan of almost $1 million to former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC  faced a boycott  in 2023 after it suspended Gary Lineker from hosting the flagship soccer show after the former soccer player criticized the government’s asylum policy as “immeasurably cruel.” Lineker was later reinstated.\n \n\n   \n  In 2012, director general George Entwistle  resigned  after a BBC report  falsely implicated  a senior British politician in a child abuse scandal.\n \n\n   \n  The director of news, Helen Boaden, and her deputy, Steve Mitchell, were  asked  to temporarily “step aside” later that year pending the outcome of an internal review related to a police investigation of sexual abuse by former BBC presenter Jimmy Savile.\n \n\n   \n  In 2004, BBC director general Greg Dyke  resigned  after facing intense pressure over a government inquiry into a Ministry of Defense employee who died after being revealed as a source in a BBC report which claimed that the government had knowingly “sexed up” a dossier on whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/democrats-voting-government-shutdown-deal","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"08:01:00-05:00","title":"Democrats Voting with Republicans on Government Shutdown Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A group of Democratic senators and one independent, Angus King, supported a bipartisan agreement to end a 40-day government shutdown—the longest in U.S. history—by securing a vote on Affordable Care Act subsidies.

with Republicans on the government shutdown deal? \n       \n  By David Wright, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:01 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A group of Democrats and one Democratic-aligned independent have helped clinch an agreement to  end the government shutdown , saying they had secured a vote on the Affordable Care Act subsidies at the center of the standoff.\n \n\n   \n  The negotiators argued that Republicans’ “flat refusal” to move on Democrats’ earlier proposals made clear that “this is the best possible offer we could secure.”\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at some of those members, and their rationale for ending the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Four of them are former governors of their home states and none are up for reelection in next year’s midterms.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois\n \n\n   \n  Durbin, a veteran member of Democratic leadership retiring at the end of his term, broke with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who opposes the deal.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Durbin said that “this bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown’s hurt.”\n \n\n   \n  He underscored the cost of the disruptions caused by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “For 40 days—the longest shutdown in U.S. history—federal workers went without paychecks. This includes our air traffic controllers, whose towers were already understaffed. They continued to work 10 hours days, six days per week to keep our airspace safe, with this additional stress at a life-saving job,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Angus King of Maine\n \n\n   \n  King, an independent, was just elected to a third term in 2024. While he caucuses with the Democrats, King has a penchant for bipartisan dealmaking and was also among the key negotiators expressing alarm about the consequences of the ongoing shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “The question was, is, as the shutdown progresses, is a solution on the ACA becoming any more likely? It appears not,” King said Sunday. “I think people are saying we’re not going to get what we want, although we still have a chance – because part of the deal is a vote on the ACA subsidies – but in the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia\n \n\n   \n  Kaine was also elected to a third term in 2024. The former governor pointed to both ACA subsidies and efforts to defend the federal workforce, a key pressure point in his state, home to roughly 300,000 employees.\n \n\n   \n  “I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans’ health care mess and to protect the federal workforce,” Kaine said in a statement about the vote.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine said the deal “guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits,” and also that it “will protect federal workers from baseless firings, reinstate those who have been wrongfully terminated during the shutdown, and ensure federal workers receive back pay.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania\n \n\n   \n  Fetterman, elected to the Senate in 2022, has been breaking with Democrats and voting for the House-passed short-term funding resolution. He said that the shutdown “has more than run its course.”\n \n\n   \n  “If we have the votes, it’s probably going to be the minimum if it does,” he warned.\n \n\n   \n  “Our party could be overplaying its hand,” he added. “I don’t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen has announced she would not seek reelection in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement Sunday, Shaheen said that “waiting longer will only prolong the pain Americans are feeling because of the shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  “Let’s be clear: This is a major step that was not predetermined. I have spent years as the lead sponsor of this legislation. There is no one in the Senate who wants to see these tax credits extended more than me. But weeks of negotiations with Republicans have made clear that they will not address health care as part of shutdown talks,” Shaheen said.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire\n \n\n   \n  Hassan, another former governor, won reelection in 2022 to her swing-state seat. She told reporters that she had been hearing from residents both affected by looming spikes in health care costs and by people affected by the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “Our work to deliver relief for families now enters an important phase,” she said. “Congress has one month to engage in serious bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act’s expiring tax cuts that help people afford their health insurance.”\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada\n \n\n   \n  Cortez Masto also voted to end the shutdown. Her term expires in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  “Too many Americans, hardworking individuals, seniors, children were suffering,” she said at a press conference, adding that she was seeing lines at food banks that rivaled the need during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  “We can open the government and we can still fight to address this looming health care crisis,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada\n \n\n   \n  Rosen, the other Democrat from Nevada, joined her colleague in voting to end the shutdown. She was reelected last year.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, it’s become clear as we go deeper into the second month of this Republican government shutdown that President Trump and Washington Republicans are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt,” Rosen said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What opponents are saying\n \n\n   \n  Many prominent members of the Democratic caucus opposed the deal and voiced ongoing concerns.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m voting no on the continuing resolution that would double healthcare premiums for 20 million Americans, kick 15 million people off Medicaid & allow 50,000 Americans to die unnecessarily every year. All to give $1 trillion in tax breaks for billionaires,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote on social media, live-streaming a speech opposing the deal.\n \n\n   \n  Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, who is eying a 2028 presidential bid, also said he was a firm “no.”\n \n\n   \n  “There’s a phrase in Spanish, ‘Con salud, lo hay todo; sin salud, no hay nada.’ It means ‘With good health you have it all; without your health, you have nothing.’ It’s with that phrase in mind that I stand firm in my decision to vote no so that families across the country can get the health care they need,” Gallego said in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/entertainment/sissy-spacek-carrie-blood","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:47:00Z","title":"Sissy Spacek says getting doused in fake pig’s blood was ‘terrible’","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sissy Spacek reflects on her experience filming the infamous blood-dousing scene in the 1976 horror film 'Carrie', which is based on Stephen King's novel.

She also expressed shock that the film was almost a half a century old.\n \n\n   \n  Spacek starred as the bullied high schooler who has telekinetic abilities which become unleashed over the course of the film, culminating in a fit of murderous rage over some very aggressive bullying: being doused with pig’s blood.\n \n\n   \n  One thing stuck out to her: “How sticky movie blood is,” Spacek said. “It was terrible, terrible, terrible.”\n \n\n   \n  She enjoyed, however, working with her costars, including Nancy Allen, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving and John Travolta, as well as director Brian De Palma.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so wonderful to get to work with people who are really into what they are doing,” Spacek said.\n \n\n   \n  The actress is currently appearing in the well-reviewed new film “Die My Love,” directed by Lynne Ramsay, and starring Jennifer Lawrence. Spacek has some thoughts as to why the horror film still resonates to this day: “That time, middle school to high school, you’re going through so many changes and we all have, no matter what, we’ve got Carrie inside of us.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a wounded teenager. It’s a hard, hard time,” she said. “Growing up is hard. And it’s kind of heartbreaking. It really hit a nerve, that film.”\n \n\n   \n  Amazon MGM Studios is preparing a “Carrie” series made from the material, to be made by Mike Flanagan, who created “Midnight Mass” for Netflix and directed “Doctor Sleep,” essentially a sequel to “The Shining.” Spacek said she’ll be watching.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/snap-benefits-limbo-shutdown-court","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:48:00-04:00","title":"Appeals court rejects Trump admin effort to block full SNAP payments, but many recipients still in limbo","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a government shutdown, tens of millions of Americans relying on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) faced uncertainty about receiving full food benefits.

admin effort to block full SNAP payments, but many recipients still in limbo \n       \n  By Danya Gainor, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:48 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Tens of millions of Americans who  rely on the nation’s largest federal food assistance program  have been caught in a weekslong swirl of Trump administration pronouncements, court orders and anxiety since the  US government shutdown  has called their ability to buy groceries into question.\n \n\n   \n  Some recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps, have received their full benefits this month, while others have only received a fraction of their usual allotment, while still others  remain in limbo , uncertain if or when their payments will arrive.\n \n\n   \n  In response, a group of Democratic-led states and a coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses have launched fast-moving legal challenges seeking to restore full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  The fight over food benefits has become a central flashpoint between all three branches of government during the  historically long shutdown  as one of the clearest and most tangible ways the impasse is affecting Americans’ daily lives.\n \n\n   \n  While a  bipartisan Senate deal  has emerged to fund the government through January 30 and ensure SNAP benefits through fiscal year 2026, the successful procedural vote is only a first step. The measure must still pass the full Senate and the House before heading to the president’s desk.\n \n\n   \n  At stake is critical assistance nearly 42 million people rely on to  feed themselves and their families . On average, households receive about $350 a month in benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s where things stand:\n \n\n   \n    It is unclear when all SNAP recipients will get November benefits\n \n\n   \n  It is still unclear when all recipients will receive their full allotment for November.\n \n\n   \n  Much depends on when – and whether – Congress actually approves a short-term spending package to temporarily fund federal agencies and reopen the government, and whether President Donald Trump signs it, which could take several more days to play out.\n \n\n   \n  If the deal falls through and the government remains shuttered, exactly how SNAP gets funded in the short term will continue to play out in the courts.\n \n\n   \n  At issue now is a lower court ruling ordering the US Department of Agriculture – which administers SNAP funds on the federal level – to swiftly issue full food stamp benefits to all recipients. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily halted the lower court ruling on Friday evening to allow the appeal to play out.\n \n\n   \n  Late Sunday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals declined a request by the Trump administration to block the lower court ruling, but the ruling has no immediate effect because Jackson’s temporary hold remains in place.\n \n\n   \n  Even after funding is decided and the USDA directs states to provide enrollees with their usual allotment, the timing of the benefits arriving will depend on the state: Some will be able to act immediately, while others may need more time.\n \n\n   \n    Some states have already issued partial or full benefits\n \n\n   \n  After a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA to pay full SNAP benefits – and the agency issued guidance on Friday saying it was complying – several states rushed to distribute to recipients their full November allotment.\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Kansas, New York, Massachusetts, California, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and Oregon are among the states to issue full SNAP benefits to at least some of their residents in recent days.\n \n\n   \n  Several states have said they will not seek to undo those distributions, as ordered Saturday by the USDA. The states argue they issued the full benefits before Jackson’s pause.\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina, meanwhile, issued partial benefits to recipients on Friday but has halted further action in light of Jackson’s stay.\n \n\n   \n    A weekslong series of court orders put millions in benefit limbo\n \n\n   \n  At the heart of the turmoil is whether the USDA must pay full SNAP benefits without new funding from Congress and if courts can force the agency to fund the program during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the USDA said  it would not use  its roughly $5.3 billion contingency fund to provide at least partial payments for November. Full benefits for November are expected to total around $8.2 billion and other expenses push the total cost to nearly $9 billion.\n \n\n   \n  Lawsuits surfaced against the Trump administration, and on Halloween, two  federal judges rejected  the agency’s claim the contingency fund was untouchable and said the administration was required to tap into billions of those dollars to at least partially cover food stamp benefits in November.\n \n\n   \n  Days after the administration  committed to providing 50%  – and  then 65%  – of the maximum allotments at the order of a federal judge in Rhode Island, the judge then said the government must immediately pivot to  fully cover SNAP  for tens of millions of Americans because some states might not be able to send partial payments for weeks or even months.\n \n\n   \n  “People have gone without for too long,” US District Judge John McConnell said during a hastily called hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Hours later, the Trump administration filed an appeal seeking to stay McConnell’s decision. Still, the USDA announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with McConnell’s order.\n \n\n   \n  That evening, Jackson granted the administration’s request for a temporary pause, saying the government did not have to immediately transfer additional funds to provide full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s order does not resolve the underlying legal questions raised by the case – and the Trump administration has already committed to using the program’s contingency fund to partially pay benefits. Rather, Jackson’s administrative stay freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Following the justice’s order, the USDA ordered states to  stop issuing full food stamp benefits  for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments. In the  Saturday directive , the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  States failing to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over-issuances of benefits, the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly one in eight Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole and Gordon Ebanks contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/flight-cancellation-government-shutdown-options","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"07:29:00-05:00","title":"Flight Cancellations Rise as Travelers Turn to Cars, Buses, and Creative Solutions Amid Ongoing Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has caused over 1,000 flight cancellations, severely disrupting travel plans for thousands of Americans.

\n       \n  By Alaa Elassar, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:29 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Xavier Vega and his partner, Soluna Vega, cheered in relief as the “Welcome to Connecticut” sign came into view. It marked the end of an unplanned 17-hour highway odyssey home after their flight became one of more than 1,000 cancellations on Saturday alone tied to the ongoing   government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The couple, who had to take a train, bus and a rental car   on Saturday   to drive over 1,100 miles from Florida, are among thousands of travelers whose plans have been   derailed by the widespread cancellations – and are searching   for other ways to get where they’re going.\n \n\n   \n  Rental car companies have been flooded with one-way bookings. Avis, Hertz and Turo all reported sharp increases in demand as passengers scrambled to make it to their destinations by any means necessary.\n \n\n   \n  An end to the travel woes could be in sight, with Senate lawmakers  voting on a key step  toward reopening the government Sunday night – but until then,  frustrated passengers continue to face flight delays and cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  For some like the Vegas, the disruptions have meant resorting to long drives, costly rebookings and days of uncertainty, all ripple effects of a shutdown that continues to grind the nation’s air system to a halt.\n \n\n   \n    The marathon to find their way home\n \n\n   \n  Exhausted and running on little sleep, Xavier and Soluna Vega set out on a 1,390-mile dash from Daytona Beach, Florida, to Connecticut, rushing to make it home on time for work Monday after spending $900 on a rental car – just two of countless travelers forced into marathon drives by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The nightmare began with what initially was a four-hour delay.\n \n\n   \n  “Our (Saturday) flight went from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., to 8 p.m. to 11:45 p.m., and we just felt so hopeless,” Xavier Vega told CNN from their rental car on Sunday while his partner drove.\n \n\n   \n  The couple had disembarked from a cruise in Miami with their best friend and took a train to Orlando, only to face a nearly 10-hour flight delay that ended in cancellation. The situation continued to worsen; a music festival in Orlando had wiped the city’s supply of rental cars. Desperate to get home, they managed to hop on a bus, which they nearly missed, to Daytona Beach, scrambling for Plan C.\n \n\n   \n  But when they arrived, the situation was just as bleak; not a single rental car was available. Then, by sheer chance, a break came when they least expected it.\n \n\n   \n  “We got really lucky with a gentleman who happened to drop off his rental before his flight got canceled, so we ended up really cramped in a Kia Soul,” Vega said, remarkably positive for someone who’d just pulled an eight-hour overnight drive.\n \n\n   \n  “I wouldn’t have it any other way, I just wanted to get home.”\n \n\n   \n    From backup plan to the only option\n \n\n   \n  Sean and Kelsey Fishkind were just hours away from what should have been a perfect third anniversary: a romantic night at “The Phantom of the Opera” in Baltimore. But two days ago, their celebration nearly fell apart.\n \n\n   \n  On Friday, the couple was en route from Boston to Washington, DC, when  their flight from their layover in New York’s LaGuardia Airport was abruptly canceled, and the next available option wasn’t until the following afternoon. But with the real possibility even that flight could be delayed or scrapped, the Fishkinds realized they’d have to find a backup plan, fast.\n \n\n   \n  At around 11 p.m., the couple says their only solution was a rental car, but finding one was easier said than done.\n \n\n   \n  According to Hertz, one-way rental bookings over the weekend surged 20% compared to the same period last year, and Turo reported a 30% jump in rentals on Friday alone.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve seen an increase in one-way rental activity as airlines adjust flight schedules and travelers explore alternative ways to reach their destinations,” an Avis spokesperson told CNN in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The Fishkinds were among the lucky ones, managing to secure a vehicle just in time for the four-and-a-half-hour drive to DC.\n \n\n   \n  But securing a rental car was the beginning of their ordeal. The couple says Delta Air Lines had assured them they’d be reimbursed for the car rental, but after hours of frustrating calls and multiple claims, they tell CNN they’re still left with no clear answers.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Delta for comment regarding the incident and car rental reimbursement in cases related to the ongoing cancellations.\n \n\n   \n  Delta said  in an earlier a statement  to customers that expense reimbursements aren’t available “for flights that are delayed or canceled due to adverse weather events or other circumstances outside of Delta’s control, including without limitation for hotels, rental cars, meals, ground transportation and other pre-paid expenses.”\n \n\n   \n  The Department of Transportation has said while airlines are  required to issue full refunds , “they will not be required to cover secondary costs,” which is the usual procedure when a cancellation or delay isn’t the carrier’s fault.\n \n\n   \n  For Sean Fishkind, a Federal Communications Commission employee furloughed due to the shutdown and without a paycheck for over 40 days, the stress is compounded.\n \n\n   \n  “From my perspective, with the impact it has on employees and the impact it has on the public, because I can’t do my job to serve the public, this is just another reminder of the more direct ways it’s starting to impact people,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It kind of feels like they’re not doing the things they need to to try to come to a resolution.”   \n \n\n   \n    Patience and kindness go a long way, travelers say\n \n\n   \n  Despite the frustration and chaos, many travelers are navigating   the shutdown’s stress with unexpected kindness.\n \n\n   \n  “We were on the appreciative side,” said Xavier Vega, a former TSA worker of 10 years who was on the front line during the 2018-2019 government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “A lot of times working for TSA, people hated us. But during the shutdown, people actually had empathy and were willing to help us,” he said. “They would give us Starbucks gift cards to get a coffee to kind of brighten up our days a little bit.”\n \n\n   \n  Now, Vega works at a group home for people with schizophrenia, many of whom lost their SNAP food aid benefits when the ongoing   shutdown froze funding from the US Department of Agriculture.   The situation remains tense. On Saturday, the US Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration  to pause full SNAP food aid benefits  for now, leaving recipients once again scrambling to make ends meet.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very difficult to tell them, ‘Hey, you might not be eating this month.’ That also added into the understanding portion of it, because I’m experiencing it as someone who has mouths to feed,” Vega said.\n \n\n   \n  He added he also worried about travelers who don’t have the same flexibility or privilege when travel plans fall apart.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m thinking, there was a gentleman in a wheelchair at the airport,” Vega said. “How is he going to get home? He’s reliant on the certainty that his flight will get there on time, that his pickup (driver) from t﻿he airport will be there at the time he says he’s going to be there.”\n \n\n   \n  For David Tilden, the shutdown turned a birthday getaway into a logistical nightmare. After an eight-hour delay at LaGuardia and a last-minute cancellation at 11 p.m., Tilden told CNN he and his wife rented a car and endured a 14-hour drive back to Atlanta.\n \n\n   \n  Tilden says he thinks the crisis isn’t just about politics—it’s about a lack of basic kindness, particularly from government systems.\n \n\n   \n  “I believe in the power of kindness and tenderness and love, and I believe in the conversation, and that’s gone in Washington. It’s disgusting, it’s traumatizing, and they should all be ashamed themselves,” he added.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A fundamental failure in the United States government’\n \n\n   \n  Although travelers are trying to stay optimistic, the outlook so far remains grim.\n \n\n   \n  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN air travel could be “reduced to a trickle” as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches and airlines continue to implement FAA-mandated reductions in flights.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines will be   required to gradually increase those cuts over the next week, with Duffy warning flight reductions  could increase to 20%  if the shutdown doesn’t end soon.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Senate convened a rare Saturday session, though senators  did not vote  and there is no deal in sight on a potential funding compromise. Majority Leader John Thune said he intends to  keep the chamber in session  until a deal is reached and the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s happening in Washington is like two kids watching their parents fight every day because they hate each other,” said Tilden, adding the shutdown and its impact on Americans is a stark contradiction to the values of American democracy and unity.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not the United States of America. This is the divided States of America. They’re hypocritical when they stand up and chant USA,” Tilden said.\n \n\n   \n  For Vega, the focus, he says, should be on the people most affected — the vulnerable, like the residents he works with who struggle with mental health issues worsened by the sudden loss of SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think whatever is being argued in Washington right now is more important than people having food on the table or being able to get from point A to point B with some level of certainty,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But if the shutdown stretches into the holidays, Vega believes it will signal a far deeper crisis beyond canceled flights.\n \n\n   \n  “At that point, there has been a fundamental failure in the United States government, and we as citizens have to speak up on that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Manu Raju and   Gordon Ebanks contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:01:00-04:00","title":"A timeline of US strikes on boats that have killed 76","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States military conducted 19 lethal strikes between September 2 and November 9, 2025, killing 76 people and destroying 20 boats in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans.

Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:01 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 76 people in 19 strikes that have destroyed 20 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN. He arrived in the country on October 18 and underwent a medical evaluation.\n \n\n   \n  The Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador reported on October 20 that there is no information that Tufiño Chila had committed a crime in Ecuadorian territory. However, US court documents indicate that he was arrested, convicted and imprisoned in 2020 for drug smuggling on the coast of Mexico before being deported.\n \n\n   \n  “No, no… He is not. He is not a criminal,” said Tufiño Chila’s sister, who requested anonymity for security reasons, in statements to CNN from a small coastal town near Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n     October 17 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that a seventh targeted vessel “transporting substantial amounts of narcotics” was struck and that it was affiliated with a Colombian terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  All three crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are—they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda.”\n \n\n   \n  The attacks sparked public clashes with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who accused the United States of killing an innocent Colombian citizen during one of its strikes on vessels in the Caribbean. Trump announced he would cancel all US aid and subsidies to the country.\n \n\n   \n     October 21 and 22, first attacks in the Pacific \n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out lethal strikes on two ships in the Pacific, killing everyone on board each vessel, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  Two people were killed in the eighth strike and three in the ninth.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth wrote on X that the first vessel targeted in the Pacific was “operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific,” adding, “The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling.”\n \n\n   \n  The action against vessels in the Pacific appeared to mark an expansion of the US military campaign, as the previous seven attacks were all conducted against ships in the Caribbean Sea.\n \n\n   \n  “Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n     October 24 \n \n\n   \n  The tenth attack killed all 6 crew members.\n \n\n   \n  The Defense secretary said the US conducted a nighttime attack on a ship allegedly operated by Tren de Aragua in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n     October 27, multiple strikes \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth reported multiple strikes in a single day for the first time, with three missiles hitting four vessels in international waters of the eastern Pacific on Monday, October 27.\n \n\n   \n  He reported that 14 people were killed aboard the vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations” and that there was one survivor who was not recovered.\n \n\n   \n  “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary stated.\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth said that the US military had contacted the Mexican government to look for the survivor. The Mexican Navy conducted a search for the person, who is now presumed dead.\n \n\n   \n     October 29 \n \n\n   \n  The United States Armed Forces carried out an attack on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that left four dead, Hegseth reported.\n \n\n   \n  “This vessel, like all the others, was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” the Defense Secretary said in a  post on X . He added that US forces suffered no casualties.\n \n\n   \n    November 1\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out  a strike on  another vessel in the Caribbean Sea and killed three people on board, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on another narco-trafficking vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) in the Caribbean,”  Hegseth announced on X  with an unclassified video of the strike. No US forces were harmed in the strike, he noted.\n \n\n   \n    November 4\n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced the US military struck another vessel “involved in illicit narcotics smuggling” in the eastern Pacific, killing two people on board.\n \n\n   \n  The US Defense secretary again posted an unclassified video of the strike  on X , noting that US forces were not harmed and the vessel was struck in international waters.\n \n\n   \n    November 6\n \n\n   \n  The US military conducted a strike against a vessel in the Caribbean, killing three people, according to Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  “The vessel was trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean and was struck in international waters,” Hegseth said in a  post on X , adding that US forces were not harmed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n    November 9\n \n\n   \n  The US military carried out another attack against suspected drug boats on Sunday, killing six people in the Eastern Pacific according, to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The military launched two lethal strikes against two separate vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations,” Hegseth  wrote on X , without disclosing which organizations the ships’ crew are believed to have been affiliated with.\n \n\n   \n  “These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/asia/malaysia-thailand-migrant-boat-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"03:02:00-05:00","title":"Near dozen dead in Thai-Malaysia search after Rohingya migrant boat sinks","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A migrant boat carrying Rohingya refugees sank near the Thailand-Malaysia border, resulting in 11 confirmed deaths and 13 survivors, including 11 Rohingya and two from Bangladesh.

Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier killed more than a decade ago in Gaza, the Prime Minister’s Office said on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed in the final days of the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas and his body has been held in Gaza since then.\n \n\n   \n  “We brought Lt. Hadar Goldin - our son, a fighter - to be buried in Israel,” his father, Simcha Goldin, said in a televised statement outside their home in Kfar Saba on Sunday evening. “We do not abandon soldiers on the battlefield, because this is a value and we don’t compromise on values. Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.”\n \n\n   \n     Following the burial ceremony in Israel on Sunday, his mother, Leah Goldin, said, “The first is the value of friendship and comradeship, the second is the right to burial in Israel, and the third is human dignity. Sadly, we faced many disappointments. We cannot give up on who we are, and we will prevail through our values.”\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s return “provides some measure of comfort to a family that has lived with agonizing uncertainty and doubt for over 11 years,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, “I know the anguish that his family has endured. I know the pain and the solidarity that have united the entire people of Israel. And today, we are united in the knowledge that we have finally brought him back to his parents and to his family.”\n \n\n   \n  As with previous hostage returns, Hamas handed what it said was Goldin’s body to the the International Red Cross, which then transferred it to the Israeli military. The handover was part of the ceasefire agreement that brought the worst of the fighting in Gaza to an end a month ago.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin’s family has spent years campaigning for his return, citing Israel’s commitment to the principle of leaving no one behind in conflict. The international campaign for the return of hostages taken during the Hamas-led terror attack on October 7, 2023, put a new spotlight on their fight.\n \n\n   \n  Goldin was killed on August 1, 2014, just as a ceasefire went into effect to end the conflict and just days before Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza. The Israeli military had activated the so-called Hannibal Directive, a controversial order that enables Israeli troops to take extraordinary measures to prevent a kidnapping, even at the risk of harming the abducted. Goldin’s abduction led to massive Israeli strikes in Rafah. He was 23 years old, one of 68 Israeli soldiers killed during the month-and-a-half-long war.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in that war, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n \n\n   \n  Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire, Hamas was required to return all hostages, including the bodies of those who had been killed.\n \n\n   \n   Israeli intelligence has previously assessed  that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.\n \n\n   \n  The return of Goldin’s body leaves four deceased hostages still in Gaza. Three are Israelis who were killed on October 7, 2023, and whose bodies were taken to Gaza. The fourth is a Thai citizen who was kidnapped during the attack. The Thai government said in May 2024 that he was presumed dead.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/style/jadeite-cabbage-taiwan-forbidden-city-curio-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"04:04:00-05:00","title":"How a humble cabbage became one of the Forbidden City’s most memorable treasures","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Jadeite Cabbage, a realistic jade carving from the Qing dynasty, has become one of the most iconic and beloved artifacts at the National Palace Museum in Taipei.

memorable treasures \n       \n  By Wayne Chang, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:04 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Louvre’s “Mona Lisa,” the British Museum’s Rosetta Stone, MoMA’s “Starry Night” — major museums often have one must-see item that singlehandedly draws visitors from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  For the National Palace Museum, in Taiwan’s capital Taipei, the star attraction is somewhat humbler: a cabbage.\n \n\n   \n  Carved from a block of white and green jadeite, the remarkably realistic sculpture of a Chinese cabbage glistens as if freshly picked from a field, still wet with morning dew. A katydid and locust lurk in its verdant leaves, while the unknown sculptor used the material’s natural flaws to create the illusion of ribs running along its stems.\n \n\n   \n  Resting gently on a wooden stand, the carving is just 7.4 inches tall. But it is so popular that it occupies its own exhibition hall. The museum even publicizes which dates the object will be away on “business trips” — in other words, when it is on loan or exhibited elsewhere — so visitors are not left disappointed.\n \n\n   \n  The museum does not record how many of its approximately 2 million annual visitors come specifically to view the Jadeite Cabbage. But the long line of people waiting to snap photos suggests that many, if not most, of them do. “When you see it in pictures, it doesn’t seem that vivid, but when you see it here in true light, it’s really more attractive,” said Chloe Wang, a tourist from mainland China, during a recent trip to the museum.\n \n\n   \n  The cabbage’s popularity often sees it dubbed a “national treasure” of Taiwan, although the sculpture is not officially designated as such. Its image is pasted across merchandise and turned into plush toys and replica models, in the museum store and beyond.\n \n\n   \n  The Jadeite Cabbage, like most of the National Palace Museum’s collection, is an imperial relic once housed at the Forbidden City in Beijing before being relocated to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. It is, by no means, the only one: Beijing’s Palace Museum and the Tianjin Museum, also in mainland China, both have cabbages carved from jade. In fact, the Taiwan museum itself even has two other examples.\n \n\n   \n  So why did this one, also known as “Jadeite Cabbage with Insects,” achieve global fame?\n \n\n   \n  Hsu Ya-hwei, an art history professor at National Taiwan University, said the jade’s shimmering colors and the sculptor’s technique help the piece stand out. “The craftsmanship, combined with this particular piece of the material, produced a good result,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But the cabbage’s enduring popularity may also come down to its perceived symbolism. Possibly part of a dowry paid to China’s Guangxu Emperor by a consort in the 1880s, the artifact has long been associated with female purity, fertility and abundance. While some historians have questioned the long-held belief that the locust and katydid represent children — and whether the item was even a dowry gift — the idea nonetheless grabbed people’s imaginations, said Hsu.\n \n\n   \n  “The auspicious wishes contained in the artifact are quite important, and probably a key factor in its appeal to ordinary visitors,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    Few historical clues\n \n\n   \n  After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Jadeite Cabbage was discovered sitting in a colorful enamel pot in the Forbidden City. It later went on show at Beijing’s Palace Museum, which was opened by China’s Republican government to display the vast imperial collection. Curators opted to present the cabbage without its pot, to make it more visually appealing, and it was an instant success with the public after﻿ debuting in 1928.\n \n\n   \n  In the 1930s, amid fears the palace collection would be seized by Japan’s Imperial Army, many of the treasures were evacuated to other cities and spent years on the road, sometimes hidden in temples and caves on the way. After Communist leader Mao Zedong triumphed in the Chinese Civil War, the fleeing Republican forces shipped thousands of crates of artifacts to Taiwan, where they established a new seat for their government.\n \n\n   \n  The Jadeite Cabbage was among the almost 700,000 items now forming the collection of Taipei’s National Palace Museum, which opened at its current location in 1965. Three years later, Taiwan’s national postal service issued a  stamp  featuring the cabbage’s image that was printed 3.5 million times, further cementing it in the public imagination.\n \n\n   \n  The cabbage is often referred to as one of the institution’s “three treasures,” along with two other popular artifacts — namely the Meat-Shaped Stone, a piece of jasper carved to resemble braised pork belly, and the Mao Kung Ting, a traditional cooking vessel featuring the longest known inscription of ancient characters on any item of Chinese bronzeware.  ﻿ The trio are often collectively described as “pickled cabbage pork hotpot” by tour guides and as a marketing gimmick.\n \n\n   \n  The everydayness of these items may also hold clues to their draw. “The familiar and endearing image of the cabbage instantly creates a connection to the imperial court, which can sometimes feel quite distant and foreign,” wrote Wang Shao-chun, a former researcher with the museum’s antiquities division, in a museum journal ﻿earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Yet, despite the Jadeite Cabbage’s popularity among the public, some art historians and museum curators are unfazed. To trained eyes, it is of similar quality to many other realistic jade carvings, which were quite prevalent in the Qing dynasty.\n \n\n   \n  “It is one of the most unique, but not the only great piece of Chinese craftsmanship,” wrote Chang Li-tuan, a former researcher with the museum’s antiquities division, in the aforementioned﻿ museum journal.\n \n\n   \n  Researchers also say the lack of written records about the artifact — including information on who commissioned, crafted and owned it — leave the item’s historical context largely unknown.\n \n\n   \n  “There are few historical clues about the piece that allow us to talk about it in-depth,” Hsu said. “Or at least, they have not yet been found.”\n \n\n   \n  This may be why Taiwan’s Ministry of Culture has only designated the cabbage a “significant antiquity,” rather than a full-fledged National Treasure.\n \n\n   \n  “Its popularity and its historical value are clearly unproportional,” Wang told CNN. “Just like movies, a blockbuster may not necessarily be a masterpiece, and vice versa.”\n \n\n   \n  For museum curators, Wang added, the Jadeite Cabbage’s fame is a double-edged sword. “We work hard to promote other great exhibits, but sometimes the only thing on people’s minds is the cabbage. It’s kind of like a singer only remembered for that one hit song.”\n \n\n   \n    Celebrating its centennial\n \n\n   \n  The museum attaches high importance to the security of its most prized artifacts. The Jadeite Cabbage is displayed in a reinforced glass cabinet and held in place by tight strings to protect it from sudden movements — an ever-present threat in earthquake-prone Taiwan.\n \n\n   \n  When it travels, it is placed in a dedicated container, which in turn is placed in a wooden box filled with protective packaging. Police and dedicated museum staff typically escort the cabbage to the airport.\n \n\n   \n  It is, however, seldom lent to overseas museums. Prior to this year, the last time the item traveled abroad was in 2014, when it (and the Meat-Shaped Stone) was exhibited in Japan. But loans can sometimes serve as tools of diplomacy. In August, as Taiwan celebrates 100 years since the Palace Museum opened, the Jadeite Cabbage was sent, along with more than 130 artifacts, to the Czech Republic, whose ties with Taiwan have warmed — as its relations with China have deteriorated — in recent years.\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s ruling Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its own territory despite never having ruled over it, criticized Taipei for engaging in “separatist maneuvers” by facilitating the Czech exhibition, which is on show in the capital Prague through December 31. Taiwanese government and museum   officials rejected the accusation, calling it simply a “cultural exchange.”\n \n\n   \n  In late September, Taiwan’s government said it had received an anonymous email threatening “arson, theft, shootings or terror attacks” if the exhibition continues. In a statement, the National Palace Museum said it was working with Czech authorities to enhance security.\n \n\n   \n  The exhibition remains open, with the Jadeite Cabbage proving to attract Czech visitors.\n \n\n   \n  “It dates from the late 19th century. But it is a perfect example of the highest artistry achievable with jade,” the show’s curator, Ondřej Crhák, told Radio Prague International in September, calling the loan “a rare opportunity.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is its first appearance in Europe,” he added. “Given its importance to the National Palace Museum and to Chinese culture, that makes it truly unique.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/asia/south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-charges-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:14:00-05:00","title":"South Korea special prosecutor indicts former President Yoon on charges of aiding an enemy state","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South Korea's special prosecutor has indicted former President Yoon Suk Yeol, former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, and former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung on charges of abusing power and aiding an enemy state.

Fung-wong, known locally as Uwan,   follows on the heels of  Typhoon Kalmaegi , which killed almost 200 people in the central part of the archipelago nation, as well as five people in Vietnam.    \n \n\n   \n  About 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead the typhoon making landfall on Sunday night, according to the Office of Civil Defense. Fung-wong slammed into the coastal municipality of Dinalungan, on the main island of Luzon, with sustained winds of up to 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph).\n \n\n   \n  A mudslide buried a house and killed two children in the town of Kayapa in central Luzon, regional civil defense official Alvin Ayson told Reuters news agency Monday.\n \n\n   \n  They followed the deaths of   two people  —  one who   drowned in Catanduanes province and a woman who died after being trapped under the debris of a collapsed home in Catbalogan City, according to the civil defense.\n \n\n   \n  The storm, with a footprint that spanned nearly the entirety of the archipelago, lost strength as it swept through mountainous northern provinces and agricultural plains overnight, before heading into the South China Sea toward Taiwan, according to the Philippines’ weather agency PAGASA.\n \n\n   \n  Taiwan is now bracing for Fung-wong, with school closures announced in parts of the eastern county of Hualien, and evacuation orders issued in flood and landslide-prone areas, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported.\n \n\n   \n  Dramatic video from the Philippines showed rescuers braving strong winds and homes submerged in water as recovery efforts continued overnight into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Drone footage from Reuters showed vast areas of flooded farmlands in Nueva Ecija province, while other videos showed massive waves crashing into the Catanduanes coastline, flooded streets, and water surging into a building in Aurora province, while families queued for food in shelters.\n \n\n   \n  About 1.4 million residents took emergency shelter at gymnasiums, theaters and relatives’ homes before the typhoon hit, with 318,000 remaining in evacuation centers on Monday, officials said.\n \n\n   \n  “We could not sleep because of the winds hitting our metal sheets and tree branches falling,” Romeo Mariano, who sheltered with his grandmother at home in Isabela province, told Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  “When we got out to check our home, we saw the damage.”\n \n\n   \n  Filomina Mariano, a 69-year-old resident in Santiago City told Reuters: “I was not able to sleep last night. I told my grandchildren to pray for our safety. I was just sitting the whole night waiting for the storm to pass.”\n \n\n   \n  Around 1,000 houses were damaged in the storm, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) said, adding that some homes remain blocked by landslides and rescuers are working to reach them once conditions improve Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “While the typhoon has passed, its rains still pose a danger in certain areas in northern Luzon, including in metropolitan Manila,” Alejandro said. “We’ll undertake today rescue, relief and disaster-response operations.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 130 northern villages were flooded, with residents in at least one community trapped on their roofs as floodwaters rapidly rose, according to the Associated Press.\n \n\n   \n  “People are a little shellshocked,” Butch Meily, president of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF), told CNN, noting this marks the country’s fourth major typhoon, in addition to  two earthquakes , within the past seven weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Recovery efforts were interrupted in Kalmaegi-stricken Cebu and Davao to the south ﻿ , to concentrate all available resources on Fung-wong, including a 24-hour operation center near the capital Manila, said Meily of the PDRF, a major private-sector coordinator for disaster response.\n \n\n   \n  “But our funds are starting to get exhausted because of the number of emergencies,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  At its height, the typhoon’s massive circulation spanned 1,800 km — enough to cover the entire country, PAGASA weather specialist Benison Estareja told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared a state of emergency on Thursday due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected damage from Fung-wong.\n \n\n   \n  More than 325 domestic and 61 international flights were canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in ports after the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas, AP reported. About 3 million people were left without power on Sunday, according to Philippines News Agency.\n \n\n   \n  While the Philippines has not requested international aid after Kalmaegi, officials said the US and Japan are prepared to assist, and authorities have ordered schools and most government offices to close until Wednesday, according to AP.\n \n\n   \n    No pause for relief\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is no stranger to typhoons, and Fung-wong is the 21st named storm to impact the country this year, according to local officials.\n \n\n   \n  Its predecessor Kalmaegi left a trail of death and devastation as it tore through the central Philippines on Tuesday, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble and displacing tens of thousands of people. At least 188 people were killed, most in Cebu province, a tourist hotspot, local authorities said.\n \n\n   \n  Though not the strongest storm to hit the country this year, Kalmaegi was slow-moving and dumped huge volumes of water over highly populated areas. Officials said most people died from drowning.\n \n\n   \n  Its impact was worsened by clogged waterways in an already flood-prone area, and an apparent lack of understanding of early warnings, Alejandro of the Office of Civil Defense, told local media.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is one of Asia’s most flood-prone countries but this year it has also been mired in a massive corruption scandal involving flood control projects that have brought thousands of protesters onto the streets.\n \n\n   \n  Dozens of legislators, senators and construction companies have been accused of receiving kickbacks with money intended for thousands of flood control projects.\n \n\n   \n  Scientists have  long warned  the human-caused climate crisis – for which industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility – has only exacerbated the scale and intensity of regional storms that disproportionately impact populations in the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  The Philippines is one area where the weather is changing, with more intense storms and severe tropical storms with a wide rain band, Meily said.\n \n\n   \n  “In the past, we used to focus on where the storm would make landfall. But now we have to consider the rain band because it’s so wide in scope that areas far away from where the storm makes land are getting flooded.”\n \n\n   \n  The western Pacific is the most active tropical basin on Earth but global ocean temperatures have been at record levels for each of the last eight years.\n \n\n   \n  Hotter oceans, fueled by  human-caused global warming , provide ample energy for storms to strengthen.\n \n\n   \n  The climate crisis is supercharging rainfall events as warmer air can hold more moisture, which it then wrings out over towns, cities and communities, as it already has this week in Southeast Asia.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/europe/ukraine-russia-power-attack-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"02:20:00-04:00","title":"Millions of Ukrainians Face Dark and Cold After One of Russia’s Largest Attacks on Energy Infrastructure","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Russia launched one of its largest attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure over the weekend, targeting nine regions including Kyiv, Poltava, and Dnipropetrovsk.

Ukrainians face dark and cold after one of Russia’s largest attacks on energy infrastructure \n       \n  By Daria Tarasova-Markina and Tim Lister, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:20 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Millions of Ukrainians are enduring cold temperatures and darkness after a wave of Russian attacks against energy facilities caused widespread power outages across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Ukrainian authorities have warned that the large scale of the damage means it will take time to restore energy flows. Electricity supplies across the country are being rationed – with people in the capital Kyiv set to be without power for 10-12 hours on Sunday, according to schedules published by energy companies.\n \n\n   \n  Svitlana Grynchuk, Ukraine’s energy minister, said the attack on Saturday was “one of the largest direct ballistic attacks on energy facilities” since the start of the war.\n \n\n   \n  She said that emergency power cuts were implemented across almost all regions to stabilise the network. “We then switched to hourly power cuts, so that consumers could more easily plan their activities around the outages,” Grynchuk said.\n \n\n   \n  The attack over the weekend came just as temperatures in Ukraine began to drop to single digits degrees Celsius. Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on numerous occasions since it launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, usually stepping up attacks around this time of the year.\n \n\n   \n  These frequent disruptions have forced Ukrainians to adapt – diesel generators have become a common sight across the country and people have become accustomed to scheduling their lives around planned outages.\n \n\n   \n  Many families are now scheduling cooking and homework time around the power schedules, and elderly people not leaving their homes in fear of getting stuck without an access to the lift.\n \n\n   \n    Russia strikes when people are asleep\n \n\n   \n  Nine Ukrainian regions came under attack overnight into Saturday, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n \n\n   \n  At least 15 civilians have been killed by Russian strikes over the weekend, according to Ukrainian local authorities.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed and 12 injured when a Russian drone struck a nine-story apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro.  Video captured  the moment the drone struck in the darkness.\n \n\n   \n  “There’s nothing here, just ordinary buildings,” said a woman who gave her name as Maia.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know how I survived, because all the shrapnel flew onto the bed where I was sleeping,” said Larysa, another resident of the building.\n \n\n   \n  “We gathered quickly and started to go downstairs. People were screaming. You could already hear screams from the street,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Of the 45 missiles fired by Russia overnight Saturday, some of which were ballistic weapons, the Ukrainian air force said only nine had been intercepted. Some 450 drones were also launched.\n \n\n   \n  “26 missiles and 52 strike UAVs (drones) have been recorded hitting 25 locations,” it said, with many of the attacks occurring in the central regions of Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk as well as Kyiv.\n \n\n   \n  “It is extremely difficult to counter ballistic and aero-ballistic missiles,” Zelensky said in his daily address later Saturday. “Only a few systems in the world are capable of intercepting such missiles effectively – and to protect our entire territory, we need far more of these systems and far more of the missiles for them.”\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian president said Kyiv was working with the US to purchase additional Patriot air defense systems, which have proved capable in intercepting Russian missiles.\n \n\n   \n  Ukraine has requested more help from allies to replenish its air defenses, as well as longer-range missiles to attack Russian energy and military facilities. Its request for US Tomahawk missiles was turned down by President Donald Trump last month.\n \n\n   \n  Russia’s defense ministry said the strikes had come in response to Ukrainian attacks, and had included Kinzhal ballistic missiles and other weapons in strikes against “enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex and gas and energy facilities of Ukraine that supported their operations.”\n \n\n   \n  The frequent attacks on energy have seriously damaged Ukrainian gas production. Ukrainian officials have said they’ll have to turn to expensive imports of European gas to make up the shortfall.\n \n\n   \n  “Despite the enemy’s plans, Ukraine will have light and heat this winter,” said energy minister Grynchuk.\n \n\n   \n  The Ukrainian military and security services  have also stepped up  drone and missile attacks against Russian refineries and other infrastructure such as pipelines and pumping stations in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, Ukrainian drones carried out what one Russian official described as a “massive attack” on energy facilities in the Volgograd region, a frequent target of Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  A substation was hit, according to Andrey Bocharov, the regional governor, who said power was restored several hours after the strike.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/climate/south-america-oil-gas-brazil-guyana-argentina-climate","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Welcome to the planet’s newest oil frontier","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"South America is rapidly emerging as a major new frontier for oil production, driven by significant discoveries in Brazil, Guyana, and Argentina.

10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Off Brazil’s northeastern coast, where the sediment-heavy water of the vast Amazon River tips out into the Atlantic, are two very different types of treasure. The first is an ecological gem: a 3,600 square-mile  deepwater coral reef  discovered less than a decade ago. The second treasure puts the first in immediate danger. Billions of barrels of oil may lie in the ancient sediments beneath the seabed, and licenses have just been approved to drill there.\n \n\n   \n  A few hundred miles north, off the coast of Guyana, companies are already pumping around 650,000 barrels of oil a day from a huge deep-water reservoir discovered in 2015. The find has transformed this rainforest-carpeted country into the planet’s newest petrostate and highest oil producer per capita.\n \n\n   \n  Several thousand miles inland to the south, the wide, dusty plains of western Argentina’s Vaca Muerta — “dead cow” in English — are dotted with oil wells. Fossil fuel production from this enormous shale deposit has boomed over the past decade, putting it on track to produce  more than a million barrels a day  by 2030, analysts predict.\n \n\n   \n  Welcome to South America’s new oil frontier. “It’s really incredible how fast and how much it’s expanding,” said Nicole Figueiredo de Oliveira, the executive director at environmental non-profit Arayara.\n \n\n   \n  Countries across the region are ramping up extraction but Brazil, Guyana and Argentina are at the forefront —  among the top five drivers  of global oil growth outside of OPEC, the group of major oil exporters.\n \n\n   \n  They are three very different countries: an economic behemoth with an  environment-championing president , a  biodiversity hotspot  with high rates of poverty and an  economically volatile  country led by a  chainsaw-wielding climate denier . Yet they are united in their quest to expand oil production, arguing it’s vital to their economic and social development.\n \n\n   \n  This new fossil fuel boom is happening just as the impacts of the climate crisis — driven by fossil fuels — are beginning to bite in ever more alarming ways. People in South America are dying in  fires ,  floods ,  storms  and  droughts  made longer and more catastrophic by climate change.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s role as  host of the COP30 climate conference , which is supposed to be a landmark summit where countries set out goals to radically reduce planet-heating pollution, adds a particular dissonance to this oil surge.\n \n\n   \n  But as global oil demand stays strong, and other, richer, countries show few signs of scaling back, their argument is: Why shouldn’t oil supply come from South America?\n \n\n   \n  The continent has a long history of fossil fuel extraction; it holds the  second-largest reserves of oil and gas  after the Middle East.\n \n\n   \n  Yet it’s one of the few regions that didn’t take advantage of the oil boom at the beginning of this century due to political riskiness and an aversion to private investment, said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University. “But that is changing very significantly,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Recent discoveries have stirred excitement, especially as the oil in South America is typically cheaper than average — deepwater sources, in particular, tend to produce large amounts at lower cost — and it also tends emit slightly lower levels of climate pollution per barrel, as it often requires less processing and is produced using newer infrastructure and cleaner energy.\n \n\n   \n  Huge oil companies including Exxon and Chevron have plowed in, seeing dollar signs in South America’s deep oceans and shale fields just as the US shale boom starts to plateau.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil is a superstar: the  region’s largest  oil and gas producer. Production has “reached levels that have never been seen in the region,” Monaldi said. This is in large part due to  ultra-deep “pre-salt” oil reserves  discovered in 2006 buried under thick layers of ancient salt beneath the ocean.\n \n\n   \n  Crude oil became the country’s top export in 2024 for the first time, overtaking soybeans, and there are hopes production will ramp up much further.\n \n\n   \n  In August, BP  announced  it had made its largest oil and gas discovery  in 25 years  off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Farther south, near Uruguay, oil companies hope the Pelotas Basin could be another new frontier.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the most controversial project is the one at the mouth of the Amazon River — the Foz do Amazonas basin — part of what’s known as the “Equatorial Margin,” a stretch of ocean along the northern coast of Brazil.\n \n\n   \n  In June, Brazil  auctioned off  several offshore oil blocks in the region, 19 of which are in the Amazon Basin, to companies including Chevron, Exxon and Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras.\n \n\n   \n  Petrobras has been trying to drill here for many years. In 2023, Brazil’s environmental agency IBAMA  denied  it an offshore drilling license, citing environmental concerns. But last month,   the agency gave the greenlight for exploratory drilling “after a rigorous environmental licensing process,” according to a  statement  from IBAMA.\n \n\n   \n  The agency’s task was to assess the “technical feasibility” of the project only, not the political or strategic side of oil exploitation, said a spokesperson for Brazil’s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, which oversees IBAMA. Any process involving high-risk areas such as the Foz do Amazonas “must comply with the strictest technical, scientific, and environmental standards,” they added.\n \n\n   \n  The decision “is an achievement of Brazilian society,” said Magda Chambriard, president of Petrobras, in a  statement .\n \n\n   \n  Environmental advocates are strongly opposed, arguing drilling in this ecologically delicate swath of ocean, with its unique reefs and huge stretches of mangrove forests, could bring catastrophic consequences.\n \n\n   \n  Ultra-deep water and strong currents mean any oil spill could quickly be swept across miles of ocean and coastline, and the remoteness of the drilling location from large settlements could delay clean-up operations, said Arayara’s Figueiredo de Oliveira.\n \n\n   \n  Approving drilling here mere weeks before the start of COP30 in the city of Belém — known as the gateway to the Amazon — presents tricky optics for Brazil, which is trying to walk a tightrope between environmental champion and fossil fuel power.\n \n\n   \n  The country’s mighty rivers and abundant rains mean  most of its electricity  comes from clean hydroelectric power. Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has presided over a  sharp decline in deforestation  and an increase in renewables.\n \n\n   \n  But Lula has always been pro-oil, Figueiredo de Oliveira said. He greeted Brazil’s big pre-salt discovery, made during his previous presidential term, with the words, “ God is Brazilian .” A famous photo shows him raising oil-drenched hands at a Petrobras event in 2010.\n \n\n   \n  Lula has firmly rejected claims of hypocrisy. “I don’t want to be an environmental leader. I never claimed to be,” he  said  at a COP30 meeting last week, adding it would be “irresponsible,” to quit oil.\n \n\n   \n  He argues oil wealth can help fund Brazil’s clean energy transition, although some fear the quest to become a major oil power will only delay it. “Every new discovery does set back the effort to move the world off fossil fuels; there’s a loss of momentum,” said Michael Ross, a political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps Lula’s main narrative  is that oil revenues will provide a route to development and a pathway out of poverty, especially for the country’s poorer Amazon states. But Brazil is already a powerhouse “with many other economic opportunities,” Ross told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The argument oil is vital for development may be easier to make in a country like Guyana, where  around 48%  live on less than $5.50 a day, according to the World Bank.\n \n\n   \n  Guyana, which has a similar geology to Brazil’s Equatorial Margin, is experiencing a remarkable oil boom. The 2015 offshore   discovery “represents one of the most transformative milestones” in the country’s modern history, said President Irfaan Ali.\n \n\n   \n  It has transformed the nation of around 820,000 people into the  world’s fastest expanding economy . “We have never seen a country produce so many barrels per capita in the history of (the region)… they belong now in the category of the countries of the Middle East,” Monaldi said.\n \n\n   \n  The government has insisted it can balance oil exploitation with environmental priorities. Guyana is one of the few countries that stores more planet-heating pollution than it produces due to its vast rainforests. It also says that revenues will boost socioeconomic growth.\n \n\n   \n  “We do not see a contradiction between the responsible development of our oil and gas sector and our commitment to protecting the planet’s climate,” Ali told CNN. Both are “integral parts of a single national mission” to cut poverty, boost the economy and protect the environment, he said.\n \n\n   \n  But there are concerns Guyana could fall victim to the “resource curse,” in which huge windfalls can make life worse for those who live there. Venezuela, for example, holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves, and has descended into authoritarianism and economic crisis.\n \n\n   \n  Ali insists the resource curse “is not destiny” and oil wealth will translate into “benefits for every household.” Yet some residents say they face  sky- high living costs  they blame on oil development, and the country’s health outcomes remain below the regional average, according to the World Bank.\n \n\n   \n  South American oil is not just about deep water. Argentina’s huge shale region, Vaca Muerta, often compared to the Permian Basin in Texas, holds the world’s second largest reserves of shale gas and fourth largest of shale oil.\n \n\n   \n  It’s Argentina’s big hope for economic recovery under libertarian President Javier Milei. “Almost everything is about expanding Vaca Muerta,” said Gabriel Blanco, a professor in the Faculty of Engineering at the National University of Central Buenos Aires and former national director of climate change in Argentina.\n \n\n   \n  Oil and gas are a very easy sell domestically, Blanco told CNN. Climate change has “never ever” been on the public or political agenda, he said. Instead, “the narrative says that we are going to be rich and we’re going to develop.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaca Muerta is an attractive proposition for fossil fuel companies. Shale is a very different type of investment than deep-water drilling, Monaldi said. Companies can spend relatively small amounts to see if they can recover their money before putting in more. This encourages investment in Argentina, a country with “high political and regulatory risk,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But environmental experts fear the impacts of this booming shale field. Fossil fuels are extracted by “fracking,” a process that involves drilling into the Earth and injecting fluids at high pressure. “They use a lot of water, they use a lot of sand and chemicals, and so it’s a mess,” Blanco said.\n \n\n   \n  Exactly how South America’s oil future will unfold is not yet clear. New discoveries in Brazil may turn out to be less viable than hoped. For projects already drilling and pumping, reserves often run out earlier than anticipated, UCLA’s Ross said.\n \n\n   \n  Oil demand is also predicted to peak at the start of the next decade, which could mean countries that go hard on fossil fuels will find themselves locked into an unprofitable industry. “These countries are getting to the party right as the bar is closing,” Ross said.\n \n\n   \n  For now, however, demand remains. “While there’s still a gap between current production and demand, there will be investment into new projects,” said Flávio Ferreira Menten, an analyst at the research firm Rystad Energy.\n \n\n   \n  There are geopolitical considerations, too. If US oil production doesn’t keep growing, South America “becomes much more important,” Monaldi said, otherwise the world risks becoming reliant on countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  What’s happening in South America is reflective of something bigger, according to Blanco. The region’s love affair with fossil fuels is part of a global movement, he said: an implicit — and sometimes explicit — consensus that oil exploitation can and should continue for decades to come even in the face of a barreling climate crisis.\n \n\n   \n  “It seems like leaders decided to step strongly on the on the gas pedal and move forward with fossil fuels everywhere,” he said, “no matter what.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/sport/baseball-mlb-guardians-emmanuel-clase-luis-ortiz","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"10:36:00.000-05:00","title":"Feds indict 2 Cleveland Guardians pitchers for alleged sports betting and money laundering scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Federal prosecutors have indicted Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz on multiple charges, including wire fraud, conspiracy to influence sporting contests, and money laundering, alleging they provided insider information about specific pitches to sports bettors, enabling fraudulent bets and generating over $400,000 in gambling profits.

CNN\n \n   \n  Cleveland Guardians’ pitchers  Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz  have been indicted for allegedly taking part in a scheme to rig bets placed on  Major League Baseball  games.\n \n\n   \n  Clase and Ortiz face charges on multiple counts of wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, money laundering conspiracy and more, according to prosecutors.\n \n\n   \n  “Ortiz was arrested earlier today in Boston, Massachusetts, and will make an initial appearance in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts on November 10,” said Joseph Nocella, Jr., United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.\n \n\n   \n  “Clase is currently not in U.S. custody,” Nocella added.\n \n\n   \n  A lawyer for Ortiz maintains his client’s innocence.\n \n\n   \n  “There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning,”   attorney Chris Georgalis told CNN in an email. “Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court.”\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s attorney, Michael J. Ferrara, also told CNN that his client is “innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.”\n \n\n   \n  “Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,” Ferrara added.\n \n\n   \n  Both players were placed on non-disciplinary leave during the 2025 MLB season in relation to a sports betting probe.\n \n\n   \n  “We are aware of the recent law enforcement action,” the Guardians tell CNN. “We will continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.”\n \n\n   \n  Major League Baseball says it has also been cooperating with the DOJ investigation.\n \n\n   \n  “MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the process,” a league spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “We are aware of the indictment and today’s arrest, and our investigation is ongoing.”\n \n\n   \n  The indictment alleges “the defendants agreed in advance with their co-conspirators on specific pitches that they would throw in MLB games. The co-conspirators then used that information to place hundreds of fraudulent bets on those pitches.”\n \n\n   \n  Clase’s involvement in the scheme is alleged to have started in 2023. The three-time All-Star coordinated with corrupt sports bettors to rig proposition bets on particular pitches he would throw, prosecutors say.\n \n\n   \n  The bettors would then wager on the speed and type of Clase’s pitches, based on information they received in advance from Clase, sometimes even during games, per the indictment.\n \n\n   \n  The DOJ says bettors won at least $400,000 using inside information on Clase’s pitches.\n \n\n   \n  Ortiz is accused of joining the enterprise in 2025, working alongside Clase to coordinate with bettors on rigged pitches he would throw.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors allege Ortiz was paid a total of $12,000 to intentionally throw a ball instead of a strike in two MLB games. Clase allegedly received matching payments for his role in helping to arrange Ortiz’s rigged pitches, the feds say, with gamblers winning at least $60,000 in the process.\n \n\n   \n  The indictment, which was filed on Wednesday and unsealed Sunday, comes on the heels of a series of  similar indictments  involving Portland Trail Blazers head coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA journeyman Damon Jones.\n \n\n   \n  The trio was arrested in October in relation to two separate federal gambling investigations, one involving rigged high-stakes poker games and the other involving insider trading in sports betting.\n \n\n   \n  Both the MLB and NBA cases are being handled by Nocella’s Brooklyn office.\n \n\n   \n  If convicted of all charges, Clase and Ortiz could potentially face decades behind bars.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Amanda Musa contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/democratic-unity-fractures-government-reopen","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"02:05:00-05:00","title":"Democratic unity fractures, paving the way for the government to reopen","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After 40 days of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, a compromise deal was reached in the Senate, allowing the government to reopen with funding through January 30, pay for furloughed workers, and extend food stamps through 2026.

to reopen \n       \n  Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:05 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Enough Democrats caved.\n \n\n   \n  A Sunday night Senate deal may be on the verge of resolving the longest government shutdown on record — after a group of moderate Democrats dropped their key demand — a guaranteed extension of Obamacare subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement opened the way for a Senate vote in which eight Democratic defectors  voted to break the filibuster  and to clear the first hurdle to reopening the government after nearly six weeks. Their move will offer relief to millions of Americans whose lives have been severely disrupted by the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But the compromise was opposed by some key party leaders and is already igniting a firestorm of protests from progressives who accuse their more moderate colleagues of disastrously backing down, handing President Donald Trump a victory and turning their backs on millions of Americans who can’t afford  spiking health care premiums .  \n \n\n   \n  “I will not support a deal that does nothing to make health care more affordable,” Democratic Sen Elizabeth Warren, a leading progressive, wrote on X. “We are in a health care emergency. … A vote for this bill is a mistake.”\n \n\n   \n  It might be crass to parse the human misery caused by the shutdown for a partisan win after a political duel that deprived millions of Americans of  food benefits , left federal workers with $0 paychecks, and created chaos and safety fears in  commercial aviation .\n \n\n   \n  But the crisis — precipitated by the expiration of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans,  whose prices are skyrocketing  — was fought for multilayered political reasons. It will influence judgments on Trump’s second presidency and the Republican majorities in Congress and help define the trajectory of the Democratic Party’s comeback bid ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  The deal sets a date for a vote in the Senate on ACA subsidies in December, but falls well short of cementing their extension. It funds the government through January 30 and guarantees pay for federal workers furloughed during the shutdown and those who worked without pay. It also reverses Trump’s firing of federal employees throughout the impasse and funds  food stamps  through 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Once the package works through procedural steps in the Senate, the Republican-led House must be recalled to vote on the measure.\n \n\n   \n    A ‘political disaster’\n \n\n   \n  The headline here is that sufficient numbers of Democrats are folding without achieving the goal that led them to withhold votes from a government funding bill and halt federal operations at the beginning of October.\n \n\n   \n  On the face of it, this looks like a massive failure. Democrats won no undertaking that Obamacare subsidies will be extended — despite insisting that such a move was their bottom line. The best they will get is a Senate vote. There is no guarantee that a bill extending subsidies will pass, considering the Senate’s GOP majority. And the prospects of the Republican House endorsing it seem even more remote.\n \n\n   \n  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive leader who sits as an independent but votes with Democrats, said the compromise risked “a policy and political disaster.” He added before the Senate vote: “My own thought is that it would be a horrific mistake to cave in to Trump right now.”\n \n\n   \n  Many leading Democrats  argued their party’s big wins  in elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City last week were attributable to the effective way their candidates lacerated Trump over  the cost of living .\n \n\n   \n  Now, at the first chance they got to put that lesson into practice — fighting for the affordability of health care — they gave up, even though polls showed most  voters blame Trump  for the shutdown and agree with the Democratic position.\n \n\n   \n  The blowback could be severe, exposing deep divisions in the party that may show the “big tent” that leaders kept citing in the aftermath of last week’s election victories may be more viable in theory than in practice.\n \n\n   \n  There were many unhappy Democrats inside and outside the Senate. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego warned he would not turn his back on Americans seeing their premiums sharply rise as he voted no on the resolution. “At a time when prices are already too high, Americans are shopping for health insurance and experiencing such sticker shock that they are being forced to sign up for a crappy, overpriced plan or not signing up for insurance at all,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The leader of the Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer, did not vote for the deal. But Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the party’s No. 2 leader in the chamber, who is retiring next year and is therefore shielded from a left-wing backlash, supported it.\n \n\n   \n  Another Democrat who voted for the deal, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, represents thousands of federal workers and welcomed the move to reverse firings during the shutdown. He also argued that the Senate vote on extending the enhanced subsidies would put the GOP on the spot. “Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said.\n \n\n   \n    A more pragmatic view of the Democratic concessions\n \n\n   \n  Still, assessments of the break in the deadlock that came on Day 40 of the shutdown must also factor in whether the Democrats’ demand was achievable in the first place and whether the deepening pain of the shutdown, which is fast becoming a national crisis, was about to make their position unsustainable.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat who opposed the shutdown all along, warned his party might overplay its hand by carrying on. “I don’t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,” Fetterman told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic leaders, dealing with intense fury over Trump’s bulldozing presidency among their base, and disillusionment over the party’s disastrous 2024 election loss, had no real political option but to fight — even if it was obvious that securing an extension to Obamacare subsidies might be unattainable.\n \n\n   \n  The party may accrue some political benefits for forcing Trump into the longest-ever shutdown. Multiple polls showed more Americans blamed him and his party at a time when his  approval ratings  are dipping into the kind of steep slump second-term presidents struggle to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout the shutdown, Trump, a billionaire surrounded by a Cabinet of millionaires and billionaires, seemed indifferent to the daily struggles of millions of Americans. It was easy for Democrats to portray him as cruel as his administration fought court orders to restore funding to food assistance for 42 million Americans. While Trump is pledging to talk more about affordability, that is an impression that might stick.\n \n\n   \n  And there is an unpalatable truth that some progressives prefer not to contemplate. Democrats have almost no power in Washington. They’ve used their only leverage — the capacity to withhold their votes in the Senate, where 60 votes are required for most legislation — to frustrate a president who gets almost no pushback. That’s not nothing.\n \n\n   \n  Trump seemed quite willing to allow the pain and anxiety of the shutdown to deepen for millions of Americans. He was implicitly daring Democrats to pick the suffering of one set of millions of Americans over the duress being experienced by millions more. With the president refusing to negotiate, it was incumbent on Democrats to consider whether the cost of carrying on was justified.\n \n\n   \n  Progressives are already dismayed about what many will see as a humiliating climbdown by Senate moderates. But another lesson from Democratic wins in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races last week was that moderate candidates racked up big victory margins. A pragmatic view of the shutdown as it stood on Sunday was that as the fast-worsening consequences became clear — with Thanksgiving travel chaos looming — Democrats may have risked losing their incremental political gains if public opinion swung against them as well as the GOP.\n \n\n   \n  In that sense, the classic building of pressure that historically ends up forcing the reopening of the government — namely that political damage caused by carrying on is outweighed by the advantage of staying shut down — did its work again, albeit belatedly.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, it’s become clear as we go deeper into the second month of this Republican government shutdown that President Trump and Washington Republicans are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt,” Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said in a statement after voting to support the compromise deal.\n \n\n   \n  But whatever the recriminations, there’s no doubt Democrats succeeded in highlighting a core issue — the exploding cost of health care — which the GOP seems to have no viable plan to tackle.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown has not changed this issue: The health care system is broken, people may lose insurance, and Republicans may end up with the blame if they don’t fix it, since they are the party in power.\n \n\n   \n    Trump didn’t cave, but he may have badly damaged his brand anyway\n \n\n   \n  Given the exhausting pace of the Trump presidency, and the multiple controversies unfolding at once under the chaos agent in the White House, it seems unlikely a shutdown now will play a major role in influencing the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Trump may have gotten what he wanted.\n \n\n   \n  Throughout his presidency, business career and life, Trump has always tried to impose personal leverage. His self-image as a winner who doesn’t give into pressure will exit the shutdown intact. Trump was determined not bend to Democrats employing the kind of hardline tactics he so often uses himself. And he didn’t. The president warned that he wouldn’t negotiate on health care with the government closed. And he held firm.\n \n\n   \n  But the political cost wrought by his actions over the last 40 days could be considerable. He often looked callous, as though unconcerned about the real pain inflicted by the shutdown. After all, he went to the Supreme Court to try to overturn a court order requiring him to pay food stamp benefits. And when the deal was struck in the Senate on Sunday night, he was absent — after attending a Washington Commanders NFL game and spending the weekend at his luxury resort in Florida, reinforcing an impression he doesn’t care about the economic concerns of regular Americans.\n \n\n   \n  And Republicans are still not off the hook on the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. GOP leaders now face the question of whether they are willing to let them expire, in a scenario that could put health care out of reach for millions of people. This seems an unsustainable political position in the run-up to midterm elections, and the issue is set to only gain in traction as the end of the year looms.\n \n\n   \n  And bitter divisions in the GOP — most graphically exemplified during the shutdown by  Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene , with her scathing criticism of her party’s dearth of ideas on health care — are likely to burst open when the House returns from its weekslong absence, and will again test the authority of Speaker Mike Johnson.\n \n\n   \n  The shutdown drama also revealed rare signs that Trump’s authority over his own party isn’t absolute on Capitol Hill. Republican senators ignored his demands to  abolish the filibuster  that requires most bills to get 60 votes in the chamber. Such a move would have given Trump almost unlimited power to use GOP majorities to transform the nation over the next year.\n \n\n   \n  But GOP senators feared what any Democratic majority might do in the absence of the filibuster. Their position was a nod to a future in which Trump is not the dominant GOP figure, underscoring that lame-duck status may beckon even for a president who has shattered almost every convention of his office.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/us/coal-mine-flood-accident-west-virginia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:28:00Z","title":"Flood Traps Miner in West Virginia Coal Mine","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A sudden flood at the Rolling Thunder coal mine in West Virginia, near Drennen, trapped a miner after an old mine wall was compromised.

centrist Democrats strike major deal to end shutdown \n       \n  By Manu Raju, Ted  Barrett, Alison Main, Sarah Ferris, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:57 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A critical bloc of eight Senate Democratic centrists on Sunday helped advance a funding deal to reopen the government in exchange for a future vote on extending  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies , putting Congress on a path to end the  longest shutdown in US history  within days.\n \n\n   \n  That deal would include a new stopgap measure to extend government funding until January and be tied to a larger package to fully fund several key agencies. It includes no guarantee from Republicans to extend the health care subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  What Democrats did secure is a future vote on the matter. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the chamber floor Sunday that he will hold a vote on a measure to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits by the middle of next month. Democrats involved in the talks believe that will give enough time for House and Senate GOP leaders to negotiate a true compromise in the coming weeks, though it would be a major lift to get through a Republican-controlled Congress.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the outrage from the rest of the Senate Democratic Caucus, GOP leaders are determined to move the funding measure quickly through Congress and to President Donald Trump’s desk in the coming days. Once Trump has signed it into law, it’s still not clear how quickly agencies can restore services for the tens of millions of Americans  facing shutdown pain , from the loss of federal food aid to child care closures to delayed paychecks. Senate GOP leaders have not yet scheduled a final passage vote.\n \n\n   \n  “I am optimistic that after almost six weeks of this shutdown, we’ll finally be able to end it,” Thune declared from the Senate floor on Day 40 of the funding lapse.\n \n\n   \n  An exasperated Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado voted no on the deal but argued that his colleagues who supported it did not “cave” and instead were doing “what they feel is helping the most number of people.”\n \n\n   \n  “There’s no good solution,” Hickenlooper said, adding that some of his colleagues believe Trump will “stop at nothing to prevent that subsidy from being restored.” He added: “I voted no just because … piss off, I’m just frustrated. We tried it and now we’re going to use every other tool. We’re not going to quit.”\n \n\n   \n  Once the Senate has given final approval to the funding measure, it heads to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson must muscle the deal through a fractious GOP conference — likely with help from Trump himself. It’s not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson with that job.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government say Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending the Obamacare subsidies forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  They believe that Democrats have an upper hand on the issue of health care and that a separate health care vote will spotlight the differences between the two parties, even though it has little chance of becoming law. And they’re not ruling out another shutdown showdown in January, when the next tranche of funding expires (though critical programs such as food aid and WIC will already be funded, to lessen the pain for millions of Americans).\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a retiring Democrat from New Hampshire, said Republicans made clear repeatedly over recent months that “this was the only deal on the table.”\n \n\n   \n  “Now I understand that not all of my Democratic colleagues are satisfied with this agreement, but waiting another week or another month wouldn’t deliver a better outcome.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether Democrats would willing to vote down the next funding measure on January 30 if Congress fails to deliver a health care fix by then, Shaheen said: “That’s certainly an option that everybody will consider.”\n \n\n   \n  The deal, which has been in the works for the last five weeks, came together between three former governors — Shaheen of New Hampshire, Angus King of Maine and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire — along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House. Details of the deal were first reported by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  One of those Democrats involved is Sen. Tim Kaine, who represents thousands of federal workers in Virginia and who said he supports the GOP’s promise for a future vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  “Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don’t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,” Kaine said of GOP senators who choose not to support extending the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  And importantly for Kaine, Democrats also secured an agreement from the White House to reverse its mass firings of federal workers during the shutdown, as well as protections against them happening the rest of this fiscal year. It also guarantees all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  But inside the Democratic Party, the funding deal has exposed a deep divide. Liberal senators were fuming at their colleagues for backing the deal, with House Democratic leaders vowing to “fight” the deal in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Democratic leadership was split on the vote, with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opposing the deal while his No. 2, retiring Sen. Dick Durbin, supported it.\n \n\n   \n  But some liberal senators have fiercely opposed the plan, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s no deal without health care,” Blumenthal said, voicing a widespread sentiment in the Democratic caucus. “So far as I’m concerned, health care isn’t included, and so I’ll be a no.”\n \n\n   \n  Even some centrist-leaning Democrats, like Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, voiced concerns with the idea on Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  “I was involved for many weeks, and then over the last couple of weeks, it changed — last week it changed,” Slotkin said, noting that she was no longer involved in talks in recent days. “But I always said, like, it’s got to do something concrete on health care, and it’s hard to see how that happened.”\n \n\n   \n  Across the Capitol, House Democratic leaders sharply condemned the deal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his caucus “will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” adding: “We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives.”\n \n\n   \n  One member, Rep. Ro Khanna of California,  took to X  on Sunday night calling for Schumer to be replaced. “Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced. If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?” Khanna wrote.\n \n\n   \n  House Democrats plan to have their own caucus huddle on Monday, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture. That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The next step after Sunday night’s vote is a vote on the full measure, which includes the larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Senate would first vote to take up the House-passed stopgap measure, which means eight Democrats would need to support it for it to advance. Then, the Senate would amend that bill with the larger funding package negotiated between the two parties.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who has voted on the GOP funding plan throughout the shutdown and criticized his own party’s stance, said Sunday that it is time to ”take the win.”\n \n\n   \n  Vote yes, he said, “and then we can find a way to lower our costs about health care.”\n \n\n   \n   This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/sport/football-nfl-former-commissioner-paul-tagliabue-dead","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"10:02:00-05:00","title":"Longtime NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue dies at 84","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Paul Tagliabue, the former NFL commissioner who led the league from 1989 to 2006, has died at 84 from heart failure.

Under him, there were no labor stoppages.\n \n\n   \n  During his time, Los Angeles lost two teams and Cleveland another, migrating to Baltimore before being replaced by an expansion franchise.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue implemented a policy on substance abuse that was considered the strongest in all major sports. He also established the “Rooney Rule,” in which all teams with coaching vacancies must interview minority candidates. It has since been expanded to include front-office and league executive positions.\n \n\n   \n  When he took office in 1989, the NFL had just gotten its first Black head coach of the modern era. By the time Tagliabue stepped down in 2006, there were seven minority head coaches in the league.\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue certainly had his detractors, notably over concussions. The issue has plagued the NFL for decades, though team owners had a major role in the lack of progress in dealing with head trauma.\n \n\n   \n  In 2017, Tagliabue apologized for remarks he made decades ago about concussions in football, acknowledging he didn’t have the proper data at the time in 1994. He called concussions “one of those pack-journalism issues” and contended the number of concussions “is relatively small; the problem is the journalist issue.”\n \n\n   \n  “Obviously,” he said on Talk of Fame Network, “I do regret those remarks. Looking back, it was not sensible language to use to express my thoughts at the time. My language was intemperate, and it led to serious misunderstanding. I overreacted on issues which we were already working on. But that doesn’t excuse the overreaction and intemperate language.\n \n\n   \n  “Bottom line, it sounded like I was shooting the messenger, which was the concussion issue. My intention at the time was to make a point which could have been made fairly simply: that there was a need for better data. There was a need for more reliable information about concussions and uniformity in terms of how they were being defined in terms of severity.”\n \n\n   \n  Tagliabue is survived by his wife Chandler, son Drew, and daughter Emily.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/usda-pauses-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"20:07:00-04:00","title":"USDA Orders States to Stop Issuing Full SNAP Benefits and to 'Undo' Benefits Sent for November","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ordered states to cease issuing full SNAP benefits for November and to reverse any prior full benefit payments, citing a Supreme Court directive that paused a lower court order requiring full payment.

states to stop issuing full SNAP benefits and to ‘undo’ benefits sent for November \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Aileen Graef, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:07 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US Department of Agriculture ordered states to stop issuing full food stamp benefits for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments, after a Supreme Court justice on Friday paused a lower court order requiring the agency to pay Americans their full assistance.\n \n\n   \n  In the  Saturday directive , obtained by CNN, the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits — which will provide 65% of the maximum allotments for November — as ordered by the same lower court judge earlier in the week. (Many recipients will receive  less than 65% of their usual assistance  because of the way food stamp benefits are calculated.)\n \n\n   \n  “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”\n \n\n   \n  States that fail to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over issuances of benefits, the memo said.\n \n\n   \n  This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who depend on the nation’s larger anti-hunger program. Over the past week, the USDA has issued guidance multiple times as lawsuits over the agency’s decision not to tap into a contingency fund to pay November benefits have worked their way through federal courts.\n \n\n   \n  The latest guidance follows   a memorandum  from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal lower court order, and that the process should be completed later that day.\n \n\n   \n  Several states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday that residents who should have already gotten their SNAP benefits this month will start getting their full payments on Friday. The next day, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that residents who received their benefits are able to spend them, but the state has paused issuing full allocations to additional people.\n \n\n   \n  Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that there’s “no clarity at all” in the guidance and that the administration is causing “intentional chaos.”\n \n\n   \n  “Once we decided to step up and say we are going to make sure that our people are going to be OK … we’ve now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money,” Moore said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n \n\n   \n    Legal battles\n \n\n   \n  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover  full food stamp benefits , siding with the administration on a short-term basis in a legal fight that has quickly become a defining confrontation of the  government shutdown .\n \n\n   \n  The ruling meant the USDA does not have to immediately honor a lower court order that required it to transfer $4 billion to the key food assistance program.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s ruling followed one a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island that directed the agency to make the full payments, reversing his own order from earlier in the month requiring the USDA to tap into its $5.3 billion contingency fund to pay at least partial benefits for the month.\n \n\n   \n  His more expansive ruling mandated the agency shift tariff revenue meant for child nutrition programs to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling in recent weeks that the agency must at least pay partial benefits or, at its discretion, provide recipients with their full allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to provide partial payments — first saying states could issue 50% of the maximum benefit and then revising the figure to 65%. But the USDA warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell last week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n    Providing full benefits\n \n\n   \n  Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to the Department of Justice’s filing to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million.\n \n\n   \n  Responding to the USDA’s demand that states should undo any steps taken to issue full benefits, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said on Sunday, “No.”\n \n\n   \n  The state loaded November benefits onto the cards of nearly 700,000 residents on Friday prior to the Supreme Court’s pause, he said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “We are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump Administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, the filing said.\n \n\n   \n  These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, according to the DOJ. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “In accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.”\n \n\n   \n  North Carolina, which issued partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday, said it was pausing the issuance of full benefits in light of the Supreme Court decision. It had hoped to issue them over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  “The hard-working people and families who rely on SNAP benefits deserve certainty, not confusion about whether they’ll be able to put meals on the table this weekend and the rest of the month,” North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement Saturday. “I am urging for a swift resolution by the courts and some humanity from the Trump administration so North Carolina families can receive the support they need.”\n \n\n   \n  In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said that residents should continue spending the benefits on their EBT cards, noting the state funded them in accordance with USDA’s Friday guidance before the Supreme Court’s pause.\n \n\n   \n  “If President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court,” Healey said in a statement Sunday, adding that state officials will continue to work to “make sure everyone gets the full benefits they are owed.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN is reaching out to other states to ask the status of their SNAP programs.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/health/byheart-infant-formula-outbreak-positive-bacteria","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:15:00-05:00","title":"Preliminary Tests Find Germ That Causes Botulism in ByHeart Baby Formula","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Preliminary tests conducted by California health officials have found bacteria associated with botulism toxin in a sample of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, prompting a recall of two lots.

All were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n\n   \n  The cases occurred in Arizona, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials agreed to recall two lots of the company’s Whole Nutrition Infant Formula, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The formula has a best-by date of December 2026.\n \n\n   \n  California health officials tested a can of the powdered formula that was fed to a baby who fell ill. The results “suggest the presence” of the type of bacteria that produces the botulism toxin confirmed in other cases. It can take several days to confirm the results.\n \n\n   \n  ByHeart officials said that “more testing is needed” to know whether the type of bacteria that causes botulism is present. It comes from a large family of bacteria, many of which are found naturally in the environment and don’t cause illness, the company said.\n \n\n   \n  “We take this very seriously,” it said in a statement Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The FDA is investigating reports of 83 cases of infant botulism reported since August including the cases linked to Byheart baby formula.\n \n\n   \n    Causes of infant botulism\n \n\n   \n  Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacteria that produces toxins in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.\n \n\n   \n  Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable and can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.\n \n\n   \n  Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel “floppy” and can have problems swallowing or breathing.\n \n\n   \n  No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.\n \n\n   \n  “This would be extremely rare,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Infant botulism treatment\n \n\n   \n  The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.\n \n\n   \n  All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said.\n \n\n   \n    Potential impact on U.S. formula supplies\n \n\n   \n  There is no danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  That’s different that the crisis caused when formula produced by Abbott was linked to infant deaths and illnesses in 2022.\n \n\n   \n  That product was contaminated with a different germ that can cause severe illness and death in babies. Because Abbott is one of the top manufacturers of infant formula in the U.S., the closure of its manufacturing plant in Michigan triggered massive shortages of formula across the U.S.\n \n\n   \n  In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company’s packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing “areas that still require corrective actions.”\n \n\n   \n    Reviewing infant formula ingredients\n \n\n   \n  Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul  the U.S. food supply  and are taking a new look at  infant formula .\n \n\n   \n  Health Secretary Robert F.

Press, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:49 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  Lenny Wilkens, a three-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame who was enshrined as both a player and a coach, has died, his family said Sunday. He was 88.\n \n\n   \n  The family said Wilkens was surrounded by loved ones when he died and did not immediately release a cause of death.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was one of the finest point guards of his era who later brought his calm and savvy style to the sideline, first as a player-coach and then evolving into one of the game’s great coaches.\n \n\n   \n  He coached 2,487 games in the NBA, which is still a record. He became a Hall of Famer as a player, as a coach and again as part of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team — on which he was an assistant. Wilkens coached the Americans to gold at the Atlanta Games as well in 1996.\n \n\n   \n  “Lenny Wilkens represented the very best of the NBA — as a Hall of Fame player, Hall of Fame coach, and one of the game’s most respected ambassadors,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Sunday. “So much so that, four years ago, Lenny received the unique distinction of being named one of the league’s 75 greatest players and 15 greatest coaches of all time.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens was a nine-time All-Star as a player, was the first person to reach 1,000 wins as an NBA coach and was the second person inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and coach. He coached the Seattle SuperSonics to the NBA title in 1979 and remained iconic in that city for the rest of his life, often being considered a godfather of sorts for basketball in Seattle — which lost the Sonics to Oklahoma City in 2008 and has been trying to get a team back since.\n \n\n   \n  And he did it all with grace, something he was proud of.\n \n\n   \n  “Leaders don’t yell and scream,” Wilkens told Seattle’s KOMO News earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens, the 1994 NBA coach of the year with Atlanta, retired with 1,332 coaching wins — a league record that was later passed by Don Nelson (who retired with 1,335) and then Gregg Popovich (who retired with 1,390).\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens played 15 seasons with the St. Louis Hawks, SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers and Portland Trail Blazers. He was an All-Star five times with St. Louis, three times in Seattle and once with Cleveland in 1973 at age 35. A statue depicting his time with the SuperSonics was installed outside  Climate Pledge Arena  in June.\n \n\n   \n  “Even more impressive than Lenny’s basketball accomplishments, which included two Olympic gold medals and an NBA championship, was his commitment to service — especially in his beloved community of Seattle where a statue stands in his honor,” Silver said. “He influenced the lives of countless young people as well as generations of players and coaches who considered Lenny not only a great teammate or coach but also an extraordinary mentor who led with integrity and true class.”\n \n\n   \n  Wilkens twice led the league in assists but was also a prominent scorer. He averaged in double figures scoring in every season of his career, except his final one in 1974-75 with the Trail Blazers. His best season as a scorer came in his first season with the SuperSonics in 1968-69 when he averaged 22.4 points, 8.2 assists and 6.2 rebounds.\n \n\n   \n  Leonard Wilkens was born on Oct. 28, 1937, in New York. His basketball schooling came on Brooklyn’s playgrounds and at a city powerhouse, then Boys High School, where one of his teammates was major league baseball star Tommy Davis. He would go on to star at Providence and was drafted by the Hawks as the sixth overall pick in 1960.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/media/resign-bbc-trump-speech-edit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"18:07:00Z","title":"BBC Leadership Resigns Amid Political Firestorm Over Trump Documentary Edit","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The resignations of BBC Director General Tim Davie and BBC News Chief Deborah Turness in November 2025 are the result of a politically charged and 'febrile' environment, driven by a misleading edit in a 2024 documentary about President Donald Trump’s January 6 speech.

contributed to BBC resignations \n       \n  Analysis By Brian Stelter, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:07 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  One word in  outgoing BBC boss  Tim Davie’s statement explains not just his resignation, but the political reality for media leaders in 2025: “Febrile.”\n \n\n   \n  To save you from Googling, Dictionary.com defines “febrile” as “a more formal way of saying feverish — having a fever.”\n \n\n   \n  Arguments over the BBC in recent days have certainly been fevered, but then again, those arguments are never-ending, owing to the broadcaster’s immense power and unique place in British public life.\n \n\n   \n  As a result, the job of BBC director general — though certainly prestigious —is also relentless and thankless. The current controversy over a misleading edit to a 2024 documentary about President Donald Trump illustrates the dynamic perfectly.\n \n\n   \n  In a vacuum, the more-than-a-year-old misstep by unnamed producers would not cause the very top heads of the organization to roll.\n \n\n   \n  But Britain’s right-wing press has been “feasting like vultures” over the bad edit, as a source at the BBC put it on condition of anonymity. And the corporation’s response to the row was feeble at best, enabling conservative critics to advance their long-running campaign against the broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  Trump celebrated the BBC shakeup on Sunday, but the political pressure over the documentary was just one of many factors at play.\n \n\n   \n  But in a politically poisonous atmosphere with near-daily disputes over coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza; the equally frequent attacks from the BBC’s rivals; and a looming review of the BBC’s license-fee model; it’s easy to understand why Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness both tendered their resignations. A sigh of relief was almost audible in their respective memos.\n \n\n   \n  “Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,” Davie wrote. Turness similarly wrote that “mistakes have been made.”\n \n\n   \n  BBC Radio 4 host and former BBC News political editor Nick Robinson spoke for many both inside and outside the organization when he said, one day before the resignations, “It’s clear that there is a genuine concern about editorial standards and mistakes. There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organization.” Robinson’s point: “Both things are happening at the same time.”\n \n\n   \n  This all contributes to the fever that Davie referenced on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  He said the BBC board had unanimously supported him throughout his “entire tenure, including during recent days,” indicating he was not forced out. And he said “the current debate around BBC News” was just one factor in his departure.\n \n\n   \n  Another factor: The government is currently reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, which is the contract that determines how the BBC is funded and run. The current charter, which expires at the end of 2027, has a license-fee system in which British households pay £174.50 ($230) a year for BBC shows and services. This license fee structure has supported a diverse array of programming for decades, but has also opened up the BBC to all sorts of criticism.\n \n\n   \n  Some conservative leaders have argued that the license fee system is anachronistic in the age of Netflix and Spotify. They have also lobbed countless complaints about perceived political bias.\n \n\n   \n  Davie said, “I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.”\n \n\n   \n    BBC faces politically charged media climate\n \n\n   \n  When Davie took charge in 2020, he said his No. 1 priority was “to renew our commitment to impartiality.”\n \n\n   \n  Most of the battles over the BBC relate back to that commitment in one way or another.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, for instance, the BBC removed “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone” from its streaming service amid intense scrutiny of the documentary. The narrator was the son of a Hamas official, a conflict that breached the BBC’s editorial guidelines. Davie issued an apology after a review of the matter.\n \n\n   \n  BBC officials have highlighted and defended the news organization’s exhaustive reporting about the war. Similarly, they have urged people to take stock of the BBC’s coverage in totality — from groundbreaking exposes about the civil war   in Sudan   to thoughtful pieces about Trump’s second term in office.\n \n\n   \n  But all of that risks getting flattened when a partisan media firestorm erupts.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC is “blatant propaganda” and “total, 100% fake news,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Saturday in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper, fanning the proverbial flames against Davie and Turness.\n \n\n   \n  The trigger was a misleading edit in “Trump: A Second Chance?” In the documentary, portions of Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech to supporters at the Ellipse were stitched together to make it sound like he had said he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” It was edited together to sound like one threatening sentence.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tone was certainly combative that day, but in the actual speech, his exhortations to “fight” were separate from his suggestion about walking to the Capitol to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  The edit apparently escaped scrutiny when the documentary aired on “Panorama,” the BBC’s flagship current affairs program, shortly before the 2024 US presidential election. But it was subsequently described in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former editorial adviser to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee.\n \n\n   \n    Trump celebrates Davie’s exit\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph, which has published anti-BBC commentary for years, reported on the existence of the memo on November 3, triggering days of controversy in the United Kingdom.\n \n\n   \n  The Telegraph published daily follow-ups about the “growing crisis at the corporation,” and amplified many critics, including by interviewing Leavitt. Meanwhile, the producers of the documentary, which was made by an outside production company, remained silent.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his aides treated Sunday’s resignations like personal victories. The president wrote on Truth Social that the BBC executives were “caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no evidence that either executive was involved in the nitty gritty of the documentary.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also wrote “thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.”\n \n\n   \n  There is no indication that the edit was politically motivated. Furthermore, the documentary’s primary audience was in the UK, not the US.\n \n\n   \n  Leavitt used the occasion to promote a right-wing upstart channel, GB News, that is sometimes described as the Fox News of the UK.\n \n\n   \n  To borrow Davie’s word, it is a “febrile” media environment, indeed.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/trump-pay-americans-directly-healthcare","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s Proposal to Pay Americans Directly for Health Care Costs","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has proposed redirecting ACA tax credits—currently paid to insurance companies—directly to individuals so they can use the funds to purchase their own health care.

Lindsey Graham called the ACA “the biggest scam on the planet,” touting Trump’s proposition to put money in the pockets of Americans to purchase their own insurance plans.\n \n\n   \n  The South Carolina Republican predicted a weekend “breakthrough” in funding talks on Capitol Hill, where negotiators so far have not presented a compromise deal that includes an ACA solution that would win over enough Democrats to back a short-term bill to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’ll have a breakthrough today. Then we’ll talk about how to change Obamacare to give the money to the people rather than insurance companies,” he told “Fox Sunday Futures.”\n \n\n   \n  Democrats so far have shown no appetite to seriously consider Trump’s proposal.\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries quickly dismissed the idea in an interview on Sunday as he slammed the GOP’s openness to negotiate a real fix to the health care system.\n \n\n   \n  “Of course, there’s always opportunity to improve current policy that exists, but Republicans aren’t operating in good faith as it relates to doing anything to actually make health care more affordable,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a key progressive voice who’s been urging her Democratic colleagues to hold firm in their health care fight, warned that Trump’s proposal could be “just a Republican bait-and-switch to repeal Obamacare for the 70th time.”\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has indicated that his conference is working on a health care plan to address their concerns about the existing system under Obamacare, though GOP leaders have not divulged any details.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/us/ice-immigration-federal-agencies-trump","dateOfPublication":"2023-10-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Community Engagement and Cultural Preservation: Building Bridges Through Tradition","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article explores the increasing significance of community engagement and cultural preservation in today's rapidly changing world.

Other personnel are troops with the National Guard, the  reserve arm  of the Army and Air Force.\n \n\n   \n  Here is a look at the agencies involved and how their complicated and often overlapping duties have evolved under the current administration’s deportation policy.\n \n\n   \n    Customs and Border Protection\n \n\n   \n  In its  own words , US Customs and Border Protection “is one of the world’s largest law enforcement organizations and is charged with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. while facilitating lawful international travel and trade.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency started as the Customs Administration in 1789 to collect tariffs, the federal government’s primary source of revenue at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Back then, the United States was effectively an “open borders” country until the passage of a  law  in 1875 blocking the immigration of most Chinese women on the premise of curbing prostitution and human trafficking.\n \n\n   \n  Full federal border inspections under a new agency  began  in 1891, which later became the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n \n\n   \n  The functions of enforcing immigration law and collecting tariffs and customs duties stayed separate until shortly after the   September 11 terror attacks , when a push to consolidate more agencies under the new Department of Homeland Security  created  Customs and Border Protection in 2003.\n \n\n   \n  “The intent was to create a single focused agency responsible for issues at the border,” Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now at the Migration Policy Institute, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The sizeable agency has more than  60,000 employees , including about 20,000 Border Patrol agents, all tasked with one mission: “Protect the American people, safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation’s economic prosperity.”\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  Two decades later, the Border Patrol division of CBP has taken on an increasingly significant role in high-profile immigration actions under Trump, with sector chief  Gregory Bovino  emerging as the  on-the-ground face  of “Operation Midway Blitz.” The initiative targets “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,”  DHS says .\n \n\n   \n  Armed agents, who once apprehended migrants across the US’s borders and stopped drug and human trafficking operations, now stand sentinel over federal immigration facilities that are the sites of immigration protests.\n \n\n   \n  “These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so,” former CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske  testified  in a  lawsuit  filed by journalists. The lawsuit stemmed from what they called “overwhelming and illegal violence” against protesters in Los Angeles this summer, a response that was also helmed by Bovino.\n \n\n   \n  Tensions from the summer’s violent clashes between immigration officers and demonstrators continued to boil over this fall in America’s largest cities.\n \n\n   \n   Jason Houser , a former DHS official, said the current administration is putting Border Patrol agents in security and crowd control situations they’re not equipped to handle.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re trained for border interdiction, terrorist threats, drug interdictions on swift boats,” Houser said. “Those tactics aren’t for de-escalation of a protest or riots. That’s not their core training.”\n \n\n   \n  In Chicago, the indelible image of a  pastor in a clerical collar  shot in the head with a pepper ball by agents standing on the rooftop of an ICE building is a direct violation of CBP’s use of force  policy .\n \n\n   \n  Officers using pepper balls “shall not intentionally target the head, neck, spine, or groin of the intended subject, unless the use of deadly force is reasonable,” ﻿the  policy  states.\n \n\n   \n  But Bovino, who has said agents have acted proportionally and in response to attacks from demonstrators, expressed ambivalence about protesters being injured – also a direct violation of CBP’s use of force  policy. \n \n\n   \n  “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that’s on them,” Bovino  told CBS News  in October. “Don’t protest and don’t trespass.”\n \n\n   \n  Like many law enforcement agencies since 9/11, the CBP has substantially beefed up its equipment with military-style weaponry and aircraft, including a  fleet  of Black Hawk helicopters and Predator drones.\n \n\n   \n  The equipment was put to use in an  overnight raid  in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood, when agents clad in tactical gear  rappelled  from a Black Hawk helicopter and burst through the windows of an apartment building to pull families from their homes.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve been on military bases for a good portion of my life, and the activity I saw – it was an invasion,”  said  neighbor Darrell Ballard.\n \n\n   \n  The show of force in Operation Midway Blitz even included sending  speedboats  – the kind   typically seen on the waterways along the nation’s borders – to patrol the Chicago River, in the shadow of the Windy City’s Trump International Hotel and Tower.\n \n\n   \n  The boats “are from Detroit. Those are interdiction patrol boats that patrol up and down the border between Canada and Michigan,” said Houser, who worries their presence in Chicago leaves the northern border vulnerable.\n \n\n   \n  “If they’re not there in Michigan, does that mean those smuggling lines are open that day, but they were out going up and down (the Chicago River) like it was St. Patrick’s Day?”\n \n\n   \n  CBP has not said if the Border Patrol assets used on the Chicago River impacted operations along the Canadian border and did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  While a city that is more than 400 miles from the nearest international border crossing may seem like an unusual choice for intense stops and searches, there is a legal loophole.\n \n\n   \n  The CBP can legally conduct warrantless searches of vehicles and property believed to be involved in immigration violations anywhere within 100 miles of the US border or coastline. The agency also  includes  the entire coastline of Lake Michigan, which lies fully within the United States, as the “functional equivalent” of an international border.\n \n\n   \n  Under CBP policy, Chicago is as much of a border town as El Paso, Texas.\n \n\n   \n  “Border enforcement does need to be as modern as possible and as updated as possible in terms of technology,” Meissner said. “But it should be taking place at the border because that’s the crossing point.”\n \n\n   \n    Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n \n\n   \n  Like its cousin CBP, ICE started as part of the new Department of Homeland Security in 2003. But in addition to having a catchier name, ICE had a different mission – focus on the nation’s interior to catch and deport undocumented immigrants, along with investigating “narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, gang violence, money laundering and other financial crimes,” the agency’s website  says .\n \n\n   \n  To accomplish these two very different tasks, the agency has two divisions: Enforcement and Removal Operations, which deports people in the country illegally, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), where  agents  “launch and pursue investigations into transnational crime.”\n \n\n   \n  During the Biden administration, HSI took steps to rebrand itself and  set up  its own website to try to distinguish its work from deportations.\n \n\n   \n  “The civil immigration enforcement side of the ICE mission is not what HSI does,” Katrina Berger, then-executive associate director of HSI,  told ABC News  last year, a few months before retiring.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  Since the start of his second term, Trump made clear that ICE – including HSI – has a singular focus under his administration.\n \n\n   \n  “The primary mission of (HSI) is the enforcement of … (laws) related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States,” the president  said  in an executive order signed on Inauguration Day.\n \n\n   \n  The HSI patch on uniforms has become a common sight in immigration raids. It was the lead agency in the  operation  at a Georgia Hyundai plant in September that  rounded up  nearly 500 workers accused of being in the country illegally.\n \n\n   \n  While HSI is typically the  lead  on worksite enforcement issues, former agency leaders fear that increasing HSI’s focus on removing undocumented workers from the country comes at the expense of investigating more significant dangers to the US, like targeting the importation of  fentanyl  and firearms  smuggling .\n \n\n   \n  “HSI, within ICE, has always been focused on human smuggling, sex trafficking, cybercrimes, Deep Web threats to children,” said Houser, who served as the ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration. “What we see now is a fundamental shifting away from that focus on national security.”\n \n\n   \n  The agency has also faced criticism for  aggressive tactics  used by ICE agents in executing the president’s immigration policy. Migrants have been  pulled from cars ,  off streets  and  tackled in courthouses  by masked agents.\n \n\n   \n  The heavy-handed tactics have also been used to control crowds at protests, where federal agents have at times used pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas to clear  demonstrators .\n \n\n   \n  ICE and US Customs and Border Protection agents are trained “to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Federal officers under DHS are “highly trained” in de-escalation tactics and “regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said.\n \n\n   \n  Illinois’ Democratic governor disagreed, accusing the agents of being provocative with protesters.\n \n\n   \n  “ICE is causing this mayhem,” Gov. JB Pritzker  said . “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”\n \n\n   \n  Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh says he got firsthand experience after accusing an ICE agent of  pointing a gun  at him when he was following an ICE vehicle.\n \n\n   \n  “These are ICE agents who are wearing masks. Their badges aren’t very clear,” Huynh  told CNN .\n \n\n   \n  DHS did not comment on whether a gun was drawn, but McLaughlin accused Huynh of “stalking law enforcement” and said agents had to “assess if he was a threat.”\n \n\n   \n  Huynh’s encounter demonstrates the difficulty people have just figuring out what agency an officer represents, especially since most DHS agencies do not have standard uniforms.\n \n\n   \n   Video  of the incident shows the  ICE agents  wearing camo uniforms marked with “POLICE.” The agency’s tan and olive shoulder patch blends into the camouflage color scheme. On a backpack, another agent is identified as being with “SRT,” the ICE Special Response Team, with SWAT-style training. Another uniform appears to say BORTAC, the Border Patrol’s own tactical unit. None of the uniforms seen in the video specifically said ICE.\n \n\n   \n  A federal judge in Chicago expressed her own concerns about the confusion caused when agents aren’t clearly identified, issuing an  order  that all agents “must have visible identification.”\n \n\n   \n  “The way that they’re carrying on without any visible identification – even that they’re law enforcement, much less what agency they’re with – it really is pretty unprecedented to see at this scale, and I think it’s very dangerous,”  said Scott Shuchart , a senior ICE official during the Biden administration.\n \n\n   \n  It’s not just the uniforms – masked federal officers have also become the  new calling card  of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n \n\n   \n  DHS officials say the masks are necessary to deal with increasing threats against ICE agents, including violence from protesters and doxxing.\n \n\n   \n  Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has said  federal officers are covering up to protect their families  after some have been publicly identified and then harassed online, along with relatives.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m not a proponent of the masks at all, but if it’s going to keep officers safe, it’s going to keep people from using advanced AI to find out their addresses and their families’ information, then by all means I’ll let them do it,” he  told NewsNation  in October.\n \n\n   \n   John Sandweg , an acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama and a former acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, has been on dozens of ride-alongs during his tenure and said he never saw anyone wear a mask.\n \n\n   \n  “When you’re at ICE and you’re at DHS, the first and highest priority is the safety of the workforce, and you have to do what’s necessary to protect them, but I think there’s no doubt it’s gone past what any reasonable policy would allow, and it really has to be a situation where it’s the exception, not the rule,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    US Coast Guard\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard was created in 1915 after a  merger  of agencies that focused on maritime tax evasion and emergency response on the high seas. The Coast Guard is responsible for “safety, security, and stewardship” on the water.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, its jurisdiction has expanded to include coverage of inland waterways, coastlines, bridges and ports.\n \n\n   \n  It is the only agency of government that is a branch of the military but operates as a civilian law enforcement agency during peacetime. The Coast Guard has been under civilian command since the end of World War II, and DHS has been in charge of the agency since 2003.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard’s unique hybrid structure straddling the military and civilian worlds allows Trump a great deal of leeway in deployment. But the administration has turned its focus to largely urban areas instead of waterways, relegating the Coast Guard to a supporting role.\n \n\n   \n  The Coast Guard said it was  preparing to support CBP agents  at the Coast Guard base in Alameda, California.\n \n\n   \n  It is working with other agencies to “detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border,” the Coast Guard told CNN affiliate  KCRA .\n \n\n   \n  Last month, Coast Guard “ personnel defensively fired their weapons ” at a U-Haul truck backing toward them outside the Coast Guard base in Alameda, where a  protest  had taken place against an anticipated federal deployment in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n \n\n   \n  No Coast Guard personnel were hurt, DHS  said  at the time, and the driver’s injury was not life-threatening,  according to  the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California.\n \n\n   \n  Trump later  stood down  on plans to “surge” resources to San Francisco after friends, including local tech executives Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce, told him San Francisco had made “substantial progress” against crime.\n \n\n   \n    National Guard\n \n\n   \n  The National Guard says its beginnings go back more than a century before the Revolutionary War, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony  established  its own permanent militia. But the current organization didn’t come  until 1933 , when the National Guard Mobilization Act created a unique two-tiered structure.\n \n\n   \n  Today’s National Guard is the descent of state militias and also the combat reserve for the Army and Air Force. The National Guard is under the direction of its state’s governor, who decides when and where to deploy troops. The president has full power over the  DC National Guard  and can also federalize the states’ National Guard for US operations in the case of an emergency when “regular forces” are unable to enforce federal law. Exactly what the law means by “regular forces” is still being discussed in the courts.\n \n\n   \n  Prior to Trump’s call-ups this year in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, the last time the National Guard was put under federal control for an operation within American borders was during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 – and it was  coordinated with state officials  at the time.\n \n\n   \n    How it’s going\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s attempt to invoke a rarely used law to deploy National Guard troops to several major American cities to curb crime and shut down protests has been one of the most striking and legally aggressive moves by the president — and one that’s come up against legal  challenges   over  and  over  again.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration recently attempted to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities that have been targeted by demonstrators in  Chicago  and  Portland , comparing the cities to a war zone and saying there is either “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion”  there .\n \n\n   \n  “You look at a place like Portland, it’s just — it’s ridiculous, when they say that there’s no problem. The place is — it was on fire over the weekend,” the president  said  last month.\n \n\n   \n  But both deployments have been halted by federal judges who say there is no justification to bring in the military.\n \n\n   \n  In  August , Trump  announced he is placing  the Washington, DC, police department “ under direct federal control ” and deploying National Guard troops to the nation’s capital, saying the move is aimed at restoring order in the city. The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall crime numbers are  lower this year  than in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  More than 2,000 National Guard troops in DC are stationed throughout the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, while other soldiers and airmen are helping with “beautification projects,” like picking up trash, replanting grass and spreading mulch.\n \n\n   \n  The ongoing mission costs about  $1 million  a day, experts estimated to CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The president brought the stepped-up law enforcement model next to Memphis, Tennessee, in an attempt to crack down on crime. The move marked the first such effort in a Republican state, and Tennessee Republicans, including Gov. Bill Lee,  welcomed the announcement .\n \n\n   \n  Like in Washington, DC, the National Guard troops in Memphis are not dedicated just to securing federal property but are also supporting local law enforcement in their operations.\n \n\n   \n  Although the city’s leadership disagreed with the Guard’s deployment, officials have cooperated and  advised  residents that the troops will be “serving as extra ‘eyes and ears’ in our neighborhoods.”\n \n\n   \n  “I want to be clear I did not ask for the National Guard and I don’t think it is the way to drive down crime,” Mayor Paul Young  said  in September. “However, that decision has already been made.”\n \n\n   \n  Young and others said they wanted the task force to  focus on targeting violent offenders  rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.\n \n\n   \n  Democratic-elected officials in Tennessee filed a  lawsuit   trying to stop the Memphis deployment, but the court has taken no action yet.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, graphic designer Leah Abucayan and photo editor Austin Steele contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/science/new-glenn-rocket-launch-mars-escapade","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"16:58:00-05:00","title":"Landmark Mars mission and first big test for Jeff Bezos’ New Glenn rocket is delayed by weather","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket, developed by Jeff Bezos' company to compete with SpaceX, has been delayed twice due to weather and FAA airspace restrictions.

2:45 p.m. ET on Sunday. But Blue Origin revealed during  a livestream  that cloud cover rolled into the area, preventing liftoff. (Rockets often seek to avoid clouds because flying through one that is electrified can actually trigger a lightening strike.)\n \n\n   \n  “We’re reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt based on forecasted weather,” the company said in a social media post.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin officials previously indicated they have the ability to try again during a launch window on Monday. The weather forecast for that opportunity, however, appeared “somewhat consistent” with Sunday’s conditions, noted Laura Maginnis, New Glenn’s vice president of mission management, during a Saturday news conference.\n \n\n   \n  The Federal Aviation Administration recently said that it would be  putting a stop  to commercial rocket launches between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. ET, beginning Monday, to ease the burden on air traffic controllers amid the government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “We are working really closely with both our partners at the FAA and with the NASA team to ensure that we’re, of course, honoring and respecting the airspace expectations,” Maginnis said.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin’s launch window on Monday would run between 2:40 and 4:08 p.m. ET, according to a news release.\n \n\n   \n    Blue Origin aims to reuse rocket boosters\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin is also attempting to land and recover New Glenn’s first-stage booster, which is the bottommost portion of the rocket that gives the initial burst of power at liftoff, on a seafaring barge called Jacklyn. Much like Blue Origin’s  chief competitor, SpaceX  — which has long been a dominant force in the commercial launch business — Blue Origin rockets are designed to be partially reused in order to drive down costs.\n \n\n   \n  Blue Origin had hoped to nail its first attempt at landing a booster on New Glenn’s inaugural orbital flight in January, but engines failed to reignite properly, causing the rocket to veer off course.\n \n\n   \n  However, the primary mission of Blue Origin’s January launch — delivering a test satellite called the Blue Ring Pathfinder to orbit — went off without a hitch, prompting the company to declare the flight a success.\n \n\n   \n  But Blue Origin does view safely recovering and reusing its rocket boosters as crucial for its business model.\n \n\n   \n  Maginnis said during the Saturday news conference that working to pinpoint why the booster did not stick its landing in January, and implementing fixes to help it succeed this time around, were the primary reasons Blue Origin waited nearly 10 months to attempt a second New Glenn launch.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve incorporated a number of changes to our propellant management system, some minor hardware changes as well, to increase our likelihood of landing that booster,” Maginnis said.\n \n\n   \n  But, she added, “if we don’t land the booster — that’s OK. We have several more vehicles in production.”\n \n\n   \n  Maginnis declined to specify how many boosters Blue Origin has in production.\n \n\n   \n  The next New Glenn flight, which had been slated for this year but does not currently have a target launch date, is expected to deliver a Blue Origin-designed lunar lander called Mark 1 to the moon’s surface.\n \n\n   \n    NASA Escapade’s Mars mission\n \n\n   \n  After taking flight, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket will set twin satellites on a path into deep space. The orbiters are expected to linger in a holding pattern before heading for Mars next year when the red planet is better aligned for a less fuel-intensive journey.\n \n\n   \n  The mission, called Escapade — short for Escape and Plasma Acceleration Dynamics Explorers — is a low-cost planetary science project funded by NASA and spearheaded by the University of California, Berkeley, with support from commercial companies Advanced Space and Rocket Lab.\n \n\n   \n  If all goes to plan, the vehicles will arrive in Martian orbit in 2027.\n \n\n   \n  Once there, the spacecraft will work in tandem to investigate why the planet began to lose its atmosphere billions of years ago — and to study how its harsh climate may affect future explorers.\n \n\n   \n  “We will be making the space weather measurements we need to understand the system well enough to forecast solar storms whose radiation could harm astronauts on the surface of Mars or in orbit,” said the mission’s principal investigator, Robert Lillis, of UC Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory in a statement.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/health/infant-formula-recall-botulism","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"11:02:00-05:00","title":"Infant Botulism in 10 US States Linked to Formula Being Recalled","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A voluntary recall of two lots of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula has been initiated after 13 cases of infant botulism were reported in 10 U.S. states, with all infants hospitalized but no deaths.

Brazil’s billion-dollar criminal networks \n       \n  By Alessandra Freitas, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:27 PM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Armored vehicles rumbling through narrow alleys. Rifle shots cracking in heavy crossfire. Helicopters and weaponized drones firing from above. Soldiers in military gear engaged in violent combat. Bodies scattered on blood-slicked streets.\n \n\n   \n  These could be scenes from a war zone.  But on October 28, they unfolded not on a desolate battlefield but on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro — a postcard city better known for its breathtaking coastline and lively bossa nova music scene.\n \n\n   \n  “Operation Containment” brought 2,500 police officers, soldiers and snipers up the slopes of Rio’s Complexo da Penha and Complexo do Alemão favelas, home to roughly 110,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  Their target was the Comando Vermelho (CV), or Red Command, a criminal organization that has ruled these hillside shantytowns for decades. During the operation, at least 117 suspected gunmen and four police officers were killed, and about 100 people were arrested. Authorities said they seized 118 weapons, including 91 rifles and 14 explosive devices, as well as a ton of drugs.\n \n\n   \n  The raid followed a year-long investigation into the Red Command and was triggered in part by the gang’s expansion into new territories, a recent surge in violence and an effort by authorities to reassert state control.\n \n\n   \n  Officials called the raid a success. But with at least 121 dead, and early reports putting the toll at 132, the operation drew sharp criticism from local and international human rights groups. It also laid bare a deep divide over how to confront Brazil’s entrenched organized crime syndicates.\n \n\n   \n    Life in a crossfire\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the first time we see blood being spilled for a ‘greater good,’” said Thainã de Medeiros, who lived in Complexo da Penha for 35 years. “But this ‘good’ never comes.”\n \n\n   \n  Now a community organizer and member of an anti-violence collective who works in the favela, Medeiros is no stranger to how the Red Command instills fear in its territories. “You walk around and see people carrying big rifles on every corner, standing by your door with grenades and pistols,” he said. “No one feels safe. And there is always the risk of instability — of another operation like this.”\n \n\n   \n  The gangs also “determine who gets in and operates inside the communities,” said Rafael Alcadipani, a member of the Brazilian Forum on Public Security, a nonprofit civic group. “Internet companies, for instance, need to pay them a fee to offer service in the area. They issue permits for people to build houses — not the government.”\n \n\n   \n  The rise in violence, weaponry and gang control in the favelas has made it increasingly difficult for government officials and police to access these areas.\n \n\n   \n  “The state abandons these communities, and then gangs end up gaining even more control,” Alcadipani said.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s criminal organizations have also extended their reach from the illegal economy to politics through such means as vote-buying, violence, intimidation and the funding of political candidates, as studies and police investigations have found, helping them to become one of the most powerful gangs in South America.\n \n\n   \n    ‘A necessary operation’\n \n\n   \n  Luiz Lima, a right-leaning congressman representing Rio, defended the October 28 raid as unavoidable.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a necessary operation,” Lima told CNN. “What happened that day — 117 criminals killed — happens every day in Brazil. With more than 38,000 homicides last year, “that’s 106 deaths a day,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Lima insisted that the public backs a tougher stance and that the vast majority of favela residents supported the operation.\n \n\n   \n  “The people living there are extorted,” he said. “Their shops are extorted. Women are raped by traffickers. It’s unbearable.”\n \n\n   \n  But Daniela Fichino, deputy director of the human rights group Global Justice, blames “a state policy that defines an entire population as disposable.” She added: “Brazil doesn’t have the death penalty, and yet the state acts as if it does — simultaneously finding, prosecuting and executing young, Black, poor residents under the banner of public security.”\n \n\n   \n  The result, Fichino said, is “a perpetual cycle of war that reinforces the very criminal structures it claims to dismantle.”\n \n\n   \n  The debate over lasting solutions reveals the complexity of how criminal organizations have grown so powerful, weaving themselves into nearly every layer of Brazilian society over time.\n \n\n   \n    A faction born from dictatorship\n \n\n   \n  The Red Command was founded in 1979 inside an island prison off the coast of Rio, the Cândido Mendes Penitentiary, where common criminals were locked up alongside leftist political prisoners opposed to the Brazilian military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. In the harsh conditions there, what began as an informal alliance for protection soon became an organized network.\n \n\n   \n  One of its founders, William da Silva Lima, spent more than 30 years behind bars after being convicted of armed robbery, extortion and kidnapping. In prison, he became a spokesman for other inmates and negotiated with authorities.\n \n\n   \n  The deplorable conditions inside the nineteenth-century Cândido Mendes — long known among inmates as the “Cauldron of Hell” — pushed prisoners to organize in resistance, da Silva Lima wrote in his 2010 book, recounting the origin of the Red Command and his part in creating the Brazilian organized crime group.\n \n\n   \n  When political prisoners were released in 1979, da Silva Lima wrote, members of what was then called the Falange Vermelha  or Red Phalanx, began orchestrating mass prison breaks and investing in the burgeoning cocaine trade.\n \n\n   \n  By 1985, the Red Command controlled roughly 70% of all drug-selling points in Rio — and the city’s deadly turf wars with other factions began.\n \n\n   \n  According to Márcio Sérgio Christino, a São Paulo state criminal prosecutor and author of a book on the gangs, while the Red Command is Brazil’s oldest faction, it is not the biggest — although its recent expansion shows it aims to achieve that goal. Its main obstacle is not the police or the government, he said, but a competing faction: bigger, better organized and highly influential in South America.\n \n\n   \n    Brazil’s biggest underground empire: The PCC\n \n\n   \n  Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), or First Capital Command, is a criminal organization created in 1993 that also has its genesis in a prison — the Taubaté Penitentiary in São Paulo. Its founders were survivors of the Carandiru massacre the year before, when 111 inmates were killed by military police.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t until February 2001 that the group revealed its full reach. In what became known as the “big rebellion,” PCC members coordinated uprisings in 29 prisons simultaneously. About 27,000 inmates were involved, leaving at least 16 killed and 77 injured, among those incarcerated and police officers. At the end of the 27-hour uprising, the flag of the PCC — black and white, some accompanied by handmade signs reading “peace and justice” — was raised across São Paulo’s penitentiaries. The message was clear: the state had lost control.\n \n\n   \n  “At first, their focus was … controlling the prison environment,” Christino explained. “Then they began to grow, to organize, and one of their main pillars became the drug trade.”\n \n\n   \n  To obtain a higher-quality supply of cocaine, the PCC expanded into Brazil’s border states with Bolivia and Paraguay — two of South America’s main cocaine sources. With the US market already dominated by Mexico and Colombia, cocaine producers in landlocked Bolivia focused on reaching Europe, and a deal was struck.\n \n\n   \n  “Bolivia agreed to sell only to the PCC,” Christino said. “In return, the PCC handled transport, logistics and sales — to Europe, Africa, and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n    From friends to rivals\n \n\n   \n  Until then, the Red Command and PCC were not enemies. But their fragile coexistence collapsed once the Red Command, blocked from Bolivia, turned to Peru and built a cocaine trade that operates almost entirely within Brazil. Notably, the gang came to dominate supply routes through the northern part of the country, using the major rivers and their tributaries of the Amazon region.\n \n\n   \n  Competition over these routes ignited a series of prison riots and massacres across northern Brazil, Christino said.\n \n\n   \n  “If you look at those uprisings — dozens, sometimes hundreds of deaths, even cannibalism — that was all about the routes,” he said. “It was a territorial war.”\n \n\n   \n  The syndicates now clash for control of Brazil’s highways, rivers and prisons as they branch out into other criminal realms.\n \n\n   \n  A 2025 study by the Brazilian Forum on Public Security found that gangs such as the Red Command and PCC generated 146.8 billion Brazilian reais ($27 billion) in 2022 through the illegal trade of gold, fuel, alcohol and cigarettes — nearly 10 times more than from cocaine trafficking, which was estimated at 15 billion reais ($2.8 billion).\n \n\n   \n  They also engage in money laundering and invest in construction firms, transport companies, fuel distributors and even crypto markets to wash billions of reals in illicit profits.\n \n\n   \n    Inside the command centers: An ongoing battle\n \n\n   \n  Investigations by the Public Ministry of Rio de Janeiro show that gang leaders continue to issue orders from behind bars — through coded messages, letters and encrypted apps.\n \n\n   \n  While high-risk inmates have been isolated in individual cells, the flow of information never truly stops, said Christino. “There’s no such thing as absolute isolation,” he said. “Cellphones still get in, and when they don’t, messages travel through lawyers or visitors. There’s always a way.”\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, the Federal District’s Secretariat of Penitentiary Administration said that “intelligence units operate in close coordination with other security forces and the judiciary to monitor faction-linked inmates.” They work to determine an inmate’s position in the hierarchy and isolate leaders “to prevent them from issuing orders,” the secretariat said.\n \n\n   \n  Despite these measures, investigators acknowledge that Brazil’s penitentiaries remain the backbone of command and communication for its largest criminal organizations — a paradox that the state struggles to contain.\n \n\n   \n  “The state’s militarized response only strengthens the factions,” Alcadipani said. “Each operation kills dozens, but the leadership remains. For every man who dies, another fills the gap … What we have now is reactive — a war without an endgame.”\n \n\n   \n  “We were about to launch a partnership with UNICEF” to help favela youth enter the job market, said Medeiros, the community organizer. Career fairs were scheduled for the day after the deadly operation in the Rio favelas. “We had to cancel everything,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “Honestly, I thought today I’d be finalizing the details for that beautiful day,” he said. “Instead, we were cleaning bodies from the streets. And now, we’re bracing for what’s next.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/newsom-democratic-party-prop-50-election","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"11:52:00.000-05:00","title":"Newsom says Democrats’ Tuesday wins, including Prop 50, represent ‘a new moment’ for party","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"California Governor Gavin Newsom declared that recent Democratic victories — including the passage of Proposition 50, which expands Democratic representation in California’s congressional delegation — mark a 'new moment' for the party.

Gavin Newsom said Democrats’  sweeping election victory  on Tuesday, including the approval of a  redistricting ballot measure  in his state, “represents a new moment” for the Democratic Party as it debates its path forward.\n \n\n   \n  “Clarity, conviction, purpose, energy. On our toes, not on our heels. A resurgent Democratic Party, and it’s a party that understands what’s at stake for our democracy,” Newsom said during a wide-ranging interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in Houston on Saturday.   \n \n\n   \n  Along with the approval of California’s Proposition 50, which creates five US House seats more favorable for Democrats, the party won in high-profile races across the country on Tuesday.  Zohran Mamdani  was elected mayor of New York City, while  Abigail Spanberger  and  Mikie Sherrill  won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom traveled to Houston on Saturday for a rally, during which he touted the win and also credited Texas Democrats for inspiring the push for Proposition 50.\n \n\n   \n  “I think just the energy that the delegation from Texas brought to the Democratic Party, to democracy as a whole, when they stood up and pushed back against (Texas Gov.) Greg Abbott and Donald Trump’s overreach … in many ways that was the beginning of this comeback,” Newsom said to Tapper following the rally.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, Texas Republicans moved to redraw the state’s congressional maps to shift five US House seats to the right at President Donald Trump’s behest. The move sparked outrage among state legislative Democrats, who left Texas to avoid a vote. They  ultimately returned , and the maps were passed and  signed into law .\n \n\n   \n  In response, Democrats in California began the efforts to redraw the state’s congressional maps. Newsom, who is widely expected to be a 2028 presidential candidate,  made himself the face  of California’s redistricting efforts and nationalized the issue.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom acknowledged criticism that California made the redistricting process partisan, including from  Republican former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , and told Tapper that he supports “independent redistricting.”\n \n\n   \n  “But you can’t do it state by state with one arm tied behind your back,” he said. “You can’t unilaterally disarm as other people are not playing by the rules.”\n \n\n   \n  After the GOP win in Texas, Republicans have also redrawn seats in their favor in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, and they are attempting to do the same in other states, including Indiana and Kansas.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, following California’s lead, Democrats are seeking changes to maps in at least three other states: New York, Virginia and Illinois.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re not screwing around. They’re consolidating power,” Newsom said of Republicans’ efforts.\n \n\n   \n  Newsom also weighed in on attending the COP30 climate summit this week in Brazil as the Trump administration has decided not to send a  high-level delegation .\n \n\n   \n  When asked what his role will be at the summit and whether he’s standing in for the president, Newsom said he’ll be “standing in for my kids and grandkids, for common sense, for, you know, our economic future.”    \n \n\n   \n  During the interview, Newsom also reiterated his warnings of the threat he says Trump poses to democracy.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, Newsom claimed, “it’s not about the rule of law. It’s about the rule of Don.”\n \n\n   \n  “This is not normal times,” he later added. “The rules have changed and we need to change.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Eric Bradner, Arit John and David Wright contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/zohran-mamdani-democrats-online-videos","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"How Democrats are emulating Mamdani’s style online","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, Democratic candidates across the U.S. are adopting Zohran Mamdani’s campaign style — marked by vibrant colors, quick cuts, and expressive gestures — to capture attention in a media-saturated environment.

They might walk and talk through a busy street or store. There’s a warm camera filter, and quick cuts, as they move rapid-fire through a list of talking points and policies.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s a look at how some Democrats are producing content echoing the Mamdani style.\n \n\n   \n    The Mamdani aesthetic\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s videos are instantly recognizable by the saturated colors that help them stand out on social feeds crowded with content.\n \n\n   \n  The videos are also characterized by quick cuts and big gestures — a tendency Mamdani joked about in one spot: “My team says I move my hands too much,” he  says .\n \n\n   \n  It’s an aesthetic that’s worked for other Democrats, including a pair of progressives in Michigan’s Democratic Senate primary.\n \n\n   \n  Former Detroit public health official Abdul El-Sayed scored a hit with a video using burgers to illustrate billionaire excess, similar to a Mamdani video that used mango lassis to explain New York’s ranked choice voting system. And state Sen. Mallory McMorrow earned her own viral moment with a video highlighting grocery prices, calling to mind Mamdani’s bodega tours.\n \n\n   \n  Andrew Mamo, a Democratic strategist advising McMorrow and Texas state Rep. James Talarico, another 2026 US Senate contender, underscored the importance of visually engaging content.\n \n\n   \n  “Understand that you’re not just competing against the other Democrats in the primary. You’re not just competing against the Republicans,” Mamo explained. “You are competing against dog videos and sports highlights and Netflix on your other television and someone FaceTiming you and your group chat for attention on your phone and on your laptop and on your iPad.”\n \n\n   \n    The substance: affordability\n \n\n   \n  Mamdani’s campaign insists that its relentless focus on affordability was equally important to the success. “The style is downstream from the substance,” said Andrew Epstein, a top campaign aide.\n \n\n   \n  “Unless you have a message and an agenda that is directly relevant to people’s lives that speaks to the economic conditions in this country, that credibly presents itself as an alternative to this incredibly broken status quo and the alienation that so many people feel from mainstream politics — it’s not going to work,” Epstein said.\n \n\n   \n  Roxie Richner, El-Sayed’s communications director, echoed the Mamdani team’s emphasis on the issues.\n \n\n   \n  “I think at the end of the day, what resonates with people is the substance,” Richner said, pointing to one of El-Sayed’s  videos  in which “he explained the privatization of the Bay City bridges in Bay City, Michigan, in a way that people understood and that maybe folks in other parts of the state weren’t aware of it.”\n \n\n   \n  And while many politicians have taken to addressing voters’ concerns about affordability, strategists pointed to the importance of getting specific, exemplified by Mamdani’s focus on everyday pressure points like rents and bus fares.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not the affordability crisis in this country — it’s, ‘I need new deodorant and it’s $13.99, when did deodorant get to be $13.99?” Mamo said. “If you’re sitting in a bar, that is how you would say that. And if you’re on video, you should say it the same way, if you’re explaining it to your neighbor or a stranger at the bar, it’s the same way you should talk on camera.”\n \n\n   \n    Emulation, not imitation\n \n\n   \n  Soon after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary this summer, rival Andrew Cuomo began producing videos in which he was walking and talking in soft-filter video. Mamdani’s team noticed.\n \n\n   \n  “I mean, I want to say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but in Andrew’s case, I think it’s a lot more pathetic than that, frankly,” Epstein said.\n \n\n   \n  Other strategists underlined the importance of authenticity in campaign communications, with candidates across the country from different backgrounds facing a diverse array of issues.\n \n\n   \n  “It has to be real to you,” Mamo said, pointing to the example of California Sen. Adam Schiff. “He’s a lawyer, a professor and an explainer. So their videos are lawyer-professor-explainer, Adam Schiff, lawyer-professor- explaining what’s going on in Congress.”\n \n\n   \n  And Richner with El-Sayed’s campaign in Michigan said  Tuesday’s election results  demonstrated the party’s need for talented communicators.\n \n\n   \n  “Whether it was bringing down utility prices in New Jersey, or it was making buses faster and free in New York, I think people are suffering in this moment, and they want to believe that things can be better, and they need leaders and messengers that can show them that,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/climate/paris-agreement-anniversary-cop30","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"09:05:00-05:00","title":"It’s been a dangerous decade since the Paris Climate Agreement, but there’s still reason for hope","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reflects on the 10-year anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement, acknowledging that while the world failed to meet its 1.5°C warming target due to rising emissions and climate tipping points like coral reef collapse, there are still reasons for hope.

dangerous decade since the Paris Climate Agreement, but there’s still reason for hope \n       \n  Analysis by John D. Sutter\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:05 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A decade ago, the world got together and decided to fix the climate crisis by adopting the Paris Agreement.\n \n\n   \n  I remember it like yesterday. This was December 2015 at the UN climate talks in Paris. I was standing in front of a CNN camera as the news came through an earpiece: Nearly every country on Earth agrees to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 — holding warming short of catastrophic levels. A hilariously on-the-nose green gavel hit a desk. The convention center erupted in applause. Diplomats wept and hugged. Even Al Gore managed to not look all that wooden.\n \n\n   \n  My column the next morning trumpeted this headline: “ This is the end of fossil fuels .”\n \n\n   \n  Somehow, it doesn’t feel like 10 years and some 300 gigatons of carbon have floated by since then.\n \n\n   \n  Paris was not the end of fossil fuels, of course. From the perspective of the atmosphere, the last decade could accurately be described as a slow-moving fever dream — one in which pollution from fossil fuels has continued to rise year after year. All those emissions drive global heating and make the planet more dangerous.\n \n\n   \n  And in this dangerous decade climate disasters have continued to intensify — from the massive hurricane that  walloped Puerto Rico in 2017 , to Jamaica this October where  the most powerful Atlantic storm  on record came aground.\n \n\n   \n  It’s a decade in which  new fossil fuel projects continued to be approved  by the very governments that had promised to slash emissions; and one in which the United States twice elected a climate-denier to the nation’s highest office. This fall, US President Donald Trump, after  cancelling billions toward clean energy projects  and  moving to open a swath of the Arctic for oil extraction , bucked the scientific consensus on global warming again by falsely stating that climate change is the “ greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world. ”\n \n\n   \n  Ironic, then, that this has also been a decade during which scientists realized that, if anything,  they underestimated some of the threats of climate change .\n \n\n   \n  Just last month, for example, researchers reported that Earth had crossed one of  its first climate tipping points , with such a massive percentage of coral reefs struggling amid warming that we’re entering a “new reality” in which those reefs won’t be able to recover.\n \n\n   \n  One key goal of the Paris Agreement was to prevent this sort of thing, by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. A group of especially climate-vulnerable countries, calling themselves the  High Ambition Coalition , banded together to push for that target. In Paris, delegates carried the rhyming theme over to wearing buttons that said, “1.5 to stay alive,” a reference to the existential threat warming poses, especially to low-lying areas that are flooding as ice melts and oceans rise.\n \n\n   \n  That “1.5 to stay alive” target, we now know, is almost certainly out of reach. Either  we’ve crossed that line already  or  we’re well on the way . Does that mean we’re “dead”? That we’ve failed to “stay alive”?\n \n\n   \n  No — thankfully, the world doesn’t burst into flames at 1.51 degrees of warming.\n \n\n   \n  We do know that every ton of heat-trapping pollution makes the world more dangerous. But, conversely, every ton of it we save makes the world safer for future generations. Yes, by many metrics, we’ve backslid in the years since Paris. Jamie Henn, co-founder of 350.org and director of Fossil Free Media, told me that if climate action is  Star Wars  then “I think we’re in the  Empire Strikes Back  episode of the trilogy” — where it all falls apart.\n \n\n   \n  But it’s still possible to adjust the lens and bring other storylines into focus.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve come an incredibly long way since Paris,” said Jean Su, energy justice director and senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. Of note, Su told me, is the fact that world leaders in 2023, at the COP meeting in Dubai,  added language to the Paris Agreement  that calls for moving away from fossil fuels. At that meeting, “we really reached a pinnacle in terms of addressing the root causes of the climate emergency,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  Just because Trump thinks climate change is a scam, doesn’t mean the rest of the world agrees.\n \n\n   \n  Henn, the climate activist, pointed to renewable energy as a bright spot. In the first half of 2025,  renewables overtook coal  as the world’s top energy source for the first time. Wind and solar power — which don’t produce the heat-trapping pollution of coal and gas — are  expected to meet 90% of new electricity demand  this year.\n \n\n   \n  “The transition is moving  even faster than people predicted back in 2015 ,” Henn said.  Fifteen times faster , in fact, if you’re looking at solar power installations, according to the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.\n \n\n   \n  Likewise, it continues to be crystal clear how the public feels about this issue: 89% of the global public  surveyed in a 2024 study  favored stronger political action on climate change.\n \n\n   \n  “That is a supermajority,” said Mark Hertsgaard, executive director of Covering Climate Now, the group behind a media collaboration called the  89 Percent Project . “And it’s a [super]majority that doesn’t know that it’s a majority. People in that majority think that they’re 29% of the population. They think they’re a minority.”\n \n\n   \n  But even in the United States, positive trends hold: 79% of registered voters  surveyed in May 2025  said they support the US being part of the Paris Agreement and 75% support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant.\n \n\n   \n  Climate advocates are planning new efforts to make use of this supermajority. Among them is a push for a  Fossil Fuel Nonproliferation Treaty . Alex Rafalowicz, executive director of that initiative, told me the idea for a treaty builds on an  International Court of Justice decision earlier this year  that held nations legally responsible for curbing climate-heating pollution.\n \n\n   \n  “The economics do demonstrate that the transition [to clean energy sources] has an inevitability about it,” Rafalowicz said. “But the question is whether it is fast enough, and whether it is fair enough. That is part of the problem we’re trying to solve.”\n \n\n   \n  A meeting about that treaty is likely to happen next spring in Colombia, he said. Meanwhile, the UN is prepping for COP30, in Brazil, which begins November 10. Plenty of the delegates there will remember that green gavel moment from Paris. I’ll be thinking of it as I watch news from the summit, too.\n \n\n   \n  On the day the Paris Agreement was adopted, I spent hours with the delegation from the Marshall Islands, a nation of low-lying islands in the Pacific that fears being subsumed by rising seas. I’d visited the country earlier in 2015 for a CNN article. I’ll never forget a woman telling me that the sound of the ocean, which used to lull her to sleep, had become threatening after waves crashed through her home and flooded it. Her family had decided to move to Arkansas to get far away from the water and that sound.\n \n\n   \n  The Marshallese delegation in Paris gave me a palm frond ribbon to remember them by. I kept it in my pocket as I relayed news of the agreement to viewers around the world.\n \n\n   \n  It’s sitting on my desk as I type this, 10 years later.\n \n\n   \n  It reminds me that the optimism and the urgency of that moment have not been forgotten.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/syrian-migrants-germany-repatriation-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"08:39:00-05:00","title":"Syrian migrants in Germany face uncertain future as government floats repatriation","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany is facing a major political and humanitarian crisis over the future of over 1.3 million Syrian migrants, many of whom arrived during the refugee crisis under Angela Merkel’s open-door policy.

in Germany face uncertain future as government floats repatriation \n       \n  By Sophie Tanno, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        8:39 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Germany opened its doors to refugees escaping war in the Middle East, more people arrived from Syria than any other country – finding homes, getting jobs, starting families.\n \n\n   \n  A question mark now hangs over their future, after Germany’s government – which has  hardened its stance  on immigration amid a surging far right – suggested it could be time for some to return home, voluntarily or not.\n \n\n   \n  Some 1 million Syrians arrived in Germany at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015-2016,  under former chancellor  Angela Merkel. Approximately 1.3 million live in Germany currently, including 25,000 who were born there.\n \n\n   \n  Now, Chancellor Friedrich Merz and other conservatives in his coalition cabinet are calling for their repatriation.\n \n\n   \n  Merz this week said that Berlin would approach the issue in a “very concrete matter,” as he signaled that there are “no longer any grounds for asylum in Germany, and therefore we can also begin with repatriations.”\n \n\n   \n  While the German government will first and foremost encourage voluntary repatriation, Merz said those who refuse “can, of course, also be deported in the near future,” as he said that the return of Syrians to their homeland would be key to rebuilding the war-torn country.\n \n\n   \n  The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President  Ahmad al-Sharaa  to Berlin to discuss the issue.\n \n\n   \n  What’s changed in Syria is that the Assad government  is no more , bringing an end to years of civil war. And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right  Alternative for Germany (AfD)  party.\n \n\n   \n  Despite Merz’s rhetoric, it remains unclear at this stage how wide-reaching deportations would be. Germany has so far only announced plans to deport Syrians with criminal records.\n \n\n   \n  Since the collapse of Assad’s regime, around 1,300 Syrians – or 0.1% - have voluntarily returned to their homeland, according to Germany’s interior ministry.\n \n\n   \n  Syrians live in Germany under varying legal statuses – some have been granted German citizenship, while others hold permanent residence permits. Over 160,000 Syrians had obtained German citizenship by the end of 2023, Deutsche Welle reported. Those who fall into these categories will not need to leave Germany, CDU politicians said during a coalition debate on Tuesday, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of thousands more hold temporary residence permits, which they are granted after receiving a protection status, such as asylum, refugee or subsidiary protection, which applies when neither of the former can be granted and serious harm is threatened in the country of origin.\n \n\n   \n  Temporary residence permits allow foreigners to live and work in Germany, as well as receive government benefits, but mean their ability to remain there is uncertain.\n \n\n   \n  The issue of repatriation is contentious and comes with significant legal hurdles. Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.\n \n\n   \n  “Merz’s comments are heading in a direction that fuels right-wing desires to deport anyone who doesn’t fit their so-called idea of who belongs in Germany and that’s terrifying,” said Rafif Dawoud, a 33-year-old architect living in Berlin, who migrated from Syria over 12 years ago and is now a German citizen.\n \n\n   \n  Dawoud said that while she knows people who have willingly returned, “talking about sending back people who have been trying to integrate, who see Germany as their second or even first and only home, who actively contribute to this society and economy, well that’s an absolute disgrace.”\n \n\n   \n  Others are concerned about a volatile political situation back home. A retired engineer, who currently lives in Germany but does not hold citizenship, described the overthrow of Assad’s government as a “historical necessity” while questioning its replacement.\n \n\n   \n  “We must ask whether the country is moving toward a state that mirrors European and specifically German values, respecting freedoms and human principles, or whether dictatorship and a new totalitarian religious system are simply being reproduced under a different name,” the man, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Since Assad’s ousting, Syria has  seen flare-ups  of deadly sectarian violence, with clashes erupting between security forces and those loyal to the former president, including in Syria’s coastal Latakia region in March.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN, Akram al-Bunni, a Syrian political activist who was jailed under Assad’s regime, said the German government must take into consideration the nature of the country’s new authority, which he believes could expose many Syrians to new persecution. The security situation must also be considered, al-Bunni said, stating that weapons remain “uncontrolled in the hands of extremist factions.”\n \n\n   \n  Johann Wadephul, Germany’s foreign minister and a politician in Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), hinted at some of the problems awaiting Syrians on a recent visit to  Damascus , when he compared the country’s devastation to “images we saw from Germany in 1945 after World War II” and expressed doubt that large numbers of Syrian migrants would return voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  But after receiving backlash from within his own party over the comments, Wadephul has sought to stress that his overall view remains in alignment with his party.\n \n\n   \n  Other politicians, particularly on Germany’s left, have criticized the plans. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Lamya Kaddor, of Germany’s Green Party, said “to believe that mass deportations (to Syria) are now possible underestimates the reality on the ground.”\n \n\n   \n  The Association of German-Syrian Aid Organizations has spoken out against the government’s plans, with its chairman Nahla Osman saying the debate represents a huge blow for Syrians who have integrated into German society, including skilled workers, in a recent interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.\n \n\n   \n  Germany’s health sector, for example, employs over 6,000 Syrian doctors, according to official figures – making them an integral part of the country’s healthcare system. Late last year, then-Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned “whole areas” in Germany’s healthcare sector would fall away if the Syrians who worked there currently were to leave.\n \n\n   \n    Countering the far right\n \n\n   \n  Despite the opposition, it is clear that the days of “Wilkommenskulture” or “welcoming culture” regarding immigration to Germany under Merkel are gone.\n \n\n   \n  The  AfD  came second in Germany’s federal election in February, securing an unprecedented number of votes after campaigning on an anti-migration platform and a manifesto that states that “Islam does not belong in Germany.”\n \n\n   \n  Since the collapse of the Assad regime, the AfD has been calling for Syrians in Germany to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the party has continued to enjoy strong popularity, even temporarily surging ahead of the CDU in some polls, leaving Merz’s government fighting to retain ground.\n \n\n   \n  Merz – who had long been a critic of Merkel’s open-door policies – has taken a tougher stance on migration, in part to counter the AfD.\n \n\n   \n  While his predecessor welcomed migrants into Germany under the slogan “Wir schaffen das” – “We’ll manage it,” Merz and his government  announced sweeping revisions  to migration policy after taking office.\n \n\n   \n  “We clearly did not manage it. That is exactly why we’re trying to fix it,” he said of the situation.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/china/china-people-cafe-change-name-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"02:00:00-04:00","title":"Chinese Coffee Chain Changes Name After Political Backlash Over 'People’s' Branding","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Chinese coffee chain named People’s Cafe faced severe backlash from state media and the public for using the term 'people'—a politically charged term central to China’s communist identity—in its branding, which included red decorations, Mao Zedong-inspired typefaces, and slogans like 'Tell China’s story with coffee.'

So far, Miran has participated in two Fed meetings — and broken ranks with the vast majority of Fed officials each time.\n \n\n   \n  At the central bank’s October policy meeting, Miran dissented from Fed officials’ decision  to lower interest rates by a quarter point , backing a larger, half-point cut instead, just as he did in September.\n \n\n   \n  He hasn’t wasted any time to leave a first impression in other ways, too.\n \n\n   \n  In his first month as a central banker, Miran spoke publicly about the US economy at more than a dozen events and media interviews. Fed officials typically do only about a handful of public engagements in their first month.\n \n\n   \n  Like Trump, Miran has  repeatedly called for aggressive interest rate cuts . He has argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that there’s “substantial disinflation” coming down the pike — views Miran proclaims as “out of consensus.”\n \n\n   \n  He reiterated his stance in a Wednesday interview with Yahoo Finance.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone is sold on Miran’s takes on the economy.\n \n\n   \n  “I certainly wouldn’t characterize anything that he’s saying as ridiculous,” David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura, said in an interview with CNN after he moderated a discussion with Miran in Washington, DC. “It’s more of a debate on the inputs that he’s putting into his economic modeling, which are controversial.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think only time will tell if he ends up being right,” Seif said.\n \n\n   \n    Miran’s takes\n \n\n   \n  Miran’s rationale for significant rate cuts is mostly based on how he views Trump’s sweeping economic policies and  his expectation that Trump’s tariffs won’t stoke inflation. \n \n\n   \n  In his first big speech after being sworn in as a Fed governor, Miran explained how Trump’s policies may be contributing to a lower “neutral rate of interest,” which is a theoretical level of borrowing costs that neither stimulates nor dampens the US economy.\n \n\n   \n  Miran specifically pointed to the administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration, the president’s signature tax and spending bill passed by Congress earlier this year, and Trump’s widespread tariffs.\n \n\n   \n  In Miran’s view, that means the Fed has a lot of catching up to do to bring rates back to a more neutral level, and he believes time is of the essence.\n \n\n   \n  “If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” he told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. “I don’t see a reason to run that risk if I’m not concerned about inflation on the upside.”\n \n\n   \n  Additionally, Miran has said the ongoing mass deportations should take some pressure off the housing market, further lowering rates and resulting in “substantial disinflation.” He has also frequently downplayed the potential impacts of tariffs on consumer prices.\n \n\n   \n    Some pushback\n \n\n   \n  Miran, who earned a PhD in economics from Harvard University, is still widely seen as a serious economist, but his ideas have had some pushback.\n \n\n   \n  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was critical last month of Miran’s debut speech as a Fed governor.\n \n\n   \n  “I cannot remember an analytically weaker speech given before the New York Economic Club or given by a Fed governor,” Summers told Bloomberg. “If this was the best case for the radical reduction in interest rates that President Trump has been advocating, then that case is even weaker than I had previously supposed.”\n \n\n   \n  Some Wall Street economists also haven’t been impressed by Miran’s takes.\n \n\n   \n  “We find some of his arguments questionable, others incomplete and almost none persuasive,”Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients in late September.\n \n\n   \n  Miran’s distinct economic reasoning also doesn’t seem to have gained traction with his colleagues on the Fed’s rate-setting committee.\n \n\n   \n  Like other Trump appointees, such as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, Miran agrees that a weaker labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff. But neither Waller nor Bowman have voted for a half-point rate cut, nor have they suggested that the neutral rate is lower than widely understood.\n \n\n   \n  Fed Governor Lisa Cook, in  her first speech since Trump said he fired her ,  was asked last week how she views the interaction between lower immigration and housing inflation, which is a cornerstone of Miran’s economic views.\n \n\n   \n  She subtly rejected that premise, stating “when I’m thinking about immigration, I’m typically thinking about the labor market.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think that that’s the major role that I see in immigration policy,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/ups-crash-fleets-grounded-investigation-lawsuit","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"08:05:00-05:00","title":"FAA halts flights of MD-11 cargo planes and requires inspections after UPS plane crash leaves community in mourning","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A UPS MD-11 cargo plane crashed during takeoff at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky on November 4, 2025, killing at least 14 people and causing a massive fire that destroyed businesses, including Grade A Auto Parts.

Here’s what we know so far.\n \n\n   \n    MD-11s grounded ‘out of an abundance of caution’\n \n\n   \n  Shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, the cargo plane’s engine and the pylon, which supports the engine, fell off the left wing of UPS flight 2976 as it accelerated for takeoff, the NTSB said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have yet to determine why it happened, but operators are erring on the side of caution until answers emerge.\n \n\n   \n  “Out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of safety, we have made the decision to temporarily ground our MD-11,” UPS said in a statement. “Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.”\n \n\n   \n  McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft are used exclusively for cargo operations and make up about 9% of the UPS fleet. The company said it had contingency plans to temporarily operate without them.\n \n\n   \n  FedEx, the only other major US airline to operate the MD-11, will also ground them for “a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  The decisions come after recommendations from Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997.\n \n\n   \n  The UPS freighter that crashed was a  34-year-old jet.  While that may be considered old for a passenger plane, that’s not so unusual in the world of air cargo and there are no initial indications that the age of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was in any way a factor in the  fatal crash .\n \n\n   \n    NTSB is still investigating the cause\n \n\n   \n  The NTSB will release a preliminary report within 30 days, but it could be 18 to 24 months before the investigation concludes, according to  Jim Brauchle , an aviation attorney with law firm Motley Rice and former US Air Force navigator.\n \n\n   \n  The cockpit voice recorders and the engine and pylon that fell off the airplane’s wing have been moved to a secure facility, where they are being examined, NTSB investigator Todd Inman said during a news conference Friday.\n \n\n   \n  The  engine was found lying on the ground  and will help investigators determine what may have caused the crash, according to CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s a huge clue and does give the (NTSB) a pretty good idea of what started this all off,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  The  engine coming off the plane  before the final impact and the fireball that followed suggest an “uncontained engine failure, meaning the engine spews out parts,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  It’s possible pieces flying off of one failing engine could have impacted other key parts of the plane, and the engine likely ruptured the wing fuel tank when it ripped from the plane, she added.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators have also recovered two hours of clear cockpit audio from the UPS cargo plane that confirmed the crew completed standard checklists and takeoff briefings, Inman said, before what he described what began as an “uneventful” takeoff roll.\n \n\n   \n  The transcript of the recording will be released to the public in several months, once most of the agency’s reports are completed, Inman said.\n \n\n   \n  Inman also confirmed the aircraft had recently undergone a heavy maintenance check in San Antonio, and clarified earlier reports of the plane reaching 475 feet were inaccurate. Data now shows the jet only climbed to about 100 feet above ground level before crashing.\n \n\n   \n  “The maintenance will be the big issue — what exactly was done to the aircraft, who did it, what parts were replaced, what procedures were followed, and who inspected the work,” Schiavo said.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators will be particularly interested in which engines or other parts may have been removed or replaced during maintenance, she added.\n \n\n   \n    A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of impacted victims and businesses\n \n\n   \n  Residents living near the crash site and local businesses facing significant economic losses who suffered emotional distress have filed a lawsuit against UPS, Boeing and General Electric.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs accuse the companies of recklessness and negligence, which “upended the lives and livelihoods” of many in the Louisville community, according to the complaint, filed in US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit alleges the Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-11 crash was preventable and the defendants must be held accountable for the “trauma, fear and uncertainty” their actions have caused, according to the complaint, filed by the law firm Morgan & Morgan.\n \n\n   \n  A Boeing spokesperson told CNN the company has no comment about the lawsuit but said it is supporting NTSB’s investigation and extends its condolences to the families and friends of the victims.\n \n\n   \n  “Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved,” a UPS spokesperson told CNN. “We do not comment on pending litigation.”\n \n\n   \n  General Electric did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n \n\n   \n  “This tragedy has needlessly shattered the lives of many in the Louisville community,” attorneys Mike Morgan, Rene Rocha, and Tanner Shultz said in a statement. “We are committed to uncovering the truth and will stop at nothing to achieve justice.”\n \n\n   \n  The suit also highlights the troubled safety record of Boeing’s MD-11 aircraft, calling it one of the most accident-prone commercial planes still in service. The filing cites past crashes, including a fatal 2009 FedEx MD-11 crash in Tokyo, and alleges similar design flaws or defects in Boeing’s MD-11 may have caused or contributed to the November 4 crash.\n \n\n   \n  The plaintiffs argued UPS’ own modifications to convert the plane into a cargo model could have played a role. The complaint further points to GE’s CF6 engines, which have been involved in multiple catastrophic incidents, as another potential factor in the disaster.\n \n\n   \n    Loved ones of missing victims are losing hope\n \n\n   \n  The fire came first with a plume of red flames and black smoke twisting through the sunset. Then came the screams.\n \n\n   \n  Officials don’t believe it’s likely there are any more survivors, and the number of fatalities linked to the crash is expected to stand at 14, Mayor Craig Greenberg announced Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  Search and rescue teams have located 13 victims, matching the number of missing persons reports related to the crash filed with police, Greenberg said in a video posted to  X . The 14th victim died at the hospital Saturday, he added.\n \n\n   \n  The plane crashed into Grade A Auto Parts, an automotive part and recycling facility, where three employees  are still unaccounted for. \n \n\n   \n  “It looked like really hell’s fury around her,” CEO Sean Garber recalled, describing a video he saw showing a “huge fireball” engulfing his business as his employees screamed and ran from the flames.\n \n\n   \n  Among the missing employees is John Loucks, a 52-year-old beloved uncle who worked on and off at Grade A Auto Parts for at least a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s scary really,” his nephew Justin Loucks told CNN. “Did he die on impact? Did he land in the woods somewhere?”\n \n\n   \n  “We were told (DNA testing) could take weeks or even longer,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Three crew members aboard the freight plane are believed to be among those found dead, Kentucky officials said. UPS identified them Thursday as Capt. Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt and International Relief Officer Capt. Dana Diamond.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Aaron Cooper, Lauren Mascarenhas, Isabel Rosales, Dalia Faheid, Jason Morris and Taylor Galgano contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/trump-foreign-leader-meetings","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"06:00:00-04:00","title":"Trump meets with more foreign leaders as GOP grapples with election losses and a shuttered government","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, President Donald Trump continues to host a wide array of foreign leaders, including Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, as part of a foreign policy strategy aimed at diplomacy and global influence.

A day later, the 38th day of the government shutdown, Hungary’s authoritarian prime minister came for lunch. On Monday, Syria’s president will make a historic visit to the White House.\n \n\n   \n  Among the topics the president spent time in public discussing last week: migration policies in Europe, commercial activity on the Caspian Sea, South Africa’s position in the G20, and the energy limitations presented by Hungary’s geography (“They don’t have the advantage of having sea,” he explained). He  hasn’t met  with congressional leadership about the record-long shutdown or offered any constructive solutions, instead digging in on the  filibuster elimination  that’s a nonstarter on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Ten months into his new administration, Trump has placed much of his attention on foreign affairs as he works to end conflicts, secure trade agreements and burnish a presidential peacemaking legacy. World leaders pass through the White House weekly, and the president has made three foreign trips just since September.\n \n\n   \n  It’s an approach that’s yielded successes, particularly in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire the president helped broker in Gaza. But as Republicans look to improve their prospects a year out from critical midterm elections, even some of Trump’s allies are beginning to wonder whether his attention abroad is obscuring the “America First” identity he’s spent years building.\n \n\n   \n  “You’re not going to convince them to go to the polls and vote by bailing out Argentina. And you’re not going to convince them to go to the polls and vote by continuing to fund foreign wars and foreign countries and foreign causes,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said last week on CNN. “You’re going to get them to go to the polls and vote, when you show up to work, and actually fix the problems that they face every single day.”\n \n\n   \n  The Georgia Republican has of late become more critical of some of Trump’s tactics, though she still describes herself as a stalwart supporter. Yet she is hardly alone in questioning whether his attention might be better focused at home, and in particular on the economy, rather than on his endeavors overseas.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s having a lot of success with world leaders, and they all respect him,” one Trump adviser said. “He’s focusing where he’s successful. But people know it doesn’t motivate anyone to vote.”\n \n\n   \n  Even Vice President JD Vance said last week that domestic matters should be a priority.\n \n\n   \n  “We need to focus on the home front,” he wrote on X the day after the election, adding: “We’re going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that’s the metric by which we’ll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n  The White House said Trump remained focused on cost questions.\n \n\n   \n  “Addressing Joe Biden’s inflation crisis has been a Day One priority for President Trump, who has already lowered prices for essentials like gas and eggs and cooled inflation to an annualized 2.5 percent rate — half the average inflation rate under Joe Biden,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “As the Administration’s robust economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can count on real wages continuing to increase, investments to make and hire in American continuing to flow in, and for Joe Biden’s lackluster economy to firmly become a distant memory.”\n \n\n   \n  A  CNN survey  released last week found only 1% of adult Americans named foreign policy as the most important issue facing the country; 47% said the economy and cost of living. Trump’s international efforts also did not receive high marks: 56% of respondents said his foreign policy decisions have hurt America’s standing in the world.\n \n\n   \n  Still, the world stage has become something of a welcome respite for the president from the humdrum realities of governing in Washington. Last month in Asia, the president was met with extravagant welcomes, gold gifts and rapid-pace announcement of new trade and peace deals. It was a stark contrast to the atmosphere he left and returned to: gridlocked discussions to reopen the shuttered federal government and growing voter anxiety about an uncertain economy.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has argued Trump’s global efforts are intertwined with his domestic ambitions. His tariff regime, which forms the backbone of his foreign policy, is intended in part to restore American manufacturing and reduce the US trade deficit.\n \n\n   \n  But in many ways, the criticism from the president’s allies is not about policy but about the impression Trump is spending far more time meeting foreign leaders or flying around the world than he is attending to economic problems at home.\n \n\n   \n  “Keeping him on nonstop tours around the world and nonstop meetings with foreign countries’ leaders is not America First. It’s just not,” Greene said. “I think domestic policy should be the most important issue that the president and the Republican-controlled House and Senate are working on, and that showed up in the election on Tuesday.”\n \n\n   \n  It is not uncommon for presidents, in their second terms, to turn attention to foreign policy. Without the burden of another reelection campaign, leaders often have a freer hand to focus on issues not necessarily front of mind for voters. Diplomacy can also be an easier occupation for a lame-duck commander in chief than sweeping domestic efforts, which often require congressional buy-in.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential legacies are often forged in the drama of the world stage, such as Ronald Reagan demanding Mikhail Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall or Barack Obama making a historic visit to Cuba. Trump, too, views his peacemaking efforts as critical to his place in the history books, according to aides, and he openly jockeys for a Nobel Peace Price.\n \n\n   \n  For Trump, however, the dynamics of his second term are different. He ran for president last year not as an incumbent, but as a challenger seeking to oust the sitting commander in chief. His campaign focused heavily on promises of an economic turnaround for struggling Americans, not the pursuit of a Nobel prize.\n \n\n   \n  When the candidate did make promises about foreign affairs, he often set the bar unattainably high. His pledge to end the war in Ukraine within a day of taking office proved impossible to meet, and he later claimed it was made facetiously.\n \n\n   \n  Since returning to office in January, Trump has hosted at the White House the leaders of Hungary, Ukraine, Argentina, Finland, Canada, Israel, Turkey, Poland, Korea, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Philippines, Bahrain, Congo, Rwanda, Pakistan, Germany, South Africa, Norway, Italy, El Salvador, Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, India, Jordan and Japan. Some have visited multiple times.\n \n\n   \n  He’s also convened summits of leaders from Europe, Africa and Central Asia, and gathered Arab and Muslim leaders at the United Nations.\n \n\n   \n  This year, he’s traveled abroad to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Israel, Egypt, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea.\n \n\n   \n  While the pace of meetings and travel is steady, it does not put Trump on a more rapid pace than his predecessors, or even himself. During his first year in office in 2017, Trump received 35 heads of state for official visits. In 2013, the first year of Obama’s second term, 34 foreign leaders came to the United States for official visits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump visited 13 countries in 2017. And Obama visited 12 in 2013.\n \n\n   \n  President Joe Biden traveled at a slower pace during his first year in office, as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic lingered, and in his final year, as he tried to turn attention to his reelection campaign. But the intervening years saw him visit roughly the same number of countries as Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Biden, too, struggled to balance domestic matters with the two foreign conflicts that came to consume the end of his presidency. And one point in 2023, he estimated 75% of his job was spent dealing with foreign leaders and traveling the world. Aides later blamed intensive foreign travel for the disastrous debate performance that precipitated his withdrawal from the race.\n \n\n   \n  Other presidents have also found that focusing abroad — at the expense of addressing Americans’ economic pain — yields little political return. George H.W. Bush oversaw the end of the Cold War and the first Gulf War, but voters were more concerned with high unemployment and inflation — a disparity his rival Democratic Bill Clinton seized upon when he ran and defeated him.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/politics/aca-enrollment-premiums-increase-impact","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-05:00","title":"Skyrocketing ACA Premiums Force Enrollees to Make Tough Decisions","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies in 2025 is causing a surge in health insurance premiums, with average increases of 26% and premiums more than doubling for many enrollees.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Late last month, Elizabeth Wick got the email she had been dreading. Her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, told her that the monthly premiums for her Affordable Care Act policy  would soar  to $1,380 next year, up from $862.\n \n\n   \n  Wick, 57, currently gets $400 in  federal premium subsidies , which makes the monthly cost of her health insurance more manageable. But the Arlington, Texas, resident is not counting on that assistance for next year since she also received a letter from the federal Obamacare exchange saying she likely won’t be eligible for any help in 2026 if the enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  The  rising health insurance rates  and lapsing subsidies could upend Wick’s life. A therapist who focuses on sexual assault survivors, she launched a full-time private practice earlier this year but depends on Obamacare coverage since she has preexisting medical conditions. However, having to pay three times her current tab is unaffordable and could force her to give up her practice and find a job that offers health benefits.\n \n\n   \n  “Health insurance will determine what my life will look like, whether or not I can continue with my private practice,” said Wick, who ruminates over the situation before she goes to sleep and when she’s out for her daily walks.\n \n\n   \n    Agonizing tradeoffs\n \n\n   \n  Wick is among the millions of Americans with Affordable Care Act policies who must contend with the looming lapse of the enhanced subsidies. The increased cost of coverage can lead to agonizing trade-offs for many enrollees, including cutting back on other necessities, trying to avoid getting care or forgoing health insurance entirely.\n \n\n   \n  The issue is  at the center  of the stalemate on Capitol Hill, which has led to a record federal government shutdown. Democrats say they will only support a federal funding package for fiscal year 2026 if it also extends the more generous assistance, but Republicans say they will only negotiate after the government reopens.\n \n\n   \n  The enhanced subsidies have enabled many lower-income Americans to obtain coverage with no or very low monthly premiums and broadened eligibility for assistance to many middle-class consumers. Obamacare’s original subsidies, which are part of the 2010 health reform law and are not expiring, are only available to those who earn less than four times the federal poverty level, or about $63,000 for an individual and $129,000 for a family of four.\n \n\n   \n  Enacted by a Democratic-led Congress during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, the extra assistance helped spur a record 24 million people to sign up for Obamacare policies this year, with many new enrollees hailing from states that voted for President Donald Trump in 2024. More than 90% of policyholders receive subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  The expiring beefed-up subsidies, along with rising health care costs, contributed to insurers hiking rates by 26%, on average, for next year, according to federal data.\n \n\n   \n  But what enrollees will actually pay will be far higher because they won’t have the additional aid. Premium payments will more than double, on average, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\n \n\n   \n  Certain policyholders will be hit harder than others. Those with incomes just above the poverty level will go from paying $0 or nearly $0 in premiums to being on the hook for a few hundred dollars a year, said Cynthia Cox, KFF’s director of the Program on the ACA. Nearly half of enrollees are in this group.\n \n\n   \n  “For them, it’s a lot of money,” Cox said. “It may be a big enough increase that they feel they can’t afford it.”\n \n\n   \n  Also, enrollees in their 50s and early 60s, who already pay a lot for coverage, will have to shell out even more. An older couple making $85,000 a year could see their premiums skyrocket by more than $20,000 a year, she said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s hard to imagine that many of them will be able to afford to continue that coverage,” Cox said.\n \n\n   \n  That’s the situation that Sunni Montgomery finds herself in.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I have fought this so hard. I want to live.’\n \n\n   \n  At 63, Montgomery is facing a relentless battle with lung cancer. Since 2022, she’s undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, relying on her ACA marketplace plan to cover the mounting costs. Thanks to enhanced subsidies, her premium this year was $541 a month — just manageable with Social Security Disability and a part-time job.\n \n\n   \n  But next year, without those subsidies, she says her premium is set to soar to $1,758 a month — far outside her budget.\n \n\n   \n  “I have to face the reality that I am probably going to become a late-stage cancer patient who’s uninsured,” Montgomery said. “I have fought this so hard. I want to live.”\n \n\n   \n  Now on daily oxygen and getting scans every three months, she says she’s at high risk for recurrence. Without insurance, those lifesaving treatments will be out of reach.\n \n\n   \n  “If I’m not getting scans and we don’t know if something’s recurred, then what that can mean is the end of me,” said Montgomery, who is racing to squeeze in every scan and checkup she can before her coverage expires.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Chris and Donna Vetter have made the agonizing decision to drop their health insurance, saying they simply cannot afford it.\n \n\n   \n  Chris, 62, is a retired federal worker, and Donna, 60, runs a small medical billing business. They relied on their ACA plan — reduced to $401 a month by the enhanced subsidies — to manage Donna’s asthma and Chris’ atrial fibrillation. But next year, their premium is set to skyrocket to $1,975 a month — nearly half their income.\n \n\n   \n  They pored over options on the ACA marketplace but say even the cheapest plans hovered near $1,000 a month. Yet those policies “have huge deductibles, big copays, and they don’t cover a lot, so effectively it’s like not having insurance anyways,” Chris said.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the Vetters, who live in rural Somerset County, Maryland, are bracing for a future without coverage — expecting to cancel appointments, forgo screenings, skip medications, and cross their fingers that disaster doesn’t strike.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m just scared, and I don’t know what to do,” Donna said. “If anything should go wrong — God forbid a car accident, heart attack, cancer — we’ll have nothing.”\n \n\n   \n    Planning for the unexpected\n \n\n   \n  Soaring premiums have also left Alison and her husband, Chris, who live in Carson City, Nevada, debating over what to do about their Obamacare coverage. They began buying policies on the exchange three years ago, when Chris, a former police officer, had to retire after a serious injury.\n \n\n   \n  This year, they are paying only $183 a month after nearly $1,350 in subsidies. But next year, their policy will cost $936 after some subsidies. They are contemplating buying a less expensive plan with a much higher deductible, though that will force them to think twice about going to urgent care or the emergency room.\n \n\n   \n  “Just to even be in a situation where you have to think about, well, do I really need it? Do I really need that medication? Do I really need to go to the urgent care? God forbid, do I really need to go to the ER or can I, for lack of a better word, suck it up?” said Alison, who asked that only her first name be used because of her husband’s former profession. “I mean those are all decisions that we’re going to be forced to have to make.”\n \n\n   \n  Younger Americans are also grappling with the increased costs.\n \n\n   \n  Kris McKegney, 23, now pays $300 a month after subsidies for a higher-end plan with only a $3,000 annual deductible. Keeping the same plan would cost him $1,250 a month because he doesn’t expect to qualify for any assistance. That amount is out of the question, said the self-employed accountant.\n \n\n   \n  One option he’s considering is signing up for a $400-a-month catastrophic plan, which would require him to pay for all his medications, doctor visits and therapy appointments. Another is enrolling in a policy with an $850 monthly premium and a $10,000 deductible that would provide more coverage. But the latter would entail dipping into his retirement fund, pausing his efforts to save for a down payment on a house and raising rates on his clients, which are mostly nonprofit organizations.\n \n\n   \n  A Vermont resident, McKegney said health care is important to him because he is transgender. The battle on Capitol Hill over the enhanced subsidies, also known as advanced premium tax credits, makes him feel “degraded.”\n \n\n   \n  “The tax credits have helped millions of people access health care, and it seems very cruel to then take that away,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The enhanced subsidies’ looming expiration led Nolan LeRoux and Emily Clute to contemplate drastic measures to retain at least some assistance. The couple, both 35, were set to get married on Saturday but have considered not filing their license after the ceremony. That’s because they are more likely to qualify for Obamacare’s original subsidies as individuals than as a married couple — the income threshold for a couple is less than double that of a single person.\n \n\n   \n  Otherwise, the Bethlehem, New York, residents are looking at paying more than $1,360 per month next year for coverage, nearly double the total of what they’d pay as individuals for the same plan with some assistance. If the enhanced subsidies are extended, they would be eligible for more aid, even as a married couple.\n \n\n   \n  Since they aren’t comfortable going without insurance, the couple may end up working more to help cover the cost. He is a barber, and she is a tattoo artist. But they aren’t happy about having to spend more time apart as newlyweds to pay for higher premiums. What’s more, the higher tab would also weigh on their honeymoon plans, dampening any thought of going to California.\n \n\n   \n  Ultimately, though, the stress of not having health insurance would be greater than the concern of how to pay for it since anything could happen, like being hit by a drunk driver, LeRoux said.\n \n\n   \n  “There are not many things health care-wise that are particularly affordable,” he said. “It’d be a lot of stress because I don’t know exactly how we would pay for a medical bill that was in the five figures.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/russian-satellite-spying-explainer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"04:20:00-05:00","title":"UK and Germany Accuse Russia of Threatening Their Satellites","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Germany and the United Kingdom have jointly accused Russia and China of escalating threats to Western space assets through satellite surveillance, jamming, and potential kinetic attacks.

Here’s what that means \n       \n  By Lauren Kent, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:20 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Germany and the United Kingdom have warned of the growing threat posed by Russian and Chinese  space satellites , which have been regularly spotted spying on satellites used by Western powers.\n \n\n   \n  The countries have in recent weeks highlighted frequent instances of  Russia  stalking, jamming and interfering with their satellites in space.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia’s actions, especially in space, pose a fundamental threat to us all. A threat we can no longer ignore,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius  told a Berlin conference  of space industry leaders in September.\n \n\n   \n  Targeting communications satellites can impact things like satellite imagery, telecoms and broadband satellite internet access. Disrupting navigation and positioning systems can impact military operations as well as civil aviation, according to the global think tank RAND.\n \n\n   \n  The warnings come in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now well into its third year. Ukrainian officials say Moscow has increased its level of cooperation with China, with Beijing conducting satellite reconnaissance of Ukrainian territory on its behalf.\n \n\n   \n  Here is what officials and experts say about the satellite threats in space.\n \n\n   \n    What has Russia been doing?\n \n\n   \n  Pistorius noted that two Russian reconnaissance satellites were recently spotted tracking two IntelSat satellites, which are used by the German Armed Forces and its allies. IntelSat is a commercial satellite services provider whose fleet is used by governments and companies in the US and Europe.\n \n\n   \n  “Russia and China have rapidly expanded their space warfare capabilities in recent years: They can jam, blind, manipulate, or kinetically destroy satellites,” Pistorius added, announcing a multi-billion-dollar boost in funding for German space programs.\n \n\n   \n  The head of the UK Space Command also sounded the alarm, saying that Russian satellites are stalking British assets in space, as well as jamming them on a “weekly” basis.\n \n\n   \n  “They’ve got payloads on board that can see our satellites and are trying to collect information from them,” Major General Paul Tedman told the BBC last month. Jamming is conducted using ground-based infrastructure. Russia has spent years developing electronic warfare capabilities amid the war in Ukraine.\n \n\n   \n  Separately, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte once again warned this year of Russia’s plans to develop  nuclear weapons in space  to disable and destroy satellites.\n \n\n   \n  Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space. But Russia also vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for member states to not develop space-based nuclear weapons in 2024. China abstained from voting.\n \n\n   \n    How does satellite ‘spying’ work and how is it detected?\n \n\n   \n  In general, it’s relatively simple for space forces to detect and locate foreign satellites, but it’s difficult to determine their exact capabilities and intentions.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities make assumptions about the intent of Russian satellites based on where the satellite is in space, what else it’s near and historical patterns of what similar satellites have done, according to expert Clayton Swope, the deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, DC.\n \n\n   \n  For example, if a Russian satellite lingers for a long period of time near a European communications satellite, authorities can infer that it’s there to spy.\n \n\n   \n  Experts believe the Russian satellites that got close to the two IntelSat satellites used in part by Germany were there to intercept signals.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, in lower orbits, Russian satellites have previously tested “things that look like weapons and fired projectiles,” Swope told CNN. Authorities can identify satellites that look similar to those equipped with projectiles to determine that they are a physical threat to other countries’ assets.\n \n\n   \n  “The Russians have a history of having those types of satellites shadowing other satellites in a way that people might think it’s a sleeper cell, waiting to strike at a moment’s notice,” Swope said.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s very hard to distinguish between a threat in the sense of a weapon and the threat in the sense of intelligence collection,” he added. “Sometimes you really are guessing a lot about what the capabilities of a satellite are as well as the intentions of the operator.”\n \n\n   \n  The Russian space agency has previously downplayed the danger of its weapons tests in space.\n \n\n   \n    How long has the threat from Russia existed?\n \n\n   \n  Germany and the UK are just the latest countries to sound the alarm. The United States and France first warned more than a decade ago that Russian satellites appeared to be spying and collecting information on their assets, including on commercially run satellites.\n \n\n   \n  The US Department of Defense said in 2015 that a Russian military satellite had parked itself near two Intelsat satellites, prompting the US to contact Moscow about its movements, which many at the time described as  “mysterious.” \n \n\n   \n  Then in 2017, after France and Italy jointly launched an intelligence satellite, Russian satellites were soon getting close to it to take a look, according to Juliana Suess, a security policy researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).\n \n\n   \n  “So, these kinds of behaviors are not entirely new, but I think also need to be seen in the context of Ukraine, and to be seen in the context of the  airspace violations  that we see Russia conducting with regard to NATO airspace,” Suess told CNN of the recent reports of satellite spying and interference. “All of these things ought to be seen in the broader context.”\n \n\n   \n    Is China also posing a threat?\n \n\n   \n  China is just as much of a threat as Russia, if not more so, experts told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Although the threats from Russia are more pressing for Europe due to their proximity, “the much bigger space power is obviously China,” Suess said. Analysts have noted some sophisticated Chinese maneuvers in space aimed at getting close to other satellites, “at just incredibly high speeds and with precision that I think has really raised some eyebrows in the West.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of China’s capabilities have raised international concerns, according to the SWP analyst. For example, China has tested a satellite with a robotic arm that can shift other satellites into a different orbit.\n \n\n   \n  China also has “a lot more money to conduct themselves in space,” Suess said. “We’re not going to see much more space growth out of Russia at the moment. Their resources are far too stretched for that.”\n \n\n   \n  Beijing’s activities in space are very active and their objectives are more opaque, according to Swope, the CSIS analyst.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t always know what they’re doing, and they’re doing a lot of different things that leave a lot of people scratching their heads,” Swope added.\n \n\n   \n    Is the European response adequate?\n \n\n   \n  Germany said it will budget up to €35 billion ($40.2 billion) over the next five years for space projects.\n \n\n   \n  “It is a big number, for sure. I think it also reflects that there’s a sort of political will to now catch up and, you know, really get things going,” Suess said. But she also stressed that the space race is an ongoing process, with no finish line in sight. “Europe as a whole has a lot to catch up on. Germany certainly has a lot to catch up on.”\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defense told CNN that its procurement measures relating to space will amount to around €1.9 billion ($2.2 billion) in 2025, “but will grow significantly in the coming years.”\n \n\n   \n  The UK government also announced a commitment to increase defense spending this year and a  strategic review  of British capabilities outlined that “greater attention must be given to the space and cyber and electromagnetic domains.” The UK announced in October that it is testing sensors to detect laser threats in space as part of measures to protect British satellites.\n \n\n   \n  But an analysis from the London-based think tank  Chatham House argued  that even greater near-term investment is needed, and that the strategic review failed to recognize how urgent the threats in space truly are, putting the country at risk of falling behind.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, France has “been very vocal about the need to have what they refer to as ‘bodyguard satellites,’ so, satellites whose job it is to protect other satellites,” Swope said. What those satellites will look like is an open question, he added, with development ongoing.\n \n\n   \n  The US still has a historic advantage in space after investing much more in recent years, analysts said. But European allies may benefit from that through cooperation under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other alliances.\n \n\n   \n  NATO declared in 2019 that space is an “operational domain” for the transatlantic alliance and years later announced that Article 5 would apply in space.  Article 5  is the principle that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all members. Analysts at RAND have argued, though, that  NATO needs to “throttle up”  on its space enterprise or risk falling short at a critical time.\n \n\n   \n  While falling behind is a real concern, particularly compared to China’s advances, there is also evidence that the Russia has not integrated its satellite systems into its military infrastructure as well as many other space powers.\n \n\n   \n  Suess cited an example of a Russian fighter jet downed in Ukraine that was found with a built-in Russian navigation system but also a commercial GPS taped to the dashboard. Analysts have also seen evidence that Russia is procuring commercial satellite imagery from the private market – an indication that its own capabilities are not up to scratch.\n \n\n   \n  “We have seen from anecdotal evidence in Ukraine that Russia does not have some sort of level of confidence that one would typically expect in their own systems,” Suess added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/europe/louvre-heist-weak-password-blunders-hackers-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"13:00:00Z","title":"Nuclear codes, voicemail hacks and businesses going bust.

bust. These are some of the biggest password blunders \n       \n  By Charlotte Reck, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:00 AM EST, Sun November 9, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 2014 security report resurfaced this week showing that the password for the server managing the CCTV network at the Louvre – Paris’ art museum which suffered immense financial loss after a  heist team  successfully  targeted historical jewels  last month – was, in fact, just  “LOUVRE.” \n \n\n   \n  But predictable passwords like these are concerningly common.\n \n\n   \n  Logging into social media accounts, shopping apps and subscriber platforms can be a laborious task that leaves many launching devices across the room in frustration and asking why it’s necessary to hire a crack team just to access a personal account.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps it’s time to consider the demand for 16-character combinations of letters, numbers and symbols to be more method than madness, and learn from the mistakes of the weak-password-makers who’ve gone before.\n \n\n   \n  Here are some examples of technological mishaps and infamous faux pas(swords):\n \n\n   \n    Colonial Pipeline blunder:\n \n\n   \n  In May 2021, one of the largest fuel pipeline systems in the United States was  paralyzed  when a cyberattack brought operations to an abrupt halt. At the time, the FBI said the hackers responsible belonged to criminal group Darkside, believed to be based in Russia.\n \n\n   \n  Colonial Pipeline said its network had been accessed via a compromised password that was linked to a disused virtual private networking account used for remote access. The account was not guarded by an extra layer of security known as multi-factor authentication.\n \n\n   \n  It is unclear how the attackers obtained the compromised credential. But the company claimed the password in question was not easily guessable, with CEO Joseph Blount telling a US Senate committee in June 2021:”It was a complicated password, I want to be clear on that. It was not a Colonial123-type password.” The shutdown remained in place until the company complied with a ransom demand, paying $4.4 million to end the attack.\n \n\n   \n  By the following year, the FBI had  recovered millions  of dollars extorted from Colonial Pipeline by Darkside.\n \n\n   \n    Zero chance forgetting the nuclear launch code:\n \n\n   \n  According to Bruce Blair, a former Air Force launch officer and nuclear policy expert, between 1962 and the mid-1970s the most powerful digits on the globe were simple – eight zeros.\n \n\n   \n  In a twist as absurd as Peter Sellers’ president declaring the War Room a place where gentlemen must not fight in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 dark comedy “Dr. Strangelove,” Blair claimed just eight zeros separated the US from launching a nuclear attack.\n \n\n   \n  Blair said a “two-man-rule,” which required two qualified crew members to be present at the location of the launch code, was considered the primary human safeguard, but the measure wasn’t always reliable. According to Blair, the two members on shift would often organize alternative sleeping rotas that left just one individual with a straightforward password and all the power.\n \n\n   \n  Eventually, the Strategic Air Command amended the system to include a unique enable code that transmitted to the launch crew from a higher authority. The change added further security steps to the process and, as Blair  said , “It no longer sufficed just to flip one switch.”\n \n\n   \n  The nuclear expert’s shocking revelation came decades after it was decided that solely punching in eight zeros might be a little lax when it comes to initiating nuclear war.\n \n\n   \n    A 158-year-old business tanked by hackers:\n \n\n   \n  Hundreds of jobs were lost when an unsuspecting transport company in eastern England was toppled by a hacking gang, British media reported.\n \n\n   \n  Northamptonshire business KNP was targeted in June 2023 by Akira, a group of hackers who gained access to the company’s system by guessing the password of an employee. Once inside, the hackers encrypted KNP’s data and locked its internal systems before demanding a ransom.\n \n\n   \n  Being unable to make the payment, the company’s data was lost, and the 158-year-old business went under.\n \n\n   \n  KNP’s director Paul Abbott admitted he never told the employee with the weak password that it was their information that was compromised and likely led to the company’s demise. “Would you want to know if it was you?” Abbott  told the BBC .\n \n\n   \n    Phone hacking scandal:\n \n\n   \n  Hugh Grant, Prince Harry and Sienna Miller were among the stars who fell victim to  phone hacking  during a scandal perpetrated by British tabloids that spanned several years.\n \n\n   \n  Formal inquiries began after complaints that personal information shared only in private realms was routinely exposed on the front pages of national newspapers, causing distress and compromising the safety of those targeted.\n \n\n   \n  Investigations found the voicemails of public figures were hacked by journalists and private investigators hired by publications who worked on the assumption that few people changed the default voicemail access code their handset came with. Simple combinations like 1111, 4444 and 1234 were used to gain access to the messages waiting in the inbox.\n \n\n   \n  The United Kingdom’s phone-hacking scandal led to the closure of the News Of The World’s in 2011, followed by an inquiry into the practises and ethics of the British press.\n \n\n   \n    A one-time hacker now an opposition party leader:\n \n\n   \n  As head of the opposition, the UK’s Conservative Party leader  Kemi Badenoch  spends a lot of time critiquing the current British government. But her record isn’t squeaky clean.\n \n\n   \n  Back in 2018, the politician confessed to hacking the official website of Labour peer Harriet Harman a decade earlier and changing the content to be pro-Conservative.\n \n\n   \n  But this was no mastermind crime – the password required to edit Harman’s website was, indeed, “Harriet Harman.”\n \n\n   \n  Badenoch, who was not a lawmaker at the time of the hack, has since apologized for what she called a “foolish prank.”\n \n\n   \n    Personal data of millions of UK voters vulnerable:\n \n\n   \n  From August 2021 through to 2022, cyber attackers gained access to computers containing Electoral Registers – lists of names and addresses of millions of voters across the UK, the country’s data privacy watchdog discovered.\n \n\n   \n  An investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said hackers accessed the system by imitating a legitimate user account. The ICO determined this possible because appropriate security measures were consistently missed.\n \n\n   \n  Software designed to fix security holes was not installed, and the company failed to enforce a policy that ensured employees used secure passwords. During inquiries, the ICO found 178 active email accounts using passwords identical or similar to those set by the organization’s IT desk when the account was activated.\n \n\n   \n  The Electoral Commission was formally reprimanded for their negligence. No evidence of data misuse was reported.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/trump-oval-office-event","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"20:24:00-05:00","title":"Images of Trump Appearing to Close His Eyes During Oval Office Event Spread Across Social Media","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Images of President Donald Trump appearing to close his eyes during an Oval Office announcement about cutting prices for weight-loss drugs went viral on social media, prompting criticism from political opponents like California Governor Gavin Newsom, who labeled Trump 'DOZY DON IS BACK.'

Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Images of Donald Trump appearing to close his eyes at an Oval Office announcement this week rocketed around social media this weekend, with the president’s opponents seizing on the footage to raise questions about Trump’s on-the-job performance.\n \n\n   \n  Trump was participating in an announcement Thursday  about cutting prices  for popular weight-loss drugs, speaking from behind the Resolute Desk alongside other officials.\n \n\n   \n  At moments, Trump’s eyes appeared closed, and at others he seemed to struggle to keep them open. He rubbed his eyes at points.\n \n\n   \n  The images drew swift criticism from Trump’s critics. The press office for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the president’s top foils, posted images from the event and wrote: “DOZY DON IS BACK.”\n \n\n   \n  White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CNN that “the President was not sleeping; in fact, he spoke throughout and took many questions from the press during this announcement which represents a historic reduction in prices for Americans on two drugs that help Americans struggling with diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other conditions. This announcement by President Trump will save a significant amount of money and countless American lives, and yet the failing, liberal media want to push a garbage narrative instead of covering it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump appears in public regularly and participates in lengthy question-and-answer sessions with reporters. Aides and Cabinet members routinely praise his stamina and describe receiving phone calls or messages from him at all hours.\n \n\n   \n  A day before Thursday’s event, Trump traveled to Miami for an economic speech that lasted more than an hour. He also completed a three-nation swing through Asia at the end of last month.\n \n\n   \n  Still, questions about Trump’s health have persisted since he took office as the oldest man ever inaugurated to the job. The 79-year-old president said last month that  he received an MRI  during a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center without saying why.\n \n\n   \n  Over the summer, the White House announced that doctors examined Trump for swelling in his legs and  diagnosed him  with chronic venous insufficiency. It’s a condition in which valves inside certain veins don’t work the way they should, which can allow blood to pool or collect in the veins.\n \n\n   \n  All presidents, at moments, have appeared tired in public. Even a much younger president like Barack Obama would occasionally rub fatigued eyes during long summits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has harshly criticized former President Joe Biden for a lack of vigor, labeling him “Sleepy Joe” in last year’s election and continuing to use the moniker. Biden, the oldest president in history, was also seen at moments closing his eyes during public events.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/trump-administration-supreme-court-snap-benefits","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-08","timeOfPublication":"20:37:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court lets Trump pause full SNAP payments for now","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court, led by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, temporarily paused a lower court order requiring the Trump administration to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for November 2025.

The decision, while temporary, could put at risk the full benefits for millions of Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to feed themselves and their families.\n \n\n   \n  The order does not resolve the underlying legal questions raised by the case – and the Trump administration has already committed to using the program’s contingency fund to partially pay benefits. Rather, Jackson’s “administrative stay” freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson is the justice assigned to handle emergency appeals from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n \n\n   \n  The legal fight over food stamps has emerged as a central pressure point between all three branches during the historically long government shutdown because it is one of the easiest to understand and most tangible impacts of that impasse so far. At stake is food assistance that nearly 42 million Americans rely on.\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear how the case will ultimately impact the billions of dollars spent in federal SNAP funding.\n \n\n   \n    Complying with the lower court\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration’s emergency request to the justices came hours after the USDA told states that it was  working to comply with the ruling to fully fund the program  that was issued a day earlier by US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island.\n \n\n   \n  This latest legal move has injected more uncertainty into whether food stamp recipients would see their full allotments anytime soon.\n \n\n   \n  The administration had made a similar emergency appeal to a Boston-based federal appeals court Friday morning, but the court had not yet weighed in by the time the USDA sent the guidance, which also said the process to make full funding for November available should be completed later on Friday. The appeals court, in a brief order Friday night, declined to put the payments on hold temporarily while it reviewed the case “as quickly as possible.”\n \n\n   \n  In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the administration said, “Such a funding lapse is a crisis. But it is a crisis occasioned by congressional failure and one that can only be solved through congressional action.”\n \n\n   \n  “The district court’s ruling,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court, “is untenable at every turn.”\n \n\n   \n  The administration moved to appeal McConnell’s order after he ruled on Thursday that the government had to provide full SNAP benefits for November, instead of issuing only partial benefits as he had mandated days earlier.\n \n\n   \n    Rushing to fund full benefits\n \n\n   \n  Before the latest legal twist, several states had rushed to start issuing full SNAP payments to their residents. But that has caused problems, according to the administration’s filing to the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Sauer told the court that Wisconsin immediately filed for 100% of its residents’ benefits to be placed on their electronic benefit transfer cards. But the USDA rejected the request because it had not yet had time to comply with McConnell’s order. That resulted in the state overdrawing its letter of credit by $20 million.\n \n\n   \n  Similarly, Kansas issued full benefits worth nearly $32 million to approximately 86,000 households in the state, Sauer said.\n \n\n   \n  These actions have hurt states that did not move quickly to issue benefits, he continued. They will be unable to receive funding to provide partial payments to their residents under McConnell’s prior order.\n \n\n   \n  Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly reacted to the Supreme Court’s action in a statement Friday night, saying, “Today, in accordance with a court’s order and after receiving guidance from the USDA, Kansas sent full November SNAP benefits to all eligible Kansans. These Kansans, most of them children, seniors or people with disabilities, were struggling to put food on their plates.”\n \n\n   \n  Other states have also promised beneficiaries would start receiving their full allotments as soon as Friday or over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Pennsylvania residents who should have already received their SNAP benefits this month will start seeing their full payments hit their electronic benefit transfer cards on Friday, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced at a press conference earlier in the day.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that by this evening, by midnight or so, that all of those individuals who were owed money over the first week or so of this month, who hadn’t gotten it from the federal administration, are going to get their money,” Shapiro said.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, a Shapiro spokesperson told CNN that state officials continue to prepare for the Supreme Court’s ultimate decision. Meanwhile, residents who received their benefits are able to spend them.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the governors of Maryland and New York said beneficiaries could expect to start seeing their benefits over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in appropriations for the government.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling last week that the agency must at least tap into contingency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The agency opted to  fund partial benefits , but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case raced back to McConnell earlier this week to argue that he should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\n \n\n   \n  “People have gone without for too long,” McConnell said during a hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  Under McConnell’s ruling, the government was required to transfer additional unused tariff revenue used to support child nutrition programs in order to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with more details.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97245","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:26:00-05:00","title":"Senate Approves Shutdown-Ending Legislation, Sending Bill to the House for a Vote","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 10, 2025, the U.S. Senate voted 60–40 to approve a continuing resolution to end a 41-day government shutdown, funding most federal operations through January 30, 2026, and fully funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 30, 2026.

the House for a vote \n         By Sam Gringlas \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 9:26 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         On the 41st day of a record-long government shutdown, the U.S. Senate voted 60 to 40 to approve a continuing resolution to reopen the government.  The measure  would fund much of the government through Jan. 30 and provide funding for some agencies through the end of next September. But the shutdown will not end right away. The U.S. House of Representatives must also pass   the legislation, which is not guaranteed, before President Donald Trump can sign it into law. Seven Democrats and one independent senator voted with nearly every Senate Republican to approve the stopgap funding bill after a more than monthlong impasse that resulted in missed paychecks for millions of federal workers, delayed food assistance benefits and air travel disruptions. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the sole GOP no vote.  Over the weekend, a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement to end the shutdown after holding a series of   on-again, off-again talks over the last several weeks. A procedural vote to advance a funding bill achieved the required 60 votes late Sunday night, setting up Monday's vote. The funding package includes language to reverse reductions in force of federal employees by the Trump Administration during the shutdown, protections against further layoffs through the end of January, backpay for federal employees and a trio of appropriations bills, including one that will fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026. A deal without Democrats' health care demands But the deal does not include an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums that are set to expire later this year. Most Democrats have refused to vote for a funding measure that did not include a concrete path to preserve the subsidies. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Sunday that he would hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the expiring subsidies. Thune has said throughout the shutdown that Republicans would only negotiate on the subsidies once the government was open. \"This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren't willing to do,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., wrote in a statement. \"Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don't, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will.\" But the majority of Senate Democrats disagreed that this was the best deal they could get, doubting that Republicans would agree to extend the subsidies without the pressure of an ongoing shutdown. After Democratic victories on Election Night last week, some senators said it was a mistake to back down. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"As long as there is still any time left to reverse the MAGA health care hike, I believe we must do everything we can to force Republicans to the negotiating table,\" wrote Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee that negotiated the three full-year funding bills. The full-year funding measures include money for agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs and the legislative branch. Those are just three of the 12 appropriations bills Congress needs to pass before the continuing resolution would run out again at the end of January. On to the House House leadership alerted members Monday morning that they would have 36-hours notice to return to Capitol Hill for a vote. The House has not conducted official business since the chamber passed its version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. While Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has held near-daily press conferences at the Capitol, many rank-and-file have not been in for weeks. \"At the very moment that they do that final vote, I will call all House members to return as quickly as possible,\" Johnson told reporters Monday and, noting the ongoing shutdown-related air travel delays, told members, \"You need to begin right now returning to the Hill.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Moving the measure through the House could require some arm-twisting. Many Democrats have indicated they will not support the deal, and some hard-line Republicans may not be inclined to vote for it either. But Johnson projected confidence Monday that the measure can pass and said Trump is ready to sign it. The speaker, though, has so far declined to promise an ACA vote in the House should a bill pass the Senate. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604664","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:19:00-05:00","title":"Trump Slams Air Traffic Controllers Who Called Out During Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, air traffic controllers were forced to work without pay for over 40 days, leading to widespread flight cancellations and delays.

air traffic controllers who called out of work during the government shutdown, during which they were forced to stay on the job without pay. Trump said in a  post on Truth Social  Monday morning that he was \"NOT HAPPY\" with controllers who took time off. \"All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!! Anyone who doesn't will be substantially 'docked,'\" he wrote. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Federal Aviation Administration had been contending with a shortage of air traffic controllers since well before the shutdown began, but the crisis deepened when the government closed and controllers received a partial paycheck and then no pay at all.. Some have taken on second jobs, while others have called in sick. Controllers are set to miss their second full paycheck this week. In a statement to NPR, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said, \"This nation's air traffic controllers have been working without pay for over 40 days. The vast majority of these highly trained and skilled professionals continue to perform one of the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world, despite not being compensated. Many are working six-day weeks and ten-hour days without any pay.\" \"These unsung heroes, who report for duty to safely guide this country's passengers and cargo to their destinations, deserve our praise. They have certainly earned it.\" Meanwhile, Trump called controllers who took no time off during the longest shutdown in U.S. history \"GREAT PATRIOTS\" and said he would recommend giving them each a $10,000 bonus. He said any controllers who wanted to quit shouldn't hesitate, but would receive \"NO payment or severance of any kind!\" and would be \"quickly replaced by true Patriots.\" (In fact, one reason for the shortage is that  it takes years to train and certify  new controllers.) \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a subsequent  post on X , Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy praised \"those who have worked throughout the shutdown\" and said he would work with Congress to \"reward your commitment.\" Others offered sharp criticism of Trump's comments. \"The President wouldn't last five minutes as an air traffic controller,\" former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg  said in a post on X , \"and after everything they've been through - and the way this administration has treated them from Day One - he has no business s****ing on them now.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Last week, the  FAA announced  it would reduce flights by up to 10% at 40 of the busiest airports in the country, starting with a 4% reduction put in place on Friday.

There were more than 4,500 cancellations and 18,000 delays at airports across the U.S., according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. At Philadelphia International Airport, Phill Hicks' flight to West Palm Beach, Fla., was canceled and rebooked twice on Sunday.

Tovia Smith, Chandelis Duster, Jennifer Ludden \n        \n           Updated Monday, November 10, 2025 • 12:12 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The Trump administration has notified the U.S. Supreme Court that it still wants to fight a lower court ruling requiring full SNAP benefits be paid for November. The move comes after an appeals court late Sunday refused another government attempt to deny full funding for the nation's largest anti-hunger program. The administration's appeal to the high court over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program comes despite new efforts to end the federal shutdown, which would render the issue moot. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At issue is an order from a federal judge in Rhode Island, to increase SNAP payments from the 65% the government says it can afford to 100% of what SNAP recipients are entitled to. In its ruling, the appeals court said the harm from denying millions of people food aid \"would be immense,\" and it repeated the lower court finding that the funding gap could have been avoided. \"The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,\" the appeals court said. The federal judge in Rhode Island, John J. McConnell Jr., had accused the government of delaying payment for \"political purposes.\" The chaos of moves and counter-moves has left states scrambling and heads spinning, and many SNAP enrollees remain uncertain how much of their benefit to expect for November, and when it will come. On Friday, after the administration said it would send full payments (even as it appealed the order to do so), a number of states immediately started sending out that money. Around the country, some participants started getting it on the debit-like cards they use to buy groceries. Then the  Supreme Court late Friday  granted a request to temporarily pause those full payments while the appeals court considered the issue more fully. Adding to the confusion, Trump administration officials on Saturday directed states to \"immediately undo\" any actions they have made to fully fund SNAP, and only pay 65%. In a statement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said  such payments were \"unauthorized ,\" and threatened states that they may end up having to cover those costs themselves, and facing financial penalties.    Rhode Island is one of several states that had already sent full benefits to SNAP recipients before the Supreme Court temporarily halted full payments. In a statement Sunday, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee railed against President Trump, saying he \"intentionally created chaos for states across the country — playing games with people's ability to feed their families, weaponizing hunger, and gaslighting the American people. It's inhumane.\" McKee said he was working on contingency options \"to protect Rhode Islanders against President Trump's volatility.\" At the same time, Rhode Island is among some two dozen states, who sought and obtained temporary protection from federal judge in Massachusetts. A hearing on that issue is set for Monday afternoon. In court papers, the states said they feared that the federal government \"may attempt to recoup funds from the States that the States' residents have used to feed themselves and their families.\" That could amount to hundreds of million dollars, they said, and would \"risk catastrophic operational disruptions for the States, with a consequent cascade of harms for their residents.\" Trump administration officials did not respond to requests for comment. But over the weekend, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins  took to X to blame Democrats  for the lapse in benefits, and railed against \"activist judges\" who have ordered \"reckless and unconstitutional legal maneuvers\" to force funding that Congress didn't appropriate. Speaking to Fox News, Rollins borrowed language from anti-Trump activists. \"It's interesting, the 'No Kings' rally, where they said 'we don't want a King in America,'\" Rollins said. \"Except now they want a king who can create money out of the clear blue sky.\" Meanwhile, SNAP recipients remain in limbo, as do the organizations that serve them. The Facing Hunger Foodbank in Huntington, W.V., has tripled the volume of food distributions that are usual this time of year, according to CEO Cynthia Kirkhart. People are struggling, she says, and all the uncertainty has just exacerbated their pain. \"The news comes out that we are going to get SNAP benefits. Then, we aren't going to get SNAP benefits. This is much worse. Folks get their hopes built up and then they crash. It's a lot,\" Kirkhart sighs. \"We can do better.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604293","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:48:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Declines to Revisit Gay Marriage Decision","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by former Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the 2015 Obergefell v.

The challenge to the court's 2015 ruling came from Kim Davis, the former Kentucky clerk who refused to issue same-sex licenses after the court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. In the aftermath of her refusal, Davis was jailed for acting in contempt of court and lost her clerk re-election. A jury also ordered her to pay $360,000 to a couple who she refused to marry. Davis attempted to get out of paying this verdict by additionally requesting that the court assert that she has a First Amendment religious protection from liability for her actions. The court declined her petition without comment. Davis has long argued that religious liberties conflict with Obergefell.  \"If ever there was a case of exceptional importance, the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it,\" she argued in her  petition  before the court. She is not alone in wanting to challenge the legality of same-sex marriage. According to  Lambda Legal , which advocates for gay rights, in this year alone at least nine states have entertained bills or resolutions criticizing Obergefell or have sought to limit marriage to heterosexual couples. On Oct. 24, the Supreme Court of Texas  adopted language  allowing judges to refuse to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies due to religious beliefs.  In his concurring opinion in the case that overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Justice Clarence Thomas  expressly stated  that the Supreme Court should reconsider its stances on birth control, same-sex marriage, and same-sex intimacy. Had the Supreme Court decided to hear Davis' case and later overturn Obergefell, same-sex marriage would still be protected on the federal level. In 2022, former President Joe Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act, which repeals the Defense of Marriage Act and recognizes the legitimacy of same-sex and interracial marriages. If Obergefell was overturned, however, individual states could refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. The court's decision to not hear Davis's petition means that the constitutionality of same-sex marriage is reaffirmed, at least for now. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604157","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:08:00Z","title":"Flesh wins 2025 Booker Prize: 'We had never read anything quite like it'","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Szalay’s novel *Flesh* has won the 2025 Booker Prize, a major literary award recognizing excellence in English-language fiction.

      Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —President Trump has announced that no U.S. officials will attend the G20 Summit hosted by South Africa – the current rotating chair of the group of major world economies – in Johannesburg later this month, citing \"human rights\" concerns. Vice President JD Vance had been due to attend in Trump's place. \"It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa. Afrikaners (People who are descended from Dutch settlers, and also French and German immigrants) are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,\" Trump posted on Truth Social over the weekend. He previously said South Africa should be kicked out of \"the gs\" altogether. Trump has been relentlessly critical of South Africa since his return to office. He  ambushed  the country's president Cyril Ramaphosa during a White House visit in May falsely accusing his government of seizing white-owned land;  cut aid  to South Africa;  his administration  expelled  the South African ambassador to Washington; slapped the country with  30 percent tariffs;  repeated debunked far-right claims about a white genocide -  and as a result prioritized Afrikaners for  fast-track refugee status  in the U.S. (while stopping refugee admissions from most other countries). The South African government has repeatedly tried to correct the White House, providing statistics that disprove these claims – for example the fact that Black people are by far the worst affected by violent crime and that whites still own the majority of commercial farmland – to no avail. Now, some white Afrikaners themselves, as well as Afrikaans groups, are calling out what they say are the U.S. administration's \"lies\" and \"falsehoods\" in their name. \"We reject the narrative that casts Afrikaners as victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa,\" a group of over 40 prominent Afrikaners said in an  open letter last month . \"We are not pawns in America's culture wars.\" The group included writers, journalists, musicians, university lecturers and Christian clergy. \"Afrikaners have done harm in the past, and we acknowledge that,\" the letter said, referring to the fact that their ancestors – as well as British settlers – colonized the country. The Afrikaners later set up the apartheid system which segregated the races, prevented the Black majority from voting, and brutally clamped down on dissent. \"As citizens of post-apartheid South Africa, we have dedicated ourselves to building our country. Singling us out as victims of multiracialism alienates us from our fellow-South Africans and harms relationships that have been fostered over the past 30 years.\" 'Please stop lying'  Max du Preez, an Afrikaner journalist and author who was among the signatories of the letter, told NPR they rejected the narrative coming out of the White House as \"the abuse of our ethnic identity to further the MAGA movement's interests.\" \"There is no genocide in South Africa, there's absolutely no persecution of anyone based on race. Our constitution has iron-clad protection of every citizen's human rights,\" he said. \"Not a single square inch of white-owned land has been confiscated since we became a democracy in 1994,\" du Preez added. \"Please stop lying about us and using us as pawns.\" Trump has repeatedly said he particularly wants to help white Afrikaans farmers. But some agricultural organizations that represent them have stressed their businesses will be hurt too if the US sanctions South Africa. Christo van der Rheede represented white farmers for years as head of the biggest agricultural organization in South Africa. He now leads the FW De Klerk Foundation, named for the former Afrikaans president who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela for their roles in ending apartheid. \"It is now very important for all South Africans to unite and refute the statements by President Donald Trump…that Afrikaners are being killed and slaughtered and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated. This is simply not true,\" van der Rheede said after Trump's G20 announcement. He said the U.S. should reconsider boycotting the G20. \"The role of the G20 as a key driver of uniting and building a better and just world is critical and it will be very negative for the US and its business interests in South Africa should it continue to premise its reasons for staying away on falsehoods,\" he added. Despite the pushback from some segments of Afrikaans society, there are others who are fierce supporters of Trump and have welcomed his position on South Africa. For years some Afrikaner groups have been travelling to the US pushing the \"white genocide\" narrative and lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill. For its part, the South African government released a measured statement noting Trump's announcement. \"We really think this is going to be one of the most significant G20's to date albeit without the U.S.A. I think that is something that will affect the U.S. as a country, not the entire G20,\"   Chrispin Phiri, spokesman for the Department of International Relations, later told NPR. The summit  will be attended by European heads of state and China's President Xi Jinping is expected. Its theme – which the US State Department has objected to – is \"solidarity, equality and sustainability.\" \"South Africa is doing very bad things,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X in February. \"Using G20 to promote \"solidarity, equality, & sustainability.\" In other words: DEI and climate change.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97223","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:52:00-05:00","title":"Shopping for an Affordable Care Act health plan?

That shutdown is on the brink of ending, but the health care issue that started it is still not resolved. Since 2021, people who buy their health care on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces have had extra help -- in the form of tax credits -- to buy their plans. If Congress can't agree on a compromise, those subsidies that made  a record number of Americans sign up for ACA plans  will expire for 2026 health plans. Negotiations to reopen the federal government also promise a Senate vote on the health care subsidies by the second week of December. But  that informal deal is not part of the official legislative text  to reopen the government. Meanwhile, open enrollment has started, allowing consumers to shop for next year's plans. Because Congress hasn't yet agreed to renew the subsidies, many of the 24 million people who have these plans will  see large jumps in the monthly price  they may pay, compared to their 2025 plans.

cut hundreds of flights due to the shutdown. Here’s what to know \n       \n  By Emma Tucker, Pete Muntean, Hanna Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:52 PM EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Disgruntled travelers across the US will face more disruptions to their plans this weekend, as airlines cancel hundreds of additional flights and delays continue to mount due to air traffic controller staffing shortages amid a government shutdown with no end in sight.\n \n\n   \n  More than 1,700 flights have been canceled from Friday through Sunday, data from Cirium shows, as airlines start to implement a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest airports mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n \n\n   \n  But the cuts – which officials say are aimed at keeping air travel safe while some of the air traffic controllers and federal security screeners missing paychecks are not showing up to work – haven’t prevented thousands of hourslong delays that have left flyers scrambling to figure out how to get to their destinations.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t want to be stranded at the airport sleeping on a bench,” Michele Cuthbert of Columbus, Ohio, told   The Associated Press , expressing concern about possible flight cancellations ahead of her trip to Dallas.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next week, airlines will ramp up flight cancellations to 10% by next Friday if the government shutdown remains unsolved. And the shutdown will likely disrupt holiday travel plans if no deal is reached after next week, plunging flyers into “uncharted territory,” said former FAA deputy administrator Dan Elwell.\n \n\n   \n  But travelers can still see flight cuts even if the government were to reopen next week, as the FAA’s order requires airlines to cancel flights days in advance.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to know if you plan to travel by air in the coming days:\n \n\n   \n    Why is the FAA ordering flight cuts?\n \n\n   \n  An emergency order by the FAA on Thursday said airlines have to cut traffic by 4%, resulting in about 800 flight cancellations for Friday that increased to over 1,000 throughout the day, according to FlightAware.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, there were more than 1,500 flight cancellations and over 6,600 delays, according to the flight tracking website. More than 1,000 flights have already been canceled for Sunday and over 240 delayed, the data show.\n \n\n   \n  The disruptions are primarily caused by air traffic controller staffing and the FAA order, but also include unrelated flight cuts.\n \n\n   \n  Airlines will be required to cut 6% of their flights to those 40 airports on Tuesday, 8% Thursday and 10% next Friday if the shutdown drags on, the FAA says.\n \n\n   \n  The percentage could rise to 15-20% if the gridlock in Congress doesn’t end “relatively soon,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned in an interview with Fox News.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to very much disrupt their Thanksgiving travel plans, I’m sure,” Elwell said about the flight cuts. “And let’s just hope we don’t get there.”\n \n\n   \n  Elwell, who served in the first Trump administration, said flight delays caused by the second-longest government shutdown starting in 2018 “actually brought people back to the table and ended the shutdown back in 2019.”\n \n\n   \n    Why are some air traffic controllers not showing up to work?\n \n\n   \n  The effects of air travel disruptions resulting from the shutdown will likely linger even if Congress makes a deal to reopen the government, as the  transportation secretary says  air traffic controllers may not return to work right away.\n \n\n   \n  The FAA said air control facilities nationwide were short-staffed 42 times on Saturday, according to an operations plan. And problems continue despite the flight cancellations designed to relieve stress on controllers struggling to deal with the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  Aaron Barker, an employee of the Transportation Security Administration and leader of the American Federation of Government Employees Union, said neither he nor his colleagues are able to make ends meet during the shutdown as controllers miss a second full paycheck.\n \n\n   \n  “We are now at the point where today would have been a payday for officers,” he told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on Saturday. “So now I have members who are coming — they’re being evicted. Some of them are already evicted.

EST, Sat November 8, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The ritual begins, as it always does, with a pilgrimage.\n \n\n   \n  People pour in from the dense warrens of India’s financial capital and from dusty villages thousands of kilometers away, all flowing towards the fortified, sea-facing Mumbai home of actor Shah Rukh Khan.\n \n\n   \n  The crowd is a mix of teenagers angling for a glimpse of the icon inside; middle-aged women for whom he was a first love; grown men who see their own aspirations mirrored in his trajectory.\n \n\n   \n  Known as “SRK” by millions, and “King Khan” to his fans, he turned 60 last week, and the chaotic display of devotion outside his home is a testament to a level of stardom rarely seen elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  The air is thick with chants celebrating his milestone. Some have waited overnight. They don masks or T-shirts with his face on, or clutch posters of his movies. All are here for the same sacrament: to get a glimpse of the superstar and be included in the sweep of his signature open-armed embrace.\n \n\n   \n  “I have loved him for a long time so I have come here to wish him happy birthday,” one fan told a local news agency. “Happy, happy birthday Shah Rukh brother. Happy birthday to you.”\n \n\n   \n  Another said he comes here every year. “I’ve been a fan of him since I was born… I have watched all his films,” they said.\n \n\n   \n  This bond was forged in a bygone era. As India opened its economy to the world in the 1990s, Khan opened its heart. He was an outsider who stormed the dynastic gates of Bollywood with little more than wit, ambition, and dimples that could disarm a subcontinent.\n \n\n   \n  And while the adoring thousands gather outside his home to worship a film deity, they may also be witnessing the twilight of India’s cinematic gods.\n \n\n   \n  “As stars become more relatable and fandom less devotional, the star-fan contract is less sacrosanct today,” said a recent IMDb report analyzing the last 25 years of Indian cinema.\n \n\n   \n  In today’s fractured attention economy of streaming, the barbed wire of polarizing politics, and the cacophony of social media, winning adoration on this scale isn’t just difficult; it might be impossible.\n \n\n   \n  As the IMDb report put it: “It’s time to stop searching for the next Shah Rukh Khan.”\n \n\n   \n  In 1991, the government dismantled the protectionist economic policies of its socialist past, cracking open the nation to the world. It was a policy shift that ignited a period of economic growth and industrial expansion that essentially reshaped the country. Satellite television brought a plethora of choice into the living room, Western brands began to appear in shops and, for a burgeoning middle class, the definition of success was suddenly rewritten.\n \n\n   \n  An exhilarating mantra became mainstream: Anyone can make it.\n \n\n   \n  Into this moment stepped Khan.\n \n\n   \n  A Muslim boy from a middle-class Delhi neighborhood, Khan says he was shaped by a household rich in intellect but often short on cash.\n \n\n   \n  His father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was a lawyer and Indian independence activist from Peshawar, in modern-day Pakistan, who ran a series of failed businesses. His mother, Lateef Fatima, was the family’s anchor, according to the younger Khan.\n \n\n   \n  “I come from a very normal lower-middle-class family. I saw a lot of failure,” he  said  during a 2012 speech at Yale University. “My father was a beautiful man and the most successful failure in the world… We were quite poor actually and let me tell you… poverty entails fear and stress and sometimes depression.”\n \n\n   \n  He began acting in school plays. By the age of 23, he was already on television in the successful series “Fauji” (Soldier). But just as his career was taking flight, his personal world fell apart.\n \n\n   \n  The death of his mother, years after he lost his father, prompted a move to Mumbai, the heart of India’s film industry.\n \n\n   \n  “I was sad in Delhi,” Khan told CNN in a 2008 interview. “I said to myself: OK, come (to Mumbai) for a change of scene. Maybe I’ll enjoy myself for a year and get over my depression of my parents’ death. But I just I couldn’t go back… I was never trying to be a movie star, I became one by chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Khan made his big-screen debut in the 1992 romantic drama “Deewana” (Obsessed) and soon became known for playing villainous, menacing characters in films like “Darr” (Fear) and “Baazigar” (Gambler). But it was his pivot to the romantic hero in the 1995 cult hit “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (The Brave Hearted Will Take the Bride, widely known as DDLJ) that catapulted him to superstardom.\n \n\n   \n  His character, Raj, presented a new model of masculinity that wasn’t the angry young man of the previous generation. He was the empathetic partner for the new one, offering a vision of modern love that felt safe and aspirational.\n \n\n   \n  Bollywood certainly has other megastars, like Deepika Padukone, who is among India’s most celebrated women actors; Aamir Khan, known for his versatility; and Salman Khan. Yet, their followings are distinct from the quasi-religious fervor thar surrounds Khan.\n \n\n   \n  It is a phenomenon of near-mythic proportions, engendering a devotion so profound as to lead to the scenes of mass pilgrimage outside Khan’s Mumbai home.\n \n\n   \n  Sher Mohammed had traveled 2,200 kilometers from his village in the eastern state of Jharkhand and waited 95 days for a chance to meet Khan. When Khan learned of Mohammed’s determined vigil, he came out to the street to personally greet his fan.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone told me I won’t be able to meet him… I got even more motivated to meet him,” Mohammed said. “I felt so happy.”\n \n\n   \n  Also present was Visharukh, Khan’s self-proclaimed “biggest fan,” whose home is plastered with posters of the actor, and whose children are named “Simran” and “Aryan” – after Khan’s love interest in “DDLJ” and his real-life son, respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Visharukh’s shrine to Khan is just one thread in an intricate tapestry of fandom.\n \n\n   \n  In her book, “Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh,” author Shrayana Bhattacharya explores what he means to women as someone who challenged masculinity in a newly liberalized economy.\n \n\n   \n  “For 15 years, I thought I was talking to fans about Khan,” she said. “Eventually, he became a research device for hundreds of his female fans to use his icon to talk about their own frustrated attempts to assert economic and emotional independence in one of world’s most insidious patriarchies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Bhattacharya, there is no single explanation for his appeal.\n \n\n   \n  For a migrant tribal domestic worker, for instance, she found the appeal wasn’t rooted in grand romance. She most appreciated his characters’ willingness to participate in domestic life, Bhattacharya said, citing “simple gestures such as being in the kitchen in his films, helping with chores.”\n \n\n   \n  For the nation’s elites, Bhattacharya found Khan symbolized something entirely different. He was a living embodiment of the dream that hard work could lead to limitless success. He represented, as she put it, “the myth of meritocracy at a time when India started its love affair with GDP growth and consumer spending.”\n \n\n   \n  And for another crucial group – the first generation of women to ever work in their families – she found his films offered a vital refuge. Khan’s imagery became a “necessary entertainment and escape when their everyday rebellion of prioritizing a career over marriage caused heartbreak or exhaustion,” Bhattacharya said.\n \n\n   \n  “He is one person, but each fan has projected their aspirations and fantasies onto him in their own unique and deeply diverse ways.”\n \n\n   \n  But in today’s world of digital creators, those seeking fame face competition in a way Khan’s generation never could have imagined.\n \n\n   \n  This new reality is the daily grind for Shivam Khatri, an aspiring actor in Mumbai. He, too, left his small town for the city of dreams, but his hustle operates in a different universe. For him, the formula has been inverted: where Khan became a star and then a brand, actors now must become a brand first.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like someone gets picked up from the street,” Khatri said from the home he shares with several other people. “Social media, web shows, it’s changed everything.”\n \n\n   \n  The influence of stardom in India is immense. Cultivated over years through a series of box-office hits, it can define eras, create cultural touchstones, and command a loyal fanbase that transcends generations.\n \n\n   \n  But the very nature of the connection between stars and their audience is now evolving, according to the IMDb report.\n \n\n   \n  “What was once a carefully mediated connection, built through iconic characters and controlled narratives, has become more porous,” it said. “The closing of the metaphorical gap between the big screen’s larger-than-life star and the one on the (Instagram) reel you can hold in your hand has changed the equation between the star and the fan.”\n \n\n   \n  Khatri knows his follower count is as important as his headshot as he competes not just with actors but with food bloggers, comedians and dancers for screen time. “Everyone should have an online presence now,” he said, “and you have to constantly check it.”\n \n\n   \n  His struggle illustrates how the singular path to box-office fame has been replaced by a thousand algorithm-driven streams on social media apps like Instagram and TikTok.\n \n\n   \n  For Ibrahim Qadri, a Khan lookalike and social media influencer from Gujarat, it pays to trade on the existing fame of others, supplying a demand for connection that the real SRK could never sate.\n \n\n   \n  His Instagram feed is a meticulous recreation of Khan’s world: the signature arm-spread pose in a mustard field, a lip-sync to a classic song, a frame-by-frame remake of a famous movie scene. He is, in many ways, more accessible than the real Khan, making a living through brand deals with local businesses and paid appearances at weddings.\n \n\n   \n  “When I perform, I don’t think I’m imitating,” Qadri said. “I become him. I feel like I am him.”\n \n\n   \n  This profound devotion, which has garnered him more than 2 million followers, comes with a paradox: He might be the only person in India who doesn’t want to meet Khan.\n \n\n   \n  “I’ve said that many times,” Qadri explains. “Because if I meet him, I feel my passion will end… what will be left to do in life?”\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t talk about Hindu-Muslim,” he once said in a 2020 interview in Hindi. “My wife is Hindu, I’m a Muslim, and our children are Hindustan (Indian).”\n \n\n   \n  But in today’s era of political polarization, defined by a new wave of Hindu nationalism, that same identity has been weaponized, transforming him from a unifying symbol into a cultural battleground.\n \n\n   \n  The 2023 release of his action film “Pathaan” (Warrior) served as a flashpoint. The brief appearance in a musical sequence of a female actor in a saffron bikini – a color associated with Hinduism – ignited a coordinated firestorm of outrage from far-right groups and politicians, who framed it as a deliberate insult to the religion.\n \n\n   \n  Calls for a nationwide boycott trended for weeks, and effigies of the actor were burned,  according  to local media reports. But the film’s eventual record-breaking success was a deafening rebuttal from his loyal fanbase.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know if there will be another SRK or not,” said the author Bhattacharya. “What I do know is that we will need icons who unite us in conversation, not divide us into spiritual silos.”\n \n\n   \n  Back at the birthday congregation in Mumbai, a sea of fans surges outside Khan’s home. As the day wears on, the crowd swells to a formidable throng. Police struggle to maintain order, their wooden sticks cracking against the pavement in a futile attempt to control the sheer mass of people.\n \n\n   \n  Afternoon bleeds into evening, and as the sun sets over the Arabian Sea, the collective hope that they’ll see their hero   begins to fade. A message appears on X, confirming their disappointment. “Have been advised by authorities that I will not be able to step out and greet all you lovely people who have been waiting for me,” Khan writes, adding his “deepest apologies.”\n \n\n   \n  For Khatri, the aspiring actor, there will never be another like Khan.\n \n\n   \n  You have to almost be delusional to make it in the industry, he says. “It’s fun until the money runs out… It’s not going to happen in the next 10 days or months. But it will work out.”\n \n\n   \n  Inspired by Khan, a vision board in the corner of his room reads: “India’s next superstar.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97313","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:03:00-05:00","title":"Families Accuse Camp Mystic of Ignoring Risks in Texas Lawsuit Over Flood Deaths","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Families of campers and counselors who died in a catastrophic flood at Camp Mystic in Texas on July 4, 2025, have filed a lawsuit alleging that the camp operators ignored safety protocols, failed to evacuate vulnerable campers despite rising floodwaters, and prioritized profit over safety by keeping children in flood-prone cabins.

steps to protect the campers as life-threatening floodwaters approached, families of the victims allege in a lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed Monday in state court in Austin, seeks more than $1 million in damages but does not specify an exact amount. It was filed as Camp Mystic has drawn renewed outrage from several victims' families over plans to reopen the 100-year-old camp next summer. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Among the claims in the lawsuit is that a groundskeeper was directed to spend more than an hour evacuating equipment while girls and counselors in cabins closest to the Guadalupe River were ordered to remain there, even as floodwaters overwhelmed the property. The lawsuit was filed by the families of five campers and the two counselors who died. \"These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,\" the lawsuit said. \"The camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins.\" The suit also alleges the operators of the camp chose not to make plans to safely evacuate campers, despite state rules requiring such plans, and instead ordered campers and counselors to remain in their cabins as a matter of policy. Defendants named in the lawsuit include Camp Mystic, affiliated entities and its owners, including the estate of camp owner Richard Eastland, who also died in the flooding, and his family members. A separate lawsuit with similar allegations was filed Monday by the family of Eloise Peck, another Camp Mystic camper who died in the flood. Both lawsuits were filed in Travis County. Telephone and email messages left Monday with an attorney for Camp Mystic seeking comment on the lawsuit were not immediately returned. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The campers and counselors were killed when the fast-rising floodwaters roared through a low-lying area of the summer camp before dawn on the Fourth of July. All told, the destructive flooding killed at least 136 people, raising questions about how things went so terribly wrong. County leaders were asleep or out of town. The head of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather beforehand, but it's now unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesperson for the camp's operators said in the immediate aftermath. The camp, established in 1926, did not evacuate and was hit hard when the river rose from 14 feet (4.2 meters) to 29.5 feet (9 meters) within 60 minutes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Ryan DeWitt, whose daughter Molly DeWitt was one of the campers killed in the flooding, said in a statement that the lawsuit is a step toward helping the family find peace. \"We trust that through this process, light will be shed on what happened, and our hope is that justice will pave the way for prevention and much-needed safety reform,\" DeWitt said.

November 10, 2025 • 5:00 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Six months after the Justice Department cancelled  more than $800 million  in federal grant money, many groups on the receiving end are still reeling. The cuts, focused on community safety initiatives, affected hundreds of organizations around the country and were far-reaching in scope: school violence programs, training for rural police officers, resources for domestic violence victims and hate crime prevention. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi  said the department  was cutting millions of dollars in \"wasteful grants,\" highlighting efforts geared toward transgender and LGBTQ communities. NPR spoke with 10 affected organizations to see how they've fared. A few said their grants were reactivated, but most said they have had to lay off employees, dip into reserve funds, or shrink the services they offer. \"These cuts are significant and unprecedented,\" says Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and former head of the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs, the office responsible for the cuts. \"When an administration gives a grant to an organization, that is a promise for the full amount. And so organizations plan, they budget, they hire,\" she says. Instead, the DOJ cancelled these grants in the middle of their cycle. At Washington Technology High School in St. Paul, Minn., Principal Elias Oguz was shocked when a grant-funded position at his school was suddenly cut last spring. \"This was named the 'Stop The Violence' grant,\" he says. \"Who would want to cut the 'Stop The Violence' grant?\" The money had allowed him to hire Robyn Strowder as a restorative practices coordinator, to resolve conflicts between students and build community at the school. \"It was very nerve wracking,\" Strowder says. \"There was definitely a time that I was like, 'Hey, I have a whole family to provide for and I'm not sure if I have a job.'\" Oguz ended up putting $50,000 toward the position using money dedicated to school supplies, as well as other funds from the school district and community donations. Even so, he's not sure where the money will come from in future years. Oguz and Strowder are not the only ones grappling with that uncertainty. \"We have three other federal grants and know they could be terminated at any time without cause. If that happens, we will have to lay off staff and end services for participants,\" Nicky Fadley, executive director of the Virginia nonprofit Strength In Peers, told NPR in a statement. The organization, which supports people with substance use and mental health challenges, laid off two employees already. It had already spent about $90,000 of the terminated grant and is still waiting to be reimbursed for more than half of that amount. Many of the organizations NPR spoke with were in a similar situation, saying the DOJ has not reimbursed them for money already spent. Those that appealed the cancellations have not heard back. Several organizations  have sued the administration , saying the cancellations were unlawful and that they are owed thousands of dollars in outstanding expenses. In a statement, the Justice Department told NPR the ongoing government shutdown is hindering its ability to consider appeals and reimburse organizations. However, the department cancelled the grants five months before the shutdown began. Almost all the cuts were to nonprofits. Solomon, the former DOJ official, says that reveals how the Trump administration is thinking about public safety. \"The kind of old school thinking is that it's only police that can keep communities safe. And what we're seeing out in the field more and more is that community-based organizations work as a complement to law enforcement,\" she says. In fact, after the grants were canceled, DOJ officials  sent a letter  to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley emphasizing that the cuts were mostly to nonprofits, and \"not to states or local jurisdictions that directly serve our communities.\" \"That's flawed rationale because these organizations play a really important role in their communities,\" Solomon says. \"We got hit pretty hard,\" says Everette Penn, co-founder and former director of the Teen and Police Service Academy, a mentoring program in Houston that had to reduce its staff. He says federal grant funding has bolstered the nonprofit world for years. \"It's the government sector that funds things that often are not funded in the private sector because they're necessary to keep our society functioning,\" he says. Dwight Robson, executive vice president of operations at the community violence intervention group Roca, said the DOJ told his organization that its work \"no longer effectuates\" the administration's priorities. Yet Robson says combatting violent crime and protecting children were among the DOJ's new listed priorities in its communications to his organization. \"Those are things we think we do very, very well. We're not of the mind that we're entitled to any funding. We're very happy to undergo any sort of merit-based, individualized review of our performance,\" says Robson. \"We believe that such an examination would result in one concluding that there's actually very good alignment between what the Department of Justice's priorities are and our work.\" Roca had to eliminate about 50 positions, Robson says. They're now looking for other funding streams. He says Roca will get through this challenge, but he worries about the future of other groups dedicated to community safety. \"I'm sure there are funders that are looking at organizations and saying 'Gosh, they're doing good work,'\" he says. \"But it's unclear whether they're going to be there in two or three, four, five years.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-37741","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:45Z","title":"City Launches Health Awareness Campaign to Boost Vaccination Rates","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On April 5, 2023, the City Health Department launched a comprehensive Health Awareness Campaign to promote vaccination and public health education.

So many of you told me to pray to St. Anthony, the patron saint of lost objects — a tip that my grandma has sworn by since I was a kid. Others had some very practical advice: Look in coat pockets, lay a flashlight on the floor (if you've lost a tiny object, the beam may cast a large shadow) and — here's a good one — make sure you know what it looks like! \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Here's a roundup of advice from our audience on how to look for stuff — plus a few bonus tips from our experts. We hope this helps you quickly find whatever you're searching for. These responses have been edited for length and clarity. For science-backed and expert-recommended techniques to find missing objects, listen to the podcast episode above, or  read the original story here .  What to do if you've lost a wallet  Look up your last credit card transaction, and then go to the place where you last spent the money and look around there. — Darryl Ellis, a private investigator and the head of  A-1 Detective Agency  in Illinois Watch things fall as you drop them  I have trained myself to watch things fall when I drop them. If you watch a small screw fall and see where it lands and bounces, you will have no trouble finding it. If you just look at the place where the screw was supposed to go and growl and curse, expect to have trouble finding it. — Gregory Vogt Don't ever put it in a \"special place\" The worst possible thing to do is to place something of value in a \"special place\" that is \"easy to remember\" for \"safekeeping.\" Ha! Definitely not recommended. — Shan Crockett Use a flashlight  I find a flashlight to be a useful search aid, day or night. The beam forces me to focus on a limited area. It helps me see, instead of just looking. Held near the floor, it makes things shine. A girlfriend once lost her contact outdoors, in a driveway, with snow on the ground. I waited until after dark and then quickly found the contact in a snow pile at the edge of the street. — Art Clack  Start cleaning My mother taught me this tip: When you cannot find something, clean up and you will find it. I often find the item when I'm picking up something to put it back in its proper place. — Anne Chevalier \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Check favorite hangout spots Go to the places you hang out most and look there first. Do you have a favorite place you sit on the sofa? Look through the cushions and under and behind the sofa. Do you hang out on the patio? Look in between seats and chairs or on tables outdoors. My youngest son is autistic and nonverbal. He wears glasses and sometimes comes up to me without them on his face. To look for them, I always go to his favorite places around my home. They might be in his bed, his sensory swing or the closet. I always end up finding them. — Naeemah Ford Goldson, executive director and founder,  National Association of Black Professional Organizers Make a mental note of something you're likely to lose  I make a mental note when I put something down — like my keys, glasses or phone — in a place I do not usually put it. It is akin to underlining or highlighting something in writing to help make it easier to remember. — Marc R. Inver Come back to it  Take a break from looking for your missing object and relax or do something else. Without worrying and fussing, your brain will quietly surprise you with a stored memory that will suddenly pop into your consciousness and lead you to the missing object. — Gregory Vogt Look carefully in the most obvious place Look in the most likely place it should be. Most of the time, it's there. You just overlooked it. — Kelly Connolly Make sure you know what it looks like Numerous times, my wife has sent me to get something in the basement, and I can't find it at first because she told me the wrong color, container or location. Make sure you know the correct characteristics, or you may easily overlook what you are looking for. — John Heinen The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane. The visual editor is Beck Harlan.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: Hey, everybody. It's Marielle. A few years ago, our digital editor, Malaka Gharib, lost her passport two days before a big international trip. Getting a new passport expedited would cost her hundreds of dollars, and she wasn't sure if it would even get to her in time. MALAKA GHARIB, BYLINE: You can imagine how stressed I was. I mean, the last time I saw my passport was on the bed, but I retraced my steps about a dozen times and nothing. SEGARRA: She was so stressed about the missing passport, she even took off work to look for it. GHARIB: I mean, I was really frazzled. I tore up the house, and I was checking the most random places, like the bathroom cabinets. SEGARRA: That experience made Malaka think, you know, there has to be a more methodical way of finding lost objects. GHARIB: Right. I mean, like, what do researchers know? And what about people like detectives and search-and-rescue responders? How do they hunt stuff down? SEGARRA: On this episode of LIFE KIT... (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SEGARRA: ...How to find the stuff you've lost. And we're not just going to tell you to look harder if you've lost something. Malaka will bring you useful techniques to find things that don't have an AirTag on them, whether that's something sentimental like a class ring or something valuable like an envelope full of cash or something you need to cross the border. GHARIB: And I'll reveal how I finally found my missing passport. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: So after I called my boss and told them I wasn't coming in, I went into my bedroom, where I lost my passport, and I turned it upside down. I remember feeling so overwhelmed that I wasn't looking carefully enough. That's exactly what you want to avoid when you're looking for a lost object. This is takeaway one. Your attention is like a spotlight, and you need to be able to point it at the task at hand. To do that, you've got to relax, which, I know, is the last thing you want to hear when you've lost something important. Arryn Robbins is a cognitive psychologist at the University of Richmond, and she specializes in visual search. She says that stress clouds our ability to focus. ARRYN ROBBINS: Stress can have a couple of different types of effects on us. So imagine you're highly distracted because you're thinking about something that's coming up. GHARIB: Like a big international trip that you're packing and getting ready for. ROBBINS: That type of distraction, that mental distraction is taking away attentional resources from the task at hand. GHARIB: So I was already frazzled when I was handling my passport to begin with. Then I realized I lost it, which was my second layer of stress. ROBBINS: In terms of visual processing, when you are stressed out, you have that sort of fight-or-flight response kicking in. That sympathetic nervous system is kicking into gear. Your heart is beating a little faster. You might get a little sweaty because you're anxious. What that does is it actually narrows your attention. GHARIB: So, if your attention is like a spotlight, you could increase the size of that beam or shrink it down. When it's narrow, it's almost like you're having tunnel vision. On one hand, that can be great. You're able to process your environment with a lot more detail. ROBBINS: But you, to some degree, need your attention sort of expanded in order to get the gist of your search environment to know where to put that spotlight next. GHARIB: So take a moment to widen that beam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROBBINS: It helps to take a breath, kind of calm the body down because it really is your body response to that stress that's causing that restriction in attention. GHARIB: Once you've calmed down and centered yourself again, it's time to start hunting. Takeaway two, if you've lost something important, think about the features of the object that would really make it stand out in the environment. Arryn says it'll make your search easier and more efficient. ROBBINS: When you are looking for objects, you're using a bunch of different cognitive processes in your brain, but the two most important ones are memory and attention. GHARIB: You're going to rely on your memory to remind you of what the lost object looks like and its likely location. ROBBINS: Its visual features like color, shape, texture, size, memory for where the object is most likely going to be, and that information in memory is used to direct your attention. GHARIB: Say you're looking for a white sedan in the parking lot. To find it, you're not going to look at every single car in the lot. ROBBINS: Your attention is going to be directed to cars that are white, that are sedan-shaped. You're going to skip over the black SUVs, and that helps you save time. GHARIB: This is what scientists call attentional guidance. It's the process of moving your attention toward areas in your environment where you'd most likely find your object, including important features of your object and where you tend to keep the object. It's something we do all the time without even realizing it, when we look for a toothbrush in the morning or a favorite coffee mug. You only realize you're looking for something when it becomes challenging - for example, when you're looking for a white sedan in a parking lot full of white sedans. ROBBINS: So in that case, you have to really think about what would make this object stand apart in the scene? What are some distinctive features of this object? Maybe you have a bumper sticker that sets it apart. GHARIB: Arryn used this tactic recently when she lost the back of a rose gold earring on a carpet in a similar color. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROBBINS: So I had to think about, OK, what would set my earring apart from this carpet that would allow me to find it? Well, my earring is shiny. It would reflect light. And so, as soon as I thought about that, like, almost instantly, I saw it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: OK. So you've tried this technique, and you still can't find what you're looking for. Time for takeaway three - think about the likely scenarios of how and where your object got lost. Demian Garcia is a metal-detecting enthusiast. For more than a decade, he's been using his metal detector to help people where he lives in Northern California find their lost jewelry in some pretty challenging environments - parks, beaches, roads. His track record is impressive. Over the years, he says he's helped recover some 50 lost objects for folks. When people pay him to find a lost object - he charges around 25 to 35 bucks a search - he starts off by asking them questions. DEMIAN GARCIA: Do you have any locations that you put it normally? Have you lost it before? Has it fallen off before while doing something? You know, some people say, oh, yeah, it always slips off when I'm in my car, and I play with my ring while I'm driving. GHARIB: Then he goes through typical ways people lose rings off their hand. He's got a lot of experience in the behavior of rings, as you can imagine. GARCIA: Did you throw anything away that day? Were you dealing with cold water? Did you put on lotion somewhere? GHARIB: And one of my favorite ways that Demian helps people find their lost jewelry without the use of a metal detector is to recreate the scene. GARCIA: An example of that was a couple were pulled over on the side of the road, and she tossed the ring out in the passenger seat. GHARIB: Side note - Demian says this scenario happens a lot. Couples get into an argument, and one of them takes off their wedding band and chucks it out the window in anger. But then they make up, and then they can't find where they threw their ring. So they contact Demian. GARCIA: And she kept going, it's right there. I threw it straight out the window right there. GHARIB: Demian wondered, was it really right there? He wanted to test the theory, so he took a cheap ring, tied a long red ribbon on to it and asked the woman to throw the ring out the window again like she did with her wedding ring. GARCIA: Well, she threw it three times in a row, and it never went straight out the window, like you would think. It went flying back behind the car because of her arm going out the window makes her hand throw it towards the back of the car. So it went back about 20 feet to the rear of the car, going a different direction. GHARIB: Using this technique, he was able to find the woman's ring. Yay, Demian. So the next time you lose something, try recreating the potential movement of the object. I should've done that with my passport. I could've taken something similar to it, like a little booklet or something, laid it on my bed, the last place I saw it, and I could've ruffled the duvet cover around to see where something of that size and weight might have landed because where I ultimately found it was not that far from my bed, actually. More on the exact spot later. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: At this point in your search, you've probably looked in some pretty obvious places. Now it's time to change your perspective and scour elsewhere. This is takeaway four. Michael Hout is a cognitive psychologist and the director of the Vision Sciences and Memory Lab at New Mexico State University. He specializes in how people find things and where and why people move their eyes. He was telling me about this experiment that one of his students did. She had participants look for objects in a campus courtyard, and she found that people tended only to look at the ground when they searched. MICHAEL HOUT: So they're not looking up. They're just kind of walking in a straight line and sweeping back and forth with their head and their eyes in front of them. GHARIB: This is different from how search-and-rescue responders and law enforcement operate. These professionals scan their environment in 360 degrees. That means... HOUT: Looking down, looking up, looking left and right, crouching down to change your perspective, turning around to view things that weren't visible to you when you first approached them. GHARIB: He says if you've lost something, you need to engage in these kinds of perspective-changing behaviors, too. That also means looking in unexpected places. So if you can't find your keys in the places where you normally leave them - your purse, your pocket, the entryway table at the front door... HOUT: You also have to then sort of force yourself to look in the low-probability areas. I think sometimes people put their keys in weird places, or they drop them or someone moves them. GHARIB: Search-and-rescue responders use this technique when they look for missing persons in the wilderness. Instead of just looking on a trail for clues like footprints or a cell phone, they look up at the trees and off the beaten path. HOUT: A windbreaker that someone shed when they were getting hot, for example, might have been picked up by the wind and blown into a bush or a tree. GHARIB: When I was looking for my passport, I actually checked inside the fridge. I know this sounds far-fetched, but maybe I was holding it, intending to put in my backpack, got hungry and then brought it into the kitchen with me. No, I did not find it in the fridge, but it was still good that I did that anyway. This exercise is all about breaking out of the way you would normally search for something. HOUT: And that takes a little bit of additional effort to sort of force yourself out of the routine that you might automatically use to look for something. GHARIB: At this point, if you've looked in some weird places and you still can't find your lost object, it's time to bust out a more serious search technique. Takeaway five, divide your space up into sections and then search each section thoroughly. Arryn says grid search, as it's called, is one form of systematic search. It's sometimes used in search and rescue as a last resort to find missing people. But it can also be a useful tool if you're looking for something in a messy room, where your missing object's distinctive features may be hard to spot. ROBBINS: It's going to be slow, less efficient, but it's going to ensure that you find the thing that you're looking for. And so, in this case, you might imagine that your search environment, whether it's a room or an office space, is like a grid, and you want to cover each square in the grid, maybe top to bottom, left to right. GHARIB: Arryn says the general idea is to come up with a strategy to be thorough without having to remember every location you've already looked at. You don't necessarily have to measure out a grid. Just imagine breaking down the search environment into smaller units - sections of a room, pieces of furniture - then search those units in an order that makes sense to you. Arryn says you are likely going to forget where you searched, so have a way to remember the places you already sifted through. When I lost my passport in my bedroom, I deployed a similar strategy. I divided the room into sections, and I put a Post-it note where I had already looked. Arryn thought that was an excellent strategy, but did I find my passport with this method? No. Looking back on my journey to find my passport, I realize I did one thing right. I was persistent. That's our final takeaway, takeaway six - be persistent. GHARIB: Darryl Ellis is head of A-1 Detective Agency in Illinois. He's been a private investigator since 1996. His whole job is to find stuff, people, to, say, serve them legal papers, but sometimes physical items like vintage cars and important documents. I asked him what it takes to be a good detective. DARRYL ELLIS: If I had to use one word, I would say tenacity. It's my client asking me to do a - perform a service for them, and I try to do my best to locate anybody that they're requesting me to locate. GHARIB: Darryl can spend hours doing surveillance, following targets, taking photos of them, logging their whereabouts, weeks tracking down information about the location of a specific individual. ELLIS: I mean, I'm looking for a gentleman now I've been looking for for a month, and we've, you know, pulled out all the resources trying to locate him. I've been to five or six addresses, and he hasn't lived there. GHARIB: Darryl says he'll keep looking as long as his clients want him to. But Demian says sometimes they give up before he does. GARCIA: Sometimes, they don't have the patience. And they're, you know, an hour into it, two hours into it, and I'm on my hands and knees and crawling through bushes and stuff, and they're looking at me like, you don't have to go anymore looking and you don't - you know, they're kind of like, well, I guess it's gone, and I just tell them, no, no, I don't give up until I'm satisfied. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: So if you've lost something you really care about, keep going. Don't lose hope. When I was looking for my passport, I remember sitting on my bed and looking around the room. At this point, it was about 3 p.m. and my brain was fried. There were Post-it notes everywhere. I had emptied all the drawers in my cabinet to see if the passport was in there. And I just had this moment of clarity. The passport has to be near the bed. It has to be, because that's where I last saw it, and I don't remember taking it anywhere else. So I pushed the mattress off the bed, and where did I find it? Wedged between the wall of the bed and the side of the mattress. Hallelujah. Reflecting back on that wild, wild search, I truly believe that if I had these tips I just gave you, I would have found it a lot faster. And listen, if you don't find the object you're looking for, hold on to the fact that you tried really, really hard to find it. That's what Demian does. GARCIA: It may help to know that I did my best to look for it, you know, and not to spend time looking in areas that I have looked, and, you know, maybe it'll show up someday. Or if not, you know, you did the best you could. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GHARIB: Let's recap. Takeaway one, your attention is a spotlight. You need to be relaxed so you can widen your beam and stay focused on your search. Takeaway two, speed up your search by identifying the qualities of your missing object that make it stand out from the environment. Takeaway three, search the obvious. Think about the likely scenarios of how and why your object might have gotten lost to begin with and where it might be. Takeaway four, change your perspective. Professional finders like search-and-rescue responders don't just look at the floor. They look behind, they look above, and they look off the beaten path. Takeaway five, create a systematic way of searching for your lost object. Divide your room into a grid, search each square thoroughly and use Post-it notes to mark where you've already looked. And, finally, takeaway six, don't give up. Be persistent, just like our detective and our metal-detecting enthusiast, and you'll hopefully find what you're looking for.

Budgeting gets a bad reputation. \"The first image that comes to most people's mind is dieting or imprisonment,\" says Jesse Mecham, founder of the budgeting software  You Need A Budget . But that, Mecham says, is an inaccurate picture. \"Budgeting is not about being handcuffed. It's really about being liberated.\" It might just be empowering for you. Keeping tabs on where your money is going is a good first step to cutting back on spending and saving more, if you're able to do so.  These six budgeting tips will help you track your spending and make more informed decisions about your money — and your life.  1. Don't budget just because you think you should. If you're budgeting because you think that's what responsible grown-ups do, that's not super-concrete or motivational. Instead, set a specific goal that has meaning to you, like paying off credit card debt or student loans or saving for a vacation, says Kristin Wong, author of  Get Money: Live the Life You Want, Not Just the Life You Can Afford .  \"Now you have a reason to say  no  to that $50 dinner, because you have something to say  yes  to now,\" Wong says.  \n       \n      Related Story:  Boost Your Credit Card IQ  \n       2. Harness your freakout. Big life changes — a move or a job loss — can bring big stress. Leverage that anxiety by channeling it into motivation to adjust your budget. \"Those moments, where you have the willpower or you have the energy, you have this motivation,\" Mecham says. \"That motivation is fleeting.\" So take advantage of budgeting momentum while it lasts. If you mess up or overspend later on, don't quit. Mecham stresses the importance of being flexible: \"You just make adjustments, like a coach [at] a basketball game making halftime adjustments. You just adjust to how the team plays.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  Never Pay An Unnecessary Fee Again \n       3. Follow the 50-30-20 method. When you get started, try  the guidelines  that Sen. Elizabeth Warren helped develop as a Harvard University professor. The largest portion, 50%, of take-home income should go toward basic living expenses — housing, groceries, etc. Then 30% for discretionary expenses, like entertainment and clothes; and 20% for savings and paying down debt. 4. Use the power of scarcity. With credit cards and overdraft protections, \"we've gotten really used to the idea that we never really run out of money,\" Mecham says. But having a sense of scarcity can be helpful when you're trying to save. Remember back when you were a kid and all you had was that $5 from babysitting or mowing lawns? You were probably pretty careful about how you spent that money because once you did, it was gone. Try designating a certain amount of money for each budgeting category every month, and when you run out, it's out. 5. A roommate is worth a thousand coffees. It's unlikely you'll reach your budget goal just by cutting back on coffees. Housing, food and transportation are usually the biggest expenses. \"If you get a roommate or move to a cheaper place, those major decisions are going to save you so much more money,\" says Wong. \"They're harder decisions to make, obviously. But they give you more bang for your buck.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  6 Simple Rules For Saving Money \n       6. Try different budgeting techniques to see what works for you. Whether it's a simple spreadsheet or a  budgeting app with lots of categories , use the system that works for you. Mecham says the main thing is not to wait until a \"normal month\" to get started — that will never come. So just start doing it, like right now. It's worth making a budget now, and if it changes in the coming months or year, that's OK.   You Need A Budget has been a sponsor of NPR in the past.

Oh, hang on, guys. I just got to enter this beer and my share of the nachos into my budget app. I mean, who wants to deal with that? But if it's such a drag though, why are some of you talking about budgeting like this? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I have had such a positive experience budgeting recently. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: And I am budgeting wizzard. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I'm actually super jazzed about it. It's, like, all I want to talk about. ARNOLD: A budgeting wizard, I love that guy. Super jazzed, all they want to talk about - what is going on with these people? What is their secret? This is your NPR LIFE KIT. This episode, budgeting - we're going to figure out how to join this party, how to convert a dreary, anxiety-producing, emotionally-fraught task into something conquerable, empowering and maybe even fun. We're going to learn how right after this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: I'm Chris Arnold, and I cover personal finance for NPR. And in this episode, we're going to give you six tips for setting up and sticking to your budget. And our first big takeaway - call it tip number one - you need a goal. But it can't just be any goal - right? - because, I mean, you want to stick with this. You want to be a budgeting wizard. You need motivation. This is going to be fun. It can't be just any goal. KRISTIN WONG: It has to be something that's specific and meaningful to you. ARNOLD: That's Kristin Wong. She's written a book called \"Get Money.\" And she writes about personal finance for Lifehacker and other publications. And she says, you don't want to try to start a budget just because you think it's something that you should do. WONG: If you just have, like, a vague goal - like, oh, well, I mean, I need to be an adult. I need to be a responsible grown-up. You know, I think most of us when we start budgeting or start wanting to get our finances in order, that's the goal - the best goal that we come up, you know. Like, it's time to be an adult. And it's just not a goal that really serves us because it doesn't really mean anything. And, I mean, also who wants to be a responsible adult? (Laughter) That just doesn't sound fun. ARNOLD: Deep down, that's not really what we want. WONG: No. ARNOLD: Kristin says, pick a goal that actually is something that you really, really want. WONG: Like, maybe you want to get out of $10,000, $20,000 worth of student loan debt. Maybe you want to save up $3,000 for a trip to South America. Then on a Friday night, where you have nothing else to do, and your friends say, hey, let's go to this hip new restaurant. You know it's going to be 50 bucks, but you don't really have a good reason to say no except that, you know, this budget tells you not to. But when you have a goal like, OK, I want to save $3,000 for a trip to South America, well, now you have a reason to say no to that $50 dinner because you have something to say yes to now. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: OK. So a trip to South America is fun and exciting. But, of course, a lot of times what gets us serious about wanting to make a budget is that we're not having fun. There is, like, a moment of crisis or a huge life shift. This is our next takeaway - tip number two - if you are freaking out about money, harness the freakout. JESSICA FISHER: My water broke, and we had quite the experience. ARNOLD: That's Jessica Fisher (ph). She was on her way to the hospital, in labor obviously. And you know the scene - contractions, everybody's getting anxious. It probably didn't help that her husband pulled the car over to buy a burrito on the way to the hospital before they finally got there. FISHER: I started having contractions, you know, pretty frequently with not a lot of time in between them. And Ryan's sitting there eating his Chipotle and kind of making me mad. So I flipped to my phone. ARNOLD: And Jessica's feeling like, OK, we're having this baby. This is going to cost money - child care, someday college. I mean, burrito guy here is not looking terribly full of answers at the moment. FISHER: I was trying to not feel the contractions as bad, so I'm scrolling through Facebook in between contractions. And I see a post about a budgeting program, and it said it was on sale. It hit me right at that moment that this is what we need to do. This is what's going to make everything work. And I pass the phone to my husband. I said figure out how to buy this budgeting program. That kind of, you know, calmed me down a little bit because I really, you know, had started panicking about what we were going to do with three kids when we brought my youngest daughter home. JESSE MECHAM: I'll have to meet this woman at some point. (Laughter) That blows my mind. ARNOLD: That's Jesse Mecham. And that budgeting program that Jessica bought, he invented it. It's called You Need A Budget, or YNAB for short. And we should say the company's been a sponsor of NPR before. But we're talking to Jesse because YNAB has this vast community of loyal users - like, hundreds of thousands of people. And Jesse's interviewed a bunch of them, and it turns out, a lot of them are kind of like Jessica, having her baby and freaking out about money. MECHAM: Or they had decided they were going to move. Or the breadwinner lost a job. I think those moments where you have the willpower or you have the energy or whatever it is, you have this motivation, that motivation is fleeting. ARNOLD: It might be getting out of college and having to start paying student loans and feeling like, uh-oh, I've got to figure this out. But whatever it is, Jesse says harness that freakout. You have an impulse to knuckle down and get started and do it. And as you do it - and he says this is important - forget everything that you think you know about what making a budget is actually going to be like. MECHAM: I mean, the first image that comes to most people's mind is either dieting or imprisonment. And what we try and get people to think is budgeting's not about being handcuffed. It's really about being liberated to start to decide what you want to do instead of just reacting to everything that comes your way. And so it's not about saying, hey, don't spend here, don't spend there, cut back on this. Never eat out. None of that. It's just about saying, what do you really want? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: So those are our first two tips - what's your specific goal, the thing you really want? And use your angst for motivation. And we're talking to Jesse from YNAB, but there's also all kinds of other tools and apps out there. Mint is really popular. We've got a link to a free, simple spreadsheet you can use at /lifekit. And, look. If you're still like, budgeting, that's going to be a drag, I don't know, Jesse says, look, getting started can be pretty painless. And at first, all you want to do is just track where the money is going and kind of see what's going on. And he says sometimes it's best if you don't try to change too much, too fast. MECHAM: Especially don't cut back right away. You know, you're just getting started. You have someone that's been spending, I don't know, $1,200 a month on groceries, and then they come in and they say, we'll spend $500 'cause we're really serious. That's a recipe for disaster. You know, don't go zealot on me too quickly. ARNOLD: OK. So now, though, it is time to take out and sharpen your pencil. WONG: Then, you know, comes the dirty work of actually putting together the budget and deciding how your income gets divvied up among different categories. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: And Kristin says there's a good rule of thumb here that a lot of experts talk about. This is tip No. 3. We've got some numbers coming up here, but it's going to be OK. It's not that complicated. It's called 50-30-20. And Elizabeth Warren actually used to talk about this back when she was a Harvard professor and she was looking into the pressures that middle-class families face. And, all right, it's called 50-30-20. Here's how it works. WONG: It goes like this. Fifty percent of your after-tax, take-home income should go toward basic living necessities, like your rent, like your groceries, like your utility bill. ARNOLD: So that's easy. Half your income for the big fixed costs in life. WONG: And then 30 percent should go toward discretionary expenses - things that you don't necessarily need but you want, like your Netflix subscription, restaurant spending. You know, clothing, makeup. Stuff like that. ARNOLD: And then that last part, the 20 percent that's left over... WONG: Should go toward savings and debt goals. ARNOLD: And these are guidelines, a good place to start. The saving, of course, is going to be the hardest part for a lot of people. That is very tough, especially when you're not making that much money. But we have a whole episode just on how to save more money. There's a lot of good, high-value information in there. So check that out. But with this 50-30-20 thing, what you're doing here is you're starting to organize and place some limits on your spending. MECHAM: The budget is, it's a tool to manufacture scarcity regularly. ARNOLD: And like Jesse was saying, this is the part that people think is going to feel like handcuffs. But he says that pinch, that scarcity, that's actually really powerful. I mean, you could kind of think about like this. Like, remember when you were a kid and all you had was that $5 or $10 allowance, or money from babysitting or mowing lawns or whatever? You were probably pretty careful about how you spent that money because once you did, it was gone. MECHAM: This moment that we never experienced now, where you end up with zero dollars or really, really close to it. We've eliminated this scarcity because banks have introduced very profitable mechanisms to have you just walk past zero and overdraft a little bit and pay them a fee. Or you can just, if you run out of money in your checking account, you just swipe your credit card and you've walked past zero again. We've gotten really used to the idea that we never really run out of money. ARNOLD: So Jesse says this is the whole point of the budget, to get back to a world where we do run out of money, to feel that scarcity. And this is tip No. 4. You want to make the power of scarcity work for you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: So if your budget says $800 for groceries this month or $50 for coffee - whatever it is - that is way better than just looking at what's in your checking account. MECHAM: Absolutely, if, yeah, you never look at your checking account balance to see if you can spend anything. Because that's a big pile of money or small pile, whatever it may be. But it's a pile that doesn't tell you any information at all. All it tells you is what your checking account balance is. But it doesn't tell you if half of that money is reserved to pay a large bill that's coming up, and a little bit that's left over is to pay a preschool tuition and then you've got some left to pay the lights. And you're sitting there wondering if you should buy boots, you know? It shouldn't even be in the equation. So the moment I know someone's really got it is when they'll tell me, Jesse, I went to look to see if we should go out to eat, and we only had, you know, $20 in our restaurants category so we decided to get some pizzas instead. I felt broke. That phrase is great. They'll say, I feel broke because I can't go out to eat where I want to go out to eat at this moment, but my checking account has never been bigger. And that is where I say, OK, this person got it. They're manufacturing scarcity around the priority of how much should we spend on restaurants. But on the flip side, they've got money set aside to go on some great vacation where they'll get to enjoy themselves, guilt-free. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: Jesse says a key part of that story about the pizza is that you have to actively look at your budget as you go throughout the month so it can help you make decisions. Also you definitely want to have different categories in your budget but, Jesse says, don't go overboard. Like, does toothpaste go under health care? Or maybe under groceries? I know. Maybe I need, like, a hygiene category. MECHAM: And I'd say, whoa, whoa. (Laughter) You know? Whoa. Do you ever make a decision based on the information you are collecting? And if the answer is no, don't collect that information anymore. ARNOLD: But you are going to get some useful information as you go through and make your budget. And all of a sudden, as you're tracking your spending and you're seeing where all the money's going, Kristin says you want to go through, kind of like, a brushfire or doing some weeding and just get rid of stuff. I mean subscriptions, a magazine you don't read, some online service you signed up for that you just don't use. WONG: You know, my big one is candles from Target. I don't know why I love spending, I just - (laughter) like, the amount of money I spend on candles, yeah, is so stupid. ARNOLD: Jesse says everybody he talks to cuts back on one thing, for sure - going out to eat. MECHAM: Not one - not one - has ever said, well, we kept eating out at the same level, and we found our savings somewhere else. Every one of them cuts their eating out dramatically. ARNOLD: And now we're getting into our next big idea here. You want to go after the big stuff, too, and not just the little pick-me-up purchases and candles at Target. WONG: Where are you going to get the most bang for your buck when it comes to cutting back? If you look at the areas where you spend the most money - and think about, like, your rent, your housing, your food, transportation - those are, I think, the three biggest areas most of us spend money on. If you tackle - if you make one decision to cut back on any one of those areas, it's going to save you so much more money and time and energy than trying to cut back on coffee every day or avocado toast every week. Sometimes if you get a roommate or move to a cheaper place, those major decisions are going to save you so much more money. They're harder decisions to make, obviously. But they give you more bang for your buck. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: This is our next big takeaway here, tip No. 5. A roommate is worth a thousand cups of coffee. Or actually, maybe more, right? If you live in a city, a roommate could be $15,000 a year in money to help you pay your rent or your mortgage. And Kristin has walked the walk here. WONG: You know, I was one of those millennials that boomeranged (laughter) and moved back in with my mom when I was paying my student loan. I paid it off so much faster, and I saved so much money. And I'm very lucky. My mom doesn't charge me rent. We come from this culture where my mom would still have me living at home, if she could. But, you know, it's just, sometimes you have to give up what you think life should look like to think about what it could look like. ARNOLD: And sure, I mean, moving in with her mom was kind of a bummer in her mid-20s, but... WONG: Sometimes I do miss those, you know, Friday nights where we'd just sit at home, the two of us, and watch \"What Not To Wear\" and eat takeout. And, you know, I think about those memories now fondly. It wasn't that bad. It worked in my favor, and I was able to get out of debt and then focus on my career. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: When it comes to exactly how you organize and structure your budget, you can do this lots of different ways, right? I mean, super-detailed with a spreadsheet or a budgeting app with lots of categories, or you can keep it a lot more simple. We heard from a listener, Wendy Spitzer (ph), in North Carolina. And she's got a budgeting system that she calls week money, as in how much money she's going to spend this week. WENDY SPITZER: And in week money, every Friday, I take out an allotted amount of money from an ATM, and that money has to cover all daily living expenses for the upcoming week. So that would include needs like groceries, or gas for your car, transportation, as well as anything for fun money you might use in the course of the week. ARNOLD: Bigger expenses, like rent, car payments, utilities, that's not part of this. But everything else, she lumps into basically one big, simple category of money that she can spend this week. And if she makes an online purchase, she'll take the cash out of her wallet. And then when it's gone, no more eating out, no more impulse buys in the checkout line. And with this budget system, over time, Wendy has saved a lot of money. I mean, she has a very modest salary, and she was able to buy her own house. SPITZER: It was, I think, quite shocking to a lot of people I knew because I was living on such little money. But, like, you make a small change. It becomes a habit. You institute or implement that habit for many years. And I have been able to put a down payment for a house, and I have been able to save for retirement. So it's worked really well for me. ARNOLD: I'm a fan of Wendy's strategy here because it's simple, and I'm not like a super detail-oriented guy when it comes to tracking every single purchase and doing a budget. I mean, look. Planning for retirement - yes, the big stuff - but, you know, the little stuff, it's hard for me. I think it's hard for a lot of people. So this is our last big takeaway - tip number six. You want to try different things and find a budgeting system that works for you. So if you want to keep it simple, keep it simple. And people come up with their own systems all the time. I mean, Jesse's budgeting software YNAB, that evolved from just a spreadsheet that he created on his own to help him and his wife save money when they were still in school. And they just kind of stuck it up there on the Internet and tried to sell it. MECHAM: It launched as a very embarrassing spreadsheet that I love to look at still and... ARNOLD: Can you describe the spreadsheet? MECHAM: I don't want to because it's embarrassing. You know, Excel has so many colors you can choose, and I chose all of them in my first spreadsheet. You know, so it was just - it was a hideous cacophony of color and - but it worked. And it taught me that the tool is - it really plays second fiddle. And the first most important thing is your approach. And the effective thing about the tool that I built was that it forced us to approach our money, thinking about it in a different way. ARNOLD: Meaning thinking about budgets and money as a way to have the best life that you possibly can - the things that you really want with the money that you have. Whether that's more great vacations or paying off your student loans or saving up to buy a house, this is what makes budgeting feel fun. You get good at this, and it affects your life in a lot of good ways. And so to get there, Jesse says the main thing is look, just get started doing it, like right now, this month. MECHAM: I mean, life is - if it's not changing or abnormal, you know, we're probably dead or darn close to it. And people will often - they'll say, oh, I'm going to wait - let's wait for a normal month, honey, before we do blah or before we undertake this thing. And there just is no normal month ever. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARNOLD: OK, so this is doable. We can do this budget thing. To help you remember the most important stuff, here's Kristin and Jesse with the key takeaways. Number one, you need the right kind of goal to help motivate you. WONG: Make sure that it's specific and meaningful to you. ARNOLD: Tip number two. WONG: If you have a big life event that is making you anxious or stressed about money, harness that stress and that anxiety and turn lemons into motivation. ARNOLD: Tip number three, a good place to get started with your budget... WONG: Is the 50-30-20 method - 50 percent of your take-home income goes toward basic living necessities, 30 percent goes toward discretionary expenses, your wants, and 20 percent goes toward saving and debt goals. ARNOLD: And tip number four - this is my favorite kind of big concept - use the power of scarcity. MECHAM: Don't view scarcity as a negative. Use the power of scarcity to help flesh out your true priorities. And don't think of budgeting as handcuffs. Think of it as freedom. ARNOLD: Number five. WONG: A roommate is worth 1,000 cups of coffee. ARNOLD: And our last one, number six. MECHAM: At the end of the day, you want to try different things and find out what works for you.

Equally unlikely to achieve any level of success is Charles Guiteau, another character from humble beginnings. Guiteau, though, is a lot less noble than Garfield, and a lot less humble.

It's a moment that makes it clear why Gilpin took the role.  The series is created by Mike Makowsky, based on the book  Destiny of the Republic,  by  Candice Millard .

Death by Lightning  is full of recognizable arrogance — political, social, medical — and also contains recognizable strains of both optimism and hopelessness. Those, by the way, all were central themes in the musical  Assassins , which included the actual song Guiteau composed to sing on the gallows just before his execution.  Assassins  is an outstanding musical — just as  Death by Lightning  is outstanding television. \n         \n         Transcript \n         TONYA MOSLEY, HOST:   This is FRESH AIR. \"Death By Lightning,\" the new four-part miniseries now streaming on Netflix, stars Michael Shannon from \"Boardwalk Empire\" as President James Garfield and Matthew Macfadyen from \"Succession\" as Charles Guiteau, the man who assassinated him. Our TV critic David Bianculli has this review. DAVID BIANCULLI, BYLINE: \"Death By Lightning\" is a period piece, but it plays like a 19th century version of \"The West Wing.\" It's full of political intrigue and unexpected betrayals, focusing on an elected representative whose desire is to do right and do good no matter how many obstacles are in the way. James Garfield, played by the always intense Michael Shannon, brings his intensity to Garfield's public oratory. But at home, his Garfield is a gentle, loving husband, father and farmer, an unlikely person to rise to the top in the snake pit of national government in the 1880s. Equally unlikely to achieve any level of success is Charles Guiteau, another character from humble beginnings. Guiteau, though, is a lot less noble than Garfield and a lot less humble. In fact, he may be delusional about his own self-worth, and he's not above stealing, lying, forging or other crimes to further his ambitions. In the Stephen Sondheim musical \"Assassins,\" Guiteau was portrayed with the enthusiastic optimism of a child, and that's how he's played here by Matthew Macfadyen, who played Tom on \"Succession.\" It's a wholly committed, completely empathic portrayal. You can feel Guiteau's emotions, his highs and his lows, instantly and deeply, often in the same scene. As in this one, when we meet Guiteau for the first time, facing a panel and defending his behavior in 1880 after being incarcerated in the New York jail called The Tombs. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DEATH BY LIGHTNING\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) To speak candidly on behalf of the panel, Mr. Guiteau, you seem to us a liar and a fraud. We fail to see how you've served as anything more than a drain on good society. MATTHEW MACFADYEN: (As Charles Guiteau) A drain? A drain on good society. That's - wow. No, that's not right. That's not how this is supposed to go. You know, sir, you sit there and you ask me to prove my worth. Well, let me tell you, I sit now in the same position as any one of our forebears. Are we not a nation built wholly from rogues and migrants and free thinkers? Isn't that the whole point of this thing? Here, and only here, a man can be anyone. He can amass a fortune. He can influence millions through words or action, his name ringing down through the ages. Not a drain. No, not a drain, but a credit. Hell, under the right conditions he might even be made president. BIANCULLI: James Garfield, on the other hand, has no such ambitions. He's a congressman representing Ohio, but spends most of his time back home. He's asked to do a favor for a fellow Ohio politician, to nominate him at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Chicago. Garfield's nominating speech, though, is so inspirational, the deadlocked convention eventually adds his name to the potential nominees. On the 36th ballot, Garfield emerges as the Republican front-runner, a fact that amuses Senator James Blaine, played by Bradley Whitford. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DEATH BY LIGHTNING\") BRADLEY WHITFORD: (As James Blaine) It's yours, Congressman. MICHAEL SHANNON: (As James Garfield) You didn't ask me if I wanted it. WHITFORD: (As James Blaine) Everyone wants it. BIANCULLI: Bradley Whitford, from the original \"West Wing\" TV series, is featured at the moment in another Netflix political drama as the first gentleman on the new season of \"The Diplomat.\" He has more to do as this four-part miniseries goes on, and so do many of the other supporting players. Two, in particular, are worth spotlighting. Nick Offerman, as Chester Alan Arthur, is cartoonish and bullying when it's called for and sensitive when that's called for. And he's perfect in every scene. And Betty Gilpin as Garfield's wife Lucretia - he calls her Crete - is perfect too. You might wonder why Gilpin, after starring in \"American Primeval\" and \"GLOW,\" is playing such a relatively small role, even one that's so dignified and independent. But her scenes with Shannon as Garfield are lovely, as in this rare moment alone, sitting on their porch after he's returned with his party's presidential nomination. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DEATH BY LIGHTNING\") SHANNON: (As James Garfield) Sitting here with you on this porch, reading our books in peace, it's my favorite thing. BETTY GILPIN: (As Lucretia Garfield) Then why go to Chicago and stand up and give that damned speech? SHANNON: (As James Garfield) Because nobody was saying what needed to be said, not a one of them. I waited. I waited, I hoped just one other man in that hall would stand up and tell the truth. I swear to God, Crete, if that would have happened, I'd have kept my mouth shut. But now I have to consider the possibility that I might be able to fix all the things that terrify me about this country. I mean, what if you and I could actually make a difference? BIANCULLI: But at another point in \"Death By Lightning,\" Gilpin's character explodes into a whole new gear, altering the course of history along the way. It's a moment that makes it clear why Gilpin took the role. The series is created by Mike Makowsky, based on the book \"Destiny Of The Republic\" by Candice Millard. Among its executive producers are David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who brought \"The Game Of Thrones\" and \"3 Body Problem\" to television. And now they've all brought to TV a dated history lesson that seems not at all dated today. \"Death By Lightning\" is full of recognizable arrogance - political, social, medical - and also contains recognizable strains of both optimism and hopelessness. Those, by the way, all were central themes in the musical \"Assassins,\" which included the actual song Charles Guiteau composed to sing on the gallows just before his execution. The song is performed in part in \"Death By Lightning,\" but I'll close with the Broadway version, sung by Denis O'Hare as Guiteau. \"Assassins\" is an outstanding musical, just as \"Death By Lightning\" is outstanding television. MOSLEY: David Bianculli reviewed the new Netflix miniseries \"Death By Lightning.\" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE BALLAD OF GUITEAU\") DENIS O'HARE: (As Charles Guiteau, singing) I am going to the Lordy. I am so glad. I am going to the Lordy. I am so glad. I have unified my party. I have saved my country. I shall be remembered. I am going to the Lordy. NEIL PATRICK HARRIS: (As the Balladeer, singing) Look on the bright side, not on the sad side. MOSLEY: Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, nutritionist Marion Nestle had to completely revise her groundbreaking book, \"What To Eat,\" 20 years later thanks to changes in what and how we eat, like the prevalence of ultra-processed foods and the popularity of food delivery. Nestle guides us through today's supermarket maze and the influences that determine what's on our plate. I hope you can join us.

Try asking a 'magical question' \n         By Marielle Segarra, Sam Yellowhorse Kesler, Malaka Gharib \n        \n           Thursday, May 29, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         What's the weirdest thing you've ever found in your pocket? What topic could you give a 20-minute talk on with no preparation? What's a path you almost took but didn't? If you find yourself immediately wanting to reply to these queries, there's a reason, says Priya Parker, a conflict resolution facilitator. They were designed to spark curiosity and elicit a response. She calls them \"magical questions.\" \"A magical question is a question that everyone in your group is interested in answering\" and hearing the answers to, says Parker, who hosts  a video series  on the topic on her Instagram page.  She likes asking them in group settings because they have the power to cut through small talk and reveal people's personalities. And people don't need to agree or have the same tastes or experiences to answer. Parker, author of the 2020 book  The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters ,  explains how to develop your own magical questions. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Priya, what are some of the qualities of a magical question?  They help people feel like not just a blob, but a group of individuals. And they help you know something about somebody. One of my favorite magical questions is: What was the first concert you went to, and who took you? I often ask this in team [meetings] or large town halls. Immediately, you get answers like Toni Braxton, Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, New Kids on the Block. So you might think: \"They went to the same concert I went to, how bad can they be?\" They can also be a jumping off point for other types of conversations, you say.  [Let's say you ask]: What's a gift you got that you deeply loved? That is a question that leads to other deeper questions, for example: What's a good gift? What creates meaning? Is it specificity? Empathy? What does it mean to be a generous person? How can we come up with our own magical questions?  Ask yourself: What questions might  everyone  be able to answer that come from the context of the group? That everyone is going to lean in and wait for the answer, but also be excited to share their own? Recently, someone on my Instagram shared that she discovered a magical question while she was in art class. People were talking about how quitting work was contagious. So she asked, \"What's everyone's favorite quitting story?\" Whether they were a musician, a consultant or a teacher, everyone had a story. [The question worked] because it was related to the conversation at hand. What's an example of a not-so-great magical question?  Years ago, when my son was 7 years old, he asked [our family]: What is your favorite animal? Now, that may be a magical question for  him , but not so interesting for the rest of us to either listen to or answer. You have a prompt to help people practice coming up with magical questions.  Imagine you are speaking to a group of dentists. What is the opening question you'd ask them? What was your favorite toothpaste flavor as a kid? Or maybe I'd ask if they expect me to answer their questions when they have their hands in my mouth!  I love it. Your first question is relatively equalizing. Every single dentist was once a child themselves. Some other questions you might ask: What is a Halloween candy you love that you would never recommend to your patients? What's the worst thing that's been said to you while someone was in the dental chair? Who has your favorite smile and why? What's the going rate for the tooth fairy? It sounds like what's required is attunement and presence. Speaking of which, what's the best way to bring up a magical question in conversation?  In some friend groups or group chats, you can be like, \"Y'all, I heard about this amazing thing called 'magical questions.' Are you game?\" Like, yes! In other places, some people are deeply allergic   to anything that feels like an icebreaker. As in all of life, read the room. More magical questions from Priya Parker  What's a gift someone gave you that offended you? What is one rule you had growing up that looking back now ,  you think was totally unnecessary or even a little funny? What are three gifts you would give aliens on behalf of humanity? When was the last time you used glitter? When was the last time you blew up a balloon with your own mouth? What is a favorite building in your community? When did it become so?

November 10, 2025 • 4:23 PM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump has pardoned a long list of political allies accused of trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, according to Justice Department Pardon Attorney Ed Martin. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The people listed were charged with or accused of various crimes or conduct related to attempts to subvert the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claimed to have won.   Some faced state prosecutions, while others were never charged. A proclamation  published on Martin's personal X account  late Sunday listed 77 people who received \"full, complete, and unconditional\" pardons, including Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Sidney Powell, a former Trump attorney who spread conspiracy theories about ballot fraud after Trump lost the 2020 election. In a statement, Giuliani said, via his spokesman Ted Goodman: \"Mayor Rudy Giuliani stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election, when he responded to the legitimate concerns of thousands of everyday Americans. Mayor Giuliani never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump's decision.\" Powell is one of four pardon recipients who previously pleaded guilty in a Georgia court after being indicted for trying to subvert the 2020 election results in Georgia. The pardons are largely symbolic as none of the names listed were ever charged with federal crimes. Dozens of people listed were charged in multiple swing states that were the center of unfounded claims of election fraud, including Georgia, Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin. Presidents do not hold the power to pardon state crimes. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The proclamation appeared to have been signed on Friday. It also made clear that Trump was not among those being pardoned. Trump has previously said  he had the \"absolute right\"  to pardon himself – a claim that remains untested. The Supreme Court granted the president broad immunity for official acts committed during his presidency. In a statement to NPR, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,\" adding: \"President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime's communist tactics once and for all.\" In January, Trump  pardoned some 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters  who participated in the siege on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. Among those pardoned were Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys chairman, who was convicted of \"seditious conspiracy\" and sentenced to 22 years in the federal penitentiary. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This latest string of pardons, while symbolic, appears to be part of Trump's longstanding efforts to rewrite history and amplify his false claims that the 2020 election, which was won by Joe Biden, was stolen. Pressed about those false claims  in a 2022 interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep , Trump repeatedly attempted to cast more misinformation about his election loss, before abruptly ending the call. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5601819","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"In an encrypted group chat, National Guard members question Trump deployments","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In early 2025, following President Trump's calls for National Guard deployments to cities like Los Angeles, D.C., Chicago, Portland, and Memphis, a small group of Ohio National Guard members formed an encrypted group chat on the Signal app to process their growing concern. These members, including individuals named J, C, and A, express deep unease about the political and ethical dimensions of the deployments—particularly the lack of clear mission parameters, the use of troops for tasks like street patrolling, and the administration’s public rhetoric promoting immigration enforcement, which is legally and constitutionally questionable. They argue that such actions contradict their original motivations for joining the military and raise serious ethical questions about loyalty to the Constitution versus obedience to political leaders. The group has grown to about 12 members, and the concern has spread nationally, with over 100 active service members reaching out to About Face, a nonpartisan veteran-led nonprofit that supports conscience-based military service.

        By Kat Lonsdorf \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         As President Trump calls for  National Guard deployments  across the U.S., a small contingent of Ohio guard members has been quietly expressing concern in an encrypted group chat. The administration started sending troops into several Democratic-led cities this summer, citing the need to crack down on violent crime and protect federal immigration facilities. The Ohio guard members now say they're alarmed at the turn the country is taking. They're even questioning their potential role in it. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I really went to a dark place when they sent the troops to [Los Angeles], and then eventually [Washington, D.C.], and now, Chicago. This is just not what any of us signed up for, and it's so out of the scope of normal operations,\" says J, a member of the Ohio National Guard who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity. In the summer,  Trump sent troops  into Los Angeles as anti-ICE protests escalated. He then deployed guard troops into D.C., where around 2,300 still regularly patrol streets. Then a torrent of plans for deployments came —  Chicago ,  Portland ,  Memphis , cities in Louisiana and Missouri. Many of them remain embroiled in legal limbo. In Ohio, J and several other members have taken to that group chat to discuss the deployments and the accompanying anxiety they've felt. J, as well as members C and A — all part of the same unit — agreed to talk to NPR on the condition that they are only identified by their first initials, because they are not authorized to talk to the press and fear retribution for expressing their opinions. \"I have been on two humanitarian-esque missions with the guard, which were awesome, doing the things you see on the commercial, helping these communities,\" says J. \"And then you want me to go pick up trash and dissuade homeless people in D.C. at gunpoint. Like, no dude. It's so disheartening every time I see another city — and I just wonder, 'who's going to stand up to this?'\" It's a sentiment that's building with guard members elsewhere. In recent weeks, more than 100 active military members have reached out to  About Face , a nonpartisan nonprofit made up of current service members and post-9/11 veterans to be a resource for those who might be questioning their deployments, according to the organization. \"In the military culture, it's really easy to feel like if you have questions or dissent, you're the only person who thinks that,\" says director Brittany Ramos DeBarros, a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The group has started an information campaign, specifically targeting members of the National Guard around the country — using flyers, posters, even billboards — encouraging them to reach out if they're having doubts. \"We take very seriously making sure that people do understand what they could be facing if they follow their conscience,\" says DeBarros. \"But the thing we also help people think through is, what is the cost of not following your conscience? Because as Iraq and Afghanistan vets in particular, many of us are living with that cost every day.\" NPR reached out to both the White House and the Pentagon for this story. \"Our great National Guardsmen signed up to defend the nation and serve the American people,\" wrote Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson in a statement. \"We are proud of the work they have accomplished this year, and we are confident in their collective ability to carry out any and all orders by President Trump, the Department of War, and state leaders.\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the deployments, saying Trump was using his \"lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel.\" Jackson lashed out at Democratic leaders, saying they'd failed to stop violent attacks on law enforcement. The group chat The group chat with the Ohio National Guard members — set up on the encrypted messaging app Signal — began amid the  flurry of executive orders  President Trump signed as he took office. Some of them affected the military. The members say they needed a space to process it. \"It's not even necessarily expressing opinions or anything. It's just expressing questions about things that come out,\" says A. They say the chat is active every day, with members sharing information and news articles they come across. In recent months, that chat has grown to a dozen members of their unit, and it's become largely focused on Trump's rhetoric around the National Guard and his deployments of troops to several cities. Ohio's Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has agreed to send troops to support the administration's efforts; there are about 150 in DC right now. That voluntary directive has come to this unit. None of the three took it. They say the orders themselves were uncharacteristically vague. \"What exactly are we going to be doing? Are we going to have leave? And those answers aren't very clear — but in the past, it's always been very clear,\" says A. \"Anywhere that we go, there's crucial information that we get about the why behind it. And whenever we don't get that, especially for these city moves, members ask questions.\" Growing anti-guard sentiment A joined the guard to pay for college. J was looking for direction in life. And C felt the pull of the benefits that the guard offers and to serve her country. All three have served for years, even decades. The three say they are grappling with whether to leave the guard, and end their military careers. \"The only reason I want to finish my current contract is just because I feel like there's weight to what I do and say right now, and I just want to use that to do some good,\" says J. C says she has been proud of her military career and how she has served — noting that she's served on missions that she didn't necessarily agree with before. But she worries these deployments could change that. She says she's spent a lot of time thinking about what line she won't cross. \"I've been in therapy. Lots of therapy has taken me to the point where at least I can be okay if I have to say goodbye. That sucks. Is this tarnishing my service? Is it undoing everything I thought I was fighting for?\" she says. The three say they've felt anti-guard sentiment from some of their community and in their civilian lives. \"Everything that has been happening is so counter to doctrine, and so counter to what we've been taught,\" C says. Their thoughts The Trump administration has publicly talked about using the  National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration enforcement  — something broadly illegal under US law. That bothers the three guard members. \"There is no way I would participate in that,\" says J. \"I just think when everything is said and done, people are going to have to answer for what we're seeing now, and I don't want to be any part of it.\" A also says he's been wrestling with what he'd do if made to participate. \"I think, like, establishing those boundaries with yourself: What am I willing to do? What am I willing to give up? And where do I draw those lines?\" he says. The idea of troops patrolling U.S. streets — even if they're only picking up trash — is also problematic for the Ohio guard members. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's kind of like fearmongering. People who don't see people in uniform every day, you send 50 of them out to walk their street, it's going to send a message,\" J says. DeBarros, the director of About Face, says she knows the tactic well. \"In Afghanistan, we used to regularly carry out what are called presence patrols, where there was no purpose or mission other than to be present in the space and normalizing that we were there,\" she said. \"Letting people know, oh, if you act up, we are here, and we're watching.\" C has been thinking a lot about what she's willing to give up and the potential consequences. \"I swore an oath to the Constitution, not a person,\" she says. \"I just really, really implore my peers and everybody outside looking in, to just think about that. Really think about that, and think about what that means. And if there are questions, ask them. Keep talking.\" \n         \n         Transcript \n         AILSA CHANG, HOST:   An encrypted group chat has become a place for some National Guard members in Ohio to work out how they're feeling as they have watched President Trump deploy troops to several U.S. cities. NPR's Kat Lonsdorf heard about that chat and traveled to Ohio to meet some of the members. KAT LONSDORF, BYLINE: Shortly after Trump took office earlier this year, J started feeling very unnerved about the president's executive orders surrounding the military. J: I got with some people that I knew were like-minded, and then they knew some other people. And we decided that a chat, like, a place that we could express these things with people that are feeling the same way. LONSDORF: We're only identifying J and other National Guard members in this piece by their first initials because they fear retribution for speaking to the media. J went to A, a member of his unit in Ohio, and brought up the idea of an encrypted chat. J: We're on there every day, sharing information, news articles, whatever. A: And it's not even, like, necessarily expressing opinions or anything. It's just expressing, like, questions about things that come out, right? C: We needed something to be able to talk to each other. LONSDORF: That's C, also a member of the same unit, also in the chat. The four of us are sitting in a tiny study room in a public library in suburban Ohio. Did it just kind of start growing a little bit? Like, how many people are in it now? It's, like, 10 or 12? A: Twelve. LONSDORF: And was there, like, a vibe shift at some point, where people were kind of looking at what was happening with these National Guard deployments and saying, like, wait a minute? J: I really went to, like, a dark place when they sent the troops to LA and then eventually D.C. and now, like, Chicago. Like, every time I see that, it's just, like, it - this is just not what any of us signed up for. And I just wonder, like, who's going to stand up to this, you know? LONSDORF: All three of these Guard members have served for years, even decades. The concern about being sent out on one of these deployments is legitimate. Ohio's Republican governor, Mike DeWine, has said he will send troops to other states. There are around 150 from Ohio in D.C. right now. That voluntary directive has come to this unit. None of these three have taken it. They point out it's hurricane season, usually when National Guard members are thinking about deployments to help in the aftermath of a storm. A: Those are the moments a lot of members of the National Guard live for. Like, they're able to go into these other areas and maybe provide a little bit of assistance during these tough times. But instead, we have D.C. come across our desk, like, anybody want to go to this? And no one raises their hand. Well, what exactly are we going to be doing? Like, are we going to have leave? And those answers aren't very clear. LONSDORF: They say they've tried to raise these questions further up the chain of command. C: We were concerned. We asked the question. We got a - kind of a pooh-pooh, I will say. And for me, it's just - I don't let them off the hook. LONSDORF: In response to NPR, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said that the Pentagon is confident in the National Guard and, quote, \"their collective ability to carry out any and all orders by President Trump.\" In D.C., where more than 2,000 troops have been deployed for months, guard members are largely patrolling the streets. But J says that bothers him. J: People who don't see people in uniform every day, you send 50 of them out to walk their street, it's going to send a message, you know, even if they're not doing anything. LONSDORF: They also say it's the continued and increasingly hostile rhetoric around the deployments that has them worried. In cities like Portland or Chicago, the Trump administration has said troops are needed to quell unrest and protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Federal judges and local governments have disagreed. Those deployments are tied up in court. And the administration has publicly talked about using the National Guard to help with immigration enforcement - something broadly illegal under U.S. law. Threatening to send troops to Chicago, the president famously posted an \"Apocalypse Now\"-style AI-generated picture which said, quote, \"I love the smell of deportations in the morning.\" I bring that up. And I wonder - you know, I see you all kind of taking a deep breath. That must have gone in the group chat. J: Like, we were just like, is this real? That's the question. It's so unbelievable sometimes that we have to, like, get assurance. Is this really happening? A: For that to come from, like, the epicenter of the military, it ripples out. You see that, and it frees up other people, and they start to quote the same things because it's coming from the top. LONSDORF: I ask them if they've thought about leaving - ending their military careers. J: I would get out if I could. The only reason I want to finish my current contract is just because I feel like there's weight to what I do and say right now, and I just want to use that to do some good. A: If, for some reason, this became so unbearable that I was like, I have to get out of the military, then you are a cog in a machine. So I get taken out, someone else is just going to be put in. I like the idea that I can make a difference within my six feet. And if there's enough of us in a military organization, I think that's enough to make a bigger difference than what we realized. C: So, to be clear, not every engagement I've ever done, every deployment I ever have been on, I've agreed with. But that's what the apolitical military is, right? You go when you're asked and you're called, when it's legal and lawful. But right now, how I'm feeling? Lots of therapy has taken me to the point where at least I can be OK if I have to say goodbye. That sucks. And the things on my mind are, what is my line that I won't cross? What am I prepared to give up? Is this tarnishing my service? Is it undoing everything I thought I was fighting for? - 'cause I spent a lot of time being really proud of my military career and my service, just to watch it possibly go up in flames. LONSDORF: Yeah. Thank you for sharing that because I can imagine that's really hard. And it seems like maybe you don't even really have the answers to those questions yet. C: I know what my line is. I am a cog, right? Like, somebody else can replace me. So that's why I'm sitting here. I'm OK if I have to go, if I'm asked to go. I have a way. But right now, I got to stay and do the good I can because the person behind me might not. LONSDORF: Conversations like this aren't just happening here in this public library in Ohio. They're happening all over the country. BRITTANY RAMOS DEBARROS: In the military culture, it's really easy to feel like if you have questions or dissent that you're the only person who thinks that. LONSDORF: Brittany Ramos DeBarros is the director of About Face, a nonpartisan nonprofit made up of current service members and post-9/11 veterans to be a resource for those who might be questioning their deployments. The group has started an information campaign specifically targeting members of the National Guard around the country - flyers, posters, billboards - encouraging them to reach out if they're having doubts. She says more than a hundred have so far. DEBARROS: We take very seriously making sure that people do understand what they could be facing if they follow their conscience. But the thing we also help people think through is what is the cost of not following your conscience? Because as Iraq and Afghanistan vets in particular, many of us are living with that cost every day. LONSDORF: DeBarros is a combat veteran who deployed to Afghanistan. She says she believes the patrols in U.S. cities are sending a message. DEBARROS: In Afghanistan, we used to regularly carry out what are called presence patrols, where there was no purpose or mission other than to be present in the space and normalizing that we were there and letting people know, oh, if you act up, we're here and we're watching. LONSDORF: NPR reached out to the White House for comment on this story. Spokesperson Abigail Jackson asserted that Trump's deployments are lawful and necessary to, quote, \"protect federal assets and personnel following violent left-wing riots.\" Back in that library room in Ohio, as we're wrapping up our conversation, I ask all three Guard members if they have a final thought. C: I swore an oath to the Constitution, not a person. And I just feel like - I don't know. I just really, really implore my peers and everybody outside looking in to just think about that. A: Because if - the moment that we stop asking the questions, then everything falls on their face. J: There's troops all across the military with their own kind of feelings, reasons for, do I or don't I, you know? So I hope that those people can all connect. LONSDORF: One way to do that - start a group chat. Kat Lonsdorf, NPR News, Ohio.

The justices, without comment, turned away an appeal from Kim Davis , the former Kentucky court clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the high court’s 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. Davis had been trying to get the court to overturn a lower-court order for her to pay $360,000 in damages and attorney’s fees to a couple denied a marriage license. The Supreme Court has rejected a call to overturn its landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Here’s what to know. Her lawyers repeatedly invoked the words of Justice Clarence Thomas, who alone among the nine justices has called for erasing the same-sex marriage ruling. Thomas was among four dissenting justices in 2015. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito are the other dissenters who are on the court today. Roberts has been silent on the subject since he wrote a dissenting opinion in the case. Alito has continued to criticize the decision, but he said recently he was not advocating that it be overturned. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was not on the court in 2015, has said that there are times when the court should correct mistakes and overturn decisions, as it did in the 2022 case that ended a constitutional right to abortion .

She defied court orders to issue the licenses until a federal judge jailed her for contempt of court in September 2015. She was released after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form. The Kentucky legislature later enacted a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses.

These warnings, introduced in 2002 following the Women's Health Initiative study, previously highlighted increased risks of cancer, dementia, heart attacks, and strokes. However, newer research—including a 2023 study published in *Cancer* and analyses of studies from 1966 to 2003—shows that early initiation of hormone therapy can actually reduce risks of Alzheimer’s disease, heart attacks, and hip fractures. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary asserts that the therapy is life-saving and that women have been unfairly denied access due to fear of risk.

The prominent warnings said these therapies could raise the risks for some cancers, dementia, heart attacks and strokes.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The FDA today is announcing that we are going to stop the fear machine steering women away from this life-changing, even lifesaving treatment,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said during a  press conference  Monday. \"The FDA is taking action to remove the black box warnings from estrogen related products. This is based on a robust review of the latest scientific evidence.\" It was time for a change, Makary told NPR's  All Things Considered , because women have \"been denied or never offered hormone replacement therapy despite the profound short term and long term benefits.\" ( Watch the interview above. ) Instead of black box warnings on labels, he said, the agency wants to see a nuanced explanation of potential risks appear in a packaging insert: \"The idea is to get better information in front of women.\" The label change will make estrogen products more accessible to perimenopausal women and improve their lives, said  Dr. Steven Fleischman ,   president of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, or ACOG,  in a statement .  \"The updated labels will better allow patients and clinicians to engage in a shared decision-making process, without an unnecessary barrier, when it comes to treatment of menopausal symptoms.\" Though he added that the medical organization's official guidance on estrogen therapy hasn't changed because it has \"long advised\" its members to talk to patients about their unique risks. The FDA convened an expert panel in July to discuss removing them from at least low-dose vaginal estrogen. The agency then  opened a docket  to solicit comments from the public and received nearly 3,000 by the Sept. 24 deadline. In its formal comment, ACOG wrote that it has \"long encouraged\" the agency to reevaluate warning labels on low-dose estrogen products administered vaginally, but it considers those separate from systemic estrogen products that deliver the hormone throughout the body, such as pills and patches. ACOG's Fleischman said in Monday's statement that, \"like all medications, systemic estrogen products are not without risk, and their use should be based on an individualized conversation between patients and their clinicians.\" Doctors had gone back and forth about the risks versus benefits of hormone therapy for years. In 2002, researchers rang the alarm about them because a long-term study called  the Women's Health Initiative  found that hormone therapy was associated with increased risk of cancer and stroke. Since then, additional research has shown those risks were overstated, and the therapy can instead reduce heart disease when prescribed earlier. \"Fifty million women since that study 23 years ago have been denied or never offered or talked out of the life changing lifesaving benefits of hormone replacement therapy – including my mom,\" Makary said during the press conference Monday about the label changes. Makary added doctors are often taught in medical school that menopause is mild and lasts a few years, but that's wrong. \"The symptoms occur in over 80% of women. They last, on average, eight years. And for many women, they are severe, even debilitating: mood swings, night sweats, weight gain, hot flashes, divorce.\" Although doctors have pushed to have the black box warnings removed, they say the special panel the FDA convened in July deviated from the usual process for making such changes and lacked the rigor of the usual approach. \"While we appreciate the FDA Expert Panel's interest in reevaluating the label warnings on hormone therapy, a brief panel such as the two-hour July 17th Expert Panel should not be considered an adequate substitute for an advisory committee meeting,\" ACOG wrote in its formal comment to the agency. FDA advisory committees are made up of independent experts who evaluate scientific presentations, discuss and debate the evidence on a given topic and then vote on recommendations for the FDA. The agency doesn't always follow its committees' recommendations, but it usually does. \"Forgoing the advisory committee process runs counter to the Agency's stated goal to increase transparency.\" ACOG writes. \"Therefore, ACOG urges the FDA to delve deeper into the benefits of low-dose vaginal estrogen for [genitourinary syndrome of menopause] and systemic estrogen therapy for vasomotor symptoms by convening separate advisory committee meetings, including opportunities for public engagement, before making decisions on possible labeling changes for these distinct menopausal hormone therapy options.\" Makary said during the press conference that the agency chose not to have an advisory committee meeting, \"because [advisory committees] are bureaucratic, long, often conflicted and very expensive.\" He said his FDA is doing more expert panels instead, which are less strict and can be more spontaneous but remain robust. In an email to NPR, the agency shared several studies in support of its decision. The studies showed that these hormone therapies reduced the risk of  Alzheimer's disease ,  heart attack  and  hip fracture . The findings aren't new, however, and were published between 1980 and 1996. The agency also cited an  analysis of 30 studies  from 1966 through 2003 that showed starting hormone replacement therapy earlier could save lives. It was published in 2004. During the press conference, Makary held up a study he said was published in the medical journal  Cancer  from three years ago that showed a decrease in coronary heart disease among women using hormone replacement therapy. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/bonnie-watson-coleman-new-jersey-house-reelection-d1b73b4b501146dee9583e17de52aebe","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:51:38+00:00","title":"Bonnie Watson Coleman Announces She Will Not Seek Reelection","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Bonnie Watson Coleman, the first Black woman elected to represent New Jersey in the U.S. House of Representatives, has announced she will not seek reelection in 2025.

speech he made was edited in a documentary aired by Britain’s national broadcaster. BBC chairman Samir Shah on Monday apologized for the “error of judgment,” which triggered the resignations of the BBC’s top executive and its head of news. Director-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing of a speech Trump delivered on Jan. 6, 2021, before a crowd of his supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington. The hourlong documentary — titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” — was broadcast as part of the BBC’s “Panorama” series days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. Shah said the broadcaster accepted “that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.” Related Stories How scandals at the BBC have rocked its leadership over the years 2 MIN READ Furor over editing of Trump speech sparks ‘existential crisis’ at the BBC 5 MIN READ Top BBC bosses resign after criticism of the broadcaster’s editing of a Trump speech 4 MIN READ A letter from Trump attorney Alejandro Brito demands the BBC “retract the false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements,” apologize and “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused,” or face legal action for $1 billion in damages. The BBC said it would review the letter “and respond directly in due course.” Top executives quit Trump had earlier welcomed the resignations of the two BBC executives. He posted a link to a Daily Telegraph story about the speech-editing on his Truth Social network, thanking the newspaper “for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” He called that “a terrible thing for Democracy!” In a resignation letter to staff, Davie said: “There have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility.” Turness said the controversy was damaging the BBC, and she quit “because the buck stops with me.” She defended the organization’s journalists against allegations of bias. “Our journalists are hardworking people who strive for impartiality, and I will stand by their journalism,” she said Monday. “There is no institutional bias. Mistakes are made, but there’s no institutional bias.” Trump speech edited Pressure on the broadcaster’s top executives has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph published parts of a dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. As well as the Trump edit, it criticized the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. The “Panorama” episode showed an edited clip from the January 2021 speech in which Trump claimed the 2020 presidential election had been rigged. Trump is shown saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” According to video and a transcript from Trump’s comments that day , he said:  “I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. “Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.” Trump used the “fight like hell” phrase toward the end of the speech, but without referencing the Capitol. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said. In a letter to Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Shah said the purpose of editing Trump’s words had been “to convey the message of the speech” so that viewers could understand how it had been received by Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground. He said the program had not attracted “significant audience feedback” when it first aired but had drawn more than 500 complaints since Prescott’s dossier was made public. Shah acknowledged in a BBC interview that “it would have been better to have acted earlier. But we didn’t.” A national institution The 103-year-old BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters — and criticism from its commercial rivals — because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households who watch live TV or any BBC content. The broadcaster is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed. It’s frequently a political football, with conservatives seeing a leftist slant in its news output and some liberals accusing it of having a conservative bias. It has also been criticized from all angles over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. In February, the BBC removed a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of an official in the Hamas-led government. Governments of both left and right have long been accused of meddling with the broadcaster, which is overseen by a board that includes both BBC nominees and government appointees. Some defenders of the BBC allege that members of the board appointed under previous Conservative governments have been undermining the corporation from within. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesman, Tom Wells, said the center-left Labour Party government supports “a strong, independent BBC” and doesn’t think the broadcaster is biased. “But it is important that the BBC acts to maintain trust and corrects mistakes quickly when they occur,” he said. ___ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed from Washington."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5602065","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"People want to avoid ultra-processed foods.

But experts struggle to define them \n         By Maria Godoy \n        \n           Monday, November 10, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The American  diet is killing us . On that point, public health experts largely agree. And in recent years, people who want to make Americans healthier — across the ideological spectrum — are targeting ultra-processed foods, which make up the  majority of what Americans eat . Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said these foods are \" poisoning \" Americans and blames them for the chronic disease epidemic. California last month became the first U.S. state to  ban certain ultra-processed foods  from school lunches. And the Trump administration is working on its own  definition of ultra-processed foods  to help guide federal policy — and consumers. One  recent survey  found the majority of U.S. shoppers say they're trying to avoid these foods. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But here's the dilemma: Public health and nutrition experts don't agree on a definition of ultra-processed foods that will actually help make Americans healthier. 'They're not all junk foods' The term ultra-processed food was developed by Brazilian researchers to describe the level of processing foods undergo. They came up with the  NOVA classification system . On one end of the spectrum, there's unprocessed or minimally processed foods — such as an apple or frozen peas. On the other end, there's ultra-processed foods, which are made from manufactured ingredients and contain additives like artificial colors, flavors, emulsifiers and preservatives. Think processed deli meats, packaged cookies and candies, sweetened beverages and frozen ready meals. \"It's about additives and processing methods that aren't used in home cooking,\" says  Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian , head of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University. He says nearly 100 observational studies and three different randomized controlled trials have linked overconsumption of ultra-processed foods to a host of health harms — including an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, obesity,  cardiovascular disease ,  certain cancers  and even  depression. But not all foods that fit the definition of ultra-processed are unhealthy, says  Julia Wolfson , an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       For instance, packaged whole grain breads, plant-based milks and some yogurts are considered ultra-processed, but they can be beneficial for health. One study noted that yogurts were linked to a  lower risk of colorectal cancer , even if they had added sugar. Other studies have found  ultra-processed whole grain breads  are linked to a lower risk of  Type 2 diabetes  and  cardiovascular disease . And some of these foods can save time and money when cooking at home, such as jarred pasta sauce. \"They're not all junk foods,\" Wolfson says, so any health policy or regulation shouldn't treat them all the same. \"I think it's important to identify foods that are of most concern for health, and not just treat all ultra-processed foods with the same broad brush.\" But which foods do you focus on? That's a big point of contention. Should we target the nutrients? On one side of the debate you have people like  Dr. David Ludwig , a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center Boston Children's Hospital. He thinks the focus should be   on the overall nutritional quality of foods, not the processing. He argues that the concept of ultra-processed foods is too imprecise and can stigmatize healthy food while giving unhealthy food a false health halo. For example, he says, a low-sugar packaged cereal with added protein would be considered ultra-processed, but plain cornflakes are considered minimally processed — even if you pour a bunch of sugar on top at home. He says he'd much rather see kids eating the former breakfast. The same thing goes with additives. While some additives, such as emulsifiers, have been linked to disruptions in the gut microbiome, others, such as added dietary fiber, are helpful or benign, Ludwig says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"There are healthful ultra-processed foods and then there are unhealthy ultra-processed foods,\" Ludwig says. If the category is so diverse, \"what's the purpose of the concept in the first place?\" He worries that by targeting this one food category, we could end up with something similar to the  'fat-free' era of the 1980s and '90s . That resulted in a surge of low-fat, high-carb packaged snack foods, which were often loaded with sugar. Instead of focusing on ultra-processed foods,  he says it makes more sense  to target nutrients of concern with decades of evidence of harm. Chief among them are highly processed carbohydrates such as added sugars and refined grains like white rice, he says. The Institute of Food Technologists, which represents food scientists around the globe, has endorsed a similar approach. In comments submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture,  IFT called for a definition  that focuses on the nutritional quality of food — such as whether foods are high in salt, sugar and fat — not on the degree of processing. But can you really ignore the processing? Any definition that ignores the role of processing is missing the big picture, says Mozaffarian of Tufts University. While ultra-processed foods do tend to be high in salt, sugar and refined starches, \"that's not the whole story.\" He says,\"there's something about the processing itself that's important.\" High levels of processing alter the physical and chemical structure of foods in ways that change how our bodies digest them, Mozaffarian says. \"We have now molecularly disassembled and reassembled foods in a way that's never been done before in human history.\" Think cheese puffs, which are pretty unrecognizable from the corn meal they start with. \"When you lose natural, intact structure, you get  very, very rapid digestion  of the food in the stomach and small intestine,\" Mozaffarian says. \"So you get bursts of sugar and highly processed starch in your bloodstream.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Over time, these sugar spikes increase the risk of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, the rapid digestion of food means fewer nutrients reach your lower intestine, where the vast majority of our gut microbes live. So you end up starving your gut microbiome. And that's  not good for health  because gut microbes break down food that your body can't digest and in turn, they produce chemical messengers that influence everything from your   blood sugar levels  to your immune system. And evidence suggests our bodies  absorb more calories  from ultra-processed foods than they do from high-fiber whole foods. Mozaffarian says more research is needed to work out the exact mechanisms linking ultra-processed foods to health harms, but he thinks \"we know enough to start taking action.\" So what's a consumer to do? For now, there's no avoiding the fact that the majority of the foods sold in grocery stores are ultra-processed, says Wolfson of Johns Hopkins. And for many people, these foods are often the more affordable and accessible option. If the Trump administration truly wants to help Americans become healthier again, Wolfson says it also needs to adopt policies that help people afford healthier options. In the meantime, she says there are ways to make smarter choices within the ultra-processed category. For example, when shopping for packaged breads, look for whole grain options. And try to reduce consumption of sugar and artificially sweetened beverages and processed meats, two food categories that are  most strongly linked to health harms . And she says, get in the habit of reading ingredient lists. If it's really long and full of emulsifiers, dyes, and colorings, try to find an alternative product \"with the fewest of those ingredients that you don't know and can't pronounce.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       You might not always find an option that's not ultra-processed but you can \"try to maximize the nutrition and minimize the processed ingredients,\" she says. \"It's a tradeoff.\" Eat as many whole foods as you can. Beans, frozen fruits and vegetables are often more affordable options. Ultimately, though, \"If all the experts are disagreeing right now about exactly what to do, imagine what it's like for the average consumer?\" Mozaffarian says. That's why he  wants to see federal policy  to provide guidance. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5587875","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:04:00-05:00","title":"Who Has President Trump Pardoned and Why?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Trump has issued a series of pardons and commutations during his second term, including to former aides Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, former U.S. Rep.

It comes after recent clemency grants from Trump to former U.S. Rep. George Santos and an ex-CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       While former President Joe Biden still holds the record of 4,245 clemency actions, Trump's second-term pardons and commutations are notable for their political and personal connections to the president, says Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University. \"There's more of a sense of the insider pardon than we've seen previously,\" Meyler said. In mid-October, Trump  commuted the prison sentence  of Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who  pleaded guilty  to wire fraud and identity theft last year. Days later the president  handed a full and unconditional pardon  to Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Binance has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, but Trump said in an interview with  60 Minutes  that he  does not know who Zhao is . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       U.S. presidents are given broad authority to nullify convictions or sentences for federal crimes without the involvement of Congress or the Supreme Court. The legal principle is a holdover from English law, in which  the king had  what was known as the \"prerogative of mercy\" as early as the seventh century. While Trump has granted clemency to a wide range of people convicted of federal crimes, from nonviolent drug offenders to white-collar criminals, his first term in office was also marked by several notable  pardons of political allies  and grants of clemency to people  whose cases were advocated for by celebrities  or friends. Both of those trends have been amplified during his second term, Meyler said. \"He's much more explicit about making political statements through the use of the pardon power,\" Meyler said of Trump's second-term pardons and commutations. She said that includes granting clemency for people who have supported his political career as well as public statements he's made about why a particular crime shouldn't be punished. Trump's pardons align with his politics … Trump is by no means the first president to show leniency to a political ally. President Bill Clinton  pardoned Mark Rich , a former hedge-fund manager whose ex-wife had donated  hundreds of thousands of dollars  to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign. And President George W. Bush  commuted the sentence  of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. During his first four years in office,  Trump pardoned  his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, commuted the sentence of his friend and political confidant Roger Stone and pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared. In his second term, Trump \"has taken the same norm-busting approach to pardons as he has in other areas,\" Jeffrey Crouch, a professor of American politics at American University, told NPR via email. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Crouch pointed to Trump's move on inauguration day this year to  pardon some 1,500 defendants  (and commute the sentences of several others) convicted of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, siege on the U.S. Capitol in support of Trump's effort to overturn his electoral loss the previous fall. For comparison, Trump granted a total of 238 acts of clemency in his first term,  according to the Pew Research Center . Crouch said many presidents have waited until the \"lame duck\" period at the end of their terms to issue potentially controversial clemency grants — but not Trump. \"He did not shy away from granting early or controversial pardons and commutations in his first term, either.\" Politics have always been entwined with the U.S. clemency process, but past presidents have often used pardons as a way  to heal political divisions . George Washington pardoned some of those involved in the Whiskey Rebellion, while Jimmy Carter granted a blanket pardon to people who had evaded service  in the Vietnam War . The Trump administration has used clemency to benefit some of its political backers. In May, Trump pardoned  former Virginia Sheriff Scott Jenkins , an ardent Trump supporter who was convicted of taking bribes from local businessmen in exchange for auxiliary deputy badges. The day the pardon was announced, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin  posted on X : \"No MAGA left behind.\" And when Trump pardoned Santos earlier this month, the president  said on social media  that Santos had \"the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" The founders envisioned impeachment as one check on what is otherwise a nearly absolute presidential power, but Trump has  faced virtually no criticism from fellow Republicans  for his pardons and commutations. Past presidents have also taken flak from voters for their clemency decisions. Gerald Ford's approval rating  fell by more than 20 points  after he pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974, and he lost the presidential election two years later to Carter. … and his political frustrations While Santos and Jenkins are both Trump supporters, they also fall into another category of criminal that comes up with some regularity in Trump's clemency choices: public officials of both parties convicted of corruption. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Trump in February  issued a full pardon  for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, after having commuted Blagojevich's prison sentence during his first term as president. Former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld  received his own pardon  in May following his conviction on federal bribery and attempted extortion charges in 2022. Both men are Democrats. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  said in June  that Trump had pardoned a total of 16 former elected officials convicted of corruption charges. Meyler, the Stanford professor, said Trump, who has characterized  his own recent prosecutions  as politically motivated, may view the cases of political corruption against other politicians as similarly unjust. \"Maybe it's not too much of a stretch to think that Trump feels that he was prosecuted for similar kinds of offenses and then is kind of looking out at the landscape of political figures who have been prosecuted and, you know, potentially identifies with the plight of some of them,\" she said. In an emailed statement to NPR, the White House contrasted Trump's approach to the clemency process with former President Joe Biden's, alluding to criticism from Trump and his allies over Biden's use of an autopen to issue pardons and sign other official documents. (In June, Trump  ordered an investigation  into Biden's use of the autopen.) \"It's not difficult to be more involved in the pardon process when your predecessor was an autopen,\" said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. \"President Trump has exercised his constitutional authority to issue pardons and commutations for a variety of individuals.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Jackson also alluded to the lame-duck pardon Biden granted to his son Hunter, as well as Biden's  commutations of 37 federal death row prisoners . Biden said he made those commutations due to his objections to capital punishment at the federal level — and his worry that Trump would lift the moratorium he put on federal executions. \"And the only pardons anyone should be critical of are from President Autopen, who pardoned and commuted sentences of violent criminals including child killers and mass murderers – and that's not to mention the proactive pardons he 'signed' for his family members like Hunter on his way out the door,\" Jackson added. What is the clemency process under Trump? Getting his ear may help Though it's not the only path to securing a pardon or commutation, the official process for seeking clemency is to submit a formal application to the U.S. pardon attorney. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Martin, the current pardon attorney, was appointed by Trump after the president  withdrew his nomination  to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in the face of Republican opposition. The  Trump administration fired  the former pardon attorney, Liz Oyer, in March after she refused to restore the gun rights of actor and Trump supporter Mel Gibson, who had been convicted of domestic violence. Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, said it's unclear whether the formal process is currently resulting in clemency grants in any significant numbers. \"Right now we know that there's still a mailbox, and that there are petitions going into that mailbox,\" he said. \"What we don't know is what happens after that.\" Osler said concerns about the clemency application process — or lack thereof — predated Trump's second term. He said Biden also issued pardons to political allies and personal connections he thought Trump may target,  including his son Hunter . \"So those norms were being strained and broken before Trump took office, but he certainly has continued that trend,\" he said. Osler, who runs a clinic where he and his students file petitions for people seeking clemency, said it's raising questions among those seeking clemency about their odds of success by following the traditional path to obtain a pardon or commutation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I think people are focusing very much on how upset they are about who's receiving grants,\" he said. \"But we need to focus as well on who's not getting grants — those people who have done a long term in prison, who have rehabilitated themselves, often done incredible things in prison. And they're being ignored in their plea for mercy.\" Trump  appointed Alice Johnson  as his \"pardon czar\" in February. Johnson was pardoned for a nonviolent drug offense by Trump during his first term after her story got the attention and advocacy of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian. Johnson said she was going to \"fight for those who are still incarcerated, who don't have a voice like I have right now.\" She  told Fox News  in May that she'd sent more than 100 clemency petitions to the White House and \"over 46 people really were able to get a second chance in life.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/climate-brazil-trump-disasters-cooperation-cop30-ae09566d32a8a97a954b2cef831de503","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:07:28+00:00","title":"U.S. Absence at COP30 Climate Summit Sparks Global Concern Amid Record Weather Disasters","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, global leaders convened to discuss the implementation of climate commitments, highlighting recent extreme weather events such as Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica, tornadoes in Brazil, and typhoons in Southeast Asia.

recent weather disasters rang long Monday at the opening of U.N. climate negotiations : Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica, a deadly tornado in Brazil , droughts and fire in Africa. Against that backdrop, activists used an empty chair to drive home the absence from these talks of the United States, the world’s richest nation and second-biggest carbon polluter. World leaders highlighted the devastation wrought on some of the world’s poorest places to show the need to work collectively to fight global warming , which is fueling extreme weather. But any united front will be without the U.S., one of only four nations missing the talks, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar. The 195 nations who did come to Belem, a weathered city on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, for the talks known as COP30 were told that only together can they swiftly reduce the emissions from coal, oil and gas that cause climate change. While the activists’ empty chair primarily illustrated the U.S. absence, it was also intended to be a call-out for other nations “to step in and step up,” Danni Taaffe with Climate Action Network International told The Associated Press.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More A clear mandate Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , whose nation is hosting these talks, urged negotiators not to forget that “the climate emergency is an increase of inequality.” “It deepens the perverse logic that defines who is worthy of living and who should die,” Lula said. This year’s talks are not expected to produce an ambitious new deal. Instead, organizers and analysts frame this year’s conference as the “implementation COP.” Countries had a clear mandate: arrive with their updated national plans to fight climate change. On Monday, the United Nations released updated calculations showing that those national pledges promise to reduce projected 2035 global greenhouse gas emissions 12% below 2019 levels. That’s 2 points better than last month, before new pledges rolled in. Attendees on Monday stressed cooperation, with Stiell saying that individual nations simply cannot cut heat-trapping gas emissions fast enough on their own. André Corrêa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasized that negotiators must engage in “mutirão” — a local Indigenous term that refers to a group uniting to complete a task. A united front — without the US Complicating those calls is the absence of the United States, where U.S. President Donald Trump has long denied the existence of climate change. The U.N.'s updated figures Monday depend on a U.S. pledge that came from the Biden administration in December — before Trump returned to the White House and began working to boost fossil fuels and block clean energy like wind and solar. His administration did not send high-level negotiators to Belem, and he began his second term by withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement , the first global pact to fight climate change. The Paris Agreement sought to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the historical average, but many scientists now say it’s unlikely countries will stay below that threshold. The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S. Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States, said the U.S. withdrawal “has really shifted the gravity’’ of the negotiating system. Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said. “It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” he said. Though the U.S. government isn’t showing up, some attendees including former top U.S. negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will help take up the slack.

Typhoon Fung-wong blew out of the northwestern Philippines on Monday after causing floods, landslides, power outages and at least 18 deaths. The typhoon weakened into a tropical storm over the South China Sea and was moving northwest toward Taiwan, where it could hit Thursday. Fung-wong lashed the northern Philippines after Typhoon Kalmaegi struck central provinces last week, leaving at least 232 people dead, and later hitting Vietnam, where at least five were killed. Fung-wong was a super typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph) when it made landfall Sunday in northeastern Aurora province. The 1,800-kilometer (1,100-mile)-wide storm weakened as it raked through mountainous northern provinces and agricultural plains overnight before blowing into the South China Sea, according to state forecasters.

people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders , according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that “this highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.” Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would “far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined” to the country. The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money. The State Department declined to comment on the details of diplomatic communications, but said, “Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State. As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.” Related Stories How Trump’s support for a white minority group in South Africa led to a US boycott of the G20 summit 4 MIN READ The Latest: Bill to end government shutdown passes the Senate, heads to House next for final vote 20 MIN READ Trump hosts Syria’s al-Sharaa for a first-of-its-kind meeting at the White House 4 MIN READ As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust. The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the “third country” policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption. At the same time, the Trump administration has developed ties with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro “Teddy” Nguema Obiang , who is notorious among world leaders accused of corruption for a lavish lifestyle that has attracted the attention of prosecutors in several countries . The AP has reported that the State Department granted a sanctions waiver to allow him to travel to a high-level U.N. gathering in New York in September and visit other American cities. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also met with Obiang . Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there. Obiang is the son and presumed successor of Equatorial Guinea’s longtime ruler. He’s accused of decades of corruption and abuse of power. The vice president, who oversees national defense and security, has been under international sanctions for years and faces allegations of siphoning state wealth while most people live in poverty. Despite Equatorial Guinea’s oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Obiang’s father, is Africa’s longest-serving president , holding power since 1979. In 2017, a French court found the younger Obiang guilty of laundering and embezzling millions of euros, handing down a three-year suspended sentence and a 30 million euro fine as well as ordering the confiscation of his luxury Paris properties and car collection worth tens of millions. Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice. U.S. prosecutors also reached a $30 million settlement with Obiang in 2014. He had to surrender assets, including a Malibu mansion, a Ferrari and Michael Jackson memorabilia. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/wyoming-grand-teton-trump-pardon-sunseri-069f5c73442c07787729e8a84bc62edc","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:30:00+00:00","title":"Trump Pardons Trail Runner for Off-Trail Run on Grand Teton","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump pardoned Michelino Sunseri, a 33-year-old trail runner, for a misdemeanor conviction stemming from his record-setting 13.3-mile run up and down Grand Teton in 2024.

(AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday pardoned a trail runner who briefly took a prohibited trail on his way to a record time up and down the tallest peak in the Teton Range of western Wyoming. The pardon for Michelino Sunseri, unlike recent pardons of Trump allies, appeared apolitical. Sunseri, 33, ran up and down Grand Teton, the 13,775-foot (4,200-meter) centerpiece of the iconic Teton Range, in 2 hours, 50 minutes, 50 seconds in 2024. It was an epic feat: The run covered 13.3 miles (21.4 kilometers), gaining 7,000 feet (2,133 meters) in elevation, then back down again in western Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park. But on the way down, Sunseri left a switchback to avoid casual hikers. Going off-trail in a national park is considered a no-no because it can cause erosion, especially when a shortcut over time becomes a popular way to go. Sunseri, who was open about taking the two-minute detour, got a misdemeanor conviction from a judge in September. Before the pardon, prosecutors agreed to seek dismissal if Sunseri completed 60 hours of community service and a course on wilderness stewardship, according to Sunseri’s attorneys.

2025-11-10T18:52:36+00:00\n\nLONDON (AP) — The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning. The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and “fight like hell.” The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an “error of judgment.” A letter from Trump’s attorney threatened legal action , demanding that the broadcaster “retract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements” and compensate the president for the harm caused. Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting. “This is an existential crisis for the BBC,” said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George’s University of London. “In capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it’s relatively easy to cow the BBC.” Related Stories Britain’s once-mighty Conservative Party is battling to avoid extinction 5 MIN READ Starmer argues for inclusive patriotism and accuses Farage of trying to divide Britain 4 MIN READ Treasury chief says wars and tariffs are harming the UK’s economic outlook 3 MIN READ That is “incredibly dangerous” in an increasingly polarized environment “where the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,” she warned. A look at the scandal, past criticism of the BBC and uncertainty about its future: Accusations of institutional bias The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC. The memo raised concerns over how the BBC’s “Panorama” documentary program edited a speech by Trump. The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.

The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster’s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. Longstanding criticism from the right Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined “Trump goes to war with ‘fake news’ BBC.” Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were “corrupt” and “dishonest” and “tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage , told a news conference that the BBC “has been institutionally biased for decades” to loud applause from supporters. In recent months, the corporation came under sustained criticism from all sides over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, including its livestreaming of a rap duo’s chants calling for “death to the IDF” (Israel Defense Forces) at this year’s Glastonbury festival. It also had to remove a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of a Hamas official. Charles Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, alleged that the BBC has a consistent bias, “always from a sort of metropolitan, left position” on trans issues, as well as its coverage of race, Trump, Israel and Gaza. “I’m not, of course, saying that it should be right-wing either,” Moore said. “I’m saying it should take impartiality seriously and put in people capable of running this gigantic and self-satisfied bureaucracy.” Posetti disagreed and said the BBC, like many other news outlets, is under attack from right-wing voices and the Trump administration. She acknowledged the editing mistakes but said it is wrong to call the broadcaster fake news “when patently it is not.” “I’m not suggesting that there weren’t errors made, but I think that those errors needed to be addressed head-on, clearly and transparently and in a very timely manner.” Instead, she said, the resignations will have a “destabilizing effect.” Staff arrive at BBC Broadcasting House in London, Monday Nov. 10, 2025.

In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.

The corporation is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial and independent. It is not a state broadcaster beholden to the U.K. government. Its model has inspired the CBC in Canada, the ABC in Australia and other publicly funded outlets, Posetti said. Known affectionately — or mockingly — as “Auntie,” the BBC began in the 1920s and changed the history of television when many Britons bought a TV set specifically to watch the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. It still devotes more time and resources than other outlets to events such as the death of the monarch in 2022. Outside the U.K. the BBC World Service operates in over 40 languages and is one of Britain’s most significant cultural exports. Apart from news, it retains a huge global viewership with popular entertainment shows, including “Doctor Who,” “The Traitors” and “Strictly Come Dancing” and their spinoffs. Ahead of the renewal of its charter in the next few years, many critics have questioned whether the license fee model is still viable at a time when viewers are turning to streaming competitors, YouTube and social media. The BBC has lost millions of pounds as more households stopped paying the fee in recent years. “This is the BBC’s last chance,” Farage said. “If the BBC doesn’t now get a grip … then I think what you would see within the next couple of years are many, many millions just refusing, just not wanting to have the license fee.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-opens-in-brazil-with-calls-for-unity-amid-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:01:12+00:00","title":"COP30 opens in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) has opened in Belem, Brazil, with global leaders emphasizing the need for unity and immediate action to combat climate change.

Brazilian city of Belem, with leaders calling for countries to take a united approach against global warming.\n\n“In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another – your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” the UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, told delegates on Monday.\n\nSome 50,000 people from more than 190 countries are expected to attend the 12-day event, which is being held at the edge of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.\n\nAddressing the conference, Stiell said that previous climate talks had helped, but that there was “much more work to do”.\n\nThe UN climate boss noted that countries would have to move “much, much faster” in driving down greenhouse gas emissions. “Lamenting is not a strategy. We need solutions,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as a new UN analysis of countries’ climate plans found that the pledged reductions fall far short of the drop needed by 2035 to limit temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nIf this threshold is breached, the world will experience far more severe impacts than it has so far, experts say.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stressed at the start of COP30.\n\nBrazil’s leader condemned those seeking to undermine efforts to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“They attack institutions, they attack science and universities,” he said. “It’s time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers.”\n\nThe United States is not sending any delegates to COP30 in keeping with President Donald Trump’s anti-climate change stance.\n\n“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” the US’s former special envoy for climate, Todd Stern, said of the Trump administration’s decision.\n\nCOP30 President Andre Correa do Lago said the US’s absence “has opened some space for the world to see what developing countries are doing”.\n\nPablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru, urged world leaders to do more than simply give pledges at this year’s conference.\n\n“We want to make sure that they don’t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,” he said.\n\nIn a letter to COP30 that was published on Monday, dozens of scientists expressed their fears about the melting of glaciers, ice sheets and other frozen parts of the planet.\n\n“The cryosphere is destabilising at an alarming pace,” they wrote. “Geopolitical tensions or short-term national interests must not overshadow COP30.

2025-10-27T07:34:31+00:00\n\nTitle: Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?\n\nThe mass-produced COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-militants-ptt-afghanistan-border-8ddc968217dec7c18bc039808a618d01","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:51:57+00:00","title":"Pakistani Security Forces Kill 20 Taliban Insurgents Amid Escalated Tensions with Afghanistan","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Pakistani security forces conducted raids in the northwest region, killing 20 Pakistani Taliban insurgents, including 8 in North Waziristan and 12 in Dara Adam Khel.

2025-11-10T14:51:57+00:00\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani security forces killed 20 Pakistani Taliban insurgents in raids on hideouts in the northwest region bordering Afghanistan, the military said Monday, as tensions between the two countries escalated. Separately, militants including a suicide bomber tried to storm a cadet college in Wana, a city in the South Waziristan district also in the northwest, triggering a gunbattle that killed at least two of the attackers, the military said. Pakistan and Afghanistan blamed each other for the collapse of a third round of peace talks in Istanbul over the weekend. The negotiations, facilitated by Qatar and Turkey, began last month following deadly border clashes that killed dozens of soldiers and civilians on both sides. Pakistan’s military described the slain militants as “Khwarij,” a term the government uses for the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which is designated as a terrorist organization by both the United States and the United Nations. It said eight militants were killed Sunday in North Waziristan, a former TTP stronghold in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and 12 others were killed in a separate raid in the Dara Adam Khel district, also in the northwest.

The military said troops killed two attackers and cornered three others in an administrative block. It alleged they were backed by rival India and had handlers in Afghanistan. “Pakistan reserves the right to respond against terrorists and their leadership present in Afghanistan,” it said. Pakistan often claims TTP enjoys India’s backing, a charge New Delhi denies. TTP in a statement denied it was not behind the college attack. TTP is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has been emboldened since the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021. Many TTP leaders and fighters are believed to have taken refuge in Afghanistan since then. TTP often claims attacks in Pakistan, which has seen a surge in militant attacks in recent years. Pakistan often accuses Kabul of turning a blind eye to cross-border attacks by Pakistani militants. Afghanistan’s Taliban government denies the allegation. Tensions between the two countries escalated after Afghanistan blamed Pakistan for Oct. 9 drone strikes in Kabul and vowed retaliation. The ensuing fighting killed dozens of people, including soldiers, civilians and militants, before Qatar brokered a ceasefire on Oct. 19, which remains in place. It was followed for two rounds of talks in Istanbul, with the latest dialogue held on Thursday. But the talks ended without agreement after Kabul refused to provide a written assurance that the TTP and other militant groups would not be allowed to use its territory against Pakistan. On Monday, Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said Kabul remains committed to preventing its territory from being used against any country. However, he blamed Pakistan for the stalemate, saying its delegation made “completely unacceptable demands.” His comments followed a statement Sunday by Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which also said it remains committed dialogue but its core concern regarding “terrorism emanating from Afghanistan needs to be addressed first and foremost.” In 2022, Kabul had brokered a brief ceasefire between TTP and Pakistan, but TTP later ended it while accusing Pakistan of violating it. Since then, Pakistan has said there will be no talks with TTP and demanded Kabul hand over TTP members to Pakistan if it cannot rein them in. __ Associated Press writers Ishtiaq Mahsud in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, Riaz Khan and Rasool Dawar in Peshawar, Pakistan, contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/21-dead-search-continues-after-refugee-boat-sinks-near-malaysia-thailand","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:28:50+00:00","title":"Refugee boat sinks near Malaysia, Thailand; 21 dead, search continues","category":"Human Rights & Immigration","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A refugee boat carrying Rohingya migrants from Myanmar’s Rakhine state sank near Ko Tarutao island in Thailand, just north of Malaysia’s Langkawi, resulting in at least 21 deaths.

He said that since October 17, the soldiers had removed landmines and laid defensive barbed wire there.\n\nBut the wire was destroyed on Sunday, and the soldiers checking the site on Monday stepped on the mine, Winthai said.\n\n“The evidence led to the conclusion that intruders secretly removed the barbed wire and laid the landmines in the Thai territory, targeting the personnel who conduct regular patrols there,” Winthai said, according to the Bangkok Post.\n\n“The act shows Cambodia’s insincerity in reducing conflict and reflects hostility which violates the jointly signed declaration,” he added.\n\nThe military said a sergeant lost his right foot in the explosion and the other three suffered minor injuries from shrapnel or the impact of the blast.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the US or Malaysia.\n\nWhile the Thai-Cambodian truce has generally held since July 29, both countries have traded allegations of ceasefire breaches.\n\nAnalysts said a more comprehensive peace pact adjudicating the century-long border dispute at the core of the conflict is needed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1356","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"03:23:43+00:00","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,356","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On the 1,356th day of the Russia-Ukraine war, as of November 11, 2025, the conflict continues to evolve with ongoing military engagements, strategic developments, and international responses.

A spokesperson for Syria’s Ministry of Interior had announced on Saturday, as al-Sharaa was set to arrive in the US for his meeting with Trump, that nationwide preemptive operations were carried out targeting ISIL cells.\n\nAccording to state-run Al-Ikhbariah TV, Syrian security forces carried out 61 raids, with 71 people arrested and explosives and weapons seized.\n\nOn Monday, the Reuters news agency quoted unnamed officials as saying that Syria had foiled two ISIL plots to assassinate al-Sharaa.\n\nThe senior Syrian security official and senior Middle Eastern official said the assassination plots were foiled over the past few months.\n\nThey asserted that the schemes underline the direct threat that al-Sharaa faces as he tries to consolidate power in a fragmented country that has been devastated by 14 years of civil war.\n\nThe Syrian leader was praised by Trump during their meeting at the White House as he secured a six-month suspension of US sanctions against his country.\n\nThe 43-year-old president toppled the former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December in a swift armed offensive.\n\nHe formerly led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed group that was an affiliate of al-Qaeda.

Booker Prize for his novel Flesh\n\nHungarian-British writer David Szalay has won the prestigious Booker prize for his novel Flesh, which tells the story of a tortured Hungarian emigre who makes and loses a fortune.\n\nSzalay, 51, beat five other shortlisted authors, including Indian novelist  Kiran Desai  and the United Kingdom’s Andrew Miller, to claim the 50,000 British pound ($65,500) award at a ceremony in London on Monday.\n\nWritten in spare prose, Slazay’s book recounts the life of taciturn Istvan, from a teenage relationship with an older woman through time as a struggling immigrant in the UK to a denizen of London high society.\n\n“A meditation on class, power, intimacy, migration and masculinity, Flesh is a compelling portrait of one man, and the formative experiences that can reverberate across a lifetime,” organisers of the award ceremony in London said in a statement.\n\nAccepting his trophy at London’s Old Billingsgate, Szalay thanked the judges for rewarding his “risky” novel.\n\nHe recalled asking his editor “whether she could imagine a novel called ‘Flesh’ winning the Booker Prize”.\n\n“You have your answer,” he said.\n\nIn addition to the 50,000-pound ($67,000) prize for the winner, as well as 2,500-pound awards to each of the shortlisted authors and translators, the writers also gain a boost in popularity and benefit from increased book sales.\n\nSzalay’s book was chosen from 153 submitted novels by a judging panel that included Irish writer Roddy Doyle and Sex and the City actor Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nDoyle said that Flesh, a book “about living, and the strangeness of living”, emerged as the judges’ unanimous choice after a five-hour meeting.\n\n“We had never read anything quite like it. It is, in many ways, a dark book but it is a joy to read,” said Doyle in a statement.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve read a novel that uses the white space on the page so well. It’s as if the author … is inviting the reader to fill the space, to observe – almost to create – the character with him.”\n\nSzalay, who was born in Canada, raised in the UK and lives in Vienna, was previously a Booker finalist in 2016 for All That Man Is, a series of stories about nine wildly different men.\n\nFlesh was Szalay’s sixth work of fiction.\n\n“Even though my father is Hungarian, I never felt entirely at home in Hungary. I suppose, I’m always a bit of an outsider there, and living away from the UK and London for so many years, I also had a similar feeling about London,” Szalay told BBC Radio.\n\n“I really wanted to write a book that stretched between Hungary and London and involved a character who was not quite at home in either place.”\n\nThe frontrunners for this year’s prize, according to betting markets, were Miller for his early-1960s domestic drama The Land in Winter, and Desai for the globe-spanning saga The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, her first novel since The Inheritance of Loss, which won the Booker Prize in 2006.\n\nThe other finalists were Susan Choi’s twisty family saga, Flashlight; Katie Kitamura’s tale of acting and identity, Audition; and Ben Markovits’s midlife-crisis road trip, The Rest of Our Lives.\n\nThe Booker Prize was founded in 1969 and has established a reputation for transforming writers’ careers.\n\nIts winners have included  Salman Rushdie , Ian McEwan,  Arundhati Roy , Margaret Atwood and Samantha Harvey, who took the 2024 prize for space station story, Orbital.\n\nThe separate category of the International Booker Prize was awarded in May to Indian writer and activist Banu Mushtaq for her novel, Heart Lamp, which tells 12 stories of the everyday lives of women and girls in Muslim communities in southern India."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/delhi-red-fort-blast-kills-13-what-happened-as-police-invoke-terror-law","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:12:14+00:00","title":"Delhi Red Fort blast kills 13: What happened as police invoke ‘terror’ law?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful car explosion occurred in Old Delhi near the Red Fort Metro Station on November 10, 2025, killing at least 13 people and injuring over 20.

blast kills 13: What happened as police invoke ‘terror’ law?\n\nAt least  13 people have been killed  and more than 20 wounded when a car  exploded in New Delhi , India’s capital.\n\nSecurity forces have been placed on high alert across major states and cities as authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the blast on Monday night.\n\nAt 6:52pm (13:52 GMT), a powerful, high-intensity blast tore through a crowded neighbourhood during the evening rush hour.\n\nAccording to Delhi Police, the explosion originated in a moving Hyundai i20 car.\n\n“A slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light. An explosion happened in that vehicle, and due to the explosion, nearby vehicles were also damaged,” Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters.\n\nImages from the scene show shattered windows, mangled vehicles, and fire and smoke rising from burning cars.\n\nPolice later detained the original owner of the car, identified as Mohammad Salman, in Gurugram, Haryana. He bought the vehicle in 2013. Investigators said Salman had subsequently sold the vehicle to another man in New Delhi who in turn sold the car recently. The person Salman sold the car to has also been arrested. However, the car was still registered in Salman’s name and carried a Haryana number plate, according to local media reports.\n\nDelhi Police have invoked India’s primary “counterterrorism” law, registering a case under Sections 16 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) along with provisions of the Explosives Act.\n\nThis means that even though officials have yet to formally confirm the cause of the blast or name suspects, they appear to be treating the explosion as a potential act of terrorism, not just a criminal or accidental blast.\n\nThe explosion occurred in a densely populated part of Old Delhi near the Red Fort Metro Station.\n\nThe blast took place at a traffic signal close to the entrance of the metro station serving the Red Fort (locally known as Lal Qila), one of the city’s most renowned Mughal-era monuments.\n\nThe site lies at a busy intersection linking the Red Fort with the bustling Chandni Chowk Market, where the impact of the explosion was felt.\n\nThe Red Fort itself, constructed by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1546, is an architectural masterpiece that blends Islamic, Persian, Timurid and Hindu design traditions.\n\nThe Red Fort also holds deep national importance because it was from its ramparts that India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, delivered an Independence Day speech on August 15, 1947, marking the end of British colonial rule.\n\nSince then, every year on Independence Day, the Indian prime minister hoists the national flag and addresses the nation from the same spot. This tradition makes the fort a living symbol of India’s sovereignty and freedom.\n\nThe explosion occurred hours after police revealed they had arrested a Kashmiri doctor from Faridabad, also in Haryana, on charges of plotting a “terrorist” attack.\n\nHaryana police said in a statement that they had found 2,900kg (6,393lb) of explosives, 20 timers, two dozen remote controls, a rifle and dozens of live rounds from the premises of the house where the doctor lived. Seven other people accused of helping the doctor were also arrested.\n\nHowever, Indian authorities have so far not confirmed any link between the arrested doctor and the explosion on Monday.\n\nPolice have intensified security checks across the city with a particular focus on railway stations, where incoming vehicles are being thoroughly inspected.\n\nAccording to local media reports, major train stations across India – including those in Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, and in Uttar Pradesh, which borders Delhi – have also been placed on high alert as a precautionary measure.\n\nVideos shared online show the wreckage of several cars scattered along a crowded street in Delhi’s old quarter as police moved in to secure the scene and disperse onlookers.\n\nAccording to New Delhi’s deputy fire chief, the explosion ignited six vehicles and three autorickshaws.\n\nMeanwhile, as authorities respond to the explosion, voters in the eastern  state of Bihar  are heading to the polls in the second and final phase of state elections, marking a significant political event unfolding alongside heightened national security concerns.\n\nAs panic and confusion swept through Old Delhi after the explosion, witnesses described scenes of horror and chaos.\n\n“Suddenly, there was a sound of a blast,” Irfan told Al Jazeera.\n\n“We came running, and we didn’t get too close because we were scared. We saw someone’s hand on the ground. They were completely blown up.”\n\n“I saw someone’s lungs, and I also saw a car’s steering wheel completely damaged. I just cannot express, can’t imagine how their families will deal with this. I cannot describe how big the blast was,” he added.\n\nRelatives of people injured or missing were trying to track down their loved ones.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Nazish Malik said his brother-in-law, Mohsin, an e-rickshaw driver, was missing after the blast.\n\n“After more than 100 calls on his phone, finally someone answered and said that the phone is at the police post at the Red Fort and your relative has been taken to Lok Nayak Hospital,” Malik said.\n\n“When we heard that, we rushed here and got here around 8:30pm. My brother was already here. I got here late but found that the security was so tight, they are not permitting us to go inside,” he added.\n\n“At least announce who is critical and who is dead. You can at least inform that bit,” he said.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi said he has been briefed about the attack by Home Minister Amit Shah and expressed condolences for the lives lost.\n\nCondolences to those who have lost their loved ones in the blast in Delhi earlier this evening.

displaced\n\nTyphoon Fung-wong has moved away from the northwestern Philippines after carving out a trail of devastation, leaving at least 10 people dead and 1.4 million displaced.\n\nKnown in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Uwan, the intense tropical storm was forecast to head northwest towards Taiwan.\n\nFung-wong lashed the northern Philippines while the country was still dealing with the devastation wrought last week by Typhoon Kalmaegi, which killed at least 232 people in central provinces on November 4 before pummelling Vietnam, where at least five people died.\n\nAt least 10 people died due to flash floods, landslides, exposed electrical wires, and a collapsed house in the provinces of Catanduanes, Eastern Samar, Nueva Vizcaya, Mountain Province and Ifugao, disaster-response and provincial officials said.\n\nAmong the dead were three children who were hit by two separate landslides in the mountainous province of Nueva Vizcaya, police told The Associated Press news agency, adding four others were injured. Another landslide in nearby Kalinga province killed two villagers, and two others were missing, provincial officials said late on Monday.\n\nFierce wind and rain flooded at least 132 northern villages, including one where some residents were trapped on their roofs as floodwaters rapidly rose.\n\nMore than 4,100 houses were damaged, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV of the Office of Civil Defense and other officials said.\n\n“While the typhoon has passed, its rains still pose a danger in certain areas” in northern Luzon, including in metropolitan Manila, Alejandro said. “We’ll undertake today rescue, relief and disaster-response operations.”\n\nFung-wong slammed ashore in northeastern Aurora province on Sunday night as a super typhoon with sustained winds of up to 185km/h (115mph) and gusts of up to 230km/h (143mph).\n\nThe 1,800km (1,100-mile)-wide storm weakened as it raked through mountainous northern provinces and agricultural plains overnight before blowing away from the province of La Union into the South China Sea, according to state forecasters.\n\nMore than 1.4 million people moved into emergency shelters or the homes of relatives before the typhoon made landfall, and about 240,000 remained in evacuation centres on Tuesday.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency on Thursday due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected damage from Fung-wong.\n\nClimate change is making tropical storms – which are known as hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons depending on  where in the world  they take place – more frequent and extreme, driven in part by warmer oceans that contribute more water vapour and heat.\n\nThe two super typhoons to batter the Philippines in one week come as representatives from governments around the world are gathering in the Brazilian city of Belem for the 30th annual  United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30)  this week.\n\nMany of the countries facing the worst impacts of climate change, like the Philippines, have done the least to contribute to causing the crisis due to their relatively small fossil fuel emissions.\n\nThey are now calling on the countries responsible for the climate crisis, which still spend about  $1 trillion a year  subsidising fossil fuels, to  help pay  for the costs of responding to climate disasters."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/11/delhi-red-fort-blast-live-terrorism-law-invoked-in-india-after-9-killed","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:46:12+00:00","title":"‘Anti-terror’ law invoked after 13 killed in New Delhi car explosion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Indian police in Delhi have invoked an anti-terror law following a car explosion near the historic Red Fort, which killed 13 people.

$1bn lawsuit over edited January 6 speech\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn over an edited clip that has plunged the broadcaster into a public relations crisis and prompted the resignations of two top executives.\n\nIn a letter sent to the BBC, Trump’s legal team has demanded the retraction of “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading, and inflammatory statements” contained in a Panorama documentary aired a week before the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nThe letter, written by Trump’s lawyer Alejandro Brito, gives the BBC until Friday to provide a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary and “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused”, or face legal action in the US state of Florida.\n\n“The BBC is on notice. PLEASE GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY,” says the letter, which was widely circulated on social media.\n\nA BBC spokesperson told Al Jazeera the broadcaster was reviewing the letter and would “respond directly in due course”.\n\nDespite his legal threat, Trump would find it difficult to prove defamation in the US, where the 1st Amendment provides expansive protections of speech.\n\nKyu Ho Youm, a 1st Amendment expert at the University of Oregon, said he was “very doubtful” that Trump would be able to succeed in a suit against the BBC.\n\n“Insofar as what I can tell, the broadcast seems to be factually truthful. Hence, there’s not much falsity in the broadcast,” Youm told Al Jazeera.\n\n“If there’s no actionable falsity, 1st Amendment law is irrelevant. By the way, what’s Trump’s reputation? By every measure, he is more or less ‘libel-proof’ as a convicted felon.”\n\nUS courts are also barred from enforcing foreign judgements that are incompatible with the 1st Amendment, Youm said, limiting Trump’s ability to take a case in a more plaintiff-friendly jurisdiction such as the United Kingdom.\n\n“There’s no chance that the judgement will be enforced, simply because the SPEECH Act of 2010 prohibits it,” he said.\n\nThe BBC documentary, titled Trump: A Second Chance?, has been mired in controversy since the leak of an internal memo that criticised producers for editing Trump’s remarks to make it appear that he had directly encouraged the January 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol.\n\nIn the documentary, Trump is shown saying, “We fight like hell”, directly after telling supporters, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol”.\n\nTrump had actually followed his comments about going to the Capitol with a remark about cheering on “our brave senators and congressmen and women”, and made his “fight like hell” comment nearly an hour later.\n\nThe memo, written by Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC’s standards committee, also accused the broadcaster of suppressing critical coverage of transgender issues and displaying anti-Israel bias within the BBC Arabic service.\n\nThe BBC’s director-general, Tim Davie, and its head of news, Deborah Turness, stepped down on Sunday amid the fallout of the controversy.\n\nTrump welcomed the resignations in a post on Truth Social, accusing the BBC executives of being “corrupt” and “very dishonest people”.\n\nBBC chair Samir Shah on Monday acknowledged that the clip was misleading and apologised for the “error of judgement”, but rejected claims that the broadcaster is institutionally biased.\n\nShah also said the memo did not present “a full picture of the discussions, decisions and actions that were taken” by the standards board in response to concerns raised internally before the leak.\n\nTrump’s legal threat is the latest in a flurry of actions he has taken to punish critical media.\n\nThose moves include defamation claims against outlets, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and ABC News, funding cuts at NPR and PBS, and the removal of Associated Press journalists from the White House press pool."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/11/delhi-red-fort-blast-live-terrorism-law-invoked-in-india-after-9-killed?update=4098592","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:46:12+00:00","title":"‘Anti-terror’ law invoked after 13 killed in New Delhi car explosion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Indian police in Delhi invoked an anti-terror law after a car explosion near the Red Fort killed 13 people, highlighting a potential terrorist act in a historically significant and politically sensitive area.

parliamentary elections  that are marked by apathy and scepticism despite close geopolitical attention.\n\nPolling started across the country at 7am (04:00 GMT) on Tuesday, in a vote that will be closely watched in Iran and the United States.\n\nThe sixth election since the US-led invasion toppled longtime ruler Saddam Hussein in 2003, voting takes place in a relatively stable country.\n\nHowever, many Iraqis have lost hope that elections can bring meaningful change to their daily lives, feeling that the vote benefits only political elites and regional powers.\n\nNearly 21 million Iraqis are eligible to vote across 4,501 polling stations nationwide, reported the Iraqi News Agency (INA).\n\nMore than 7,750 candidates, nearly a third of them women, are running for 329 seats in parliament. Under the law, 25 percent of seats are reserved for women, while nine are allocated for religious minorities.\n\nUnder the electoral law that many believe favours larger parties, just 75 independent candidates are standing.\n\nObservers fear that turnout might dip below the record low of 41 percent in 2021, reflecting voters’ apathy and scepticism in a country marked by entrenched leadership, allegations of mismanagement and endemic corruption.\n\nThe polls will close at 6pm (15:00 GMT), with preliminary results expected within 24 hours.\n\nBy convention in post-invasion Iraq, a Shia Muslim holds the powerful post of prime minister and a Sunni that of parliament speaker, while the largely ceremonial presidency goes to a Kurd.\n\nHowever, few new potential candidates have emerged recently, with the same veteran politicians at the forefront.\n\nCurrent Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani,  elected in 2022  with the backing of pro-Iran parties, is expected to secure a sizeable bloc in parliament as he seeks a second term.\n\nOther frontrunners include influential Shia figures, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Muslim scholar Ammar al-Hakim.\n\nSunni parties are running separately, with the former parliament speaker, Mohammed al-Halbousi, expected to do well.\n\nThe ballot is marked by the absence of influential Shia leader Muqtada al-Sadr, who has urged his followers to boycott the “flawed election”.\n\nIn 2021, al-Sadr secured the largest bloc before withdrawing from parliament following a dispute with Shia parties that refused to support his bid to form a government, and instead came together to form a larger alliance.\n\nThroughout his time in office, al-Sudani has  sought to balance  Iraq’s relations with Tehran and Washington.\n\nEven as its influence wanes, Iran hopes to preserve its power in Iraq – the only close ally that remained out of Israel’s crosshairs amid the war in Gaza.\n\nBy way of contrast, Lebanon and Yemen suffered heavy losses as Israel struck at armed groups that they host.\n\nThe US also holds significant sway in Iraq with forces deployed across the country.\n\nEarly last year, pro-Iran factions in Iraq, listed as terrorist groups by Washington, yielded to internal and US pressure and halted the targeting of these forces. Baghdad remains under pressure from the US to disarm the groups.\n\nUS envoy Mark Savaya recently called for Iraq to be freed from Iran and its proxies’ “malign” interference."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/11/delhi-red-fort-blast-live-terrorism-law-invoked-in-india-after-9-killed?update=4098670","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:46:12+00:00","title":"‘Anti-terror’ law invoked after 13 killed in New Delhi car explosion","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Indian police in Delhi invoked an anti-terror law after a car explosion near the Red Fort killed 13 people, raising concerns over national security and public safety in a major cultural and political center.

James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97\n\nScientist James Watson, whose research on the structure of DNA helped pave the way for developments in the study of human genetics, has died at the age of 97.\n\nWatson, a brilliant but controversial figure who later prompted outcry with his promotion of debunked racist ideas, shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in medicine with fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where Watson previously worked, called the discovery a “pivotal moment in the life sciences”. Watson’s son said that he died in hospice care after struggling with a brief illness.\n\nWatson’s discovery helped pave the way for important developments in the alteration of the genetic makeup of living beings and treating diseases through the insertion of genes into patients, along with the increased use of DNA samples in criminology.\n\n“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” he once said, later writing that he could not have anticipated the “explosive impact of the double helix on science and society”.\n\nThe image of the double helix, taking the form of a long, twisting ladder, became an iconic symbol of science. Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/5/australia-adds-reddit-kick-to-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-05","timeOfPublication":"06:55:24+00:00","title":"Australia adds Reddit, Kick to social media ban for children under 16","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australia has announced a new social media ban for children under 16, expanding the list of restricted platforms to include Reddit and Kick, alongside Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube.

We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/us-senate-passes-bill-to-end-longest-ever-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"03:29:14+00:00","title":"US Senate passes bill to end longest ever government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan spending bill on November 10, 2025, to fund the federal government through January 30, 2026, ending a five-week shutdown.

is moving closer to ending its record-breaking government shutdown after the Senate took a critical step towards ending its five-week impasse.\n\nThe upper chamber of Congress on Monday night approved a spending package by a vote of 60 to 40 to fund the US government through January 30 and reinstate pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n\nThe spending bill next moves to the House of Representatives for approval and then on to President Donald Trump for his signature before the shutdown can finally end.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has  said  he would like to pass it as soon as Wednesday and called for legislators to immediately return to Washington, DC, to take part in the vote.\n\nThe vote in the Senate follows negotiations this weekend that saw seven Democrats and one independent  agree  to move the updated spending package to end the shutdown, which enters its 42nd day on Tuesday, to a debate and a vote.\n\nAlso included in the deal are three-year appropriations for the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, military construction projects, veterans affairs and congressional operations.\n\nThe  deal  does not, however, resolve one of the most central issues of the shutdown – extending healthcare subsidies that benefit 24 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nInstead, the Senate Republicans only agreed to hold a vote on the issue by December.\n\nAnalysts said this means there could be another shutdown in January.\n\n“The deal that they’ve reached means most of the government will shut down again in January if they can’t come to another agreement, so this is just a stopgap arrangement,” said David Smith, an associate professor at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre.\n\n“My guess will be if there hasn’t been a vote on Obamacare subsidies by the end of January or if the vote fails, then the shutdown will happen again,” he said, using a nickname for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe agreement has also provoked anger among the Democrats who preferred to keep holding out. They noted the vote came a week after Democrats won high-profile elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City and argued there is no guarantee that the Republican-controlled Senate or House would agree to extend the health insurance subsidies.\n\nThe group that supported the deal were Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin from Illinois, independent Angus King from Maine, John Fetterman from Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jackie Rosen from Nevada, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire, and Tim Kaine from Virginia.\n\nKing, Cortez and Fetterman previously voted with Republicans to end the shutdown, citing its impact on Americans. Both Durbin and Shaheen are not seeking re-election in 2026 while Kaine’s state of Virginia is home to thousands of federal workers, according to the US news site Politico.\n\nFetterman told the NBC News programme Meet the Press that his breakaway group of senators wanted to “put the country before the party”.\n\n“I think people realised this really needs to end, the mass chaos. How many people are going to play chicken for the food security of two million Americans? How much more unsafe are you going to make flying in our country?” he said on Tuesday.\n\nThe legislators had been under increasing pressure over lapses in funding to critical  programmes like food assistance while hundreds of thousands of federal  employees have been furloughed or required to work without pay since the shutdown began on October 1.\n\nTrump has separately threatened to use the shutdown as a pretext to slash the federal workforce.\n\nVoters have also felt the impact of the shutdown at  airports  across the US after the Federal Aviation Administration last week announced a 10 percent cut in air traffic due to absences by  air traffic controllers , one of the groups working without pay.\n\nThe move by Fetterman and others to cross the aisle was criticised by leading Democrats like Illinois Governor JB Pritzker – considered a Democratic contender for the 2028 presidential election – who called the deal an “empty promise”.\n\nThis is not a deal — it's an empty promise.\n\nTrump and his Republican Congress are making healthcare more expensive for the middle class and ending it for working families.\n\nTime for Democrats to stand tall for affordable healthcare.  https://t.co/hLiMKgkc8i\n\n— Governor JB Pritzker (@GovPritzker)  November 10, 2025\n\nWithout the subsidies, healthcare insurance premiums for more than 20 million Americans are due to double in 2026, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Another 15 million could lose health coverage and become uninsured by 2034 because of the changes, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor on Monday, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who votes with Democrats, blasted the raising of health insurance costs and putting millions of Americans at risk of losing healthcare coverage.\n\n“Everybody in America knows our current healthcare system is broken. It is dysfunctional. It is cruel. It is by far the most expensive healthcare system in the world and the only healthcare system of any major country that does not guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right,” he said\n\n“We are unique in that respect, and yet tonight, what this Senate is about to do is make a horrific situation even worse,” he added."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar comet to pass through our solar system, after its discovery in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope team in Chile.

2025-11-07T07:49:12+00:00\n\nTitle: Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?\n\nAstrophysicists are scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/9/powerful-tornado-wrecks-brazil-town-killing-six-and-injuring-hundreds","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-09","timeOfPublication":"04:22:10+00:00","title":"Powerful tornado wrecks Brazil town, killing six and injuring hundreds","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A powerful tornado with winds reaching up to 250km/h (155 mph) struck the town of Rio Bonito do Iguacu in Paraná state, Brazil, killing at least six people and injuring over 750.

Brazil town, killing six and injuring hundreds\n\nAt least six people have been killed and 750 others injured in Brazil after a tornado ripped through the southern state of Parana, with powerful winds of up to 250km/hour (155 mph).\n\nLocal authorities said on Saturday that the twister, which struck late on Friday, lasted less than a minute, but destroyed about 90 percent of the town of Rio Bonito do Iguacu.\n\nThe town is home to 14,000 people.\n\nAerial photographs show scores of buildings in Rio Bonito do Iguacu without roofs, while parts of the town appear completely flattened. Nearby, green farmland and trees outside of the tornado’s path appear to be largely untouched.\n\nThe destructive weather pattern hit Brazil as it prepared to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP30 in Belem on Monday.\n\nExperts say climate change can contribute to frequent and more intense tornadoes as warmer temperatures and increasing moisture in the air can increase atmospheric instability and wind shear – the factors that give rise to such twisters.\n\nFernando Schunig, head of the Parana Civil Defence agency, described the town as a “war zone” in an interview with local news outlet G1.\n\n“When these events hit an urban area, the damage is major. It is very lethal,” he said.\n\nGilberto Brecailo, a resident of Rio Bonito do Iguacu, said his mechanic shop was one of the buildings destroyed by the tornado.\n\n“There’s not much we can do… All we have left are our clothes and our documents. My livelihood, my mechanic shop, is gone, and my son worked with me,” he said, standing near a pile of support beams and building rubble.\n\nMarileia Chagas, another resident, said she was thrown against a structure by the high winds but was able to hide under a bench until it passed.\n\n“When I came out, everything was destroyed. My daughter and my wheelchair-bound mother were inside. My father was inside too. I was devastated,” she said. “In two minutes, everything was on the ground; some people lost family, but we must thank God everyone is alive.”\n\nAuthorities say five of the people killed were from Rio Bonito do Iguacu, while another victim was from the nearby town of Guarapuava.\n\nAt least one person is missing.\n\nTowns near Rio Bonito do Iguacu were also hit by winds, storms and hail, but none suffered the same level of damage, according to the local government.\n\nState Governor Carlos Massa Ratinho Jr declared three days of mourning to honour the dead. Officials say the casualty rate may rise as search and rescue operations are still under way.\n\nAt least 750 people were also injured by the tornado, of whom 10 have undergone surgery and nine are in serious condition, according to health authorities.\n\nCinthia Kelly Somariva, the director of a nearby hospital, said they were still evaluating the fallout from the tornado. “It was a very sad and intense night. There were lives lost,” she said.\n\nOn social media, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expressed solidarity with the victims. Members of his Cabinet announced the dispatching of emergency assistance to the area.\n\nOfficials said that food, hygiene products, tarps, mattresses and several other items will be available to victims."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"7112-11-20","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00Z","title":"Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"This article highlights key developments in science and technology, including breakthroughs in genetics and AI, environmental interventions like cloud seeding in Delhi, global trade tensions affecting semiconductor supply chains, and public health advancements such as HPV vaccination in Pakistan.

But I've used it twice in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe first time was on Sunday night, after the resignations of Tim Davie and Deborah Turness. That, in fact, might have involved a bit of overreach.\n\nAfter all, this has happened before at the BBC. Back in 2004, two senior figures departed - admittedly not on the same day, but on subsequent days.\n\nThe then BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies, and the director general, Greg Dyke, resigned in light of the Hutton report.\n\nThat was the inquiry into the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly which found that the BBC's reporting on the Iraq \"sexed-up dossier\" was flawed.\n\nBut my use of unprecedented on Monday feels entirely appropriate.\n\nA US president threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn is completely new territory for the corporation.\n\nWe've seen a succession of US media operations previously cave in as Donald Trump launched lawsuits.\n\nParamount Global paid him $16m to settle a dispute over an interview broadcast on CBS with former vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nABC News paid him $15m to settle a defamation lawsuit after its anchor falsely claimed he had been found \"liable for rape\".\n\nNow the president has the BBC in his sights. He wants a full retraction of the Panorama documentary, an apology for the \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading and inflammatory statements\" made about him in it, and appropriate compensation \"for the harm caused\".\n\nIf he doesn't get them by Friday, he's put the BBC \"on notice\" that he will be looking for damages of \"no less than $1,000,000,000\".\n\nWhether you are a supporter or a detractor of the BBC, I think everyone would agree these are incredibly testing times for the corporation.\n\nEvents have developed rapidly over a week.\n\nFirst we got the series of claims about the Panorama documentary and also wider systemic bias first made in the Telegraph.\n\nSix days later came the resignations of director general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness.\n\nQuickly some were voicing concerns about a politically orchestrated campaign against the BBC from the right. Others said this was all about accountability in the face of gross failures.\n\nNow the BBC faces a potentially very costly legal battle with Donald Trump.\n\nIt should be basking in the success of Celebrity Traitors with the programme's hugely popular finale broadcast just last Thursday. Instead the BBC is plunged into a crisis some would argue of its own making.\n\nIt's taken until Monday to apologise for the Panorama edit and to push back on the notion that the corporation suffers from institutional bias.\n\nThe interview I did with BBC chair Samir Shah should have been done much earlier - with the DG or Deborah Turness last week, as the headlines ramped up.\n\nThe apology should have come then. Now the BBC is on the back foot.\n\nIt will take robust leadership to steer a course through.

with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c051yjv90dmo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"02:29:59.272+00:00","title":"New 'Lucifer' bee with devil-like horns found in Australia","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Australian scientists have discovered a new native bee species, Megachile Lucifer, in the Bremer Ranges of Western Australia.

millions of people across the globe, the United Nations has warned before the opening of its annual climate change conference.\n\nThe UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a report, published on Monday to coincide with the launch of the 30th annual UN Climate Change conference (COP) in Brazil, that weather-related disasters caused about 250 million people to flee their homes over the past decade.\n\nThe migration agency issued its second major report on the effect of climate change on refugees – No Escape II: The Way Forward – in the run-up to COP 30, as it appears that the enthusiasm of countries to agree action to curb climate change continues to ebb.\n\n“Over the past decade, weather-related disasters have caused some 250 million internal displacements – equivalent to over 67,000 displacements per day,” the report said .\n\nThe UNHCR added that climate change is also increasing the difficulties faced by those displaced by conflict and other driving forces.\n\n“Climate change is compounding and multiplying the challenges faced by those who have already been displaced, as well as their hosts, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings,” it continued.\n\nFloods in South Sudan and Brazil, record heat in Kenya and Pakistan, and water shortages in Chad and Ethiopia are among the disasters noted in the report.\n\nThe number of countries facing extreme exposure to climate-related hazards is projected to rise from three to 65 by 2040.\n\nThose 65 countries host more than 45 percent of all people currently displaced by conflict, it added.\n\n“Extreme weather is … destroying homes and livelihoods, and forcing families – many who have already fled violence – to flee once more,” UN refugees chief Filippo Grandi said in a statement.\n\n“These are people who have already endured immense loss, and now they face the same hardships and devastation again. They are among the hardest hit by severe droughts, deadly floods and record-breaking heatwaves, yet they have the fewest resources to recover,” he said.\n\nBy 2050, the report reads, the hottest 15 refugee camps in the world – in The Gambia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Senegal and Mali – are projected to experience nearly 200 days of hazardous heat stress per year.\n\nThe refugee agency’s report emphasised that while the effect of climate change is growing, the commitment towards dealing with it has been weakening.\n\nThe UNHCR hopes to reawaken efforts to fight the effects at the conference in Brazil.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States, traditionally the world’s top donor, has  slashed foreign aid .\n\nWashington previously accounted for more than 40 percent of the UNHCR’s budget. Other major donor countries have also been tightening their belts.\n\n“Funding cuts are severely limiting our ability to protect refugees and displaced families from the effects of extreme weather,” Grandi said.\n\n“To prevent further displacement, climate financing needs to reach the communities already living on the edge,” he said. “This COP must deliver real action, not empty promises.”\n\nAbout 50,000 participants from more than 190 countries will meet in Belem, in the Amazon rainforest, to discuss curbing the climate crisis.\n\nOne topic on the agenda exposing the difficulties of agreeing on global action is the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n\nThe policy is designed to prevent “carbon leakage” by requiring importers of carbon-intensive goods like steel and cement to pay the same price for embedded emissions that EU producers face domestically.\n\nWhile the EU promotes CBAM as a necessary environmental tool to encourage greener practices, critics of the policy, including major trading partners like the US and China, view it as a veiled act of protectionism.\n\nDeveloping nations, meanwhile, are concerned that it unfairly shifts the financial burden of climate action onto them."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/why-has-pakistans-hpv-vaccine-campaign-faced-a-backlash","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"08:09:33+00:00","title":"Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan launched its first national HPV vaccine campaign in September 2025 to vaccinate over 13 million girls aged 9 to 14, aiming to prevent cervical cancer — a leading cause of female mortality in the country.

Why has Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign faced a backlash?\n\nIn September, Pakistan launched its first-ever national human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine campaign, aiming to immunise more than 13 million girls aged nine to 14 in its first phase.\n\nHPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer, which kills eight Pakistani women every day, according to Dr Dapeng Luo, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Pakistan. The United Nations health agency has set a goal of  eradicating cervical cancer  globally by 2030.\n\nBut the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.\n\nHere is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.\n\nHPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.\n\nThere are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.\n\nSome types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.\n\nMore than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.\n\nSome strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.\n\nWhile the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.\n\nSufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.\n\nSome 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.\n\nIn advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.\n\nA single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.\n\nIn the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.\n\nPakistan’s federal health minister, Syed Mustafa Kamal, said at a launch ceremony for the vaccine on September 16 in Islamabad, “I urge all parents to ensure their daughters and sisters are vaccinated. Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”\n\nKamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”\n\nHe said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”\n\nOn the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”\n\nHe said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.\n\n“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.\n\nThe initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.\n\nThe Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.\n\nOther countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.\n\nThe government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.\n\n“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.\n\n“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”\n\nIn September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.\n\nManzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.\n\nManzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.\n\n“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”\n\nShe described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.\n\nThe rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.\n\n“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.\n\nThe low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.\n\nThe vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.\n\n“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.\n\nWhile vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.\n\nIt was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.\n\nThis was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”\n\nManzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”\n\nThe HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.\n\nSome argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.\n\nA Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”\n\nAnother user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”\n\nManzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.\n\n“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.\n\nIn 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the  World Population Review , 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While  birthrates  in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.\n\nIn May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.\n\nOther rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.\n\nIn fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.\n\n“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.\n\nIn an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.\n\nIt can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.\n\nKamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.\n\n“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.\n\n“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the controversy surrounding President Donald Trump's announcement of resuming U.S. nuclear weapons testing, with U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright clarifying that the planned tests are noncritical and do not involve nuclear explosions.

tests will be “noncritical” and will not feature any nuclear explosions for now.\n\nThis clarification on Sunday came three days after President Donald Trump announced he had instructed the Department of Defense to “immediately” restart  testing of US nuclear weapons .\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests,” Wright said on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing.\n\n“These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyl7n4q3qyo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:49:17.449+00:00","title":"Delhi blast: The night that shook India's capital city","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An explosion in a car near the Red Fort metro station in Delhi on a Monday evening killed at least eight people and injured over 20, triggering widespread panic and a citywide alert.

It was so powerful that several vehicles nearby almost melted, and people could hear the blast from kilometres away.\n\nThe police are still investigating what caused the blast but the fact that it happened in one of the most secure and busy areas of Delhi has shocked people.\n\nOn one side is Chandni Chowk - a busy trading and clothing hub that is busier than usual at this time of the year due to the peak wedding season.\n\nAnd on the other side is the 17th Century Red Fort which attracts thousands of tourists every day.\n\nSandwiched between the two is the road where the explosion took place. Within minutes, confusion and alarm spread from the scene to the rest of the city.\n\nSome readers may find the details below disturbing\n\nMohamed Hafiz, who lives less than 200m from the spot, said his house shook and he and others ran out thinking it was an earthquake.\n\nWhat he saw on the street terrified him: people were running in all directions, cars were on fire, and bodies lay on the road. Some locals were trying to help the injured.\n\n\"There was blood everywhere. People were in shock. The scene was too disturbing - I could even see body parts,\" he said.\n\nAs local media broke the news, fear and panic swept through the city. Police declared a high alert, and neighbouring states quickly followed suit.\n\nAs we entered Delhi from the neighbouring suburb of Noida, we could see a long queue of vehicles at the border as policemen searched them one by one.\n\nEveryone - the people in the vehicles and the policemen - looked tense as they all appeared to be in disbelief that something like this had happened in their city for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nBeyond the crossing, most roads were deserted as we drove to Lok Nayak Hospital, where the injured had been taken.\n\nOutside, a large crowd had gathered behind police cordons. Confusion hung in the air as people searched for answers, and fellow journalists speculated about what might have caused the explosion.\n\nOnlookers were mystified and even scared. Rajesh Kumar, who works at a tea shop near the hospital, said he always believed the capital was the safest city in the country.\n\nHe said that though the blast had shaken him, he still believed that the security forces would soon find out what caused it.\n\n\"My family in Uttar Pradesh [state] told me to leave, they panic easily. I am a little worried and shocked but I don't think Delhi has suddenly become unsafe,\" he said.\n\nAmong the crowd were also several people who were looking for missing family members.\n\nOne of them was Mohammed Azghar, whose brother was in the area where the blast took place.\n\n\"My brother has been missing since the explosion. We haven't had any contact with him,\" he said.\n\n\"We've searched around Red Fort, Chandni Chowk, everywhere but we can't find him.\"\n\nMr Azghar said his brother used to drive an electric rickshaw. \"The police have confiscated the vehicle, which is fine, we don't mind that. But at least help us find my brother.\n\n\"I just want some news - good or bad.\"\n\nAfter visiting the hospital, we drove to the site of the blast. It was jarring to see the roads empty here, as the area is usually teeming with people late into the night.\n\nThere were only security personnel or journalists around. Officials had relaxed restrictions and journalists could go closer to the site.\n\nThe scene there told the story of the blast.\n\nThere were mangled remains of cars, rickshaws and tuk-tuks. Blood stains could still be seen on the road. Some of the vehicles were charred beyond recognition.\n\nSome locals had also gathered around. They looked visibly shaken and worried about their immediate future.\n\nRam Singh, who drives a small vehicle to ferry goods from stockrooms to shops in the area, is worried about business being affected.\n\n\"I earn daily and I am worried how I might feed my family. I hope a sense of security soon returns. I hope the police will be able to restore trust fairly quickly,\" he said.\n\n\"And I hope this never happens in our city ever again. We are shaken but we should overcome this.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3zpdvxz3zo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:49:08.858+00:00","title":"Nord Stream suspect accuses Italy of pressure to confess","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Serhiy Kuznetsov, a Ukrainian former military officer, is on a 10-day hunger strike in an Italian prison after being extradited on an arrest warrant from Germany.

strike in an Italian prison, where he has accused the authorities of mistreating him to make him confess to blowing up Russia's Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea in 2022.\n\nSerhiy Kuznetsov was detained in Italy in August on an arrest warrant from Germany.\n\nIn a letter shown to the BBC by his lawyer, Mr Kuznetsov says he is being treated as \"criminal no.1\", held in a high-security facility alongside suspected members of so-called Islamic State (IS or Isis). The BBC has contacted the prison, but it has not yet commented.\n\nNo-one has admitted carrying out the attack on the pipelines carrying Russian gas to Germany.\n\nIn his first public comment since his arrest, Mr Kuznetsov writes - by hand - that \"the Italians have been cynically ignoring my dietary habits for the past two months\" - a reference to his vegetarian diet.\n\n\"They think that these restrictions can affect my position, and make me confess my guilt. But such efforts are futile.\"\n\nA relative of Mr Kuznetsov's told me they had tried to deliver special food to the prison, but had been refused - and they were worried that he seemed \"exhausted\".\n\nThe Nord Stream pipelines were destroyed deep beneath the Baltic Sea at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt was a high profile and controversial attack.\n\nMany initially suspected Russian involvement and an attempt by Moscow to blackmail Europe by restricting its energy supplies.\n\nBut this summer, German prosecutors activated arrest warrants for two of the men they suspect of carrying out the attack: Serhiy Kuznetsov and a second Ukrainian citizen, Volodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was detained in Poland.\n\nGerman prosecutors have cited charges of \"anti-constitutional sabotage\" as a basis for the extradition requests.\n\nA judge in Warsaw ruled against Mr Zhuravlyov's extradition , saying that, if Ukrainians were involved, such an attack would count as legitimate self-defence in a \"bloody, genocidal war\".\n\nIn Italy, by contrast, a court in Bologna last month approved Serhiy Kuznetsov's extradition in a closed hearing. He is currently appealing against that ruling for a second time.\n\n\"He told me he had lost 9kg when I said that his clothes were hanging loosely,\" the Ukrainian's lawyer, Nicola Canestrini, said, after visiting his client on hunger strike.\n\nThe lawyer said Kuznetsov was refusing all solid food but was \"doing fine and is clear of mind\".\n\nSerhiy Kuznetsov complains in his letter about having to exercise in isolation and under armed guard and being subjected to \"maximum restrictions\".\n\nHis lawyer told the BBC that he himself felt that Mr Kuznetsov had been \"abandoned\" by the Ukrainian government \"like an old boot\".\n\n\"He was in the army, so they should know was he there or not? If he was there, they should protect him - if not, they should protect him as well,\" he argues, referring to the attack.\n\nUkrainian officials have always denied any involvement. They declined to comment again recently when approached by the BBC.\n\nOn Sunday, the human rights ombudsman in Kyiv, Dmytro Lubinets, said an adviser was looking into the case and would check on the prison conditions.\n\nIn his letter, Mr Kuznetsov says that he understands that his government \"currently has more important matters to attend to, searching for an end to the war\".\n\nHe ends on a patriotic note, writing: \"I love Ukraine very much and am happy to have the honour of being an officer in its armed forces.\"\n\nHis final appeal hearing in Italy is due in the next couple of weeks."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/has-climate-change-brought-mosquitoes-to-iceland","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-23","timeOfPublication":"15:45:13+00:00","title":"Has climate change brought mosquitoes to Iceland?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Mosquitoes, specifically the cold-adapted Culiseta annulata species, have been detected in Iceland for the first time, marking a significant ecological shift due to climate change.

Iceland?\n\nMosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.\n\nThis follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up glacial melting in the country.\n\nOn October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group  Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi  (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kjos at dusk that day.\n\nHe said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik.\n\nHjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.\n\nAlfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Culiseta annulata are not known to carry disease but are generally considered a nuisance.\n\n“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.\n\nMosquito species that are well adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.\n\n“Their development is slower, their active season shorter and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley from the Royal Entomological  Society told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes but with lower disease risk.”\n\nThere are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Antarctica.\n\nMosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland has in abundance. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.\n\nThis is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.\n\n“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.\n\nIceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from minus 1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11C (52F) in the warmest months.\n\nMosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year, making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.\n\nBefore mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.\n\nGislason told Al Jazeera that more mosquito species are in warm climates than cold, and the greatest diversity of mosquitoes is seen in tropical areas.\n\n“There is one species in Greenland, Aedes nigripes. It is a high Arctic species, and their density is controlled by the abundance of hosts, [such as] muskoxen, Arctic foxes, reindeers, polar bears and humans.”\n\nIn a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how this particular mosquito species came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”\n\nA growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.\n\nThe country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.\n\nThe country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting and are projected to lose about half their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website said.\n\nIncreasingly, “cooler climates can support mosquito development and survival. They can adapt to cooler temperatures up to a certain temperature below which they cannot survive. It depends which mosquito species,” Yaw Afrane, a professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of Ghana, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.\n\nAs the planet warms, “vector-borne diseases will move to areas that have been free of them as the climate will be more permissive to disease vectors,” Afrane said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified an increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.\n\n“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.\n\n“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”\n\nIn September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.\n\nThe Aedes aegypti is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.\n\nEuropean countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.\n\nWarmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.\n\nBesides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae and pupae from areas where they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, the ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nTilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.\n\n“A mosquito in a new area will be a prey for predators like fish, waterfowl and insect-eating insects. There is, therefore, more diversity of food for these predators,” Gislason told Al Jazeera, adding that it is difficult to predict accurately what will happen if a mosquito enters a new area. He said, however, that major changes in aquatic ecosystems in Iceland have not been observed yet.\n\nTilley said these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study climate change patterns, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-summit-in-brazil-what-to-know-about-the-un-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:36:51+00:00","title":"COP30 summit in Brazil: What we know about the UN climate conference","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 climate summit, hosted in Belem, Brazil, brings together over 50,000 delegates from more than 190 countries to focus on implementing existing climate commitments rather than setting new goals.

(COP30) begins on Monday in the Brazilian city of Belem. About 50,000 people from more than 190 countries, including diplomats and climate experts, are expected to attend the 11-day meeting in the Amazon.\n\nDelegates are expected to discuss the climate crisis and its devastating impacts, including the rising frequency of extreme weather.\n\nThe hosts have a packed agenda with 145 meetings planned to discuss the green fuel transition and global warming as well as the failure to implement past promises.\n\nAndre Correa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasised that negotiators engage in “mutirao”, a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.\n\n“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators on Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”\n\nCOP is the abbreviation for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which refers to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a treaty adopted in 1992 that formally acknowledged climate change as a global threat.\n\nThe treaty also enshrined the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”, meaning that rich countries responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions should bear the greatest responsibility for solving the problem.\n\nThe UNFCCC formally went into force in 1994 and has become the basis for international deals, such as the 2015  Paris Climate Agreement , designed to limit global temperature increases to about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 to avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming.\n\nThe first COP summit was held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1995. The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the agenda and hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to climate change while trying to corral member states to agree to new climate measures.\n\nBrazil wants to gather pledges of $25bn and attract a further $100bn from the global financial markets for a Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), which would provide financing for biodiversity conservation, including reducing deforestation.\n\nBrazil has also asked countries to work on realising past promises, such as COP28’s pledge to phase out fossil fuel use. Indeed, the Brazilian government’s overarching goal for this COP is “implementation” rather than setting new goals.\n\n“Our role at COP30 is to create a roadmap for the next decade to accelerate implementation,” Ana Tonix, the chief executive of COP30, was quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper.\n\nAt a summit last week before COP30, Brazilian President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”\n\nIn a letter to negotiators released late on Sunday, Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already – from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, super typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines to a tornado ripping through southern Brazil.”\n\nNot only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives”, Stiell wrote.\n\nCOP30 is also the first to acknowledge the failure to so far prevent global warming.\n\nMore than 50,000 people have registered to attend this year’s COP in Belem, including journalists, climate scientists, Indigenous leaders and representatives from 195 countries.\n\nSome of the more prominent official group voices will include the Alliance of Small Island States, the G77 bloc of developing countries and the BASIC Group, consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\n\nIn September, United States President Donald Trump told the UN General Assembly that climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, based on “predictions … made by stupid people”.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to deny the climate crisis has further complicated the agenda at the conference, which will have no representation from Washington. Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement twice – once during his first term, which was overturned by former President Joe Biden, and a second time on January 20, 2025, the day his second term began. He cited the economic burden of climate initiatives on the US. Trump has called climate change a “hoax”.\n\nThe US historically has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. On an annual basis, however, the biggest carbon polluter now is China.\n\nCOP30 organisers have been criticised for the exorbitant prices of hotel rooms in Belem, which has just 18,000 hotel beds. Brazil’s government has stepped in, offering free cabins on cruise ships to poorer nations in a last-minute bid to ensure they can attend.\n\nAs of November 1, only 149 countries had confirmed lodging. The Brazilian government said 37 were still negotiating. Meanwhile, business leaders have decamped to host their own events in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBrazil has also been slammed for clearing forest to build a new road to reach the conference venue.\n\nRenewables, led by solar and wind, accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added worldwide last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar energy has now become the cheapest form of electricity in history.\n\nMeanwhile, one in five of new cars sold around the world last year was electric, and there are now more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels, according to the UN.\n\nElsewhere, the International Energy Agency has estimated that global clean-energy investment will reach $2.2 trillion this year, which would be about twice as much as on fossil fuel spending.\n\nAt the same time, global temperatures are not just rising, they are climbing faster than ever with new records logged for 2023 and 2024. That finding was part of a study done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27C (0.49F) each decade, almost 50 percent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2C (0.36F) per decade.\n\nThe world is now on track to cross the 1.5C threshold by 2030, after which scientists warn that humanity will trigger irreversible climate impacts. Already, the planet has warmed by 1.3C (2.34F) since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAt the same time, governments around the world spend about $1 trillion each year subsidising fossil fuels.\n\nAt a preparatory summit with dozens of heads of state and government, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.”\n\n“Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable. We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down,” he said on Thursday.\n\n“Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”\n\nThe India-Pakistan  heatwave  began unusually early, in April this year. By June, temperatures had reached a peak of about 48C (118.4F) in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Hundreds of lives were lost, and crops were decimated.\n\nEurope also faced extreme heat this year. Over the summer, the region endured a heatwave that pushed cities like Lisbon past 46C  (114.8F). In London, a prolonged period of elevated temperatures in late June caused an estimated excess 260 deaths.\n\nAt the same time,  Mediterranean wildfires  ravaged large tracts of Southern Europe with more than 100,000 people evacuated and dozens of deaths.\n\nTurkiye suffered one of its worst droughts in decades, hitting agricultural areas. Rainfall dropped by up to 71 percent in some areas compared with the previous year, stressing ecosystems and energy and food production."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jdyw24782o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"01:55:05.863+00:00","title":"Dulles airport crash leaves 18 injured in people carrier","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A mobile lounge, a type of people carrier used at Washington Dulles International Airport, crashed into a dock at 16:30 EST on November 11, 2025, injuring at least 18 people.

2025-11-11T08:34:24.292+00:00\n\nTitle: Government sets out plan to phase out animal experiments \n\nThe government has detailed for the first time how it aims to fulfil its manifesto pledge to work toward phasing out animal testing.\n\nThe new plans include replacing animal testing for some major safety tests by the end of this year and cutting the use of dogs and non-human primates in tests for human medicines by at least 35% by 2030.\n\nThe Labour Party said in its manifesto that it would \"partner with scientists, industry, and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing\".\n\nScience Minister Lord Vallance told BBC News that he could imagine a day where the use of animals in science was almost completely phased out but acknowledged that it would take time.\n\nAnimal experiments in the UK peaked at 4.14 million in 2015 driven mainly by a big increase then in genetic modification experiments – mostly on mice and fish\n\nBy 2020, the number had fallen sharply to 2.88 million as alternative methods were developed. But since then that decline has plateaued.\n\nLord Vallance told BBC News that he wants to re-ignite the fast downward trend by replacing animal testing with experiments on animal tissues grown from stem cells, AI, and computer simulations.\n\nAsked by BBC News if he could envisage a world where animal tests were \"near zero\", he said: \"I think that is possible, it's not possible anytime soon, the idea that we can eliminate animal use in the foreseeable future, I don't think is there.\n\n\"Can we get very close to it? I think we can. Can we push faster than we have been? I think we can. Should we? We absolutely should.\"\n\n\"This is a moment to really grasp that and drive these alternative approaches,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the government's newly detailed plans, by the end of 2025, scientists will stop using animals for some major safety tests and switch to newer lab methods that use human cells instead.\n\nAs a former government chief scientific advisor and former head of research for a major pharmaceutical company, he will know that many scientists believe reaching \"near zero\" tests on animals will be extremely difficult, even in the longer term. That includes those who are the greatest advocates of non-animal methods.\n\n\"I very strongly believe that that is not possible for reasons of safety,\" said Prof Frances Balkwill, of Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London.\n\nProf Balkwill is working on finding ways stop ovarian cancer recurring, using mice as well as non-animal approaches, of which she is a huge fan.\n\n\"These non-animal methods will never replace the complexity that we can see when we have a tumour growing in a whole organism, such as a mouse,\" she said.\n\nOne of the world's leading centres for developing alternatives to animal testing is the Centre for Predictive in vitro Models (CPM) at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nResearchers here are developing the extraordinarily sounding \"organ-on-a-chip\" technology, conjuring up alarming images of throbbing brains and beating hearts sitting on top of electronic circuits.\n\nThe reality, though, is far less sci-fi.\n\nSome small pieces of glassware containing tiny samples of human cells from different organs from the body, such as the liver or brain, are connected to electrodes which send information to a computer.\n\nWhat is amazing, said the CPM's co-director, Prof Hazel Screen, is that cells from various parts of the body can be connected together to mimic how different organs work together.\n\n\"In theory, you can build any organ on a chip. Then I can use it to test a new drug,\" she said.\n\n\"And because we're taking human cells, we should be able to do better quality science.\"\n\nThe safety tests that the government says will no longer use animals by the end of this year include the practice of giving rabbits a small dose of a new drug – called the pyrogen test. It says this will be replaced by a test using human immune cells in a dish.\n\nAll tests that used animals to check for dangerous germs in medicine will also be done with cell and gene technologies, the government says.\n\nBetween 2026 and 2035, the government plans to speed up the use of non-animal techniques, including the organ-on-a-chip devices and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe proposals group animal tests into two main groups: those which could be immediately replaced because safe and effective alternatives already exist and simply need laws or guidelines to be updated; and others, where alternatives exist, but still need work to prove that they are reliable enough to be widely used.\n\nTo speed up the latter, the government plans to set up a Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods.\n\nMinisters also promise to give an unspecified increase in funding and investment for developing new alternatives, including £30m for a research hub and more grants to support innovative methods and training.\n\nThe RSPCA has cautiously welcomed the plan, describing it as a \"significant step forward\",  but has urged the government to deliver.\n\nSome scientists working with animal experiments, such as Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, are deeply concerned about what they fear may be a premature push toward alternatives, and its potential negative consequences for science and medicine.\n\n\"How about the brain and behaviour? How can you study behaviour in a petri dish?

immigration enforcement, his family said on Monday.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  arrested Hamdi , a media commentator and outspoken critic of Israel, last month while he was on a speaking tour in the US.\n\nThe State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged at the time that Hamdi supports terrorism and poses a threat to national security, while his lawyers have argued he was targeted for criticising Israel and its war in Gaza.\n\nHamdi will be released from ICE detention in the next few days and return to the UK, his representatives say.\n\nHamdi was visiting the US to speak at events for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim advocacy group, when ICE officers arrested him at the San Francisco International Airport on 26 October.\n\nHis detainment came after the US government revoked Hamdi's visa and criticism from far-right political activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who accused him of supporting terrorists.\n\n\"We've said it before, we'll say it again: The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans\", the State Department said of Hamdi at the time he was detained.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to the US State Department, ICE, and DHS for comment and confirmation of the agreement to release Hamdi.\n\nLawyers for Hamdi and the California chapter of CAIR said in a Monday statement that they welcome an agreement allowing Hamdi to voluntarily return to the UK instead of facing deportation.\n\nThey said he was targeted for speaking against \"Israel's war crimes against Palestinians\".\n\nCAIR said that the immigration charging document filed in Hamdi's case only accuses him of overstaying his visa, which the government revoked without notifying him first.\n\nThe organisation said the charging document does not identify \"any criminal conduct or security grounds\", which it said was proof that Hamdi was never a danger to the community or to national security.\n\n\"It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell. His only real 'offense' was speaking clearly about Israel's genocidal war crimes against Palestinians,\" Hussam Ayloush, the CEO of California's CAIR chapter, said in the news release.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) did not confirm details of Hamdi's detainment or release but told the BBC that it was providing consular assistance to a \"British man detained in the USA\". The office said it has also been in touch with the man's family and with local US authorities.\n\n\"This decision brings joy to me, his mother, his wife, our entire family, and all of Sami's supporters around the world,\" Hamdi's father, Dr Mohamed Elhachmi Hamdi, wrote on X.\n\n\"However, it does not erase the bitterness and shock we all feel over what happened to him in the United States — his arrest and the defamation of his reputation and character by US government-affiliated accounts without any legitimate reason whatsoever.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn51pn74l23o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:53:39.826+00:00","title":"Fight fake news and climate deniers, Brazil's Lula tells UN talks","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"At the opening of COP30 in Belém, Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva called for global action to combat climate denialism and fake news, referencing former U.S. President Donald Trump as a symbol of misinformation.

Inácio Lula da Silva has told the opening meeting of the UN climate talks.\n\nIn a rallying cry to COP30, President Lula again made thinly veiled references to President Donald Trump who branded climate change \"a con job\" in September.\n\nThe two weeks of talks kicked off on Monday in the lush Brazilian city of Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nThey take place against a fraught political backdrop and the US has sent no senior officials.\n\nOn Monday thousands of delegates poured into the COP venue in a heavily air-conditioned former aerodrome, some coming from accommodation in shipping containers and cruise ships moored on the riverside.\n\nMembers of the Guajajara indigenous group, in traditional dress, performed a welcome song and dance for assembled diplomats.\n\nAddressing the conference, President Lula said \"COP30 will be the COP of truth\" in an era of \"fake news and misrepresentation\" and \"rejection of scientific evidence\".\n\nWithout naming President Trump, President Lula continued, \"they control the algorithms, sow hatred and spread fear\".\n\n\"It's time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers,\" he said.\n\nSince President Trump took office in January, he has promised to invest heavily in fossil fuels, saying that this will secure greater economic prosperity for the US.\n\nHis administration has cancelled more than $13bn of funding for renewable energy and is taking steps to open up more areas of the US to oil and gas exploration.\n\nThat puts the country at odds with the majority of nations still committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green energy.\n\nThis backdrop has put the COP talks in a difficult position as nations aim to make progress on tackling climate change without the participation of the world's biggest economy.\n\nSome delegates fear that the US could still decide to send officials to undermine the talks. Other environmental talks collapsed this year following US pressure, labelled \"bully-boy tactics\" by some participants.\n\nAddressing officials in Belém, UN climate chief Simon Stiell initially struck an optimistic tone. He said significant progress had been made in the last decade to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases.\n\nBut then he took aim at \"squabbling\" between countries.\n\n\"Not one single nation among you can afford this, as climate disasters rip double-digits off GDP,\" he said.\n\nBrazil wants to use its presidency of the talks to secure progress on key promises made in previous years.\n\nThat includes moving away from the use of planet-warming fossil fuels, finance for developing countries on the frontline of climate change, and protecting nature.\n\nPresident Lula's centrepiece is a fund called the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that Brazil hopes will raise $125bn to protect tropical forests globally.\n\nFund-raising got off to a slow start. Last week UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, at the last minute, that the UK would not contribute public money.\n\nBut on Monday, UK climate envoy Rachel Kyte told BBC News that the fund was a \"brilliant idea\" and that the UK \"will make the investment at some point\".\n\nAfter a fight, nations finally agreed a conference agenda on Monday.\n\nIt promises to consider the question of whether countries can still work towards keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nGroups on the frontline of climate change, including coalition called Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) that mostly represents Caribbean and Pacific countries, had insisted the talks address the long-held goal.\n\nIn recent weeks even the UN has said it accepts that overshooting this temperature is \"inevitable\".\n\nLast week UN General Secretary General António Guterres told leaders in Belém that the failure to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C was a \"moral failure and deadly negligence\".\n\nAdditional reporting by Esme Stallard"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c051mdgd1ddo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:06:31.176+00:00","title":"Three easy ways to help you beat the winter blues","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As daylight decreases in winter, many people experience fatigue, low mood, and difficulty concentrating, which may signal Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).

have gone back and the evenings are darker, many of us are trudging to work and back in the dark and sometimes our mood is lower as well.\n\nWe can feel more tired than normal, lack energy or find it difficult to concentrate.\n\nSeasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), or \"winter depression\" can affect anyone. For those struggling to stick to their normal daily activites, the  NHS  advises contacting their local GP.\n\nFor those with milder symptoms, here are three ways to help you manage the darker days and even embrace them.\n\nPsychologist Kari Leibowitz says growing up in the US in a summer-centric town   meant she used to view winter as limiting and uncomfortable, but travelling to Norway where some places get almost no daylight in the depths of winter changed her mindset.\n\nShe found that instead of people succumbing to a darker mood, they embraced their circumstances, finding different hobbies from snow sports to knitting and cooking.\n\n\"They're looking at winter as a time of year that's full of opportunities,\" she says.\n\nKari said it taught her that changing your approach to focus on what you can do during this time, rather than what you can't, was surprisingly effective.\n\nThis could include  winter walks,  movie nights, cooking a new meal or ice skating.\n\n\"So often we only focus on the things that are harder to do in the winter when really there's a whole world of seasonal activities that feel better when it's cold out.\"\n\nWith our work and social calendars ticking along as normal, we may wonder why we feel so tired but Kari says we need to accept our bodies need more rest in winter.\n\n\"It's actually good not to be as productive or active as you would be during the summer months because our bodies are biologically hardwired for rest during winter,\" she says.\n\nJust like animals and plants, she says we should be slowing down and changing our behaviour.\n\nDr Em May Armstrong, a plant researcher, says the key is finding the balance between resting more and becoming too lethargic.\n\nShe suggests so called \"active dormancy\" - mixing a slower restful lifestyle with activities that still keep us mentally engaged.\n\nThis could include activities such as knitting, repairing clothes or practices that help get you ready for the year ahead.\n\n\"And while that's not as active as, say, travelling or camping, it's just as active in a more restorative way.\"\n\nWhile resting more is natural, it is still important to make time for the things that make us happy and to mix with other people, according to GP Gavin Francis.\n\n\"We're very social animals, even the most solitary human being doesn't live completely alone. We all depend on others.\"\n\nHe suggests planning activities in advance, focusing on spending time with those who make you feel good, and activities which can boost your mood.\n\nDoing this means you're committed, and a low mood nearer the time won't be able to stop you.\n\n\"You can then start planning in your diary to do more things with these people over winter,\" he says.\n\nSimple practical things to improve your mood, such as making sure you get a good night's sleep, avoiding too much alcohol or late night parties and maintaining a healthy diet are also important, he says.\n\n\"These things are not rocket science, but they're really fundamental to having a good, healthy circadian rhythm and a good healthy physiology through the winter.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxnq6d71y9o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:25:19.667+00:00","title":"Gaddafi's youngest son released after 10 years in Lebanese detention","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hannibal Gaddafi, the youngest son of deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, has been released from Lebanese detention after nearly 10 years, following accusations of concealing information about the 1978 disappearance of Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr.

global car industry\n\nIn late September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era emergency law to take control of a Chinese-owned chip company that has operations in the country.\n\nThe extraordinary move set off a chain of events that sent shock waves through the global motor industry – already battered by US tariffs and China's curbs on rare earth exports.\n\nIn a statement to the Netherlands parliament, the minister of economic affairs cited \"serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia\" that \"posed a threat\".\n\n\"This measure is highly exceptional and intended solely to ensure that the continuity of supply and safeguarding of critical technologies for the Dutch and European economy are not put at risk,\" the statement said.\n\nBeijing reacted furiously, accusing the Netherlands of political interference.\n\nIt imposed export controls and halted deliveries of Nexperia chips from its Chinese facilities to Europe, while the Dutch government froze shipments of key supplies needed to make the chips in China.\n\nThe disruption caused to the motor industry highlighted a major weakness in the global supply chain of chips vital to car production and opened yet another front in the rivalry between the US and China.\n\nThe Chinese government has now granted exemptions to export controls  on the chips for civilian applications but has not clarified what it considers those to be.\n\nBut Chinese authorities still want the Dutch to revoke the takeover of Nexperia.\n\n\"China welcomes the EU to continue exerting its influence to urge the Netherlands to correct its erroneous practices as soon as possible,\" the commerce ministry said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nNexperia's parent company Wingtech Technology did not respond to a  BBC request for comment.\n\nAt the centre of the dispute is a critical part of the world's chip ecosystem.\n\nNexperia makes so called \"legacy\" or \"building block\" semiconductors that are vital for everything from power-steering and airbags to central locking systems. These are not cutting-edge chips, but they are still indispensable.\n\nSome vehicles contain hundreds of them, and Nexperia supplies chips to major carmakers around the world.\n\nAround 70%-80% of its output is sent to China for processing, testing and packaging – a dependence that has left car makers exposed to Beijing's control over supply chains.\n\n\"Car markers blindsided by the Nexperia mess should be hiring new supply chain management executives, as they clearly learned nothing from Covid... and excessive reliance on [Chinese] supply chains,\" China watcher Bill Bishop wrote in his Sinocism newsletter.\n\nIt underscores China's ability to choke off global supply chains - just as it did with rare earth exports.\n\nSimilar to critical minerals, China can hold the West hostage with control of a company as inconspicuously important as Nexperia, according to Bill Echikson, Senior Fellow for the Tech Policy Program at Center for European Policy Analysis. This is as much about digital sovereignty as it is about semiconductors, he adds.\n\nBeijing faces a dilemma though. It has been pitching itself as a reliable partner in the face of Trump's tariff chaos, but cutting off supplies of critical products risks undermining that message.\n\n\"The narrative was [that, since]   Trump came in and caused chaos for everybody, maybe there's an opportunity for China and the EU to work more closely together,\" said Tom Nunlist, Associate Director at Trivium China.\n\nThat didn't go so well, he adds, with the rare earths shortage showing how trapped Europe and other trading partners are between the US and China, and their ability to upend global trade, according to Mr Nunlist.\n\nAlong with the takeover, a Dutch court also suspended Nexperia's former chief executive Zhang Xuezhen - who founded its Chinese owner Wingtech - citing mismanagement.\n\nWingtech's shares trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and it is partially owned by the Chinese government.\n\nIt was placed on an official US watch list in 2024, and the so-called entity list was expanded this September to include any firm that is at least 50% owned by companies already on the list.\n\nAccording to court papers released by the Dutch authorities last month in relation to the government's takeover of Nexperia, US authorities had raised concerns about the boss of the chip company before it was taken over.\n\nThe documents contained evidence that Dutch authorities had told Nexperia it may be able to secure an exemption from the US list if there was a change in leadership because the \"Chinese owner is problematic\".\n\n\"It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced to qualify for the exemption from the entity list,\" authorities told Nexperia, according to the documents.\n\nThe Hague denies the takeover of Nexperia was a response to pressure from any foreign country but said there was evidence to suggest the company's   chief executive was transferring its production capacity, financial resources and intellectual property to China.\n\nWingtech did not respond to a request for comment on this.\n\n\"I think Nexperia just underlines what is already true, and makes it truer,\" said Mr Nunlist from Trivium China.\n\n\"Western countries don't want Chinese investors in these types of strategic manufacturing assets, even legacy chips.\"\n\nExperts say the incident is an example of the very real impact of undoing business and economic ties between the West and China.\n\n\"This is what decoupling actually looks like at the corporate level, and it's a huge mess,\" said Mr Nunlist.\n\nEuropean vehicle industry suppliers have sought clarity on the exemptions that will be applied, and have said it creates extra bureaucracy at an already uncertain time.\n\nIt is possible to switch suppliers, say experts, as rivals chip makers like Infineon, NXP and Texas make similar chips.\n\nBut supply chains are not precisely planned, they evolve organically and these components are often tailor made for autos, Mr Nunlist of Trivium China said.\n\n\"Companies can't move on a dime; there are incentives to keep supply chains in place and it's extremely complicated and costly to change things.\"\n\nThe incident comes as US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year trade truce - a deal which suspended some export bans and rare earth restrictions.\n\nBut the Nexperia dispute suggests that this newly-minted agreement may be a fragile one.\n\nThe US is not going to blow up the deal though, according to Mr Nunlist, and Europe doesn't have much leverage especially in this game of supply chain weaponisation.\n\n\"This is really politically tricky for both sides, and for Europe because it doesn't want this to end with chip capacity leaving Europe,\" Mr Nunlist said.\n\n\"My understanding is that leaders in Brussels were unaware that the Dutch government was planning to make this move and were unhappy with it.\"\n\nChina and the EU remain locked in urgent negotiations to lift export controls on both chips and rare earths.\n\nTalks are continuing with China on finding a \"lasting, stable, predictable framework that ensure the full restoration of semiconductor flows\", EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said in a post on X over the weekend.\n\nBut the episode has exposed vulnerabilities in key supply chains - and ties between China and the Netherlands, and in turn the European Union, are likely to remain under pressure until the discord over Nexperia's ownership and operations is fully resolved."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4w1g9ezko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:31:56.714+00:00","title":"Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion to be sentenced over £5bn Bitcoin stash","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Qian Zhimin, a Chinese woman, orchestrated a massive fraud by setting up a cryptocurrency company, Lantian Gerui, which lured over 100,000 Chinese investors—particularly pensioners—with promises of high returns through mining and technological innovation.

sentenced over £5bn Bitcoin stash\n\nA woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, is due to be sentenced this week for money laundering.\n\nAfter fleeing China, she moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures.\n\nMore than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say. As she awaits sentencing, investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities.\n\nAnything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul.\n\n\"If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,\" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. \"Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost.\"\n\nQian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after  Chinese police started investigating her .\n\nShe moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend.\n\nSo she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property.\n\nAs Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could \"get rich while lying down\". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping.\n\nBut Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke.\n\nHer grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022.\n\nIn the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth.\n\nPolice raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history.\n\nQian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices.\n\nBut UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme.\n\n\"The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,\" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC.\n\nOne of her investo r s, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day.\n\n\"That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,\" he says.\n\nHe and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more.\n\nIn addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them.\n\n\"There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment.\"\n\nInvestors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found.\n\nA former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends.\n\nLantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: \"We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance.\"\n\nThe company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready.\n\nLantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly.\n\n\"Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,\" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. \"They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world.\"\n\nA range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said.\n\n\"We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?\"\n\nThe company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to.\n\n\"That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,\" Mr Yu says.\n\nDespite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog.\n\nBut she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li.\n\n\"Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,\" he remembers. \"We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth.\n\n\"She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations.\"\n\nMr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them.\n\nA Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme.\n\n\"The payouts suddenly stopped,\" Mr Yu recalls. \"The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough.\"\n\nWhat helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police.\n\nWhat he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money.\n\nQian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project.\n\nWhen she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told.\n\nAt the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.\n\nMr Li told the BBC this offered victims a \"glimpse of sunlight\".\n\nThe cryptocurrency Qian brought to the UK has multiplied more than 20 times in value since her arrival. Its fate will be decided by a  civil \"proceeds of crime\" case  that will start in earnest early next year.\n\nThere are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us. They will need to prove their claim - and in many cases they did not transfer money to Qian's company directly, but to accounts of local promoters who then passed the cash up the chain.\n\nIt is not clear whether the victims, if successful, will receive only their original investment, or an inflated amount which reflects Bitcoin's subsequent rise in value.\n\nAs in other \"proceeds of crime\" cases, any money left over after this process would normally default to the UK government. The BBC asked the UK Treasury what it plans to do with any remaining money, but it did not respond.\n\nSeparately, last month, the CPS said it was considering a compensation scheme for those with no representation in the civil case. We asked the CPS what level of evidence this alternative scheme would require, but it told us it was not able to share any details at this stage.\n\nThe toll on Mr Yu - whose wife invested alongside him - has not just been financial, but personal, culminating in divorce and little contact with his son, he told the BBC.\n\nStill, he considers himself relatively lucky. One lawyer we spoke to said many of Qian's investors were left without money for food or medicine.\n\nMr Yu knew one such person - from Tianjin, northern China. She died of breast cancer after discharging herself from hospital, unable to afford treatment, he said.\n\n\"She was at death's door, and she knew I could write, so she asked me to write her an elegy if the worst came to the worst.\"\n\nMr Yu says he kept his word and wrote a poem in her memory which he posted online. It ends with the lines:\n\n\"Let us be pillars, holding up the sky / Rather than sheep, to be led and misled / To those who  survive - strive harder / That we might right this grave injustice.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj41pgpk0wgo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"03:52:05.216+00:00","title":"US Senate passes funding bill as historic shutdown nears end","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US Senate passed a bipartisan funding bill in a 60-40 vote, ending the longest government shutdown in history, which began in October 2025.

passes funding bill as historic shutdown nears end\n\nThe US Senate has passed a crucial funding bill that could bring the longest government shutdown in history to an end within days.\n\nThe bill passed in a 60-40 vote late on Monday, with nearly all Republicans joining eight Democrats who splintered from the party to approve it. The deal funds the government until the end of January.\n\nThe House of Representatives will now have to pass the bill before President Donald Trump can sign it into effect. Trump signalled he would be willing to do so earlier on Monday.\n\nThe deal came to fruition over the weekend, after some Democrats joined Republicans and negotiated an agreement to get federal employees back to work and essential services restarted.\n\nRepublicans - who hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate - needed the measure to clear the 60-vote minimum threshold.\n\nDemocratic Senators Dick Durbin, John Fetterman, Catherine Cortez Masto, Maggie Hassan, Tim Kaine, Jackie Rosen and Jeanne Shaheen broke from the rest of their party to vote in favour of the funding bill.\n\nThey were joined by Maine's Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, who also voted to reopen the government.\n\nOnly one Senate Republican - Kentucky's Rand Paul - voted with the majority of Democrats against it.\n\nThe announcement of the bill's passage was made to a largely empty room, but the senators who stayed until the end cheered and applauded.\n\n\"We are going to reopen government, we are going to ensure that federal employees... will now receive compensation that they're earned and deserve,\" Senator Susan Collins, a Republican who played a key role in authoring the bill, said after it passed.\n\nMany government services have been suspended since October, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay.\n\nThe shutdown has had wide ranging impacts on a variety of services, including US air travel and food benefits for 41 million low-income Americans.\n\nOn Monday, more the 2,400 flights across the US were cancelled according to airline traffic tracker FlightAware. At least 9,000 were delayed.\n\nThe funding bill will now go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where members have been out of session and away from Washington since mid-September.\n\nOn Monday, with the Senate deal seemingly in reach, House Speaker Mike Johnson called members of his chamber back to Washington.\n\nThe House will begin discussing the measure on Wednesday, although it is unclear exactly how much time that process may take.\n\nRepublicans have a two-seat majority in the House so every vote will count.\n\nThe deal negotiated over the weekend extends funding for the federal government until 30 January.\n\nIt also includes full-year funding for the Department of Agriculture, as well as funding for military construction and legislative agencies.\n\nGuarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - which provides food aid to one in eight Americans - until next September are also included in the bill.\n\nThe package includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending healthcare subsidies that are due to expire this year, a key issue Democrats had been holding out for concessions on.\n\nDemocratic Party leaders had said that they would not lend their support to new funding for government operations until Congress addressed the subsidies that help tens of millions of Americans pay for health insurance purchased through government-run exchanges.\n\nThe agreement was negotiated between Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House, with Democratic Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nSome high-profile Democrats have been highly critical of colleagues who sided with Republicans to end the shutdown without concrete guarantees on healthcare, with California Governor Gavin Newsom earlier calling the decision \"pathetic\".\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the chamber, said the package \"fails to do anything of substance to fix America's healthcare crisis\".\n\nVirginia Senator Tim Kaine was among the group of Democrats who voted in favour of the compromise. He pushed back on that criticism, and said the federal workers he represents were \"saying thank you\" for agreeing the deal.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has promised to take up the healthcare subsidies measure by the second week of December, but in the House, Johnson has said he will not bring the measure for a vote.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, signalled earlier on Monday that he would be willing to sign the funding bill into effect if it passes the House.\n\n\"We'll be opening up our country very quickly,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office, adding: \"the deal is very good.\"\n\nYou can also get in touch by following this link\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly  US Politics Unspun  newsletter.

coalition to combat the Islamic State group, marking a shift in US foreign policy in the Middle East, a senior Trump administration official has confirmed.\n\nThe announcement came as President Donald Trump met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House - the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.\n\nIn an interview with Special Report on Fox News, al-Sharaa said the visit was part of a \"new era\" in which the country would co-operate with the US.\n\nTrump has expressed his support for al-Sharaa, who until recently was designated a terrorist by the US government.\n\nSyria will now be the 90th country to join the global coalition, which is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.\n\nFollowing the meeting, a senior administration official also confirmed that the US Treasury Department, along with the departments of state and commerce, will announce new measures to lift economic restrictions on Syria and provide \"compliance clarity for investors\".\n\nAs part of the measures, the administration is also issuing an 180-day suspension of the Caesar Act, which since 2019 had sanctioned the former Syrian government.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office several hours after the meeting, Trump said that \"we want to see Syria become a country that's very successful.\"\n\n\"And I think this leader can do it,\" he added. \"I really do.\"\n\nDiplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although the US will now allow Syria to re-open its embassy in Washington.\n\nThis is the third meeting between the two leaders, following one in May on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council and a dinner during the UN General Assembly in September.\n\nAl-Sharaa's visit to the White House caps a remarkable re-branding for the former jihadist.\n\nNot long ago, he led a branch of Al-Qaeda - the group behind the 9/11 attacks and many others - before breaking off ties.\n\nEven until this year, he was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed Islamist group which the US officially considered a terrorist organisation until four months ago, with a $10m bounty on his head.\n\nThe Treasury Department removed al-Sharaa from its \"specially designated global terrorist list\" just last week.\n\nBut since becoming interim Syrian president, al-Sharaa has worked to soften his public image as he tries to rebuild Syria, with foreign support, following 13 years of war.\n\n\"He has had a rough past,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And I think, frankly, if you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance.\"\n\nIn his interview, al-Sharaa said that he and Trump had not discussed his past, but instead focused on the \"present and the future\" of Syria in which it was a \"geopolitical\" and economic partner of Washington.\n\nAl-Sharaa's rule, however, has been marred by killings of members of Syria's Alawite minority, as well as by deadly violence between Sunni Bedouin fighters and Druze militias.\n\nHe has vowed to root out members of his security forces that have committed human rights violations.\n\nTrump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed support for al-Sharaa, referring to him as a \"young, attractive guy\" and a \"fighter\".\n\nIn June, President Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against Syria, which the White House said would help support the country's \"path to stability and peace\".\n\nAt the time, the administration said it would monitor the new Syrian government's actions, including \"taking steps toward normalising ties with Israel\" and addressing \"foreign terrorists\" and militant groups operating in the country."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2p1zx4dkro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:00:10.099+00:00","title":"Wicked premiere: Ariana Grande on going

has said her new darker hair is not about saying goodbye to her Wicked character Glinda, but rather a way of “doing something different”.\n\nThe singer and actress, 32, has recently swapped her signature, Glinda-era blonde locks with a brunette tone, sending fans wild on social media.\n\nIt comes as she resumes her role as the Good Witch of the North alongside Cynthia Erivo, who returns as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, in Wicked: For Good.\n\nOn Monday night, London’s Leicester Square was transformed into the magical Land of Oz, with Wicked-inspired shades of pink and green and a sprawling yellow brick road running through the middle.\n\nFans came dressed in witches' hats and green makeup, while others channelled their inner Glinda in sparkly floor length gowns.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, Erivo, who was recently nominated for two Grammys, said it felt “overwhelming” to be closing the Wicked chapter.\n\n“It feels beautiful though,” said Grande. “This project will always be part of our lives.”\n\nThe sequel will see Grande and Erivo joined once again by co-stars Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard.\n\nBridgerton star Bailey, 37, who reprises his role of Prince Fiyero, has recently made history by becoming People's first-ever openly gay \"Sexiest Man Alive\".\n\nWhen asked by BBC News who his sexiest man of the year is, he didn’t skip a beat.\n\n“Jon M Chu,” he said, naming Wicked’s film director. “Because his genius, and his compassion, knows no end.”\n\nHe then laughed, adding: “And because he cast me in this film, so that is entirely sexy.”\n\nThe sequel has a romantic plotline, which could lead some to wonder whether Bailey was channelling his inner Anthony (his Bridgerton character).\n\n“I’m sure I’m mining something that’s in my bones somewhere,” he says.\n\nAs a sidebar, I also had to ask him whether would ever do Celebrity Traitors.\n\n“The answer is, we’ll have to find out,” he said, pausing dramatically before laughing. “I feel like I’m already exposing my game play.”\n\nWhen Grande unveiled her new look on Instagram recently, many fans speculated that it was a way for her to bid farewell to her Good Witch character.\n\nBut when asked about that, she said: “No, I think it was just a way of doing something different for the second movie, and playing into the darker tones, with clothing and beauty.\n\n“It’s fun,” she said, while Erivo smiled and nodded.\n\nThe sequel picks up where the first film left off and covers the years after Elphaba and Glinda's decision to part ways.\n\nElphaba is now an enemy of the state of Oz, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard.\n\nThe films have been adapted from the hugely successful Broadway and West End musical, which itself was based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel.\n\nHowever, the stage musical was split into two films for its big-screen adaptation.\n\nThey were shot simultaneously between December 2022 and January 2024, with production interrupted mid-way through by the Hollywood actors' strike.\n\nWicked  was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK , and scored 10 Oscar nominations - winning two for best costume and production design.\n\nAt two hours 40 minutes, the first film alone was almost as long as the entire length of the stage show.\n\nBut the second film is slightly shorter, at 2 hours and 18 minutes.\n\nErivo and Grande's chemistry and real-life friendship prompted several viral interview moments during the first film's promotional run last year, and the pair jointly opened the Academy Awards in March with a Wicked medley.\n\nOne challenge facing the sequel is that most of the best known songs from the musical, such as Defying Gravity, Popular and The Wizard And I, featured in the first film.\n\nBut the forthcoming follow-up will feature two brand new songs, with Chu telling BBC News that the first time Grande and Erivo heard them, “they just cried”.\n\n“It means a lot to now, however many years later, we’re here and people get to see it on the big screen. I’m so excited.”\n\nWicked For Good is in cinemas on 21 November."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/shutdown-deal-revives-democratic-infighting.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:30:28-05:00","title":"Shutdown Deal Revives Democratic Infighting","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Democratic Party is deeply divided over a bipartisan shutdown deal that ended a 41-day government closure, with critics—including progressive and moderate members—arguing it failed to extend critical health care subsidies.

Smith playing Bunny Munro - the sex-obsessed door-to-door salesman from his 2009 novel The Death of Bunny Munro - he was taken aback.\n\n\"In the book, Bunny's not good at what he does - he wants to sleep with everyone he can and he's an unsuccessful lothario who women treat like a joke,\" Cave explains.\n\n\"Whereas Matt is hot and that adds a complexity that the original Bunny didn't have because when Matt's Bunny hits on women, they kind of like it and he draws them in.\"\n\nThe Australian musician's darkly comic tale of sex, guilt and grief has been reimagined as a TV series with Doctor Who and The Crown star Smith taking on the titular role of a man spiralling after his wife's suicide.\n\nHaving kidnapped his son, Bunny sets off on a chaotic road trip, clinging to his job and desires as everything else falls apart around him.\n\nSmith says that he signed up to play Bunny immediately after he first met Cave - and thought the role was \"an amazing opportunity and challenge to play a man pushed to the edge by grief, sex and life\".\n\nFor Cave, the project revisits one of his morally complex characters and the 68-year-old stands by the fact that Bunny isn't wholly a bad person.\n\n\"When I look at Bunny, I don't see an aberration,\" he says. \"He's a flawed human being struggling with grief, his own legacy and all the things that make us human.\"\n\nSmith agrees and his version of Bunny is more beguiling and dangerous, and his appeal makes his downfall harder to dismiss.\n\n\"He's selfish and difficult, but also funny, mad and kind of charismatic,\" he explains. \"He's human and I saw the good in him, thought he was quite funny and became quite attached to him.\"\n\nIt's that tension of Bunny being both repellent and relatable that gives the story its emotional punch.\n\nSmith says that beneath the chaos, it's \"a really touching story about a father and son\".\n\nCave nods in agreement, adding that the tale of Bunny makes him want to hug his kids.\n\n\"It's a reminder of the vulnerability of our children and of the need to hold them while there's still time.\"\n\nSet in 2003 in Brighton, the adaptation turns Cave's novel into a period piece that feels close enough to the present day but distant enough to reflect how the world, and its tolerance for men like Bunny, has changed.\n\nBut both men resist saying that the show makes a statement about masculinity.\n\n\"That's for other people to decide,\" Smith says. \"But for me, it's really a story about the sins of the father and about Bunny Junior breaking that cycle.\"\n\nCave calls it a story about inheritance - what we carry from our parents and what we choose to leave behind.\n\n\"Little Bunny needs to get away from his father as he's chaotic and a threat to his safety but Bunny is essentially good and we wouldn't want his son to escape those parts of him.\"\n\nThe singer also suggests it's much deeper than an exploration of masculinity as it reflects \"how we deal with our own nature and humanity.\"\n\nThat sense of humanity has always been at the core of Cave's work and his music with The Bad Seeds is \"essentially autobiographical\".\n\nIn 2015, Cave's son Arthur died after falling from a cliff in Brighton and in 2022 his eldest son, Jethro, died at the age of 30.\n\nThe singer has previously written about the  \"vastness\" of his grief  and about how the  death of his sons changed him.\n\nHe also moved to Los Angeles because \"Brighton had just become too sad\" but he later returned after he \"realised that, regardless of where we lived, we just took our sadness with us\".\n\n\"If you listen to my songs and the words, they paint a very clear picture of what I'm like and what I've gone through,\" he tells the BBC. \"Even the despicable characters, they're not removed from me, they are just part of a complex character.\"\n\nIn contrast, Cave explains that Bunny Munro isn't autobiographical but there is some overlap between his life and that of his creation.\n\n\"I wasn't writing about someone I didn't understand,\" he says. \"I felt extremely connected to Bunny - not that I went around trying to seduce women, though there was a

Australia's bid to host COP31 falters amid deadlock with Turkey\n\nOn the banks of the Amazon River delta, business and government officials, campaigners and lobbyists are holed up in meeting rooms in an effort to come up with ideas and action-plans to prevent an impending climate crisis.\n\nEvery delegation has its interests, and negotiations at UN climate talks are all about compromise. Which is a problem Australia knows all too well as it engages in parallel negotiations of its own in Belém.\n\nFor some time now, there's been a deadlock between Australia and Turkey over who will host next year's meeting – and it all needs to be ironed out by the end of next week when the talks come to a close. If no agreement between the two is reached, hosting will default to the German city of Bonn, where the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is headquartered.\n\nBrazil would have preferred the matter be sorted out much sooner, mindful that the quiet chatter in COP corridors about the next presidency will soon become deafening, with neither side backing down.\n\nBack in 2022, Australia put together a convincing proposition of co-hosting COP31 with the Pacific.\n\nA year after focusing on rainforests in Brazil, the oceans would be in the spotlight. Rising sea levels  are a constant talking point , and Pacific islanders have the most to lose.\n\nFiji held the presidency in 2017 but the talks themselves took place in Bonn – 2026 would be a chance for the world to see first-hand the effects of climate change.\n\nFor Australia, showing commitment to its neighbours was good domestic politics.\n\n\"Having it close to your home means you can create space for the greatest ambition,\" says Shiva Gounden of Greenpeace Australia Pacific. \"The Pacific has always led in trying to come up with ambition that really addresses the climate crisis.\"\n\nBut it was also good geopolitics, putting on a united front with the Pacific, a region where Chinese influence is growing. Australia's position would be strengthened, the Pacific would be put on the map. It felt like a win-win.\n\nHow times change. Now, Australia's bid to co-host COP with the Pacific looks like it's faltering. And possibly failing.\n\nAustralia has long maintained it has overwhelming support to host next year's summit.\n\nIn fact, more than two years ago, in my conversations with diplomatic sources, there was an extremely confident prediction that this was Australia's bid to lose. It was just a question of coming to a deal with Turkey, but the belief was that that wouldn't be an insurmountable problem.\n\nRecently several options have been floated, including reportedly splitting the hosting rights with Ankara.\n\n\"There was a fair bit of complacency early on in the process,\" says Gavan McFadzean of the Australian Conservation Foundation, who is currently in Belém. \"[There was] an assumption that an Australian/Pacific joint presidential bid would just sail through.\"\n\nBut Turkey is not budging on its desire to host. While that's not Australia's fault, many feel more could have been done to push Australia's credentials as a climate leader.\n\nAt the COP leaders' meeting last week, several dozen leaders attended including the UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. President Erdogan of Turkey didn't show up; neither did Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. It's not a strong signal of Australia's commitment.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC last week, the president of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, who has been one of the biggest Pacific voices when it comes to climate change, said it was \"crunch time\", arguing that Albanese's presence could hopefully \"push Turkiye over the line.\"\n\nHosting COP was an election promise by Albanese, but it's not a universally popular political move.\n\nWhile the expense of bringing COP here is often cited by critics - recent reports put it at A$1bn ($650m; 500m pounds) -  supporters of hosting COP talk about the investment and tourism it will bring to Australia, especially Adelaide where it would be hosted.\n\nBut there's also a lot to lose for Australia more broadly.\n\nThere's been a fair bit of criticism over UN climate talks in recent years. Last year, in Azerbaijan, the president said that natural gas was \"a gift from God\". The year before that, the talks were hosted in Dubai – a city in one of the richest oil states in the world.\n\nTurkey, if it wins, has close ties with the Russia and Saudi Arabia, both countries who have frustrated past efforts to move forward on climate action.\n\nSo there was a view that Australia could help turn around the COP brand. The idea being that Australia is one of the \"good ones\", committed to bringing down emissions and working multilaterally to reach UN goals.\n\nOnly there's a big flaw in that argument - Australia is the largest exporter of coal in the world and one of the biggest natural gas exporters. Australia has one of the highest per capita emissions globally.\n\nWhile Albanese has made strong commitments to tackle climate change - his government recently committed to bringing down emissions in 2035 to between 60 and 72% of 2005 levels - his administration has also recently  extended the North West Shelf , one of Australia's largest gas projects.\n\nIt's trying to embrace the transition to renewables but knows that its loyalties - and its wealth -  lie in fossil fuel exports.\n\nThe minister for climate change and energy, Chris Bowen, has been a huge champion of Australia co-hosting COP. But several sources have told me that Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong have been less than enthusiastic about the prospect.\n\nDoes Australia want to come under such scrutiny? Perhaps not everyone in the government will be upset if it can't pull off the bid."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/trump-government-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:55:34-05:00","title":"For Trump, Nothing Was Off Limits During the Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The government shutdown, the longest in American history, saw unprecedented actions by the Trump administration, including cutting food stamps, firing government workers, withholding back pay, and canceling funding in Democratic-led states.

But it’s also perhaps the most punishing, in part because President Trump has taken actions no previous administration ever took during a shutdown.\n\nOver the past six weeks, the Trump administration cut food stamps for millions of low-income Americans. It tried to fire thousands of government workers and withhold back pay from others, while freezing or canceling money for projects in Democratic-led states.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether there will be a political price to pay for Mr. Trump or his party, with polls showing that voters generally blamed Republicans more for the shutdown. But for now, the tactics appear to have worked, after a group of Democrats agreed to support a bill to end the shutdown and drop the concessions their party had demanded.\n\n“Standing up to Donald Trump didn’t work,” said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, said on MSNBC Monday. “It actually gave him more power.”\n\nThe bare-knuckle politics the Trump administration employed during the shutdown — often coming from his budget director Russell T.

the Husband of a Republican Congressional Ally\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T20:10:24-05:00\n\nPresident Trump quietly pardoned the husband of Representative Diana Harshbarger, Republican of Tennessee, last week amid a string of clemency grants to allies.\n\nIn 2013, Robert Harshbarger Jr., a licensed pharmacist at the time, pleaded guilty to health care fraud and distributing a misbranded drug, in this case kidney medications, some of which came from China, that were not approved for the purpose by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nMs. Harshbarger, also a pharmacist, was a corporate officer and agent for American Inhalation Medication Specialists, the company through which her husband sold the drugs, according to corporate records, which show that the company was dissolved in 2018. But during her first successful congressional campaign in 2020, she denied to local media that she had any involvement with the company, after attack ads sought to link her to her husband’s conviction.\n\nMs. Harshbarger’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.\n\nA White House official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said that Mr. Harshbarger was not pardoned because of his last name or other affiliations. The official did not respond when asked if Ms. Hashbarger lobbied for the pardon.\n\nThe pardon, which was not publicly announced by the White House, was posted on the website of the Justice Department’s office of the pardon attorney on Monday.\n\nIt was the latest use of the unfettered presidential clemency power by Mr. Trump to reward allies and make political points, including casting prosecutions of his supporters as corrupt witch hunts.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The rise of critical literature and war poetry—especially Wilfred Owen's depiction of war's 'pity'—has challenged these narratives. As the veteran generation disappears, the article questions whether Remembrance can retain its emotional power without personal witness. It concludes that the true purpose of Remembrance must be to acknowledge the overwhelming sorrow and human cost of war, not to celebrate victory or national pride.

Their families came from the small village of Glenluce in South-West Scotland where I grew up. Every day, on my way to school, I'd walk past their names, which were inscribed on the village war memorial.\n\nGeorge was a labourer and enlisted early, in September 1914. He was killed at Gallipoli eight months later. Thomas enlisted in 1916 and died the following year in France. Both had emigrated to Australia, part of a wave of rural depopulation as farm workers were replaced by mechanisation.\n\nTheirs are among 51 names on that pale grey granite cenotaph.\n\nIt was built by a master mason called Robert MacMillan Clive, who was my great-grandfather. As a child in the 1970s, we used to gather by it on Armistice Day to \"remember\". Once or twice, I carried the Union flag.\n\nBut it meant little to us. World War One seemed like ancient history in my childhood imagination, even though I was born only 40 years after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nThe idea of Remembrance, the forms it took, emerged in the immediate aftermath of the Great War, as it was then known.\n\nOf the eight million British men who fought in it, almost one million were killed: one in eight. In Scotland one in four never came home.\n\nBut today, some 107 years after the guns fell silent, there are no WW1 veterans left alive in the UK. The last veteran of the trenches was Harry Patch, who died in 2009 at the age of 111.\n\nThough we go on remembering vicariously, performing rituals of solemnity and sorrow to honour those who died, the meaning of those rituals have changed.\n\nSo, what does public commemoration mean when the veterans themselves have all died - and when there are few others alive today who remember first-hand the mass shared grief that gave rise to them?\n\nOf the 51 men listed on the memorial in Glenluce, at least 20 have no known graves. Their bodies were either never recovered, or they were never identified.\n\nThe men of my village left their bones in France and Flanders, Palestine and Gallipoli and Greece and Macedonia.\n\nThe village - like every town and village in the country - emerged from the war as a community of bereavement. Pretty much every street had lost someone. Survivors carved their grief into the landscape of Britain, by raising memorials in stone to those they'd lost.\n\nThe end of the war in 1918 brought an urgent shared imperative: to make sense of what had happened; to find meaning, a way to believe that it had not been for nothing.\n\n\"There was this public need for recognition,\" says Liam Markey, research associate at Liverpool University, who has written a study of how Remembrance has changed over the decades.\n\nThe early national commemorations were \"also a way to legitimise the war\", he says, \"to be able to say that these were the men who ended war; that this was the war to end all wars.\"\n\nProfessor Jay Winter, of Yale University, author of Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning, points out that this all nodded to a very deep commitment.\n\n\"You know, 'it mustn't happen again. We cannot inflict this on our children'. There was astonishment, a shock realisation that the war had been so much more horrible than anyone had imagined it could be.\"\n\nAlmost immediately, the ritualising of sorrow acquired a public and national dimension.\n\nA wooden cenotaph, initially intended to be temporary, was erected in Whitehall. The remains of an unidentified soldier were buried at Westminster Abbey on Armistice Day 1920.\n\nThe inscription on his grave reads \"thus are commemorated the many multitudes… who gave the most that man can give, life itself… They buried him among kings because he had done good toward God and toward his house.\"\n\n\"This is one of the most unusual moments in British history,\" says Professor Winter. \"When the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior was consecrated, it's estimated that two million people gathered to see it.\n\n\"It was a moment of joining together in recognition of the injustice of young men dying so that the old could go on living.\n\n“There's something terrible in that message and it needs to be performed in order to be tolerated.\"\n\nThere was a paradox central to the early years of commemoration: that performing something that came to be known as \"Remembrance\" became one way of trying to forget.\n\n\"I think the first thing [they] had to forget is the harsh and appalling realities of the dismemberment of human bodies that went on,\" says Professor Winter.\n\n\"What had to be forgotten was not only the suffering but the indignity of not dying physically intact.\n\n\"The [at first] Imperial and later Commonwealth War Graves Commissions are brilliant in that they're beautiful. The beauty forgets the ugliness of the war.\"\n\nThe idea that the Great War had been the war to end all wars had fallen apart in the late 1930s, with the outbreak of World War Two.\n\n\"The white poppy first appeared as early as the 1930s,\" explains Liam Markey.\n\nSome veterans themselves dissented from the formal rituals of Remembrance. \"One veteran its quoted in one of the newspapers saying 'every day is Remembrance Day for us'.\"\n\nAt the end of the WW2, the public showed no great enthusiasm to build sites of Remembrance for those who'd died. There were no new monuments to the dead of 1939-45. Instead their names were tacked onto existing post-1918 memorials.\n\nParticipation in Remembrance services began to dwindle.\n\nBy the 1960s, many people began to believe that as the memory of the trenches receded into distant memory, the annual commemoration had begun to serve as a way of sanitising the war; that they had begun to ritualise not shared bereavement, but national pride.\n\nAnd, in the age of anti-Vietnam War protests, there was a backlash.\n\nBenjamin Britten's War Requiem was completed in early 1962. He incorporated the poetry of Wilfred Owen, which graphically depicted what Owen called the \"pity\" of war.\n\nThe war poets had not been much read in the 20s and 30s. They had not appealed to a public seeking to turn the page on the horrors of what they'd lived through.\n\nBut by the 60s they, and especially Owen, had found large new readerships.\n\nAlan Clark, before he became Conservative Minister, published The Donkeys - based on the phrase \"lions led by…\" - which challenged the settled narrative that the leader of British forces in France, Earl Haig, had been a strategic genius and the architect of victory.\n\nAt Haig's funeral in 1928, a million had lined the streets but by the 60s he was popularly perceived as the \"Butcher of the Somme\".\n\nThe war experience was now being mercilessly satirised. The stage musical Oh! What a Lovely War opened in 1963 and was turned into a film directed by Richard Attenborough in 1969.\n\nMuch of the public wanted a different take on war - and one that challenged solemn pieties at the heart of Official Remembrance.\n\nIt has been 14 years since the last surviving British veteran of WW1 died. As for WW2, of the five million British men and women who served in it, the Royal British Legion believes fewer than 8,000 are still alive. The youngest of these is 98 and many are over 100.\n\nSo, what will Remembrance mean when they are all gone?\n\nPoppy Scotland, a charity linked to the Royal British Legion, plants a Garden of Remembrance at this time of year in the heart of Edinburgh.\n\nIt is a carpet of little wooden crosses, perhaps nine inches tall, decked with poppies. Last weekend I watched a woman plant one and stand quietly for a few moments.\n\n\"It's nothing to do with the military for me,\" she admitted. \"I come here to remember my sister, who died of cancer two years ago. She was my only sibling.\n\n“She wasn't religious so I haven't used a cross, just a vertical piece of wood. But it's good place to come and remember.\"\n\nPeople also queued at a pop-up stall offering Remembrance merchandise: t-shirts bearing the words Lest We Forget, poppy-themed Christmas cards, napkins, water bottles, mugs, large plastic poppies for your car.\n\nJane, a 56-year NHS worker, was taking donations. \"I do this every year,\" she said. \"At work I've seen a lot of people who've served [in other wars too] and been affected, often in their mental health. They need support. It means a lot to me.\"\n\nDebbie Clapham, from Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire, bought an enamel poppy and was pinning it on her husband Sean's rugby shirt when we spoke.\n\n\"We go the parade every year in Stowe. People still come to watch but the parade itself is getting smaller and smaller.\n\n“They stop the traffic, and you can see some of the drivers getting irritated - and that annoys me.\"\n\n\"I was in Perth, Australia one Armistice Day,\" Sean added. \"The whole city came to a standstill at 11am. There were bagpipers at all the street corners. It was very moving.\"\n\nInevitably, as the generation that fought WW2 disappears, the focus is shifting.\n\nThere are 176,000 service veterans in Scotland out of two million in the UK as a whole, many of whom fought in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nPoppy Scotland, like the Royal British Region in the rest of the UK, offers them financial support, help with housing, and with adjusting to civilian life.\n\nYet most of the people I saw buying the merchandise last weekend seemEd to be middle aged or older. Where are the young, I asked Jessica Gillespie, the Poppy Appeal manager there.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more young people volunteering,\" she insists.\n\n\"There a rugby international in town later. Wait till the rugby fans arrive. We'll be busy with the young then. They’re among our biggest supporters.\"\n\nThe public rituals we perform as a country haven't changed much in a hundred years. But the spirit of them, the sense of purpose that accompanies them, shifts all the time.\n\nFor the men and women who took part in them more then a century ago, they were about alleviating devastating personal and collective loss and a grief that embraced the whole population.\n\nIn the absence of that grief, and soon, when there is no-one left who served in WW2, how will these acts of Remembrance retain their power to move us?\n\nThe challenge will be to remember that the core purpose of the phenomenon we call Remembrance not to celebrate victory, or to celebrate the flag, or to take pride in what was done on the battlefields, but to acknowledge a great and overwhelming collective sorrow - and what Wilfred Owen called the \"pity of war\".\n\nBack in Glenluce there is a name on the memorial that holds my attention more than others: William Clive.\n\nI've often wondered whether, like Robert MacMillan Clive, we were related. No photo of William survives, but we know quite a bit about him. He was five foot seven-and-a-half inches tall, with dark hair and grey eyes, and like others he too had emigrated, enlisting in Toronto in March 1916. He had, for a spell, worked as a nurse.\n\nHe died age 34 at the Battle of the Somme, six months after joining the Army.\n\nHad William Clive survived into old age I might have met him when I was a child. And, as long ago as it feels in some ways, this, on the other hand, makes WW1 seem startlingly recent.\n\nTop picture credits: European Pressphoto Agency, Roll of Honour\n\nBBC InDepth  is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Mr. al-Shara has since redefined himself as a statesman while seeking to return Syria to the international fold and rebuild the country as it emerges from a long and devastating civil war.\n\nA World Bank report estimated the cost of Syria’s reconstruction at about $216 billion.\n\nSince taking power, Mr. al-Shara has toured the wealthy Gulf states to drum up international investment. In September, he went to New York and became the first Syrian president to address the U.N. General Assembly in nearly 60 years.\n\nThe next month, he visited the Kremlin and met President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who once backed Mr. al-Assad in his government’s fight against Mr. al-Shara’s rebels. They discussed developing Syria’s oil fields and other projects in the energy, transport and tourism sectors.\n\nBefore traveling to Washington, Mr. al-Shara joined world leaders in Brazil at an annual U.N. climate summit and invited investments in renewable energy as part of his government’s plans for reconstruction.\n\nMr. al-Shara has been embraced by Mr. Trump.\n\nIn December, the U.S. government dropped the $10 million bounty, and in July, it revoked the terrorist designation for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that Mr. al-Shara once led.\n\nMr. Trump has also pledged that Washington would lift all sanctions on Syria to support its efforts to rebuild. So far, Mr. Trump has granted Syria widespread exemptions on sanctions and pushed for Congress to repeal a 2019 law, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, which imposed the toughest sanctions on Syria.\n\nThere remains some resistance to doing so in light of concerns about Syria’s sometimes rocky transition since the Assad regime collapsed.\n\nOver the past year, there have been a series of deadly outbursts of sectarian violence, some involving armed groups that support Mr. al-Shara’s government.\n\nMr. al-Shara has also come under criticism for concentrating power in his own hands and those of a close circle of loyalists.\n\nBefore his visit to Washington, the U.N. Security Council voted on Thursday to remove Mr. al-Shara from a terrorism sanctions list, a move pushed by the United States. That step will allow him to travel more freely, without having to seek waivers for some trips.\n\nBy signing onto the coalition fighting the Islamic State, Mr. al-Shara is further bolstering his relationship with the Trump administration, analysts say.\n\nWhile the Islamic State lost its territorial foothold in Syria in 2019, it continues to have a presence in the country, and there are fears that it could re-emerge if Mr. al-Shara fails to stabilize and unite the country and consolidate his own security forces.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/world/middleeast/iraq-election-what-to-know.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:01:16-05:00","title":"Iraqis Are Voting for a New Parliament.

Sunday evening, in the wake of scathing criticism by the Trump administration, as an extraterritorial example of the intense pressure that President Trump has put on broadcast news organizations in the United States.\n\nBut the British Broadcasting Corporation is not CBS or ABC, both of which settled lawsuits brought by Mr. Trump over their coverage of him. Its current crisis — the gravest the BBC has faced in decades — is less about Mr. Trump, experts said, than about the insoluble tensions of a renowned public service broadcaster operating in a bitterly divided political and media world.\n\nVilified by political enemies, who accuse it of chronic bias — in this case, to the left — and targeted by rival media firms, who resent its public funding, the BBC is a perennial football in Britain’s political contests. With its global reach, it regularly runs afoul of foreign governments as well, from India to the United States.\n\nThe BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, attributed their resignations in part to the tempest over a misleadingly edited documentary about Mr. Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol. Their exits, however, followed a string of disputes over the BBC’s coverage of other sensitive issues, ranging from the war in Gaza to transgender rights.\n\n“It’s a critical time for the BBC to be impartial because there’s not much impartiality in the world,” said Howard Stringer, a former president of CBS News who once served on the BBC’s board. “They clearly felt that taking on Trump was important, but in this case, it gave Trump an opening and it left Tim Davie exposed.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Monday night to end the nation’s longest government shutdown, after a critical splinter group of Democrats joined with Republicans and backed a spending package that omitted the chief concession their party had spent weeks demanding.\n\nThe 60-to-40 vote, on Day 41 of the shutdown, signaled a break in the gridlock that has shuttered the government for weeks, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed, millions of Americans at risk of losing food assistance and millions more facing air-travel disruptions.\n\nThe measure goes next to the House, which is expected to take it up no sooner than Wednesday and where the small Republican margin of control and intense Democratic opposition could make for a close vote. President Trump has indicated that he will sign it.\n\nThe breakthrough came after eight senators in the Democratic caucus broke their own party’s blockade of spending legislation Republicans have been trying to pass for weeks to reopen the government, prompting a bitter backlash in their ranks.\n\nThey said they had done so after concluding that Republicans were never going to accede to Democrats’ central demand in the shutdown fight — the extension of federal health care subsidies set to expire at the end of the year — while millions of Americans continued to suffer amid the federal closure.\n\n“We had no path forward on health care because the Republicans said, ‘We will not talk about health care with the government shut down,’” said Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. “And we had SNAP beneficiaries and those relying on other important services who were losing benefits because of the shutdown.”\n\nIt will still take days to reopen the government. Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday urged House members — who have not held a vote in nearly two months as they took an extended recess during the shutdown — to begin the process of returning to Washington “right now.”\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Trump said that he approved of the plan.\n\n“We’ll be opening up our country very quickly,” he said, calling the package “very good.”\n\nWhile the legislation omits any mention of the tax credits, Democrats said they would accept an offer by Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, to hold a vote on the issue later this year, when the subsidies are set to expire.\n\nBut that measure, which would require 60 votes to pass, faces long odds in the Republican-controlled Senate and even less chance of advancing in the House, where Mr. Johnson would be unlikely to bring it up amid widespread opposition in his party.\n\nMany Democrats, including a phalanx of senators across the ideological spectrum, called that commitment woefully insufficient and angrily denounced the spending deal.\n\nAfter holding his party together for 40 days in the shutdown fight, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, opposed the deal made by some of his own members because, he said on Monday, “it fails to do anything of substance to fix America’s health care crisis.”\n\nOthers argued the agreement amounted to enabling Mr. Trump’s agenda and tactics, when Democrats should instead be standing up to him and Republicans.\n\n“Trump and MAGA Republicans have been shutting down the government since Inauguration Day, gutting Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and engaging in the greatest health care heist in history — all to pay for tax cuts for CEO billionaires,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. “The American people want us to stop the heist, not drive the getaway car.”\n\nThe compromise measure, which was largely negotiated by leaders on the Senate Appropriations Committee, includes a spending package that would fund the government through January, as well as three separate spending bills to cover programs related to agriculture, military construction and legislative agencies for most of 2026.\n\nThe package also includes a provision that would reverse layoffs of federal workers made during the shutdown and ensure retroactive pay for those who have been furloughed.\n\nMr. Trump, who has repeatedly defied Congress’s dictates on spending matters, said on Monday that he would comply with those provisions.\n\n“I’ll abide by the deal,” he said.\n\nAs many as a dozen Democrats, many centrists hailing from purple states who had been uncomfortable with the idea of backing a government shutdown, had been quietly huddling for weeks in search of an off-ramp. Several privately agreed to hold the party line until at least Nov. 1, the start date for the annual open enrollment period for people who receive health coverage through the federal marketplace, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.\n\nBut as the impact of the shutdown worsened and radiated across the nation, with flight cancellations racking up ahead of Thanksgiving travel and rising uncertainty around accessibility to food stamps, moderate Democrats were ready to break from their party. In the end, the eight who did were all senators who could afford to take a political hit; two are retiring while the other six are not up for re-election next year.\n\n“The question was, does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits?” said Senator Angus King, an independent of Maine who caucuses with Democrats and voted for the deal. “Our judgment was that it will not produce that result. And the evidence for that is almost seven weeks of fruitless attempts to make that happen. Would it change in a week or another week or after Thanksgiving or Christmas? And there’s no evidence that it would.”\n\n“What there is evidence of,” Mr. King added, “is the harm that the shutdown is doing to the country.”\n\nIn a 53-to-47 party-line vote, Republicans defeated a last-ditch effort by Democrats on Monday night to try to add a proposal to the spending package that would extend the credits for one year.\n\nBut the fight is far from over. Having succeeded in elevating the health care subsidies as a political issue during the shutdown, Democrats are eager to keep the pressure on Republicans to extend them or suffer the consequences from voters who polls show overwhelmingly want to see them protected.\n\nAlso rejected on Monday on a party-line vote was a Democratic effort to add a provision to bar the White House from using a maneuver known as a “pocket rescission,” in which the administration seeks to unilaterally cancel spending approved by Congress by making the request so late in the fiscal year that lawmakers do not have time to reject it before the funding expires. The Trump administration used that maneuver earlier this year to cancel $4.9 billion Congress had approved for foreign aid programs.\n\nSenators also defeated an effort by Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, to remove language from the bill that would effectively ban the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-derived products. It was rejected on a bipartisan vote of 76 to 26, allowing the ban to stand.\n\nAlso tucked into the legislation was a provision that would provide a wide legal avenue for Republican senators whose phone records were seized as part of the investigation by Jack Smith, the former special counsel, into the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 to sue the government for at least half a million dollars each.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/nyregion/chi-osse-hakeem-jeffries.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:21:12-05:00","title":"Against Mamdani’s Wishes, Gen Z Councilman Plans to Challenge Jeffries","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Chi Ossé, a 27-year-old progressive city councilman aligned with Zohran Mamdani, is planning to challenge House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries in the June 2025 primary.

He said in a statement that he had been “hearing a lot of concern about Democratic Party leadership. It’s a big part of why I worked so hard to get Zohran elected and defeat the establishment’s champion, Andrew Cuomo.”\n\n“Right now, I’m focused on serving my constituents and guaranteeing the success of Zohran’s agenda at City Hall,” he added.\n\nMr. Mamdani has privately tried to discourage his ideological ally from running. The mayor-elect and his team fear that another high-profile challenge from the left might compromise his own bid to push the Democratic establishment to support his affordability agenda.\n\nMr. Mamdani also may want to avoid the optics of having Mr. Ossé challenge the House Democratic leader, who endorsed Mr. Mamdani in October after months of negotiation.\n\nThe disagreement caused Mr. Ossé to be disinvited from Mr. Mamdani’s election night watch party, according to two people familiar with the matter, even though he has been a frequent presence at Mr. Mamdani’s campaign events. Instead, Mr. Ossé said he spent the night “with my constituents at D.S.A. events celebrating Zohran’s incredible win.”\n\nMr. Mamdani on Monday sidestepped questions about Mr. Ossé, saying he was solely focused on preparing for his inauguration and would keep his “opinions just to the work of the transition.” Mr. Ossé’s plans to challenge Mr. Jeffries were first reported by The New York Post.\n\nFor Mr. Jeffries, any primary challenge will be a distraction from his main priority of trying to lead House Democrats into the majority. He has not run in a competitive primary since 2012, when he first won office in a Brooklyn district that encompasses gentrifying communities as well as working-class Black neighborhoods that tend to be more moderate, like East New York and Canarsie.\n\nJustin Chermol, a spokesman for Mr. Jeffries, said he “is focused on addressing the crushing Republican health care crisis, combating Donald Trump’s scheme to gerrymander congressional maps and leading the effort to take back the House of Representatives in 2026.”\n\nDemocratic leaders have historically tried to discourage insurgent candidates, especially from the left, from challenging incumbents. That has not stopped several primary challenges to state lawmakers, including one whose district overlaps with Mr. Jeffries.\n\nAny challenger ideologically aligned with Mr. Mamdani may hope that the mayor-elect, now a national figure who can raise large sums of cash for allies, would support their campaigns.\n\nBut Mr. Mamdani and his aides have stressed that he would not simply follow the endorsements of the local D.S.A. chapter, and would look to back candidates who can help him deliver on his agenda. It appears that Mr. Ossé may not meet Mr. Mamdani’s requirement.\n\nMr. Ossé, who was first elected at the age of 23 to the City Council in 2021, did not unconditionally support Mr. Mamdani for mayor until late May. He initially donated to the mayoral campaign of Brad Lander, the city comptroller, and to State Senator Zellnor Myrie; he could not donate to Mr. Mamdani because his campaign had already maxed out on contributions. He later told supporters to rank Mr. Mamdani No. 1 on their primary ballots, one of the earliest councilmembers to do so.\n\nHe has gained prominence for his accessible distillations of progressive policies on TikTok and Instagram. Last year, he introduced legislation, which passed and took effect in June, that forces many landlords to cover broker fees, instead of renters.\n\nLike Mr. Mamdani, Mr. Ossé will seek support from the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, an influential organizing engine that has helped local progressives like Mr. Mamdani win recent elections. But unlike Mr. Mamdani, whose membership in the group dates back to 2017, Mr. Ossé’s roots are not as deep.\n\nHe said last month that he had recently joined the group, but as recently as 2023, he was telling followers that he is “not a D.S.A. member nor was I endorsed by D.S.A.” If the chapter signals that it may not endorse him, it could affect his plans to run, two people who have spoken to him about the race said.\n\nMr. Ossé is expected to appear later this month before the D.S.A.’s electoral working group, which handles congressional endorsements.\n\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/world/middleeast/iraq-parliamentary-election-vote.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:01:09-05:00","title":"As Iraqis Vote for a Parliament, U.S. Presses to Rid Country of Iran’s Influence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Iraq is holding parliamentary elections as it seeks stability after years of conflict, sectarian violence, and insurgency.

for every inch of Baghdad’s streets. There are pictures of politicians wearing hard hats and slogans vowing “strength and prosperity.”\n\nConcrete walls that once shielded buildings from car bombs now protect glitzy new apartment developments, promising cafes, gyms and spas.\n\nAfter a long U.S. occupation, years of sectarian bloodshed and a jihadist insurgency, Iraq has become an improbable haven of calm in the Middle East, at least relative to many other parts of the region. Safeguarding this hard-won peace is a top priority for Iraqis as parliamentary elections get underway on Tuesday.\n\n“The Iraqi people have reached a point where they can no longer tolerate conflict and wars and all these misadventures,” Mohammed al-Sudani, the prime minister, told The New York Times in an interview last week. “People want stability, security and development.”\n\nMore than 7,700 candidates from 114 party lists are competing for 329 seats. Once the results are in, there will be weeks, and possibly months, of negotiating for parties to forge a coalition with the largest share of seats, and then form a government.\n\nMr. al-Sudani, often credited for Iraq’s stability and a construction boom, heads an alliance of parties expected to win the most votes. But some of his former political allies have vowed to prevent him from forming a ruling coalition to gain a second term.\n\nAnd just below the surface of this election lurks the thorny question of whether and how Iraq can curb the considerable influence of its once powerful neighbor, Iran.\n\nThe U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 toppled the longtime dictator Saddam Hussein and ended government control by the country’s Sunni Muslim minority. Since then, Iraqi politics have been dominated by the Shiite Muslim majority.\n\nIraq has been stuck ever since in a tug of war between Washington and Tehran, the regional Shiite power.\n\nIn recent years, an array of powerful Iran-linked militias have been gaining political influence in Iraq.\n\nThese mostly Shiite groups were created in 2014 as part of the so-called Popular Mobilization Forces to fight the Islamic State, or ISIS, the jihadist Sunni force that seized large parts of the country and brutally targeted Iraqi Shiites. Some obtained military and financial backing from Iran.\n\nThe threat of ISIS has faded, but the Iran-backed militias have grown more powerful. Their leaders argue they have the right to retain weapons as long as U.S. forces remain in Iraq. And they have pushed Iraqi officials hard to expel American troops.\n\nMr. al-Sudani secured a commitment for a phased withdrawal of the roughly 1,300 U.S. forces still in Iraq by September 2026. But U.S. officials are already negotiating to maintain a presence in the country, saying it is needed to fight Islamic State remnants.\n\nIran’s regional power has dwindled in the past two years since its Palestinian ally, Hamas, led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The attack ignited a war with Israel that devastated Gaza and upended the Middle East geopolitical order.\n\nIsraeli forces killed the leadership of Iran’s top regional ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. Rebels in Syria toppled the Iran-backed Assad dictatorship. And Israel launched a brief war on Iran in June that drew in U.S. warplanes.\n\nIran’s prized network of allied militias around the Middle East, which call themselves the “axis of resistance,” unraveled quickly almost everywhere, except in Iraq.\n\nThere, an array of Iran-backed militias are not only still armed, their political wings control several government ministries — and through them, access to lucrative state contracts. Most of these groups have grown so rich from this process, Iraqi and Iranian officials say, they no longer need funding from Tehran.\n\nIn this election, almost every Iran-backed militia is running a parliamentary list.\n\nKataib Hezbollah, the most powerful of these militias and the closest to Iran, paraded horn-honking car convoys through the southern city of Kut to cap its electoral campaign on Saturday, its flags emblazoned with a fist clutching a rifle waving overhead.\n\nPresident Trump’s administration has signaled it may not tolerate the presence of such militias in the country much longer.\n\nLast month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned of an “urgency in disarming Iran-backed militias.” Mr. Trump’s newly appointed envoy to Iraq, Mark Savaya, doubled down on that idea in a message to Iraqis ahead of the voting.\n\n“The United States stands with Iraq as it moves forward: strong, independent, and free from foreign-backed militias,” he wrote on social media.\n\nIraqi politicians expect Mr. Savaya to not only demand a U.S.-friendly premier, but a cabinet free of parties aligned to the Iran-linked militias.\n\n“Just the announcement that Trump appointed a new envoy had every Iraqi official shaking,” said Ali al-Hamdani, a political campaign manager in Baghdad. “They know what comes next.”\n\nIran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Esmail Baghaei, criticized U.S. pressure on Iraq on Monday, condemning foreign interference in the elections “unacceptable.” Iraq’s foreign ministry responded by calling his comments “provocative,” and urged Tehran not to get involved in the country’s internal affairs.\n\nOn the streets of Baghdad, ousting Iraq’s ever more powerful and rich militias is something even Iraqis who describe themselves as anti-American support.\n\n“I don’t like or agree with the Americans on anything, except on this,” said Mahasan Ali, a retired kindergarten teacher in Baghdad.\n\nBut disentangling Iraqi politics from this web of militias will be a huge challenge for the country.\n\nMany militias have come at least nominally under control of the government over the years. But the hard-line groups closest to Iran — which Washington is now pushing to disarm — refuse to submit. They defend their role as part of “the axis of resistance,” fighting what they see as foreign interference in Iraq by America and others.\n\nMr. al-Sudani, who came to power with the help of some of these groups, has promoted himself as the man who can keep the militias in check. His critics say he did it by turbocharging the patronage system.\n\nIraq is one of the world’s top oil producers, and relatively high crude prices have helped fuel a boom in state-funded development projects, which militias have profited from.\n\nFor Tehran, Iraq is not just a critical economic lifeline to the outside world, but a matter of security. The countries share a nearly 1,000-mile border and once fought a devastating eight-year war Iran is determined never to repeat.\n\n“Iraq represents one of the national security pillars for Iran, so Iran will fight to maintain control in Iraq,” said Ihsan al-Shammari, a political scientist at Baghdad University.\n\nHe sees a danger in keeping the militia-linked parties inside the government.\n\nPrime Minister al-Sudani disagrees.\n\n“Any path that can shift these militant factions to politics or economics, and then lay down their weapons — this is a good solution,” he told the Times.\n\nThe militias, however, insist they are not giving up their weapons.\n\nThree nights before the election, Jaafar al-Husseini, the military spokesman of the Iran-linked Kataib Hezbollah militia, gave a fiery and sectarian speech at a campaign rally.\n\n“Iraq is under full Shiite guardianship, whether they like it or not, and our weapons will remain in our hands,” he said.\n\nMohammed al-Tamimi, head of the group al-Waad al-Sadeq, said in an interview that the move to politics was not to surrender its arms, but to protect its interests.\n\n“Every faction needs men in the Parliament and government to safeguard their ambitions and their people’s demands,” he said.\n\nMr. al-Sudani presents himself as the ideal candidate for balancing between Iranian and American interests.\n\nHe recently oversaw deals for Chevron and Exxon to develop oil fields in Iraq. In an apparent gesture to Mr. Trump, he wrote an essay in The New York Post promoting Iraq as an investment partner.\n\nHe told the Times he would bring 50 Iraqi billionaires to Washington next month for an “Invest in America” conference, to show “harmony with President Trump’s course.”\n\nAll of the political jockeying has disillusioned many Iraqis.\n\nSome polls predict the lowest turnout ever in this 20-year-old democracy.\n\n“Why should we vote? It’s just a rotating door of new names representing the same powers,” said Mohammed Abbas, a 20-year-old mattress salesman on a Baghdad highway. “Our elections are completely performative.”\n\nFalih Hassan contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/books/review/unfettered-john-fetterman.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"00:01:04-05:00","title":"John Fetterman’s Memoir Is Unlike Any Politician’s Book You’ve Read","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"John Fetterman’s memoir *Unfettered* breaks from traditional political narratives by presenting a raw, melancholic, and deeply personal account of mental health struggles, political disillusionment, and a populist connection to blue-collar working-class life.

Read\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T00:01:04-05:00\n\nUNFETTERED, by John Fetterman\n\nOn a crowded shelf of memoirs by sitting politicians, John Fetterman’s new book has to be one of the strangest. The cover of “Unfettered” features a headshot of the Democratic senator from Pennsylvania as he frowns into the camera, his dark gray hoodie conspicuously speckled with debris. Inside the book, you’ll find none of the genre’s usual tropes: no can-do optimism, no affability, no evidence of a politician’s instinct to glad-hand for the next election.\n\nBut then it’s not entirely clear from “Unfettered” whether Fetterman, who has spoken openly about his mental health issues, plans to run for office again. Recalling the moment in November 2022 when he won an expensive Senate race against the celebrity surgeon-influencer Mehmet Oz, Fetterman, who had been hospitalized for a stroke a few months before, says he “felt nothing.” The next day he was in a “daze of doom.” Staring at a bridge, he contemplated suicide.\n\nFetterman has been a U.S. senator now for nearly three years, but he doesn’t appear to like his job all that much. A number of articles have noted his dismal attendance record. In his memoir, Fetterman, who on Sunday was one of seven Democrats (along with Angus King, an independent) to break with the party to vote to end the government shutdown, mostly speaks of the Senate with disdain. “There is no sanctity left in the present U.S. Congress,” he writes, before adding that virtually the only issue enjoying bipartisan support was the push to enforce a dress code on the Senate floor that was “aimed at me.” (Fetterman, determined to wear his hoodie and shorts to work, says he stood in the doorway to give a thumbs up or down on a given vote before returning to his office.)\n\nBesides, Fetterman’s career shows that there are political advantages to bucking convention. Bland, smiling figures who smoothly recite polished talking points are relics from a less furious era. Fetterman has two master’s degrees, including one from Harvard, and worked briefly in the insurance business. But as the mayor of Braddock, Pa., from 2006 to 2019, he developed a reputation as a populist folk hero, restoring some distressed infrastructure for community use and directing a local youth program. In his book, he laments the hollowing out of Rust Belt towns like Braddock. “Western Pennsylvania, once the epicenter of the greatest industrial outpouring the world had ever seen, was left to decay in our version of Pompeii, buried by greed and the arrogance of post-World War II thinking that no other country would ever catch up to us,” he writes.\n\nMost of “Unfettered” is unrelentingly dour and mournful. Despite having parents who “provided me with every comfort,” Fetterman identifies strongly with blue-collar workers who feel betrayed and forgotten. He recounts the many times he felt overwhelmed by shame and self-loathing: “I didn’t deserve anything except loneliness and sadness and isolation.” In 2023, he spent six weeks at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center being treated for his severe depression.\n\nHis memoir, which is dedicated to “anyone with depression,” includes extended quotations from staffers and family members who implored him to obtain medical treatment and stick with it. Their worry for him is heartbreaking. His wife, Gisele, takes care to ensure that their three children won’t blame themselves for their father’s state. The children cover Fetterman’s hospital room with colorful Post-it notes, reminding him how much he is loved.\n\nWhen it comes to his mental health, Fetterman is willing to concede that he was wrong. He tried resisting treatment at first, out of despondency and denial. He felt something shift when a therapist reminded him how much his children needed him. “The doctors had saved my life,” he writes.\n\n“Unfettered” includes surprisingly little about his political positions. The pages that do have him defending himself from progressives who have been startled by his eagerness to work with President Trump, whom he visited at Mar-a-Lago before the inauguration.\n\nFetterman, who says he wants “compassionate” immigration policy,  was one of 12 Democratic senators who sided with Republicans in undermining due process for immigrants, and he was the only Democratic senator who voted to confirm Trump’s pick for attorney general. “It is not anti-immigrant to support a secure border,” he writes, though he does not say how he feels about what Trump’s version of a secure border has meant in practice — masked men pushing people into vans and immigrants being whisked away to countries they have no connection to. Fetterman’s wife, who was brought as a child to the United States from Brazil, was an undocumented immigrant. He doesn’t say anything in the book about that either.\n\nHe is similarly pat regarding his views on Israel, and his unconditional support for its  war in Gaza. According to a letter by his former chief of staff that became a national story this spring, the senator “claims to be the most knowledgeable source on Israel and Gaza around but his sources are just what he reads in the news — he declines most briefings and never reads memos.” In his memoir, he issues a pro forma line about grieving “the tragedy, the death and the misery,” but treats his position as a no-brainer. “There was no choice,” he writes.\n\nThe voice in this book is brooding but not particularly thoughtful. Fetterman offers generalized contempt instead of pointed arguments. He thinks one of the Democrats’ main problems is that they are perceived as “soft and gooey” because of their “policies against men.” While it’s true that Democrats have lost support among male voters, Fetterman never specifies which “policies” these are, but he insists they were decisive: “If men are forced to choose between picking their party or keeping their balls, most men are going to choose their balls.”\n\nA preoccupation with tough-guy masculinity seems to be an underlying theme. A flashback to 2001 has Fetterman fondly recalling how he made his home in the basement of an abandoned church in Braddock: “The place has a ‘Fight Club’ feel to it that I like, big and dingy and sparse and conducive to men beating the hell out of one another without anyone else hearing it.” In 2013, Fetterman thought he heard gunshots outside of his home and then chased a nearby jogger, using a 20-gauge shotgun to detain him until the police arrived. The jogger was Black and unarmed. Fetterman maintains that his political opponents were being grossly unfair when they criticized him: “If I had stayed indoors, they would have called me a coward.”\n\nAnyone who has experienced depression will probably recognize the overgeneralization, the binary thinking, the closed loop of self-pity. At barely more than 200 pages, “Unfettered” is not especially long, but it starts to feel interminable. “I have been told I have a persecution complex,” Fetterman writes, “but that’s the way I am.”\n\nUNFETTERED | By John Fetterman | Crown | 213 pp. | $32\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/books/booker-prize-2025-david-szalay-flesh.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"19:31:01-05:00","title":"David Szalay’s ‘Flesh’ Wins 2025 Booker Prize","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"David Szalay’s novel 'Flesh' has won the 2025 Booker Prize, making him the first British Hungarian to receive the award.

2016 Booker Prize, the author described the award ceremony as “a horrible experience.”\n\nHe sat through a “very stressful” dinner, wondering whether his book would triumph, only for it to lose to Paul Beatty’s “The Sellout.” He later told The Guardian newspaper, “Only trauma imprints memories that clearly.”\n\nOn Monday night in London, Szalay sat through another Booker Prize dinner. But this time his latest novel, “Flesh,” won the prestigious literary award.\n\nThe author Roddy Doyle, who chaired this year’s judging panel, called it a “singular” and “extraordinary” novel.\n\n“It’s just not like any other book,” Doyle told a news conference before Monday’s announcement about the novel, in which Istvan, a lonely Hungarian teenager, makes an unexpected rise to the height of British society. The sparseness of Szalay’s writing compels readers to “climb into the novel and be involved,” Doyle added.\n\nAccepting the award, Szalay said that “Flesh” wasn’t easy to write, “and I didn’t always cope that well with the pressure. I didn’t cope that wisely or graciously.”\n\nSzalay then thanked his wife for supporting him. “I’m sure she is bewildered as I am by the fact that those rather bleak times and this glittering evening are somehow part of the same process and same experience.”\n\n“Flesh” beat the five other shortlisted titles, including Susan Choi’s “Flashlight,” Kiran Desai’s “The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny,” Katie Kitamura’s “Audition,” Ben Markovits’s “The Rest of Our Lives” and Andrew Miller’s “The Land in Winter.”\n\nOne of literature’s pre-eminent awards, the Booker Prize is given each year to the book deemed to be best novel written in English and published in Britain or Ireland. Last year, Samantha Harvey triumphed with “Orbital,” a novel set aboard the International Space Station. In recent years, the Booker has acquired a global following, and winning titles often become hits on both sides of the Atlantic. As well as a boost in sales, the winning author receives a cash prize of 50,000 pounds, about $65,800.\n\n“Flesh” has attracted a host of high-profile admirers since its publication in March, including the pop star Dua Lipa, who chose the novel for her book club, and the novelist Zadie Smith, who told a BBC radio show that “Flesh” was “astonishing.” Some novelists give their characters incredibly complicated inner lives, Smith said, but Szalay had the confidence to create a lead who doesn’t reflect much on the events that befall him, and who felt realistic because of that.\n\n“Sometimes when I’m reading, one of the things I’m looking for is, ‘How has this person made the novel new?’” Smith said: “For me, this novel was new.”\n\nReviewers also praised the book, even when they had quibbles. Dwight Garner, writing in The New York Times, said that he admired “Flesh” “from front to back without ever quite liking it, without ever quite giving into it.” But Luke Brown, in The Financial Times, called the book “refreshing, illuminating and true” for its portrait of a man who has stints as a soldier, security guard and property developer.\n\nSzalay, 51, whose name is pronounced SOL-loy, is the author of five previous books. Those include his 2008 debut, “London and the South-East,” about a sales executive who ends up stocking shelves in a grocery store; “Turbulence,” a series of interconnected stories in which all of the characters take flights; and “All That Man Is,” about men in various states of duress.\n\nSzalay is the first British Hungarian to win the prize, although another writer of Hungarian descent, Laszlo Krasznahorkai, received the International Booker Prize in 2015. Last month, Krasznahorkai was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nAt a news conference after Monday’s ceremony, Szalay said, “When Laszlo won the Nobel, I did kind of think, ‘Oh, God, has he taken the quota of Hungarian winning writers this year?’”\n\n“I’m a British writer, ultimately,” Szalay added, “but it’s quite a year for people with Hungarian names writing books.”\n\nOne aspect of “Flesh” that reviewers commended is its sparse and at times funny dialogue, particularly Istvan’s frequent use of the word “Okay” to respond to questions.\n\nAt Monday’s news conference, Doyle said the judges considered such dialogue to be part of the book’s appeal. Istvan was an old-school male, brought up not to cry and to be “a man of few words,” Doyle added — comparing him to characters in westerns. And it “didn’t do Clint Eastwood’s career any harm,” Doyle said.\n\n“If you were dealing with a real-life person trying to have a decent conversation with them, it would frustrate you somewhat,” Doyle said. “But when it’s presented on the page, to be honest, I found it riveting.”\n\nSzalay said at the news conference that, unlike in 2016, he had spent the night feeling “eerily calm,” having persuaded himself beforehand that he wouldn’t take home the prize.\n\nAs a result, he was a little shocked to have won this year. But the event, he said, “was altogether a much more pleasant experience.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/style/zohran-mamdani-podcasts-manosphere.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:26:25-05:00","title":"A Political Litmus Test: Can You Hang With the Boys?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zohran Mamdani, a candidate for New York City mayor, gained significant traction among young male voters through his appearance on the anti-woke podcast 'Flagrant,' hosted by comedian Andrew Schulz.

Conservative groups and state lawmakers said they were disappointed that the court was not taking up the issue now, but would continue to press legal challenges.\n\nBefore the denial, legal experts had speculated that the court was unlikely to reconsider the issue at this juncture. But the stakes were so high for families and same-sex couples, advocates of same-sex marriage said, that many people were on tenterhooks waiting for a decision.\n\nThe petition had come from Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the landmark decision in 2015, Obergefell v. Hodges. If the Supreme Court were to overturn Obergefell, many state laws that prohibit same-sex couples from marrying would snap back into effect. Congress enacted a federal statute in 2022 mandating that marriages performed by states be given recognition by the federal government, but that statute does not guarantee a right to marry.\n\n“Do I think it’s a pure victory and we have nothing to worry about?” Jim Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the original case, said on Monday. “No, but I am taking the win today. Everyone across the country who believes that we deserve the right to marry the person we love, whoever we call home, we’re all breathing a bit easier.”\n\nThe number of married same-sex couples in the United States doubled in the last decade to 774,000, according to government data.\n\nThe possibility of a reversal on Obergefell led some same-sex couples to speed up their marriage plans, advocates said, and added fuel to state campaigns to repeal old statutes and constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriage. In Virginia, L.G.B.T.Q. advocates are hoping legislators will approve a state constitutional amendment in 2026 enshrining a right to marry, regardless of race, sex and gender.\n\n“Today’s news is a relief, but we must always remain vigilant,” said Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, a group that supports same-sex marriage.\n\nA Gallup survey from May of this year found that support by Republicans for same-sex marriage had dropped to 41 percent from 55 percent in 2021. The Southern Baptist Convention, which is often seen as a strong indicator of conservative evangelical opinion, voted overwhelmingly earlier this year to call on the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell.\n\nAnd in half a dozen state legislatures across the country this year, Republican lawmakers have introduced resolutions urging the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell.\n\nThe sponsor of one such measure, Representative Heather Scott, Republican of Idaho, said on Monday that she was undeterred by the Supreme Court’s refusal to take up the issue this year.\n\n“I’ll try to rerun it next year,” Ms. Scott said. “We need to continue to put pressure for them to override. Our constitution is very clear: we will only recognize marriage between a man and a woman. So this Supreme Court ruling is overriding our state constitution.”\n\nLegal advocates of same-sex marriage said that the prospect of the court revisiting the issue served as a reminder that a right to same-sex marriage could not be taken for granted, even at a time when the first generation of married same-sex couples are, in some cases, starting to raise grandchildren.\n\nThere is no other clear case in the pipeline, legal experts said, for a direct challenge to Obergefell.\n\n“It’s important to continue to make people aware of how important those family protections are for so many people,” said Jennifer Levi, a lawyer who worked on some of the nation’s first cases, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, on the right to same-sex marriage. “We have certainly seen the court shift its position in other contexts.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/health/fda-hormone-replacement-menopause.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"12:13:55-05:00","title":"FDA Will Remove Black Box Warnings From Hormone Treatments for Menopause","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is set to remove black box warnings from all hormone replacement products containing estrogen, a reversal of policy from 2003.

Will Remove Black Box Warnings From Hormone Treatments for Menopause\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T12:13:55-05:00\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration will remove the so-called black box warning from all hormone replacement products containing estrogen, Dr. Marty Makary, the agency’s commissioner, announced on Monday.\n\nThe labels will be rewritten with age-specific guidance indicating that there are long-term health benefits if treatment is begun within 10 years of the onset of menopause.\n\nThe changes, expected within six months, represent a radical turnabout in what women have been told about hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn 2003, large government-run clinical trials concluded that hormone pills did not protect against heart disease or dementia, and in fact raised the risk of blood clots and breast cancer. Medical guidelines since then have told women to use hormones only sparingly for menopausal symptoms like hot flashes.\n\nDr. Makary, long a champion of the treatment, asserted on Monday that in fact hormones can reduce cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline, and can improve bone health in postmenopausal women.\n\n“The long-term health benefits have been largely misunderstood,” Dr. Makary said. “Hormone replacement therapy may improve the health outcomes of women at a population level more than any other intervention, arguably, with the exception of antibiotics or vaccines.”\n\nAsked whether hormone use was safe for all women, he added that any patient with a predisposition to blood clots or a history of breast cancer fueled by hormones should avoid it. He acknowledged that there may be other contraindications.\n\nCritics opposed to removing the warning, the strongest kind the F.D.A. issues, had urged Dr. Makary to convene a scientific advisory panel to carry out a careful assessment of the evidence before making any changes to the label.\n\n“Removing the black box and putting warnings in a lengthy label that many doctors and most patients will not read is taking women’s health backward,” Diana Zuckerman, a scientist and president of the National Center for Health Research, said on Monday.\n\n“The claim that hormones for menopause is the best way to improve the health of women is inconsistent with years of research and will harm millions of women,” Dr. Zuckerman said. “There are many better ways to reduce the chances of osteoporosis, heart disease, cancer and dementia than hormone therapy for menopause.”\n\nHormone use has plummeted in recent decades. Even though estrogen is considered the most effective treatment for alleviating menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and sleep loss, some doctors say that many women who could benefit avoid the treatment.\n\nHormone therapy has been used to relieve menopausal symptoms since the 1940s. By the 1980s, hormones were increasingly being prescribed to prevent cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, as well, even in women well past menopause, despite concerns that the treatment might raise the risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe popularity of hormones was driven largely by observational studies indicating that hormones protected women from heart disease.\n\nBut large randomized trials subsequently tested this hypothesis, and concluded that there were no benefits to hormone replacement therapy in terms of heart attacks — and that it actually increased the risk of blood clots and strokes.\n\nThe trials also concluded that combined hormones — progestin and estrogen — in pill form increased the risk of breast cancer. But the danger to individual women was small, especially in early menopause, and there was no increase in breast cancer with estrogen alone, which lowered heart attack risk among women in their 50s.\n\nHormones also offered some benefits, reducing osteoporosis-related bone fractures and colorectal cancer.\n\nCritics have questioned the conclusions and the methodology of the government-sponsored trials. Some of the risks were of borderline significance, they said, and women who wanted to reap long-term benefits from hormone treatment should initiate it soon after the onset of menopause.\n\nMany doctors who treat menopausal women had pushed for removing the black box warning from local vaginal estrogen products, noting that these are low-dose products applied topically, not oral formulations. These physicians argued that studies have shown minimal to no systemic absorption of hormones from such products.\n\nBut the risks and benefits of long-term use of vaginal estrogens are still unclear, because the studies have been of limited duration, some experts say.\n\nThe black box label currently on estrogen products says that oral estrogen, with or without progestin, should not be taken to prevent heart disease and increases the risk of probable dementia in women 65 and older, as well as blood clots and strokes.\n\nThe label warning says that combined estrogen and progestin pills — a formulation used to offset the risk of uterine cancer — increases the risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe label notes, however, that these risks were found in trials of specific hormone formulations, and that the risks may not carry over to products with different formulations or to topically applied or low-dose products.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/dulles-airport-crash-mobile-lounge.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"19:22:35-05:00","title":"Mobile Lounge Crashes at Dulles Airport, Causing Injuries and Damage","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 10, 2025, a mobile lounge at Washington Dulles International Airport crashed into a dock at 4:30 p.m., injuring 18 people with non-life-threatening injuries.

These beautiful, haunting places were dedicated by still-grieving Americans in the years that followed the war, remembering its awful costs and praying for a lasting peace.\n\nThere are fewer and fewer people still alive who lived through World War II. Margraten and the other cemeteries serve as reminders of the sacrifices that Americans made to free Europe. And, at a time when many Americans want to retreat from our responsibilities to the rest of the world, they offer us a warning.\n\nThe American service members buried in the soil of Europe grew up in a country where many respectable politicians claimed America had no business preserving peace on the European continent or promoting freedom in the world. There was no NATO, no United Nations, no American-led global order.\n\nWhen you stoop down on European soil to read an American soldier’s name on a grave, you see how policies sold as “America First” can lead to unthinkable suffering and loss.\n\nTravel through Europe today and you’ll see the war-forged American-European partnership embedded everywhere — in gleaming embassies and in hulking military bases, in ubiquitous English-language ads and in the YouTube clips streaming on teenagers’ phones. But nowhere does the tie between the people on both sides of the Atlantic feel more intimate as in the World War II cemeteries.\n\nApproximately 8,300 graves are at Margraten, one of a handful of out-of-the-way cemeteries for America’s war dead near the German borders of France, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. Many of the service members buried in these places died in the western Allies’ assault on Germany and its forces in late 1944 and early 1945.\n\nOn the late summer day that I visited, the cemetery was bustling with visitors — grandparents holding the hands of little children, vacationers in bike shorts, 20-somethings with tattoos. From their hushed, respectful voices, I gathered that most of these people were Dutch.\n\nMargraten lies in the southern part of the Limburg region of the Netherlands, where American troops were billeted in the final months of the European war and where the role of the United States in liberating the country from Nazi occupation is fondly recalled. The Dutch people have long taken pride in the grave adoption here. In a tradition that stretches back to the first Memorial Day after the war, every service member honored in the cemetery has a Dutch adopter who brings flowers and visits his or her place of memorial. Some even correspond with the deceased’s family in the United States.\n\nThis has always been an essential task of the World War II cemeteries — shrinking the distance across an ocean through the memory of shared sacrifice.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of hostilities in 1945, the U.S. government announced that, as it had after World War I, it would create permanent overseas cemeteries for the dead. The families of service members whose remains had been recovered overseas had a choice: Their loved ones could be repatriated to the United States or buried beside other Americans in their theater of battle.\n\nIn each of the World War II cemeteries, rippling rows of identical white marble crosses and Stars of David mark the final resting place of Americans killed. Each bears an inscription that includes the person’s name, rank, unit, home state and date of death. Some say simply: “Here rests in honored glory a comrade in arms known but to God.”\n\nWalking through these rows of graves, you feel the sorrow the war visited on every corner of American society. A service member from Oregon lies next to one from Pennsylvania who lies next to one from Arkansas. Dumas is next to Ulander, next to Giudice, next to Smith.\n\nBut in their beauty, ambition and scale, the cemeteries have also always sent a message to Europeans, a reminder of the costs Americans were willing to pay to ensure the cause of liberty in the world. These cemeteries would be permanent and so too, they seemed to suggest, would be America’s interest in Europe’s affairs.\n\nIt is a message that many Europeans took to heart. At the visitors’ center at the Margraten, I was told that the large crowd in the cemetery that day was typical. The vast majority of visitors are Europeans. When I flipped through the guest book, I saw most of the entries were people from the Netherlands, Belgium and other Northern European countries. Many had written the same message: “Thanks, U.S.A.”\n\nReading these words, I felt a pang of regret: If only more Americans could see this place.\n\nIt is now more than ever, after all, that America needs the message of its World War II cemeteries. On a Veterans Day when optimism about the American experiment can be hard to summon, they transport us back to a moment when America was an essential force for good.\n\nIn today’s Europe, the need for such a partner remains. At Margraten that August morning, I spoke with a Dutch woman who’d come to visit the cemetery with her young son. He was learning at school about “the problems in the world,” she explained. He’s a little bit nervous, she said, about what would happen “if the Russians come.” She gestured at the rows of graves all around her: “So it’s very important to see everything.”\n\nNot far from where we were standing was Margraten’s “Statue of the Mourning Woman,” a large bronze cast sculpture by the American artist Joseph Kiselewski. It depicts an outsize female figure, a trio of doves at her side, gazing down on an obliterated tree. All she sees is what too many of us have forgotten: the lonely, terrible sorrow that comes in the wake of war.\n\nJonathan Darman, a journalist and historian, is the author of “Becoming FDR: The Personal Crisis that Made a President” and “Landslide: LBJ and Ronald Reagan at the Dawn of a New America.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Alex Karp Finds a Safe Space With Trump\n\nPublished: 2025-11-10T19:53:36-05:00\n\nOf all the tech chieftains who’ve learned to love Donald Trump’s authoritarianism, Palantir’s Alex Karp seems the most befuddling.\n\n“My biggest fear is fascism,” he told Michael Steinberger, author of a new biography of Karp, in 2019. The fragility of liberal democracy was, in Steinberger’s telling, one of Karp’s preoccupations. He moved to Germany for graduate school, hoping to understand, as Steinberger puts it, how “a pillar of European civilization” had “descended into barbarism.” He wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the rhetoric of fascism, focusing particularly on a 1998 speech by the German novelist Martin Walser complaining that Holocaust remembrance had become a “moral bludgeon” against his country.\n\nKarp was a progressive in 2004 when he became the chief executive of Palantir, the data surveillance company co-founded by his former law school classmate Peter Thiel. The Wall Street Journal referred to him as a “self-described socialist” in 2018. The next year, he boasted to Steinberger, a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine, that by helping to thwart terrorist attacks in Europe — and the attendant nativist backlashes — Palantir was a bulwark against the far right. In 2024, he supported Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris.\n\nYet now, Karp has become an enthusiastic enabler of Donald Trump. His company works with ICE to target people for Trump’s mass deportation campaign. It’s helping the administration compile enormous amounts of data on Americans, which could, as The New York Times reported, give the president “untold surveillance power.” Karp donated $1 million for Trump’s inauguration, and Palantir is helping to pay for his new ballroom.\n\nIn “The Philosopher In the Valley: Alex Karp, Palantir, and the Rise of the Surveillance State,” Steinberger points out that even Karp’s views on Walser appear to have changed. In Karp’s dissertation, he was a fascist figure. But this year, Karp and his colleague Nicholas Zamiska published a book called “The Technological Republic” that depicts Walser as a free speech hero who voiced “the forbidden desires and feelings of a nation.”\n\nI read Steinberger’s book because I wanted to understand Karp’s political evolution. But while the book is fascinating and prodigiously researched — including dozens of interviews Steinberger did with Karp — it didn’t quite answer my question. Among the tech bros who’ve clustered around Trump, some, like Elon Musk, seem to have let their own algorithms cook their brains. Others, like Mark Zuckerberg, are just phenomenally craven. But Karp, Steinberger told me, needed “to find a reason beyond just opportunism and necessity” to embrace Trumpism. His reasoning, however, is so incoherent it seems pretextual.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He was building them for Ukrainian forces in his parents’ garage with a friend.\n\nThe military was not interested.\n\n“‘You can’t just waltz into the Pentagon as 21-year-olds and sell weapon systems to the D.O.D.,’” said the friend, Olaf Hichwa, recalling the response from a senior Department of Defense official.\n\nBut two years later, Mr. Monroe-Anderson, now 22, and Mr. Hichwa, who just turned 24, are selling drones to the U.S. Army.\n\nNeros, the company they founded in 2023, has been selected to supply its signature drones, called Archer, to the Army, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. Neros is one of three American drone manufacturers picked as vendors for the first phase of an Army program that is buying low-cost, expendable drones.\n\nAlthough specific financial terms have not been disclosed, the Trump administration has budgeted more than $36 million for the “Purpose-Built Attritable Systems” program in 2026.\n\nNeros’s selection comes as military leaders are scrambling to catch up with adversaries who have the ability to mass-produce small drones, which have become crucial to modern warfare. The Army aims to buy at least one million drones in the next two to three years, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll told Reuters on Friday.\n\nAlthough the government shutdown has complicated the military’s efforts to buy drones, some contracts already in the pipeline are moving forward.\n\nThe Army contract has been closely watched as a bellwether of which American drone companies will dominate the market. For Neros, it comes on the heels of raising $75 million in venture funding, led by Sequoia Capital, and receiving a $17 million Marine Corps contract for thousands of drones, as well as an international drone coalition contract to supply 6,000 drones to Ukraine.\n\nNeros’s latest round of funding closed last week, bringing the total raised by the start-up to $121 million and cementing Mr. Monroe-Anderson’s and Mr. Hichwa’s status as wunderkinds of the emerging U.S. drone industry.\n\nThe Defense Innovation Unit, an experimental part of the Pentagon with headquarters in Silicon Valley, has been championing Neros for more than a year, with some drone specialists at the unit affectionately referring to Mr. Monroe-Anderson and Mr. Hichwa as “the boys.”\n\nAt a flyoff in Alaska this summer, military officials crowded around Mr. Monroe-Anderson as he piloted his drone unmolested toward a device that tried unsuccessfully to jam it. A Neros Archer was one of several drones buzzing around Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in July when he made a video announcement of policy changes aimed at turbocharging domestic production.\n\nIn an interview in May, Maj. Steven Atkinson of the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab recounted searching for American companies willing to supply small drones like the ones being used in Ukraine for less than $2,000 per unit. He came up empty — until he found Neros.\n\n“They were pretty young, but they did F.P.V.s,” Major Atkinson recalled, referring to first-person view drones, which are flown by pilots wearing special goggles to see video feeds from the drone’s camera, while using a joystick controller to navigate around obstacles.\n\n“What they have been able to accomplish is unheard-of,” he said.\n\nMr. Monroe-Anderson and Mr. Hichwa gained their expertise from the world of competitive drone racing. Mr. Monroe-Anderson, who attended high school in New Hampshire, and Mr. Hichwa, who grew up in Maryland, spent their teen years building drones from kits and components they ordered from China. They were so focused on flying and racing that they skipped much of school and their senior proms. Neither has a college degree.\n\nThe two met in 2017 at a drone racing competition in Muncie, Ind., and quickly began trading ideas about how to make their drones fly faster.\n\nMr. Monroe-Anderson was the better racer, winning the MultiGP World Championship in 2020. Mr. Hichwa was known for his engineering prowess. “He’s a mad genius,” said David Spencer, a fellow racer.\n\nIn an attempt to best Mr. Monroe-Anderson’s drone, Mr. Hichwa designed a circuit board for his own drone that was lighter than the ones on the market, soldering it himself. He eventually bought an industrial machine from China that mass-produced them, selling them to other drone racers for $30 apiece during his junior year. An upgraded version is used in Neros’s Archer.\n\nDespite their racing pedigree, challenges remain. Drone racers tend to build systems that are fast and nimble, and require a certain level of mastery. Neros typically trains soldiers on Archer drones for five days. By contrast, DJI, the Chinese company that produces more than 75 percent of the world’s commercial drones, is known for drones that can be flown without any special training.\n\nAnd the skill it takes to make one racing drone is different from the expertise required to manufacture tens of thousands. At Neros’s factory in El Segundo, Calif., about 20 technicians assemble roughly 2,000 drones per month by hand.\n\nIt has been especially challenging to make cheap drones without Chinese parts. Virtually everything they used as teenagers — propellers, motors, batteries, radios, cameras — came from Shenzhen, China. But to sell to the U.S. military, Neros had to build a U.S. supply chain and prove that its drones do not contain critical components from China.\n\nVendors in the United States “would laugh at us,” Mr. Hichwa said. American-made radios could cost as much as $10,000 when he was shopping around for one that cost $30. The founders quickly realized that they would have to build parts themselves and seek suppliers outside the defense industry.\n\nInstead of using computer chips common in military equipment that cost hundreds of dollars apiece, Neros used one designed for parking meters, which cost $1 each, Mr. Hichwa said.\n\nTheir inspiration to build a drone company grew out of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which turned their high school hobby into a world-changing technology. Ukrainians were beating back Russian forces with simple quadcopters jury-rigged with explosives. In the summer of 2023, Mr. Hichwa was working at Skywalk, an artificial intelligence start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., when Mr. Monroe-Anderson showed up at his job, begging him to make drones again. Mr. Monroe-Anderson, who opted to forgo college for the time being, had become fixated with helping Ukraine.\n\nMr. Hichwa took it on as a side project, and quickly got sucked in. They conferred on the phone with Ukrainians whom Mr. Monroe-Anderson had met on social media and made dozens of drones that snapped together in stacks that were easy to transport. That fall, they went to Kyiv and distributed their drones to Ukrainian soldiers, collecting feedback about how they flew. They met Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who is also the country’s minister of digital transformation, who told them that anyone who wanted to supply drones to Ukraine had to be able to produce at least 5,000 per month.\n\nThe trip underscored what they already knew: America itself is vulnerable. Russia and China produced millions of drones a year, while the United States barely made 100,000.\n\nThey set up shop in El Segundo, a hotbed for the aerospace industry, where their passion attracted the attention of venture capitalists and Peter Thiel, who eventually gave Mr. Monroe-Anderson a Thiel fellowship.\n\n“When we meet founders like that, we bet on their trajectory,” said Ian Rountree of Cantos, a venture capital firm that led their angel round. He was impressed that Mr. Monroe-Anderson had managed to attract employees who were far more senior, including Sean Wood, the company’s chief operating officer, who had worked at SpaceX for 12 years. Neros employs 80 people, virtually all of them older than its founders.\n\nBut mass production remains a challenge. Last year, Mr. Hichwa traveled to Shenzen to meet the Chinese suppliers who had sent him drone parts when he was a teenage racer. They showed him around their factories as a valued customer, never suspecting that he planned to open a plant of his own. One factory that made the brand of hobbyist drones he flew in high school was now churning out 1,000 drones per day for the Russian military, he said.\n\n“They are, to a certain degree, my friends,” Mr. Hichwa said. “But we found ourselves on opposite sides of an armed conflict.”\n\nHe said he had tried to remember as much as he could about the machinery they used, awed by what it would take for Neros to catch up.\n\n“We’re barely scraping 2,000 a month,” he said. “And they’re doing that in two days.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/camp-mystic-lawsuit.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Suits Accuse Camp Mystic of Gross Negligence in Children’s Deaths","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A lawsuit filed by the families of 27 victims—2 counselors and 25 campers—accuses Camp Mystic, an all-girls retreat in Central Texas, and the Eastland family of gross negligence during a flash flood on July 4, 2025.

Mystic in the first dark hours of July 4, top leaders at the all-girls retreat in Central Texas spent more than an hour securing the camp’s equipment instead of evacuating or even checking on campers, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday by the families of five campers and two counselors who died that night.\n\nThe suit, filed in a state court in Austin, Texas, names Camp Mystic and individual members of the Eastland family, who have owned and operated the Hill Country camp for generations, among the defendants. It portrays the family as overconfident and woefully underprepared for serious flooding, despite decades of experience and ample warnings.\n\nThe suit claims that Dick Eastland, the camp’s executive director, and his son Edward, a director, squandered a crucial window of time following the National Weather Service’s warning about “life threatening flash flooding” at 1:14 a.m. The leadership dismissed camp counselors’ early pleas for help, and then “made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster” only when it was too late, the lawsuit says.\n\nTwo counselors and 25 young campers died at Camp Mystic that night, most of them from two cabins that housed the youngest girls. Dick Eastland, 70, also died. Other camps along the Guadalupe River had to evacuate and rescue campers from the flooding, but Camp Mystic was the only sleepaway camp where campers died.\n\n“These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,” the suit says.\n\nAnother lawsuit filed in the same court on Monday by the parents of Eloise Peck, 8, presents a similar description of inadequate emergency planning.\n\nEastland family members have said little publicly about their actions during the flood, and their lawyer, Mikal Watts, did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nBut Mr. Watts, who represents the family and the camp, discussed the events in late October in an appearance on CNN. He called the evacuation of the camp “orderly” and mostly successful.\n\nMr. Watts’s account broadly matched the timeline that is laid out in the lawsuit. He said Dick Eastland and the camp’s night security guard, Glenn Juenke, met in the camp’s office “within minutes” after the Weather Service issued its alert, and were later joined by Edward Eastland. They convened the camp’s grounds crew to secure equipment, and then “started coming up with a plan” around 2 a.m., Mr. Watts said.\n\nCamp Mystic announced in September that it will reopen next summer for its 100th year of operation, using a nearby second campus that the camp opened in 2020. The older part of the camp complex, where the flooding and deaths occurred, will not be open to campers in 2026.\n\nMany of the families of campers who died in the flooding objected to the reopening. They pointed out that the body of one camper, Cile Steward, was still unaccounted for, and they complained that they were given only a few hours’ notice before the announcement.\n\nTexas passed a package of summer camp safety laws in September, a move championed by many of the parents of girls who died at Camp Mystic, who have banded together under the name “Heaven’s 27.” The Texas Legislature announced in October that it would conduct a formal investigation into the July flooding in the Hill Country, which killed more than 130 people along the Guadalupe River, including those at Camp Mystic.\n\n“I was shocked to see Camp Mystic begin signing up campers for next year with so many questions unanswered about what happened that fateful morning,” Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a statement announcing the investigation.\n\nThe multifamily suit filed on Monday describes the camp leadership as eager to cut corners and preserve the illusion of safety, while building “true generational wealth” from the camp’s low overhead costs and millions of dollars in annual revenue.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency determined in 2011 that much of Camp Mystic lay within a 100-year flood zone, meaning there was a 1 percent chance in any given year that it would be flooded. The Eastlands successfully challenged the agency’s maps, which would have designated the area of the camp as high-risk and required the owners to carry extra insurance.\n\nThe camp’s instructions to counselors in the event of a flood were minimal, and reassured them that “all cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.” Instead of being trained in evacuation procedures, the lawsuit says, “counselors flipped through their manuals with Edward and Mary Liz Eastland and were told a flood was not going to happen.”\n\nThe suit condemns the camp’s actions after the flooding, beginning with the initial notices to the parents in the late morning of July 4 that their daughters were “unaccounted for,” sent at a time when some girls’ bodies had already been found.\n\nThe suit seeks to establish that Camp Mystic was in a region known as “Flash Flood Alley,” where serious floods were a regular and predictable occurrence. Flooding killed people in the area and prompted summer-camp evacuations numerous times during the decades that Dick Eastland and his wife, Tweety, lived at the camp. In 1985, Mrs. Eastland had to be airlifted to a hospital to give birth because a flood had cut off road access.\n\nIn the early hours of July 4, Richard and Edward Eastland met in the camp’s main office about 30 minutes after the National Weather Service’s 1:14 a.m. warning of life-threatening flooding, and set the grounds crew to work securing equipment. At about 2:20 a.m., several counselors ran to the two men to ask for help, reporting that water was pouring into Bug House, the cabin closest to the river. The men went to the cabin and told the girls there to lay towels down and to stay put in the cabin.\n\nAround 2:30 a.m., the lawsuit says, campers and counselors from some cabins began evacuating to a large two-story recreation hall a short distance away, and Richard and Edward Eastland took some girls there in their vehicles. But over the course of an hour, they were able to evacuate only five of 11 cabins in the flood zone, according to the suit. Some counselors decided on their own to evacuate their campers, with the leaders of several cabins pulling girls through windows to escape and run up a nearby hill. They could hear screams for help from other cabins, the lawsuit says.\n\nTweety Eastland and Edward’s wife, Mary Liz Eastland, who are also leaders of the camp and are named as defendants in the lawsuit, were “nowhere to be found” throughout the flooding, the suit says. None of the defendants assisted or gave instructions to the many girls and counselors who made their way to the second floor of the recreation hall until later in the morning, it says.\n\nIt was around 3:51 a.m., Mr. Watts said, when Dick Eastland was swept away in his S.U.V., which an unnamed counselor cited in the suit said was full of campers from Bubble Inn, another flooded cabin. No one in the vehicle survived.\n\nThe camp’s supporters have characterized Mr. Eastland as a hero who died trying to save children during what the camp has called a “1,000-year weather event.” The lawsuit calls him “grossly negligent” for loading children into a vehicle in waist-deep, and then neck-deep, water and then attempting to drive. Driving through floodwaters violated the advice of experts including the Upper Guadalupe River Authority, a state agency on whose board Mr. Eastland was serving at the time of his death.\n\nAround the same time that Dick Eastland went to Bubble Inn, Edward Eastland went to Twins, a pair of adjoining cabin buildings where girls had been told to stay put, even though they could see that other cabins nearby were being evacuated to the recreation hall, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe girls in Twins climbed to top bunks to try to stay above the water. Some swam out of the cabin to try to reach safety; others were swept out by the water. Edward Eastland was swept through a door to a tree along with several girls, where they held on until the morning. The girls clinging to the tree “watched in horror as their friends floated by, begging for help,” the suit says. Eleven girls from Twins were killed.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/arts/television/late-night-democrats-government-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"02:39:15-05:00","title":"Late Night Is Disappointed in Democrats Over Shutdown Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 40-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, ended after eight Democratic members defected to support a Republican deal.

2025-11-11T00:01:10-05:00\n\nThe phone call came around 5 a.m. to Zhu Rikun, the organizer of a new Chinese independent film festival in New York City. It was his father in China, his voice sounding strange. He asked if Mr. Zhu was up to anything bad, Mr. Zhu recalled, and urged him not to do anything that would hurt China.\n\nIn the following days, Mr. Zhu received more vague messages. They were from the directors whose films he was preparing to screen at the festival, people scheduled to moderate discussions and one volunteer. All told him they wanted to withdraw.\n\nMost declined to give Mr. Zhu an explanation or cited personal reasons. But a few confided that they or their relatives had been told by the Chinese police to pull out, he said.\n\nTwo days before the festival was supposed to open last Saturday, Mr. Zhu decided to cancel it.\n\n“I am not making this decision out of fear or submission,” he wrote on the festival’s website. “But I hope this announcement of the cancellation of IndieChina Film Festival will make certain unknown forces stop harassing all the directors, guests, former staff, volunteers and my friends and family.”\n\nThe apparent official intimidation elicited by the festival — which by Mr. Zhu’s own description was small, low-profile and likely to have limited impact within China — shows how far the Chinese government is willing to go to suppress critical voices, even thousands of miles away. Some of the participants have lived overseas for years, said Mr. Zhu, a filmmaker who moved from China to New York in 2014. Even foreign citizens or people not of Chinese heritage were not spared, with some being pressured by their employers, Mr. Zhu said.\n\nSeveral of the films touched on topics the Chinese government is sensitive about, such as the coronavirus pandemic or the one-child policy. But others, Mr. Zhu said, could have been shown in mainstream cinemas in China.\n\n“I never thought about hiding this, like it was an underground event. If we were in China, I’d probably do that,” he said in an interview. But “that this would become so hard even in New York was totally beyond my expectations.”\n\nThe space for independent films has been largely erased in China, as Xi Jinping, the country’s leader, has sought to enforce strict ideological purity. The small independent festivals that were established in the 2000s, showing films not submitted to state censors for approval — and therefore not allowed to screen commercially — were shut down years ago. Directors who made films critical of the government have been imprisoned or fined.\n\nSome Chinese have sought refuge overseas. A year after the Beijing Independent Film Festival (of which Mr. Zhu was a co-founder) was shut down, some films were screened in New York. Chinese living abroad have set up Chinese-language bookstores, and organized comedy shows and pop-up salons to discuss culture and current affairs in Tokyo, London and Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nBut increasingly, government repression has followed. In July, the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok successfully pressured a museum there to partially censor an exhibition that the Chinese authorities said advocated independence for Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. A documentary about waters disputed between China and the Philippines was pulled from a film festival in Manila earlier this year, with the Filipina director citing “external factors.”\n\nMr. Zhu, who started planning the New York festival earlier this year, had advertised it on Chinese social media and knew that the authorities might take notice. But he thought that the worst that could happen was that he alone might encounter problems visiting China, he said.\n\nHe received around 200 submissions from filmmakers based all around the world and selected 31. He collected about $1,000 in online donations, but mostly funded the event himself. He had expected around 60 to 70 attendees at each screening.\n\nBut about a week before the opening, even as some festival guests were already starting to arrive in New York, the Chinese authorities were mobilizing.\n\nFour Chinese police officers visited a filmmaker who lives in China and who had been set to participate in Mr. Zhu’s festival. The filmmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said that the authorities were unhappy with Mr. Zhu and that the festival was an act of smearing China from abroad.\n\nThe filmmaker agreed to withdraw from the festival. The person also stopped working on their current project, describing the pressure as suffocating.\n\nThe scale of the intimidation around the world shows the government’s expanding surveillance power, said Maya Wang, the associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “It’s incredibly chilling for anyone who has some remote connection to China.”\n\nIn a written response to questions about the festival, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that it wasn’t familiar with the specific circumstances, but that Human Rights Watch had “long been prejudiced against China.”\n\nMr. Zhu said he didn’t know whether he’d try to organize another festival. It was too late to cancel the event space he’d booked in Brooklyn.\n\n“I’ll just go there and watch movies myself,” he said.\n\n"}]}
