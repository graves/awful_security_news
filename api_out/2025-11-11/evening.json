Jack Guy, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:44 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dozens of British lawmakers have called for the release of 15 penguins “trapped”  at a London aquarium without access to daylight or fresh air, saying their living conditions are “utterly unacceptable.”\n \n\n   \n  The 15 Gentoo penguins are housed in an enclosure at the Sea Life London Aquarium, located next to the River Thames, a short distance from the Houses of Parliament.\n \n\n   \n  The aquarium, owned by Merlin Entertainments, first opened its penguin exhibit in May 2011, according to the UK’s PA Media news agency.\n \n\n   \n  Campaigners say the penguins “are a small colony, in a tiny enclosure, that does not meet their physical and social needs and does not allow them to enjoy their natural behaviours.”\n \n\n   \n  “Their enclosure offers just 6-7 feet of depth in which to dive — a pitiful fraction of the 600ft they can dive to in the wild,” animal advocates say in a petition that’s been signed by more than 37,000 people.\n \n\n   \n  Now, more than 70 members of parliament have signed a letter sent to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), asking the government to “consider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioural, ecological and physiological needs,” PA Media reported.\n \n\n   \n  The letter was coordinated by David Taylor, a lawmaker from the ruling Labour party.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s un-British to keep penguins trapped in a basement with no daylight or fresh air. No animal should live like that, with their rights appearing to be traded for hard cash,” said Taylor.\n \n\n   \n  Another signatory, Danny Chambers, a lawmaker from the Liberal Democrat party, said the penguins were kept in “utterly unacceptable” conditions.\n \n\n   \n  “They are denied fresh air, natural light and the space they need to thrive,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The campaign to release the penguins and to cease all breeding programs at the aquarium has gained traction in recent months.\n \n\n   \n  Broadcaster and environmental campaigner Chris Packham attended a protest outside the aquarium last month, calling the living conditions “completely obscene,” adding: “It must not go on.”\n \n\n   \n  “These 15 penguins are currently being housed underground with no access to daylight or fresh air in a basement that has continuously held penguins since May 2011. One penguin, Polly, has been held there for over 14 years,” said Packham in the social media post.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson from the Merlin Entertainments’ Conservation, Welfare & Education team said in a statement that it had a team of specialists that ensure the penguins are “healthy and thriving.”\n \n\n   \n  The facility where the penguins are housed was designed in conjunction with vets and penguin specialists, they added, and told PA media that the facility is on the ground floor of the aquarium rather than the basement.\n \n\n   \n  “Releasing them into the wild simply isn’t a safe option for these penguins, who have always lived in human care,” said the spokesperson.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a complex issue. There’s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what’s best for the animals.”\n \n\n   \n  A DEFRA spokesperson told CNN in a statement: “This government is committed to the highest standards of animal welfare. We recently launched an overhaul of welfare standards in zoos to strengthen protections and ensure all animals – including gentoo penguins – are cared for in line with best practice.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/nba-mavericks-nico-harrison-fans","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"17:00:00-05:00","title":"Mavs fans wanted Nico Harrison fired.

Every Mavs fan knew the moment the trade happened that Nico would eventually be fired,” he said. “This still does not change that (owner Patrick) Dumont knows nothing about basketball. … Unless they bring Dirk (Nowitski, a franchise legend) back into the fold with an official position, preferably general manager, I will have no faith in Dumont or who he hires to make good decisions.”\n \n\n   \n  Slovak’s frustration runs deeper than Harrison’s front-office record. He blamed ownership – the Dumonts and the Adelsons — for what he sees as a series of tone-deaf decisions that alienated fans.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s close to impossible to root for an organization that they own,” he said, adding that the only thing keeping him invested is  the potential of phenom Cooper Flagg. \n \n\n   \n     Hope and heartbreak \n \n\n   \n  For Skylar Alcala, who adored Dončić when he played on the Mavs, the firing brought an emotional mix of relief and lingering pain.\n \n\n   \n  “First initial reaction, THANK THE LORD!” she said. “With how the Mavs have started this season, I’m glad Dumont realized that what Nico did to this team was detrimental.”\n \n\n   \n  Still, Alcala said the damage runs deep.\n \n\n   \n  “The way I feel about the Mavs now is still heartbreak. … There’s definitely a slight weight lifted off my shoulders knowing Nico is gone, but the Mavs organization has a-ways to go to build back trust,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  And the Dončić trade still stings: “The hardest part in all of this is seeing Luka dominate for the Lakers while we watch and wish every day for him to be back in a Mavs uniform.”\n \n\n   \n     A chance to heal – and rebuild \n \n\n   \n  John Tarrant – who, despite the Dončić trade, continued to cheer for the team and brings his sons to games – called the move long overdue.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s about time. The only person upset is Jerry Jones because he’s no longer the second-worst respected GM in DFW,” he quipped. “This organization and fan base needs to heal, and this is a first step.”\n \n\n   \n  Tarrant said fans are ready to move forward and build around young star Flagg.\n \n\n   \n  “Next steps need to happen. Anyone associated with Harrison’s tenure – including Anthony Davis – needs to be moved. Let’s rebuild this from the ground up around Flagg,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, he couldn’t hide his frustration at the trade that defined Harrison’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  “To trade a 25-year-old superstar for an injury-prone, aging veteran who has only played 14 of 46 games still makes zero sense,” Tarrant said. “Can Cuban buy back the team?”\n \n\n   \n     The bottom line \n \n\n   \n  The firing of Harrison may close one painful chapter, but the Mavericks’ front office faces immense pressure to get the next one right. Fans have made it clear: firing Harrison was a start – not a solution.\n \n\n   \n  As Slovak put it, “It’s not impossible to salvage the situation, but there’s been no indication over the last year that leadership is capable of making the decisions required to bring back the fans.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/marion-county-record-raid-search","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:34:00-05:00","title":"A Kansas County Agrees to Pay $3 Million and Apologize for Raid on Small-Town Newspaper","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Marion County, Kansas, has agreed to pay over $3 million and issue a public apology for a 2023 raid on the Marion County Record, a small-town newspaper, which included searches of the paper’s offices and the homes of its publisher and a councilwoman.

What was more important, he said, was the apology that was part of the negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  “The important thing, and what we held out for, is that there was an admission that wrong was done,” Meyer said. “The county itself didn’t specifically say it did wrongdoing, but it said it was wrong to have done the raids, and it apologized, and that was more important than the money.”\n \n\n   \n  The newspaper attorney’s Bernie Rhodes​​​​ said the lawsuit was not about money. “This was about an amount of money that would deter the next crazed cop who thought it would be a good idea to raid a newsroom.”\n \n\n   \n  The publisher’s 98-year-old mother, who was the co-owner of the Marion County Record, died a day after police raided the home she shared with her son.

Rhodes said he expects that suit to go to trial.\n \n\n   \n  “The most important consequence was that, you know, if you act like a bully, you try to weaponize the criminal justice system against the press, there’s going to be a price to pay, and that price is now measured in millions,” Meyer said. “This is just the first shoe of two shoes to fall. This is the county portion of it. The city was the main instigator of this raid.”\n \n\n   \n  Meyer noted that press freedoms are still under attack across the country and more needs to be done to stop incidents like this from happening elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  “This is kind of a part of the system these days where the Justice Department is weaponized against political enemies, where laws are stretched to their breaking point, where … if you want to enforce some law, you can go out and do whatever you want unless somebody challenges it in court. Well, guess what? Somebody did challenge it in court, and we won,” Meyer said.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement means Joan Meyer’s death was not in vain, Rhodes said.\n \n\n   \n  “Her death prompted this rallying cry by press organizations across the world, not just the United States, but across the world, that it’s time to stand up to these bullying techniques,” the attorney said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/gregory-bovino-border-patrol-agents-chicago","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"17:58:00Z","title":"Gregory Bovino and Border Patrol Planning to Leave Chicago Amid Legal and Political Pushback","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Gregory Bovino, the top U.S. Border Patrol official, is planning to leave Chicago as early as this week to relocate federal immigration enforcement operations to Charlotte, North Carolina, and then to New Orleans, as part of President Donald Trump’s broader crackdown on immigration in blue states.

Priscilla Alvarez, Andy Rose, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:58 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading the charge on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in cities, along with his agents, are planning to leave Chicago as early as this week as they eye other locations to ramp up arrests, according to three US officials familiar with the planning.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino  has become the on-the-ground face  of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into blue states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there — first in Los Angeles, now in Chicago, where aggressive clashes with protesters have been at the core of ongoing litigation.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino and his officers are expected to head to Charlotte, North Carolina, then continue to New Orleans, according to two of the officials, who stressed plans are still being finalized.\n \n\n   \n  The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office, which serves Charlotte, told CNN that neither its office nor Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are involved in planning of federal operations and have not been in contact with government officials regarding the reported move.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office “has not been contacted by any (Customs and Border Protection) representatives regarding any potential operations, nor have we been involved in any planning or conversations,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to continue operations in Chicago.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN, “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” and cited a drop in street crime in the city since Operation Midway Blitz began. CBS News first  reported  Bovino planned to leave Chicago soon.\n \n\n   \n    Potential move comes after personal rebuke from judge\n \n\n   \n  The discussion of Bovino moving on from Chicago comes shortly after he was personally  called out  by a federal judge.\n \n\n   \n  US District Court Judge Sara Ellis was angered that Bovino initially said he had lobbed tear gas at a group of protesters only after being hit in the head with a rock, but later acknowledged the assault against him came after his use of force.\n \n\n   \n  “Defendant Bovino admitted that he lied,” Ellis said in a hearing on November 6, the same day she issued a  preliminary injunction  blocking the use of force against protesters and journalists, “unless such force is objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat of the person causing serious bodily injury or death to another person.”\n \n\n   \n  That order also requires agents to warn protesters at least twice before deploying tear gas and less-lethal munitions like pepper balls. The Trump administration is  appealing  the injunction and asking for its enforcement to be  delayed  while an appeals court panel considers the case.\n \n\n   \n  The injunction from Judge Ellis came after Bovino sat for hours of videotaped testimony, clips of which were played in court. Those excerpts showed Bovino frequently butting heads with an attorney for the plaintiffs, arguing that protesters on the receiving end of riot control munitions were “violent rioters and assaultive subjects.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino also denied tackling one protester, Scott Blackburn, saying the incident captured on camera did not count as a “reportable use of force” because he was in the process of arresting Blackburn.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis was not impressed with the hair-splitting. “In one of the videos, Defendant Bovino obviously attacks and tackles the declarant, Mr. Blackburn, to the ground,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    President has publicly discussed other cities for operations\n \n\n   \n  Trump has previously floated New Orleans as a destination for his federal crackdown, saying in an Oval Office meeting this year that the administration was “making a determination.”\n \n\n   \n  “Do we go to Chicago? Do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite, you know, quite tough, quite bad?” he said.\n \n\n   \n  While Bovino and his team’s relocation is not yet final, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson celebrated the news Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  “Greg Bovino’s legacy in Chicago is chaos, criminality, and terror,” Johnson said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  “It is the grassroots resistance to Bovino that has forced them to retreat,” the mayor added. “Bovino did nothing to make our city safer. He will not be missed in Chicago.”\n \n\n   \n  “This has never been about improving immigration enforcement or public safety — this is about normalizing military tanks and armed troops on American streets,” said a spokesperson for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a statement.\n \n\n   \n  Asked by CNN last month where he planned to go next, Bovino said any decision would be based on intelligence.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting. \n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Whitney Wild, Dianne Gallagher and Danya Gainor contributed to this report.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/health/fda-cder-pazdur","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:24:00Z","title":"Longtime FDA oncology leader named agency’s top drug regulator","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. Richard Pazdur, a longtime leader in FDA oncology and former founding director of the Oncology Center of Excellence, has been appointed head of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the agency’s largest division overseeing drug and over-the-counter product safety and approval.

At a time when the party base has lambasted Senate Democrats, who have been accused of “caving” to end the  weekslong shutdown , most of those to speak out have rejected the Senate deal.\n \n\n   \n  The  deal to end the shutdown  would fund the government through the end of January and offer a reprieve from layoffs for federal workers. Under the agreement, the Senate plans to vote on legislation to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, Democrats’ main funding priority. The deal does not, however, guarantee a vote will happen in the House, which has become the main sticking point for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  “If we knew we were going to get a vote in the House, I’d probably support this deal,” New York Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, whose district went for Trump by 5 points last year, said during a  radio interview  with Brian Lehrer on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  House Democratic leadership is encouraging members to vote against the Senate deal,  CNN has reported , and one centrist coalition within the party also opposes the agreement. The moderate New Democrat Coalition on Tuesday came out against the deal, a position that required approval from two-thirds of the group’s 116 members. Ten of the 13 Democrats in Trump districts are members of the group.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what the 13 crossover district Democrats — based on lines drawn before  this year’s redistricting battles  — have said about the deal to end the government shutdown:\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Josh Harder of California\n \n\n   \n  Harder said he is a “hell no” on the deal in  an X video  his office posted Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “This isn’t a deal at all,” he said. “It’s a surrender that is doing absolutely nothing to lower health care costs and premiums for millions of Californians.”\n \n\n   \n  Harder blasted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats who voted for the deal, calling it an “unacceptable” capitulation to the Trump administration, and said he would push to stop it in the House. Schumer publicly opposed the deal and voted against it.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York\n \n\n   \n  Suozzi told WNYC on Monday he wasn’t ready to endorse the Senate deal because it doesn’t guarantee a vote in the House to address the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. Like many Democrats opposed to the funding bill, Suozzi said he was worried the Senate might pass a measure to address the expiring tax credits, only for the House not to take it up.\n \n\n   \n  “That would be a real kick in the head,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Nellie Pou of New Jersey\n \n\n   \n  Pou called the agreement a “bad deal” in  a statement on X  and said she would oppose any measure that doesn’t extend the premium tax credits.\n \n\n   \n  “I will be voting no to any so-called government funding package that will not stop Republican price hikes on health care premiums,” Pou said.\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Michigan\n \n\n   \n  McDonald Rivet said she’s opposed to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  “We urgently need a bipartisan budget with real solutions to fix these costs and open the government,” she  said in a statement on X . “I remain ready to work on it, but caving without health care solutions would fail countless working families who are struggling to get by.”\n \n\n   \n    Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio\n \n\n   \n  The Ohio lawmaker  told Spectrum News  that she will not vote for the measure.\n \n\n   \n  “What’s at stake are the health insurance bills and the cost of health insurance for millions and millions of Americans and their families, and we cannot take their benefits away,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    The other lawmakers\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina  wrote on X  that he is reviewing the deal and is focused on “ending the government shutdown responsibly and addressing the high cost of living families are facing.”\n \n\n   \n  Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a New Mexico Democrat, expressed concerns about the funding bill  to a local ABC affiliate , saying the deal “doesn’t get anywhere close” to resolving premium increases.\n \n\n   \n  “It doesn’t help to fix the health care crisis that we are facing, not just in New Mexico but across the country,” Vasquez said.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to spokespeople for Reps.

keeps full SNAP payments on hold with short term order \n       \n  By John Fritze, Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        6:43 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended a short-term order that allows the Trump administration to withhold paying for full food stamp payments in November, a move that appeared designed to put off the case a few days in the hope that Congress approves a pending  agreement to reopen the federal government .\n \n\n   \n  The fast-moving emergency appeal at the Supreme Court over Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits that help more than 40 million Americans – as well as several lawsuits playing out in lower courts – would almost certainly be dismissed as moot if the historic shutdown ends in coming days.\n \n\n   \n  But until that happens, the “administrative stay” that  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued Friday  will continue to block a lower court order that required the administration to provide full federal food benefits.\n \n\n   \n  In a new brief order on Tuesday, the court said it was extending the administrative stay through the end of the day Thursday. Jackson dissented from the extension.\n \n\n   \n  Along with canceled flights, the spiraling legal battle over food stamps became a defining and tangible impact of the shutdown. The groups challenging the administration told the Supreme Court in a brief earlier Tuesday that SNAP beneficiaries had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food” and that millions of Americans, including children, were going hungry.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly 42 million Americans receive food stamps on a staggered basis throughout each month. Nearly 27 million should have gotten their allotments by Monday, according to estimates by Code for America, which works with governments to improve access to safety net programs.\n \n\n   \n  Households receive around $350, on average, each month to help them buy food, though for many families, the assistance is spent quickly.\n \n\n   \n  But the administration countered that a lower court that ordered full SNAP payments was out of line, requiring the US Department of Agriculture to transfer about $4 billion out of one fund and into another. And, the Justice Department warned, the lower court orders on food aid “inject the federal courts into the political branches’ closing efforts to end this shutdown.”\n \n\n   \n  Under a separate court order that was not before the Supreme Court, the administration relied on contingency funds to pay partial food stamp benefits for November. The question before the Supreme Court, then, was whether the administration could be required to pay the full benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Amid the multiple and varied USDA guidance memos to states stemming from the court actions, a number of states sent either full or partial November benefits to their residents. At least 16 states have provided beneficiaries with their full allotments for the month, and another five states have sent partial payments, according to a CNN tally.\n \n\n   \n  The food stamp program has been in legal limbo since last month, when officials said recipients would not receive their payments for November due to the lapse in government funding.\n \n\n   \n  The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling that the agency must at least tap into contingency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November’s allotments.\n \n\n   \n  The USDA opted to  fund partial benefits , but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. The nonprofit groups challenging President Donald Trump raced back to US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island last week to argue that the court should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\n \n\n   \n  McConnell obliged. He ruled the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program’s recipients and that it had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” when it decided against providing the full benefits this month. The administration quickly appealed to the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson, who handles emergency appeals from the 1st Circuit, issued what’s known as an “administrative stay” on Friday, effectively putting McConnell’s order on hold for a few days so lower courts could review the case.\n \n\n   \n  Jackson’s emergency order was set to expire a few minutes before midnight on Tuesday. The justice did not explain her decision to dissent from the court’s extension.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/health/byheart-baby-formula-recall-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:32:00-05:00","title":"ByHeart Recalls All Baby Formula in US Amid Infant Botulism Outbreak Investigation","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"ByHeart, a U.S. infant formula company, has recalled all of its products nationwide after the FDA and CDC investigate a multistate outbreak of infant botulism potentially linked to its 'Whole Nutrition' formula.

company  ByHeart said Tuesday  that it has recalled all of its infant formula products nationwide, including cans and single-serve sticks.\n \n\n   \n  The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating a  multistate outbreak of infant botulism  that may be tied to ByHeart’s “whole nutrition” infant formula products.\n \n\n   \n  Epidemiologic and laboratory data has shown that ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula might be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, the germ that causes botulism, the FDA said Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  According to the FDA, as of Monday, 15 children with suspected or confirmed infant botulism who had also been exposed to ByHeart infant formula have been  reported in 12 states : Arizona, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.\n \n\n   \n  All 15 infants, who ranged in age from 16 days to 157 days, were hospitalized and given  BabyBIG , an intravenous antibody treatment for infant botulism. No deaths have been reported.\n \n\n   \n  Infant botulism happens when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinum   spores, which can grow in the gut and produce botulinum neurotoxin,  according to the CDC . Signs and symptoms – which can take several weeks to develop – may include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, difficulty swallowing and a weak and altered cry, which can progress to difficulty breathing and respiratory arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Since August, 84 infants have received treatment for infant botulism nationwide, based on data from the California Department of Public Health’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, according to the FDA. Among those infants, 43% had been exposed to powdered infant formula. And among those who had powdered infant formula exposure, more than 40% consumed ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula.\n \n\n   \n  “This information shows that ByHeart brand formula is disproportionately represented among sick infants in this outbreak, especially given that ByHeart represents an estimated 1% of all infant formula sales in the United States,” according to the  FDA . “Investigations remain ongoing but have not identified any other infant formula brands or shared exposures that pose a risk to infants.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘All ByHeart product must be discarded’\n \n\n   \n  Mia Funt and Ron Belldegrun, the co-founders of ByHeart,  said in an online letter  Tuesday that they have provided the FDA with access to all of their facilities and products.\n \n\n   \n  “Upon learning about this outbreak on Friday evening, we immediately began conducting our own extensive testing on all ByHeart batches. Additionally, we are providing the FDA complete and unrestricted access to all of our facilities and products for their investigation, which has been done regularly at our owned facilities. We will share the results of our own testing as they become available,” Funt and Belldegrun wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “At this moment, the most important thing for you to know is that all ByHeart product must be discarded. We know that switching formulas is not an easy process or decision. We have resources to help,” they said, providing a link to a guide on  how to switch infant formulas . “We are so sorry, and are committed to doing anything we can to support you.”\n \n\n   \n  Several states are testing leftover formula, the FDA said, and the results are expected in the coming weeks.\n \n\n   \n   Preliminary lab results  that the California Department of Public Health released Saturday suggested that the bacterium that causes botulism was present in an open can of ByHeart infant formula, which was fed to an infant with botulism.\n \n\n   \n  “Infant botulism is a very rare disease that occurs when babies inhale or swallow spores of the toxin-producing bacteria that cause infant botulism, which leads to progressive muscle weakness including trouble breathing if not treated in time,” Dr. Erica Pan, California Department of Public Health’s director and state public health officer,  said in a news release  Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have tested a sample of the specific powdered infant formula linked with these cases and preliminary tests are positive,” Pan said. “We are urging parents to stop using ByHeart formula immediately.”​\n \n\n   \n  The FDA said no unopened ByHeart product has tested positive for Clostridium botulinum spores or toxin.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/spending-bill-government-shutdown-end","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:45:00-05:00","title":"What’s in the bill to reopen the federal government?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Congress is advancing a bipartisan funding bill to end the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history by providing temporary funding through January 30, 2026.

Eight Democratic senators  defied their party’s leadership to support the legislation, dropping their key demand that the legislation extend the  enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies  that are set to lapse at year’s end.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal, the Senate will vote on the enhanced subsidies next month. Notably, the agreement with Republicans does not guarantee that the beefed-up assistance will be extended.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what’s in the bill, based on summaries provided by Congress:\n \n\n   \n    Funding federal agencies\n \n\n   \n  The bill would provide funding for most federal agencies through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  That means if the two parties can’t come to an agreement on another temporary spending measure or a package that funds agencies through the end of the fiscal year, much of the federal government could shut down again in less than three months.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation, however, provides full-year funding for the US Department of Agriculture, the legislative branch and military construction and veterans affairs. So these functions would continue even if an impasse reoccurs on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n    Food assistance\n \n\n   \n  The legislation would fully fund the food stamp program for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was thrust into the spotlight during the shutdown after the USDA said it would not dip into a contingency fund to provide at least partial benefits for November.  Legal battles  ensued, resulting in some of the nation’s  nearly 42 million food stamp beneficiaries  receiving their full allocations over the past week, others receiving partial benefits and still others waiting for any assistance.\n \n\n   \n  The deal would also replenish SNAP’s contingency fund and fully funds child nutrition programs, including free and reduced-price school meals.\n \n\n   \n  Plus, it provides $8.2 billion for the WIC food assistance program, which serves roughly 7 million pregnant women, new moms and young kids. That’s a $603 million increase over the past fiscal year. WIC’s contingency fund would also be replenished.\n \n\n   \n  The legislation provides $460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which supplies more than 700,000 low-income senior citizens with monthly food boxes.\n \n\n   \n    Congressional and Supreme Court security\n \n\n   \n  Concerned about their own security and that of their staffs, lawmakers included $203.5 million in new funding to beef up security measures and protect members of the House and Senate in the package. It also provides funding to support Capitol complex physical security requirements and cybersecurity practices.\n \n\n   \n  The bill also includes $852 million for the US Capitol Police and provides an additional $28 million for the protection and security of Supreme Court justices.\n \n\n   \n    Veterans medical care\n \n\n   \n  The package provides $115 billion for discretionary Veterans Affairs’ medical care, a bump of more than $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. It includes funding for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, rural health, caregivers, women’s health, veterans’ homelessness prevention, mental health and child care.\n \n\n   \n    Federal workers\n \n\n   \n  The legislation also guarantees retroactive pay for the roughly 1.4 million federal workers who were furloughed or worked without pay during the shutdown. Many have missed two full paychecks, as well as a partial one.\n \n\n   \n  Though President Donald Trump signed a bill during the 2018-2019 impasse that ensured federal workers would get back pay, the administration  called into question  whether furloughed employees would be compensated when this shutdown ended.\n \n\n   \n  The package also reverses several agencies’ efforts to implement staffing reductions during the shutdown, stating that workforce levels will return to what they had been prior to the lapse in appropriations. It also prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  At least seven agencies sent reduction-in-force notices to  roughly 4,000 workers  in October, though the actions were  paused  by a federal court.\n \n\n   \n    Notifying lawmakers under investigation\n \n\n   \n  The deal includes a section that would require the Justice Department and FBI to notify the Senate when a lawmaker is under investigation and if their personal information is being subpoenaed.\n \n\n   \n  The language,  tucked into one of the appropriations bills , comes after Senate Republicans released FBI records related to an investigation called Arctic Frost, which pertained to the fake elector scheme from 2020 where Trump allies pressured GOP electors to register electoral college votes for Trump from states that former president Joe Biden won.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/middleeast/west-bank-settler-violence-arson-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:39:00-05:00","title":"Dozens of Israeli settlers launch arson attack in West Bank as attacks against Palestinians surge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, dozens of Israeli settlers launched an arson attack on agricultural areas in Beit Lid, east of Tulkarm, damaging the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory.

Zeena Saifi, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:39 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Dozens of  Israeli  settlers launched an arson attack on an agricultural area in the occupied West Bank Tuesday evening, according to Palestinian activists in the area, marking the latest such attack in what has been a surge of  settler violence .\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in the town of Beit Lid east of Tulkarm, damaging the Deir Sharaf Bedouin village and Al-Juneidi dairy factory, videos show and residents told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Footage obtained by CNN shows smoke engulfing the area, with Palestinian women heard shouting in the background, and men carrying extinguishers and water buckets scrambling to put out the fires.\n \n\n   \n  Videos show torched trucks, tents and metal sheds, and smashed car windows.\n \n\n   \n  Residents said Palestinian civil defense and firefighters arrived at the scene about an hour after the fires started.\n \n\n   \n  Another video filmed by a Palestinian resident shows the settlers coming down a hill toward the Bedouin village.\n \n\n   \n  This attack is the latest in a surge of settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, which have been taking place on a near-daily basis since mid-October. A United Nations report released Friday alleges that Israeli settlers launched at least 264 attacks in October, the  largest number  since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006, with this year’s olive harvest season marred by extreme violence.\n \n\n   \n  CCTV footage of the arson attack obtained by CNN then shows the settlers attacking the dairy factory, brandishing clubs and setting fire to parked vehicles. One of the vehicles – a cargo truck bearing the dairy factory’s logo – appears to be completely torched, with a thick cloud of black smoke rising from it.\n \n\n   \n  Gilad Kariv, an Israeli lawmaker from the left-wing Democrats party, decried the settler attack  on X . “Their goal is to ignite a third intifada, that will bring the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) to operate in a way reminiscent of the operation in Gaza. This move will cost the lives of hundreds of Israel soldiers and civilians and thousands of Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF said it dispatched its soldiers to the area following “a report of dozens of masked Israeli civilians who attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  “During the incident, four Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment. Security forces operated to disperse the confrontation using riot dispersal means and apprehended several Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement. The settlers also attacked the soldiers and damaged an Israeli military vehicle, the IDF said.\n \n\n   \n  The Israel Police said it had arrested four Israeli “suspects” and transferred them for questioning, following the “extreme violence.”\n \n\n   \n  “Police investigators, together with security forces, are currently collecting evidence at the scene, including documentation, witness statements and forensic findings,” it added.\n \n\n   \n  The arson attack is the latest in what has become an increasingly violent period in the West Bank during the olive harvest.\n \n\n   \n  On Saturday, at least 10 people were injured in an attack on the village of Beita while Palestinian farmers were harvesting olives, including three medics, four journalists and three activists, according to Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak who was present and himself injured.\n \n\n   \n  Activist Oded Yedaya, an Israeli photographer and administrator of the Minshar School of Art in Tel Aviv, had to be hospitalized after he was badly beaten, according to Pollak. Images obtained by CNN show Yedaya’s entire face and torso bloodied, with a white cloth wrapped around his head.\n \n\n   \n  Pollak told CNN Yedaya suffered fractures to the cheekbone and jaw.\n \n\n   \n  The IDF told CNN in a statement Saturday that they were aware of the incident, and had dispatched soldiers to an area around Evyatar, an Israeli outpost nearby “following a report of a confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  In the nearby village of Burin, Israeli and foreign activists were injured including off-duty Israeli army reservist Yuval Ben Ari.\n \n\n   \n  In a phone interview with CNN, Ben Ari said seeing videos of Palestinians being “brutally beaten” by settlers every day compelled him to go out and support them.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s important for Israelis to get out of bed and out of the house and do real activism instead of just liking content on Facebook or retweeting an article,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  He was standing alongside seven Israeli activists on a Palestinian farm picking olives early Saturday morning, when he saw at least 20 masked settlers come down the hill brandishing clubs and bats.\n \n\n   \n  He said he knew they were about to “terrorize the entire area.”\n \n\n   \n  “I stood in front of them and said, ‘I ask you not to do it.  You don’t want to do it,’” he said, before revealing to them that he was a reservist. But that didn’t stop the attack, he said, and he suffered a head injury and minor concussion that required hospitalization.\n \n\n   \n  “I was soaking blood and in pain. But after I managed to stand up, the settlers shouted at me saying, ‘Don’t ever come here again. Don’t betray your own people.’”\n \n\n   \n  In response to a query from CNN, the IDF said in a statement that its soldiers “were dispatched to the area of Burin, following a report of rock-hurling at an Israeli vehicle.”\n \n\n   \n  “Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians were injured and evacuated to receive medical treatment…The IDF condemns any act of violence and will continue to operate to maintain security and order in the area.” the statement continued.\n \n\n   \n  Ben Ari told CNN the soldiers who arrived at the scene did not stop the attack, an accusation many Palestinians and activists have voiced in other incidents as well.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-military-mobilization-us-buildup-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"16:47:00Z","title":"Venezuela announces ‘massive mobilization’ of military forces as America’s largest warship sails into region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela has announced a 'massive mobilization' of its military, including land, air, naval, and reserve forces, in direct response to the arrival of the US Navy’s largest warship, the USS Gerald R.

Maduro has also claimed that his volunteer militias now have more than 8 million reservists, though experts have called into question that number as well as the quality of the troops’ training.\n \n\n   \n  With the arrival of the Ford, there are thought to be roughly 15,000 US personnel in the region.\n \n\n   \n  A significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets were already in the region before the arrival of the Ford group, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, amounting to more than 4,500 Marines and sailors, three guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, a guided missile cruiser and P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, the US has deployed 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, which has become a hub for the US military as part of the increased focus on the Caribbean.

Yan, Eric Levenson, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:28 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The families of 13 girls and two counselors who died in the catastrophic flooding that swept through Camp Mystic this summer are suing the Texas camp and its owners, accusing them of gross negligence, according to four lawsuits filed this week.\n \n\n   \n  The flurry of litigation marks the first wave of legal action by victims’ families against the all-girls Christian camp since  25 girls and two counselors died  in the  July 4 disaster .\n \n\n   \n   Many of the youngest victims  were housed in the cabins closest to the Guadalupe River, which swelled to a deadly torrent amid epic rainfall and flooding. Richard “Dick” Eastland, who co-owned Camp Mystic with his wife, Tweety, died trying to save some of the girls, a family spokesperson has said.\n \n\n   \n  One lawsuit was filed by the families of five campers and two counselors who perished: Anna Margaret Bellows, Lila Bonner, Chloe Childress, Molly DeWitt, Katherine Ferruzzo, Lainey Landry and Blakely McCrory.\n \n\n   \n  A second lawsuit was filed by the family of 8-year-old Eloise “Lulu” Peck.\n \n\n   \n  A third was filed by the family of  9-year-old Ellen Getten .\n \n\n   \n  And a fourth was filed by the families of six other campers: Virginia Naylor, Hadley Hanna, Virginia Hollis, Jane Hunt, Lucy Dillon and Kellyanne Lytal.\n \n\n   \n  The defendants in each lawsuit include Camp Mystic and members of the Eastland family, which owns the 99-year-old camp in Kerr County.\n \n\n   \n   “ Tragically, due to lack of planning, the absence of any evacuation plans, lack of training, inadequate warning systems, and other acts and omissions of recklessness and gross negligence, Plaintiffs’ daughters suffered terrifying, brutal, and horrific deaths,” the lawsuit filed by the families of the six campers says.\n \n\n   \n  While Camp Mystic sympathizes with the grieving families, “We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well,” camp counsel Jeff Ray said in a statement.\n \n\n   \n    What the lawsuits allege\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the families of five campers and two counselors claims Camp Mystic didn’t have adequate safety plans and prioritized money over safety.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, campers Margaret, Lila, Molly, Lainey, and Blakely should be third graders, and counselors Chloe and Katherine should be freshmen at the University of Texas. They all are gone,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “These young girls died because a for-profit camp put profit over safety,” the filing says. “The Camp chose to house young girls in cabins sitting in flood-prone areas, despite the risk, to avoid the cost of relocating the cabins.”\n \n\n   \n  On the morning of July 4, “the Camp chose to take no steps to protect its campers and counselors while it knew a storm and ‘life threatening flash flooding’ were approaching,” the lawsuit states.\n \n\n   \n  “Instead, with the river rising, the Camp chose to direct its groundskeepers to spend over an hour evacuating camp equipment, not its campers and counselors,” the filing says.\n \n\n   \n  The Camp “chose to order its campers and counselors to remain in the Bubble Inn and Twins cabins while the flood waters overwhelmed the camp,” it continued. “Finally, when it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless ‘rescue’ effort from its self-created disaster in which 25 campers, two counselors, and the Camp director died.”\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the family of Eloise “Lulu” Peck accused Camp Mystic of “gross negligence” by “failing to implement modern safety measures or update its own flood protocols in light of known dangers.”\n \n\n   \n  “Defendants knew that camp facilities were located in a flood zone, knew of the history of flash flooding in Kerr County, knew of repeated prior flood events at the Camp, and received warnings from family members about flood risk.”\n \n\n   \n  Another lawsuit was filed by the parents of Ellen, one of the youngest girls at the camp and who was housed at  Bubble Inn cabin .\n \n\n   \n  The camp’s directors should have known about emergency alerts in the area before the calamitous flooding and should have been on “high alert,” the lawsuit claims.\n \n\n   \n  But there was no plan to evacuate campers until 12 hours after a flash flood warning, the lawsuit alleges. That plan was “wholly inadequate and purposefully left some of the youngest children in Bubble Inn completely stranded without instruction, direction, or adult emergency assistance before their tragic deaths,” the third lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  The lawsuit filed by the families of six girls slammed “Camp Mystic’s so-called ‘Emergency Instructions.’” A wrinkled copy of those instructions was found in a counselor’s flooded trunk.\n \n\n   \n  Under the “Floods” section, the instructions say “Campers and counselors NEVER wander away from your cabin” and “All cabins are constructed on high, safe locations.”\n \n\n   \n  “Tragically, the last two sentences of Camp Mystic’s instructions caused the loss of Plaintiffs’ children’s lives,” that lawsuit says.\n \n\n   \n  “To instruct children to stay in a cabin with rising flood waters was ultimately a death sentence. Further, to state that ‘[a]ll cabins are constructed on high, safe ground’ was patently false, misleading [and] created a false sense of safety.”\n \n\n   \n  Photos from inside one cabin show “the water rose so close to the ceiling (5 ¾ inches) [that] the girls ran out of air space and were tragically swept into the raging flood waters,” the lawsuit states. Eight-year-old Lucy “did not make it out of the cabin where she lost her life.”\n \n\n   \n  All four lawsuits seek a jury trial in Travis County District Court and compensation for “mental anguish,” among other damages.\n \n\n   \n  The first three lawsuits each seek more than $1 million in damages. The fourth suit does not specify an amount.\n \n\n   \n    The camp responds\n \n\n   \n  The flooding killed at least 136 people across the region as parts of the Guadalupe River rose from about  3 feet to almost 30 feet in just 45 minutes .\n \n\n   \n  The horrific flood was “unprecedented,” Ray said. “We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also reached out to Camp Mystic attorney Mikal Watts for comment on the lawsuits.\n \n\n   \n  In an  interview with CNN last month , Watts addressed some of the questions and concerns that had been raised by families.\n \n\n   \n  He said the first warning came at 1:14 a.m., but “there’s some question as to who got it and who didn’t, because this is a very remote area with limited cell phone coverage.”\n \n\n   \n  At 1:47 a.m., Dick Eastland and his son Edward “immediately convened the ground crew and started securing equipment, started coming up with a plan at about 2” a.m., Watts said.\n \n\n   \n  “At about 2:19, we got the first information that one of the houses was having water coming,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Before 3 a.m., “there was a very orderly evacuation process of 10 different camps or cabins,” Watts said, noting camp leaders helped evacuate 166 girls.\n \n\n   \n  But a photo in the lawsuit filed by the six families – which attorneys say was timestamped at 3:26 a.m. – showed some campers wading in floodwater to get to higher ground.\n \n\n   \n  Watts challenged the notion that evacuating children during flash flooding is always the best option.\n \n\n   \n  “You shelter in place. That’s first and foremost what you ought to do,” Watts said.\n \n\n   \n   “ Do not take 9-year-old girls who weigh 63 pounds on average into raging floodwaters. They’re going to get washed away.”\n \n\n   \n    Anger and grief lead to change\n \n\n   \n  The deaths at Camp Mystic have led to sharp questions from parents and lawmakers about the camp’s safety and evacuation plan in an area known to flood on a regular basis.\n \n\n   \n  “Obvious commonsense safety measures were absent,” said CiCi Williams Steward, the mother of 8-year-old Cile, who remains missing.\n \n\n   \n  In September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed  tougher camp safety laws  that require local governments to install outdoor sirens and warning systems in flood-prone areas.\n \n\n   \n   Camp Mystic has announced plans to partially reopen  next summer for its 100th anniversary. The section of the camp close to the Guadalupe River will remain closed. The more recent expansion, which sits uphill and was not damaged in the flooding, will reopen.\n \n\n   \n  The news stunned Steward, who still doesn’t know where her daughter is.\n \n\n   \n  “Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter’s body,” she said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/nfl-donald-trump-kickoffs","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:59:00Z","title":"Donald Trump Really, Really Doesn’t Like the NFL’s New Kickoff Format","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump has voiced strong opposition to the NFL’s new dynamic kickoff format, criticizing it as 'demeaning,' 'unromantic,' and harmful to the game's pageantry and tradition.

like the NFL’s new kickoff format \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:59 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump called into Pat McAfee’s show on ESPN on Tuesday, discussing his admiration for the nation’s veterans on Veterans Day, the impending end of the government shutdown, the role of sports in his political life and the big money in college sports.\n \n\n   \n  But there was one topic that really got the president fired up:  The NFL’s new kickoff format. \n \n\n   \n  “I  hate  the kickoff,” Trump said to protestations from McAfee.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it’s so terrible. I think it’s so demeaning, and I think it hurts the game. It hurts the pageantry. I’ve told that to Roger Goodell, and I don’t think it’s any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other, and … it’s the opposite of what the game (is supposed to be). The ball is in the air, and nobody’s moving. It’s supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you’re supposed to move.\n \n\n   \n  “You walk in and the pageantry of the game is so badly hurt. And I don’t think NFL, you know, they don’t, they do what they want to do, but I don’t think they’ll change.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has been a frequent critic of the NFL’s revamped kickoff format, adopted for the first time last season in an effort to decrease the intense collisions that frequently resulted in injuries.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to the league for comment on Trump’s latest criticism on the so-called dynamic kickoff.\n \n\n   \n  Under the old rules, the kicking team started at its 35-yard line and tried to kick the ball as far downfield as possible to give their defense a better chance of stopping the offense far from the end zone. Meanwhile, the receiving team tries to move the ball as far as they can up the field. With two teams running at each other at top speed, collisions between players were often devastating.\n \n\n   \n  The new version still sees the ball kicked from the kicking team’s 35-yard line, but every player on the kicking team other than the kicker himself now lines up with at least one foot on the returning team’s 40-yard line.\n \n\n   \n  Players must also wait to move until the ball hits the ground or is touched by a returner inside the 20-yard line. Any kick that is caught or lands in the landing zone must be returned, while any kick that falls short of the landing zone will be ruled a touchback and spotted at the returning team’s 40-yard line. If a kick hits the landing zone and then goes into the end zone, it has to be returned or downed by the receiving team.\n \n\n   \n  Among other things, it basically means players are closer together and are not colliding into each other with as much speed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has complained about the rule almost since it first debuted. But on Tuesday, he went even further with his lamentations.\n \n\n   \n  “I hope college football doesn’t change, because the power of the kickoff is, we’re so beautiful, and now it, you know, I don’t want to say what it reminds me of, because I’ll get myself into big trouble,” Trump said. “It is not football, and I have no idea what you guys – you guys may disagree with me. I don’t think it’s going to help.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s so bad. It’s so bad. It’s so unromantic, and it just is demeaning to football. I don’t think they have a right to do that to the game,” Trump went on to say. “You know, the game is so important. I don’t think the people that approve that. I don’t think anybody has the right to do that to the game. And I hope college doesn’t change, and I hope that someday the NFL will stop it and go back to football.”\n \n\n   \n  The league has maintained that the new system is safer than the old and also results in more exciting plays.\n \n\n   \n  Kickoffs have long been one of the most dangerous plays in the game and were four times more likely to cause a concussion than a play that involved running or passing, according to  data  from the NFL. Since the change in format, the league has been buoyed by the early results.\n \n\n   \n  In January, the NFL  published data  from the 2024 season that showed a “significant decrease in concussions.” As intended, the new rule slowed average player speeds, which led to a lower concussion rate – down 43% from 2021-2023.\n \n\n   \n  The NFL said returns increased 57% in the 2024 regular season and that there were seven kickoffs returned for touchdowns – the most since 2021.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Allen Sills, the chief medical officer of the NFL, told CNN that the new rule makes the game safer.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been an overwhelming success,” Sills said.\n \n\n   \n  He added, “Last year, if you look at our data, significantly higher return rate but the injury rate was one of the lowest that we’ve seen. So, that was what we were looking for with the play, is to make it more exciting yet also safer. So, we looked at space and speed. It went down, which is what we expected from the play. We, again, saw more excitement. And here’s an unexpected benefit: Because the average starting point for drives was further out, closer to the 30-yard line, we had fewer punts, which is also good from a health and safety standpoint because pun is one of our more injurious plays.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/23/sport/chess-vladimir-kramnik-daniel-naroditsky-fide-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:35:00Z","title":"Former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik to Face Probe over Online Comments about Rival","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik is under investigation by FIDE for bullying and harassment stemming from repeated, unsubstantiated accusations of cheating against American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, a popular online chess educator who died at 29.

Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik to face probe over online comments about rival \n       \n  By George Ramsay, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:35 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Former world  chess  champion Vladimir Kramnik is being investigated for bullying and harassment over his comments about a rival,  Daniel Naroditsky , world chess governing body  FIDE has announced .\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky, an American chess grandmaster who amassed a large online following through streaming and teaching, died unexpectedly at the age of 29, according to a statement released by his family via the Charlotte Chess Center on Monday. No cause of death was announced.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.\n \n\n   \n  “The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,”  he said , adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and  wrote on X  Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”\n \n\n   \n  He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”\n \n\n   \n  Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.\n \n\n   \n  “In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich  said  in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  “When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.\n \n\n   \n  “The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by  CNN Sports , Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”\n \n\n   \n  He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”\n \n\n   \n  According to  The Associated Press , Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.\n \n\n   \n  Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “ horrible ” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura  describing  his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”\n \n\n   \n  “It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou  wrote  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”\n \n\n   \n  Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin  wrote  on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”\n \n\n   \n  “Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.\n \n\n   \n  Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.\n \n\n   \n  A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on  his YouTube channel  and 340,000 followers on  Twitch , as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator. He was loved by many.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/europe/serbia-protest-kushner-real-estate-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:51:00-05:00","title":"Serbian protesters vow to prevent real estate project linked to Trump son-in-law Kushner","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thousands of Serbian youth protesters have formed a human shield around a bombed-out military complex in Belgrade, opposing a $500-million redevelopment project by a US company linked to Jared Kushner, son-in-law of President Donald Trump.

Thousands of protesters in Serbia symbolically formed a human shield Tuesday around a bombed-out military complex, vowing to protect it from redevelopment as a luxury compound by a company linked to US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n \n\n   \n  Youth-led protesters drew a red line as they encircled the sprawling buildings in the capital, Belgrade that were partially destroyed in a 1999 NATO bombing campaign. The site faces demolition and redevelopment under a plan backed by the populist government of  President Aleksandar Vucic .\n \n\n   \n  The $500-million project to build a high-rise hotel, offices and shops at the site has met fierce opposition from experts at home and abroad, as well as the Serbian public. But last week Serbian lawmakers passed a special law clearing the way for the construction despite legal hurdles.\n \n\n   \n  Vucic’s pro-Trump government says the project would boost the economy and ties with the US administration, which has imposed tariffs of 35% on imports from Serbia. It has also sanctioned Serbia’s monopoly oil supplier, which is controlled by Russia.\n \n\n   \n  However, critics say the building is an architectural monument, seen as a symbol of resistance to the US-led NATO bombing that remains widely viewed in the Balkan country as an unjust “aggression.”\n \n\n   \n  Serbia’s government last year stripped the complex of protected status and signed a 99-year-lease agreement with Kushner-related Affinity Global Development in the US. But the redevelopment project came into question after Serbia’s organized crime prosecutors launched an investigation into whether documents used to remove that status were forged.\n \n\n   \n  The buildings are seen as prime examples of mid-20th century architecture in the former Yugoslavia. The protesters demanded that the protected heritage status for the complex be restored, and the buildings rebuilt.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a warning that we will all defend these buildings together,” one of the students said. “We will be the human shield.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue has become the latest flashpoint in yearlong street protests that have shaken Vucic’s firm grip on power. Protesters have accused his government of rampant corruption in state projects. The protests started after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad after renovation, killing 16 people.\n \n\n   \n  Tens of thousands of people marked the tragedy’s anniversary on Nov. 1 in Novi Sad.\n \n\n   \n  Serbia was bombed in 1999 for 78 days to force then-President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown on separatist ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Anti-NATO sentiment remain strong in Serbia, and the US role in revamping the military buildings is particularly sensitive among many Serbians.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the government in Albania, another Balkan country, approved a $1.6 billion plan from Kushner’s company for a project to develop a luxury resort on a communist-era fortified island on the Adriatic coast.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/us/flight-delays-cancellations-tracker-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:30:00Z","title":"Tracking US flight delays and cancellations in charts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Due to a government shutdown that has left air traffic controllers without pay, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implemented an emergency order reducing flights by 6% at 40 selected U.S. airports.

The bill now heads to the House for approval before being sent to President Donald Trump’s desk.\n \n\n   \n  “With the Senate passing the stopgap funding bill, it is likely that the government shutdown will end by the end of the week,” Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a note.\n \n\n   \n  Investors also rotated out of tech stocks on Tuesday and shifted into other sectors including health care, energy and consumer staples. That helped boost the Dow, which is less exposed to the tech and AI wave. Twenty-six out of 30 companies in the blue-chip Dow closed higher on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  A potential end to the government shutdown would also mean the subsequent release of key economic data on the job market and inflation that had been delayed. The return to regularly scheduled releases of data can also provide a boost of certainty and confidence for investors.\n \n\n   \n  In the last 15 government shutdowns going back to 1981, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 2.7% in the month after the government reopened, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n \n\n   \n  José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note: “A finalized deal later this week is expected to drive stocks to stronger advances, as a significant economic risk is pushed to the rear-view mirror and replaced with improved prospects for the holiday season.”\n \n\n   \n  On the tech front, Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) fell 2.96% on Tuesday after SoftBank disclosed that it had  sold its entire stake  in the company.\n \n\n   \n  Shares in CoreWeave ( CRWV ), a cloud-computing company and star of the AI trade, fell 16.31% after the company’s guidance did not impress investors.\n \n\n   \n  Stocks were coming off a day in the green. The Nasdaq surged 2.27% on Monday and posted its best day since May as investors swooped in to buy the dip on tech stocks.\n \n\n   \n  The bond market was closed on Tuesday in observance of Veterans Day.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Fear and Greed index  hovered in “fear” after trading in “extreme fear” last week. While the Nasdaq pulled back on Tuesday, some investors expect the rally to continue.\n \n\n   \n  “The Federal Reserve’s policy easing, robust corporate profits, and strong AI spending have been the key market drivers, in our view, and they should continue to support the equity rally,” Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS, said in a note.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/secret-lives-mormon-wives-season-3","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:32:00Z","title":"Strap in because ‘The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives’ is bringing even more drama this season","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Season 3 of 'The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives' returns with heightened drama, featuring ongoing personal conflicts, new allegations of infidelity involving Jessi Ngatikaura and Demi Engemann, and the public transition of Taylor Frankie Paul to the 'Bachelorette' show.

Strap in because ‘The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives’ is bringing even more drama this season \n       \n  By Lisa Respers France, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:32 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Things are heating up again in Utah.\n \n\n   \n  “The  Secret Lives of Mormon Wives ” is returning for its third season, which unfolds in some different locations (no spoilers here) but lacks absolutely no drama as the women try to balance personal relationships, work opportunities and the unique dynamics of being reality stars.\n \n\n   \n  The series began in 2024 thanks to Taylor Frankie Paul, who found scandal in 2022, when she announced via TikTok that she was getting divorced after she said she violated the terms of her open marriage. She also shared that she and her now ex-husband Tate had participated in “soft swinging” with other couples in their Utah community, which involved trading sexual partners in their social circle.\n \n\n   \n  Paul is credited with forming “MomTok” by pulling together a group of fellow Mormon mothers on TikTok. Many of the members have millions of followers, sharing glimpses into their lives for lucrative sponsorships.\n \n\n   \n  The first season of “Mormon Wives” last year focused on the fallout from Paul’s scandalous revelation, as well as her subsequent pregnancy with boyfriend Dakota Mortensen, with whom she became involved while married.\n \n\n   \n  Fast forward Season 3, and lots has changed as viewers witnessed the toxicity between Paul and Mortensen over the past two seasons and the recent announcement that she  is the next Bachelorette. \n \n\n   \n  Paul’s fellow cast members Layla Taylor and Miranda McWhorter offered support in her attempt to find love on another reality show.\n \n\n   \n  “I think Taylor deserves to find an actual pure example of love in somebody that respects her in and out of the room that she’s in,” Taylor said. “I feel like Taylor’s (Frankie Paul) just deserving of that. So we’re excited. We’re so excited.”\n \n\n   \n  McWhorter agreed, which means something as she and her now ex-husband Chase were a big part of the “soft swinging” scandal that kicked the show off. She told CNN, “You gotta be okay with whatever skeletons you got in that closet coming out.”\n \n\n   \n  “You have to authentic and open and real about everything. I think the more reserved you are this might not be for you. And it’s hard,” McWhorter said. “This is a hard world to be in. You have people that are judging you off of how you handle situations, off of how you operate. And it’s hard because people are only seeing such small glimpses into who you are as a person.”\n \n\n   \n  New “Bachelorette” Paul is not the only one who has gotten a reality crossover.\n \n\n   \n  Cast members Jennifer Affleck and Whitney Leavitt were selected to compete on the most recent season of “Dancing With the Stars.”\n \n\n   \n  Affleck spoke with CNN soon after she was eliminated from the dance competition.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s definitely a different vibe and it’s a different hard because with the ‘Secret Lives’ it can be very draining in the sense that there’s a lot of drama and it’s uncomfortable in that sense,” Affleck said. “But ‘Dancing With the Stars’ is uncomfortable in the sense that it’s not only mentally demanding, but also it’s very physical.”\n \n\n   \n  She said she loved how positive “DWTS” was because “everyone tries to stray away from drama and that was kind of nice for me to be able to be on a reality TV show that doesn’t fixate on drama.”\n \n\n   \n  Season 3 also includes the heightened drama of finding out what really happened regarding allegations of Jessi Ngatikaura being unfaithful to her husband and the unraveling of her and some of the other women’s relationship with Demi Engemann, who has had tension with more than a few of them.\n \n\n   \n  Ngatikaura admitted to having “all the emotions” about her personal life playing out on air.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m nervous clearly, because it’s a big story to share and I have no idea what the opinions will be,” she told CNN. “But I’m also relieved that it’ll be out there because it’s kind of been like a secret and no one’s known my dynamic and what happened in my relationship.”\n \n\n   \n  “So at least it’ll be out there and I can talk about it openly, but I have no idea what the audience is going to feel,” she added.\n \n\n   \n  Season 3 of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” debuts Thursday on Hulu.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/world/blast-islamabad-pakistan-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:42:00Z","title":"At least 12 killed in Islamabad suicide attack – the most deadly assault in the Pakistani capital since 2008","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A suicide bombing in Islamabad’s judicial district killed 12 people and injured over 20, marking the deadliest such attack in the capital since 2008.

Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harboring the TTP.\n \n\n   \n  Without providing evidence, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif foisted blame upon “Indian terrorist proxies” on Tuesday, claiming that other recent militant attacks in the country were “being carried out from Afghan soil and backed by India.”\n \n\n   \n  Delhi rejected “the baseless and unfounded allegations” in a statement on Tuesday, accusing Islamabad of fomenting “desperate diversionary ploys.”\n \n\n   \n  “It is a predictable tactic by Pakistan to concoct false narratives against India in order to deflect the attention of its own public from the ongoing military-inspired constitutional subversion and power-grab unfolding within the country,” added India’s foreign ministry.\n \n\n   \n  The comments come months after India and Pakistan engaged in the most intense fighting in decades, which saw four days of escalating conflict in May that included fighter jets, missiles, and drones packed with explosives.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I saw 40 people fall immediately’\n \n\n   \n  Manzar Abbas lay on a red and white hospital bed in Islamabad on Tuesday, his bloodied leg strapped with a thick bandage.\n \n\n   \n  The 32-year-old PhD student was near a police station close to the courts, when tens of residents immediately hit the ground following the blast. Then, in a split second, a security guard helped him get to hospital.\n \n\n   \n  “When I was passing the police station close to the courts, I saw the police car pass me and I saw a man go towards it wearing his jacket,” Abbas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw about 40 people fall immediately,” he added. “I had been hit as well and bled a lot. But thank goodness I was saved.”\n \n\n   \n  Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif stated on X that Pakistan is in a “state of war” and that this attack should be taken as a “wake-up call” with regards to negotiations with neighboring Afghanistan.\n \n\n   \n  “The rulers of Kabul can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but bringing this war all the way to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which—praise be to God—Pakistan has the full strength to respond,” the Pakistani defense minister added.\n \n\n   \n  The Afghan Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement expressing “deep sorrow and condemnation” regarding both the attack in Islamabad as well as the attack on the cadet college in the country’s northwest. The statement from Afghanistan did not address the remarks of Pakistan’s defence minister.\n \n\n   \n  Both the embassies of China and the United States condemned the attack. The US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker said in a statement that “the United States stands in solidarity with Pakistan in the struggle against terrorism.” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres extended his condolences to the victims’ families and called for a full investigation, his spokesman said.\n \n\n   \n  Clashes between the Pakistani and Afghan militaries in October saw the worst violence between the two countries in years.\n \n\n   \n  An attempt to maintain a ceasefire fell apart when peace talks between the two neighbors failed in Istanbul last week following the failure to establish a long-term deal regarding hostile militant groups in Afghanistan that operate against Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n  The explosion came  less than a day after militants attacked a cadet college in northwestern Pakistan.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/trump-economy-biden-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:17:00-05:00","title":"Trump’s flailing on the economy is worse than Biden’s","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s recent economic remarks—such as claiming inflation is a 'con job by Democrats' and that polling is 'fake'—are more dismissive and factually incorrect than former President Joe Biden’s earlier misjudgments about inflation.

Biden’s \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:17 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n   President Donald Trump’s  recent commentary on the economy is drawing plenty of comparisons to then-President Joe Biden’s.\n \n\n   \n  In his most dismissive remarks on the topic to date, Trump ratcheted up his downplaying of Americans’ affordability concerns in a  Fox News interview  on Monday. He even called them a “con job by Democrats” and said the “polls are fake.”\n \n\n   \n  Four years ago, Biden and his administration made a series of wayward predictions and comments about just how significant a problem inflation would prove to be. And they wound up paying a significant political price for their economic Pollyanna act.\n \n\n   \n  But the situations aren’t that analogous.\n \n\n   \n  In fact, Trump has gone much further in his attempts to bury his head in the sand. And he seems to have a bigger problem politically speaking, for several reasons.\n \n\n   \n  No, the economy isn’t necessarily worse under Trump than it was under Biden. But Trump seems to have turned it into a bigger political liability.\n \n\n   \n  The Biden administration’s sins on this front were largely in its failure to recognize or convey how stubborn a problem inflation would be. Administration officials repeatedly and infamously used words like “transitory,” suggesting the problem would soon go away.\n \n\n   \n  “We also know that as our economy has come roaring back, we’ve seen some price increases,” Biden  said in July 2021 . “Some folks have raised worries that could be a sign of persistent inflation. But that’s not our view.”\n \n\n   \n  Their view was wrong. The annual inflation rate climbed from about 5% when Biden made those remarks all the way over 9% about a year later. In the intervening months, the administration effectively  acknowledged its error .\n \n\n   \n  Trump, by contrast, isn’t just downplaying inflation or donning glasses that seem a couple of shades too rosy; he’s pretending the problem simply doesn’t exist.\n \n\n   \n  That escalated Monday when he was pressed by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on whether Americans were right to be feeling the economic pinch. Trump basically suggested it was much ado about nothing.\n \n\n   \n  “More than anything else, it’s a con job by the Democrats,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  When Ingraham pointed to polls that show Americans are quite anxious about the economy, the president responded: “I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN’s Daniel Dale wrote a good rundown Monday of Trump’s  nonstop string of lies  about this subject – lies that he repeated in the same Fox interview even as he accused others of misinformation. Trump has misstated a bevy of economic data points, including on inflation, grocery prices, energy prices and prescription drug prices. He keeps saying things like that there is no inflation or that grocery prices are down.\n \n\n   \n  (Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, claimed Monday when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that Trump merely meant  inflation  was down, rather than prices. But that’s not what Trump has said. And as Dale notes, inflation is not down.)\n \n\n   \n  Biden’s gamble was that his and his administration’s predictions could turn out to be wrong, which they did.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s gamble is that if he can’t convince people of his alternate version of reality, he risks looking completely out of touch.\n \n\n   \n  Which brings us to the other major difference with Biden.\n \n\n   \n  There is no question that inflation and the economy were political problems for the Democratic president; they likely helped deliver Trump the White House in 2024. But they appear to be even bigger political problems for Trump now.\n \n\n   \n  That’s because people are more likely to tie economic problems to Trump, specifically.\n \n\n   \n  A number of recent polls have shown this:\n \n\n   \n  And despite Trump’s and his administration’s attempts to blame Biden for continuing economic pains, polls suggest Americans aren’t about to buy into that.\n \n\n   \n  A  Reuters-Ipsos poll  as far back as May showed that if the country were to fall into a recession, 59% of Americans would blame Trump, versus just 37% who would blame Biden.\n \n\n   \n  So why might Americans be more likely to attach economic pains to Trump than they did to Biden?\n \n\n   \n  There are a number of possible reasons.\n \n\n   \n  One is that Trump  pledged over and over to bring prices down quickly , and he clearly hasn’t done that.\n \n\n   \n  Another is that Biden might have benefited from Americans blaming at least some of the economic problems on the Covid-19 pandemic – which rocked the economy worldwide – rather than his policies.\n \n\n   \n  Another could be that Trump voluntarily took ownership of an already dicey economy by launching tariffs very early in his second term.\n \n\n   \n  But arguably the biggest reason is that Americans just haven’t seen Trump take on this issue head-on. CBS polling shows as many 75% of Americans say the Trump administration has focused “not enough” on lowering prices. That includes 57% of Republicans.\n \n\n   \n  (At least Biden was doing things like getting Congress to pass a bill called the “Inflation Reduction Act” – regardless of whether it actually helped with inflation.)\n \n\n   \n  One way for Trump to respond to this data would be to double down on making affordability his focus. Another is to pretend 75% of Americans simply don’t know what they’re talking about or that the number is “fake.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has apparently chosen the latter. It’s difficult to see how those around him would see it as their best option.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/new-delhi-explosion-red-fort-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:29:00-05:00","title":"India on Edge After Deadly Car Explosion in Capital Region","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A deadly car explosion occurred near India’s historic Red Fort in Delhi on November 11, 2025, killing at least 10 people and injuring over 30 others.

The area, a major tourist hub known for its crowded bazaars and street vendors, was immediately thrown into chaos.\n \n\n   \n  The incident, a rare occurrence for the sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million people, unleashed a scene of devastation in the heart of Delhi.\n \n\n   \n  Footage of the aftermath showed thick, orange flames billowing into the pitch-black sky, vehicles twisted and charred from the blast and victims strewn across the street.\n \n\n   \n  The cause of the blast is not yet known, and the Indian government has yet to blame any specific group. Comments from top government officials on Tuesday have begun to suggest the act was a deliberate one.\n \n\n   \n  Speaking from Bhutan, where he is on a visit, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the “horrific incident” in Delhi “has deeply saddened everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  “I was in touch with all the agencies investigating this incident throughout last night. Our agencies will get to the bottom of this conspiracy,” he said in Hindi, before breaking out into English: “All those responsible will be brought to justice.”\n \n\n   \n  India’s defense minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the “findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  “I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice and will not be spared under any circumstances,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  More than 30 other people were “badly injured” in the blast, said Dr. Manish Kumar Jha, a physician at the local Lok Nayak Hospital. “Many are not in a position of recovering,” he told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  The National Investigation Agency (NIA), India’s principal counter-terrorism law enforcement agency, is now handling the case.\n \n\n   \n    What happened?\n \n\n   \n  Before the explosion, a “slow-moving” vehicle “came to a stop” near a red light around 6:42 p.m. local time, Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters.\n \n\n   \n  “An explosion occurred in that vehicle. The passengers in the vehicle and people in surrounding vehicles were impacted,” Golcha said.\n \n\n   \n  At least six vehicles and three autorickshaws were set on fire, Reuters reported, citing Delhi’s deputy fire chief.\n \n\n   \n  Emergency crews then arrived at the scene and extinguished the blaze – after receiving a call at 6:55 p.m. local time, Sumit Kumar, a Delhi fire services official, told CNN. Survivors were taken to a nearby hospital.\n \n\n   \n  Residents recalled hearing a loud bang in the neighborhood.\n \n\n   \n  “We heard a big sound.

The US embassy in New Delhi is advising Americans to avoid the surrounding area as well as large crowds.\n \n\n   \n  The states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which neighbors Delhi, has also been put on high alert, according to police.\n \n\n   \n  Security arrangements “of important establishments, religious sites, crowded places, and other sensitive points” will be reviewed, Uttar Pradesh police  wrote  on X. The state, India’s most populous, is home to the Taj Mahal and other major tourist attractions.\n \n\n   \n  Haryana’s head of police, OP Singh, urged residents to “remain calm” and report any “suspicious person or unclaimed object” in a  post  on X.\n \n\n   \n  The northwestern state of Rajasthan is also on high alert, its police department  said  on X.\n \n\n   \n  In the financial capital of Mumbai, train stations have been put on high alert, Reuters reported, citing authorities.\n \n\n   \n    Historic monument\n \n\n   \n  The Red Fort stands as one of India’s most significant historical landmarks.\n \n\n   \n  Originally built by Emperor Shah Jahan as the palace-fort of his capital, it served as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.

Chris Dolce\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:06 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Record cold temperatures have pushed as far south as Florida this morning as wind-whipped snow continues to pile up in the eastern Great Lakes from a brief bout of Arctic air gripping the eastern US.\n \n\n   \n  More than two dozen cities, reaching as far south as Fort Myers, Miami and Naples, Florida, toppled or tied daily record lows for November 11.\n \n\n   \n  This morning is the coldest so early in the fall since 1976 in Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia, with both locations dropping to a shivering 28 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  The cold is causing South Florida’s cold-blooded iguanas to “freeze,” or lose muscle control. They can sometimes fall out of trees as a result, which some Floridians saw Tuesday morning. The iguanas are not dead, but rather in a paralyzed state and can revive if temperatures warm up fast enough.\n \n\n   \n  Cold conditions farther north have kicked the lake-effect snow machine into gear across the Great Lakes for the first time this year. Snow will contribute to dangerous travel conditions on Tuesday in the snow belts of northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and western New York.\n \n\n   \n  The heaviest snow has come to an end in the western Great Lakes. Up to a foot of snow fell more than 50 miles south of Chicago, and totals north of the city from far northeast Illinois into southeast Wisconsin topped 10 inches. Dangerous travel conditions from snow and strong winds were reported early Monday along Interstate 57 south of Chicago in Kankakee and northern Iroquois counties in Illinois, the  National Weather Service said. \n \n\n   \n  Chicago only picked up 1 to 3 inches of snow, which was accompanied by thunder and strong winds Sunday night into early Monday. Forecasts for the city on Sunday called for potentially historic November snow totals over 10 inches, but the heaviest bands of snow spared the downtown area from those kinds of totals.\n \n\n   \n  Lake-effect snow totals  often swing wildly from location to location  depending on where heavier bands develop because of how narrow they are. That’s what happened Monday near Lake Michigan.\n \n\n   \n  Elsewhere, over a foot of snow fell in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and northwest Indiana from Sunday into Monday.\n \n\n   \n  Several inches of snow have also piled up in the Appalachians from West Virginia to the border between North Carolina and Tennessee since Monday. Knoxville, Tennessee, saw its earliest accumulating snow since 1996 on Monday,  according to the National Weather Service . Snowflakes have flown through the air as far south as the Atlanta metro area on Monday, and along the North Carolina coast in Wilmington on Tuesday morning.\n \n\n   \n    A temperature turnaround is ahead\n \n\n   \n  The good news: This cold snap won’t stick around long.\n \n\n   \n  Temperatures across the central and southern US will rebound quickly in the second half of this week as Arctic air releases its grip and warmer winds from out of the south return. Highs will be as much as 10 to 25 degrees above average from the Plains into the Midwest by Friday and Saturday.\n \n\n   \n  A few cities in the Midwest that just saw their first snowflakes of the season could flirt with daily record high temperatures on Saturday.

CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:45 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi, who has been held by US federal immigration for over two weeks, is set to be released and allowed to return to the UK.\n \n\n   \n  The London-based journalist and commentator, who was visiting the United States on a speaking tour,  was detained  by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last month as he went through San Francisco International Airport.\n \n\n   \n  Authorities told Hamdi he was being held after overstaying his US visa. But Muslim advocacy groups say that his visa was revoked during his trip without cause or prior notice. Hamdi’s family believe his public criticism of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories was the real reason behind the decision.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said Hamdi had opted to accept a US government offer to leave the country voluntarily.\n \n\n   \n  “The government has agreed to release Sami,” Hamdi’s family said in a statement posted on social media Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”\n \n\n   \n  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Hamdi had voluntarily requested removal from the US and ICE was “happily arranging his removal from this country” in a statement Monday. McLaughlin characterized Hamdi as “an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer” and said “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”\n \n\n   \n  ICE records show Hamdi was still in custody in California Monday afternoon. He was detained on October 26, a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.\n \n\n   \n  CAIR’s California chapter and Hamdi’s lawyer on Monday welcomed the US decision to release the British national.\n \n\n   \n  “This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said she was optimistic her husband would be home before the end of the week.\n \n\n   \n  “We as a family are enormously relieved that our beloved Sami will soon be returning home, after the US government agreed to release him voluntarily, with no order of deportation and no allegations,” she told CNN on Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is known for his analysis on developments in the Middle East and appearances on British TV.  He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.\n \n\n   \n  At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”\n \n\n   \n  “People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said on Monday. “His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”\n \n\n   \n  Hamdi is one of the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student  Momodou Taal  had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen has accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the Israel-Hamas war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/business/mega-millions-billion-dollar-jackpot","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:03:00Z","title":"Mega Millions jackpot soars to $900 million, 8th-largest in game’s history","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Mega Millions jackpot has surged to $900 million, the eighth-largest in the game’s history, with winners able to claim either a $415.3 million lump sum or a 30-year annuity with annual 5% increases.

The team just fired the embattled GM \n       \n  By Kyle Feldscher, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:33 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Dallas Mavericks fired general manager Nico Harrison on Tuesday, dismissing  the man who traded away fan-favorite Luka Dončić  in one of the most shocking NBA trades in recent memory.\n \n\n   \n  Mavs fans essentially rebelled against Harrison in the months after the early February trade, chanting, “Fire Nico!” at every opportunity. Harrison became something akin to Public Enemy No. 1 in Dallas, even after lucking into the top pick in the 2025 NBA Draft and drafting Duke star Cooper Flagg.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to fans, owner Patrick Dumont said the current state of the organization is not in line with the expectations fans have set for the Mavs.\n \n\n   \n  “No one associated with the Mavericks organization is happy with the start of what we all believed would be a promising season,” Dumont wrote. “You have high expectations for the Mavericks, and I share them with you. When the results don’t meet expectations, it’s my responsibility to act. I’ve made the decision to part ways with General Manager Nico Harrison.”\n \n\n   \n  He added, “I know our players are deeply committed to a winning culture, this decision was critical to moving our franchise forward in a positive direction.”\n \n\n   \n  The organization announced Michael Finley and Matt Riccardi will serve as co-interim general managers while a permanent replacement is sought.\n \n\n   \n  The Dončić trade ended up ushering in one of the bleakest stretches for any NBA team in recent memory.  On February 1,  the Mavericks sent Dončić, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris to the Lakers for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and the Lakers’ 2029 first-round draft pick.\n \n\n   \n   In the period after the deal , the Mavericks went 14-21, lost Anthony Davis – the main player Dallas received in return for Dončić – for weeks due to injury in his first game with the team, lost talisman Kyrie Irving to a season-ending ACL injury and watched a slew of other players go down hurt. Davis returned as the Mavs tried to win a spot in the NBA playoffs through the play-in round but ultimately fell short.\n \n\n   \n  During that entire time, the fans demanded Harrison be fired and pundits declared that the Mavericks had just made a potentially franchise killing move. Dončić is just 26 years old, led the team to the NBA Finals in the 2023-24 season, had been named All-NBA each year he had been in the league and was entering his prime. All reporting around the deal indicated that Dončić never planned to leave Dallas, and his emotional return to Texas in  April indicated that the pain of the surprise move still pained him.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old  told ESPN  that he threw and cracked his phone when he first heard about the trade, adding that he felt “sadness mostly” and that he “felt like my heart was broken, honestly.”\n \n\n   \n   In his end-of-season news conference,  Harrison said he was surprised by the city’s depth of feeling for Dončić.\n \n\n   \n  “I did know that Luka was important to the fanbase,” Harrison told reporters during his season-ending news conference. “I didn’t quite know to what level.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Harrison remained staunch in his belief that Dallas has the makings of a winning team despite the trade and fan backlash.\n \n\n   \n  “We feel that’s a championship-caliber team and we would have been winning at a high level and that would have quieted some of the outrage,” Harrison said, adding that being healthy is the only thing keeping the team from challenging for a title. “And so unfortunately we weren’t able to do that, so it just continued to go on and on.”\n \n\n   \n  But how the franchise handled the Dončić trade and its immediate aftermath sealed Harrison’s fate in the minds of many Mavs fans.\n \n\n   \n  One of the things that particularly irked fans was a report after the trade that slammed Dončić’s conditioning, with  ESPN  citing sources inside the franchise revealing frustration with his diet. The treatment of a player who was widely revered as an icon in Dallas, especially less than a year after an NBA Finals appearance, went over like a ton of bricks.\n \n\n   \n  “Everyone wants to point at Luka’s flaws, at least for a half-second,” Mavs fan Matthew Slovak told CNN. “The overwhelming narrative is that this is the most ridiculous thing ever, but there was that, ‘Yeah, but.’ There is no ‘yeah, but.’ – this is the most indefensible trade of all time.”\n \n\n   \n  In his letter, Dumont emphasized that he understood the frustrations of the fans.\n \n\n   \n  “I understand the profound impact these difficult last several months have had. Please know that I’m fully committed to the success of the Mavericks,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “Thank you for your support, thank you for holding us accountable, and thank you for your passion and for your patience. You deserve transparency and a team that reflects your spirit. Our goal is to return winning basketball to Dallas and win championships. Our family is committed to that mission and to continuing to invest in Dallas and the Mavericks’ future.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ben Morse and Andy Scholes contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/media/laura-ingraham-trump-fox-news-interview-maga","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:38:00-05:00","title":"‘MAGA backlash’: Laura Ingraham challenged Trump in a way few Fox hosts ever do","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Laura Ingraham, a prominent Fox News host, challenged President Trump during a recent interview by directly questioning key policy proposals, including economic perceptions, the government shutdown, and student visa plans for Chinese students.

On Monday, she sat down with Trump and scrutinized several of his policy proposals, channeling dissension within the pro-Trump ranks — and seemingly catching the president off guard.\n \n\n   \n  Sounding skeptical of Trump’s “costs are way down” defensiveness, the conservative Fox host asked, “Are you saying voters are misperceiving how they feel?”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham also asked about his stance on the government shutdown, his demolition of the East Wing, and his understanding of Christianity.\n \n\n   \n  After she brought up two issues of particular concern to her MAGA media allies, Trump said, “Don’t forget, MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else’s idea. I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else, and MAGA wants to see our country thrive.”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham’s approach was in keeping with the tone of her nightly Fox show: She often tries to steer Trump in what she believes is a more productive, ultimately politically successful direction.\n \n\n   \n  When Trump was elected in 2016, Ingraham held talks about becoming his press secretary, but she insisted on having a seat at the policymaking table as well. The transition team couldn’t agree on how to make room for her, and Sean Spicer was hired as press secretary instead.\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham has arguably been more influential on the outside, nudging Trump via the television, and occasionally in person.\n \n\n   \n  During Monday’s interview, when Trump tried to downplay the impacts of recent air travel chaos, she interjected: “There are a lot of delays now, sir.”\n \n\n   \n  She generally framed her questions in a positive light for the president, while still conveying the concerns of Republican voters.\n \n\n   \n  For instance, Ingraham brought up voter anxiety about affordability, as seen in last week’s off-year election results. “I know you’ve been all over” the issue, she said, and some prices are “way down,” but “other things, as you noted, have gone up.”\n \n\n   \n  “Is this a voter perception issue of the economy,” she asked, “or is there more that needs to be done by Republicans on Capitol Hill or done in terms of policy?”\n \n\n   \n  Trump suggested a perception problem, saying, “More than anything else, it’s a con job by the Democrats.”\n \n\n   \n  But Ingraham wasn’t buying it. She said Joe Biden was criticized — including by Trump — for “saying things were great, and things weren’t great.”\n \n\n   \n  A little bit later on, she directly asked, “Why are people saying they’re anxious about the economy? Why are they saying that?” Trump rejected the premise of the question.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t know that they are” saying that, the president claimed. “I think polls are fake. We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump also waved off Ingraham’s critical question about a recent proposal by Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte for 50-year mortgages.\n \n\n   \n  This idea “has enraged your MAGA friends,” Ingraham pointed out, describing the “significant MAGA backlash” from people who are “calling it a giveaway to the banks and simply prolonging the time it would take for Americans to own a home outright.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump didn’t want to hear it. Of the 50-year mortgage proposal, he said, “it’s not even a big deal. I mean, you know, you go from 40 to 50 years and—”\n \n\n   \n  Ingraham corrected him: From “30 to 50” years.\n \n\n   \n  “All it means is, you pay less per month, you pay it over a longer period of time,” Trump said. “It’s not like a big factor. It might help a little bit, but the problem was that Biden did this.”\n \n\n   \n  Then Trump went on to bash Biden some more.\n \n\n   \n  However, Ingraham was more interested in hearing the current president’s views about contentious topics.\n \n\n   \n  She broached conservative disdain for American colleges and universities and said “a lot of MAGA folks, um, are not thrilled about this idea of hundreds of thousands of foreign students in the United States.”\n \n\n   \n  The Fox host specifically raised Trump’s plan to grant student visas for 600,000 Chinese college students, which Trump has justified as a business transaction.\n \n\n   \n  “I know you and I disagree” on this, he said to Ingraham. “We’re never gonna agree on it.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/reopen-federal-government-next-steps","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:06:00-05:00","title":"The Senate sent a funding bill to the House.

Here’s what has to happen next to reopen the government \n       \n  By Annie Grayer, Sarah Ferris, Ellis Kim, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        12:06 PM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senators have  approved a funding package  to reopen the federal government, sending the compromise deal to their colleagues in the House.\n \n\n   \n  Centrist Senate Democrats struck a deal over the weekend with Republicans to move forward the package, without securing their party’s demand to guarantee an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which help millions of Americans afford health insurance. Ultimately,  eight members  of the Democratic caucus crossed lines to move a step closer to breaking the stalemate on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  Now, the focus is on the House, where GOP leaders believe lawmakers will end the stalemate this week.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what still needs to happen on Capitol Hill to reopen the federal government.\n \n\n   \n    It’s the House’s turn\n \n\n   \n  The Senate-passed package would fund the government until January 30 and some key agencies through t﻿he remainder of fiscal year 2026. So that means if the government were to shut down again over the next few months, key federal food assistance known as SNAP would continue to be funded.\n \n\n   \n  House Speaker Mike Johnson has to sell this package to his razor-thin GOP majority, and he’ll likely need the president’s help.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson told his members Monday to start making their way back to Washington and put them on 36-hour vote notice after the Senate passed the continuing resolution, or CR, to fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m stating the obvious: All my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible,” the Republican leader said Monday.\n \n\n   \n    When will the House vote?\n \n\n   \n  The House plans to begin voting on the Senate-passed bill to reopen the federal government on Wednesday, according to a notice from Majority Whip Tom Emmer.\n \n\n   \n  The vote will take place as early as 4 p.m., per the notice, which forecasts multiple votes that day.\n \n\n   \n  On Tuesday, the House Rules Committee is expected to consider the Senate package to set up floor activity on Wednesday.\n \n\n   \n  The House hasn’t voted or been in legislative session since September 19.\n \n\n   \n    Who are the lawmakers to watch?\n \n\n   \n  Johnson will have to work closely with the White House to muscle this deal through the House, given it is unclear how many Democrats will cross over to support the package and Republicans hold such a narrow majority.\n \n\n   \n  Fourteen moderate House Republicans had wanted to see the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies extended and had their  own bill   to address the issue at the center of the shutdown fight.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, House Democratic leadership is actively working to prevent rank-and-file members from voting for this bill because they say it falls short of what Democrats fought for during the shutdown. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who is not seeking reelection and has been known to vote with Republicans, is among those to watch.\n \n\n   \n    What are House Democratic leaders saying?\n \n\n   \n  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats’ health care demands.\n \n\n   \n  Jeffries and his team hope to limit the number of Democrats who support the plan, which will maximize pressure on House Republicans to land the votes themselves. And House Democratic leaders are officially whipping against the Senate funding compromise, according to two sources familiar with the plans.\n \n\n   \n  The House Democratic leader reiterated to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that Democrats will “strongly oppose any legislation that does not decisively address the Republican health care crisis.”\n \n\n   \n  “We want to reopen the government. We’ll continue to stand by our hardworking federal employees and civil servants. But we have a responsibility to make sure that we extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits so that tens of millions of Americans don’t experience dramatically increased health care costs that’s going to prevent them from being able to see a doctor when they need one,” Jeffries said on “The Situation Room.”\n \n\n   \n    Does the government open as soon as the House passes the bill?\n \n\n   \n  Not quite yet.\n \n\n   \n  Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.\n \n\n   \n    What does Trump think of the bill?\n \n\n   \n  The White House has already endorsed the Senate plan to reopen the government, calling the funding deal a “positive development” toward ending the record-long shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  “President Trump has wanted the government reopened since the first day Democrats shut it down,” a White House official said in a statement. “The action in the Senate is a positive development and we look forward to seeing it progress.”\n \n\n   \n  And adding to expectation that Trump will sign the measure, the president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I would say so,” when asked whether he personally approved of the deal making its way through Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, based on everything I’m hearing, they haven’t changed anything, and we have support from enough Democrats, and we’re going to be opening up our country,” Trump said Monday. “It’s too bad it was closed, but we’ll be opening up our country very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n    What’s in the funding package?\n \n\n   \n  The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap measure through January 30.\n \n\n   \n  The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture.\n \n\n   \n  That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.\n \n\n   \n  The package does not include a guarantee from Republicans to extend the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.\n \n\n   \n  As part of the deal struck between Republicans and the Senate Democratic centrists, there’s expected to be a future Senate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump’s  increasing opposition  in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.\n \n\n   \n  The deal also includes an agreement to reverse the federal firings during the shutdown and ensure that all federal workers get paid what they were owed during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n   This headline and story have been updated with additional developments. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-inflation-us-tension-intl-latam","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"12:15:00-05:00","title":"Amid tensions with US, high inflation is back on Venezuela’s streets","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela is facing a severe economic crisis marked by skyrocketing inflation—projected to exceed 600% by 2026—driven by a 70% depreciation of the bolivar against the US dollar.

He referred to the Venezuelan currency and to the pre-cooked flour used to make  arepas,  the ubiquitous corn pancakes that are a daily staple.\n \n\n   \n  In the three months since the Pentagon deployed warships and aircraft in a campaign that the White House said was aimed at drug traffickers from Venezuela, the bolivar has depreciated around 70% against the US dollar, according to data from the central bank, hemorrhaging one point every day.\n \n\n   \n  In the illegal but widely used currency black market, the drop has been just as steep. At the official rate, the US dollar is pegged at about 231 Venezuelan bolivars. On the black market, a dollar is worth roughly a third more. The Venezuelan government prohibits publishing black market exchange rates.\n \n\n   \n  The surge in inflation is linked – although only partially – with the growing tensions between the Trump administration and the Maduro government, which has been under US Treasury Department sanctions for almost a decade.\n \n\n   \n  Maduro has accused the United States of seeking to oust him after more than 12 years in power and one year after he controversially claimed to win a presidential election that many international observers accused him of stealing.\n \n\n   \n  While a military attack on Venezuelan soil may not materialize, the economic outlook is firmly in the red once again, after a change of policies gave the country a much-needed boost in the years immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \n\n   \n  Only last year, Maduro boasted about the results of those reforms, claiming his country’s GDP was growing at 8% and that inflation was at the lowest rate in four decades. The autocratic leader no longer makes such claims.\n \n\n   \n  According to the United Nations, Venezuela historically does not produce enough food to meet its needs, and many products must be imported from abroad and paid for in foreign currencies.\n \n\n   \n  This also means the market is particularly exposed when the bolivar loses value.\n \n\n   \n  For many Venezuelans, still reeling from years of hyper-inflation before the pandemic lockdowns, the new price hikes revive a familiar nightmare.\n \n\n   \n  “Not many people are purchasing these days. Those who can try to buy as little as possible,” said Marjorie Yanez, 40, a street-food seller in Caracas. “Dollars get more expensive every day, and that is bad for retailers like us because we also must raise our prices every day.”\n \n\n   \n  A typical breakfast of croissant and  café con leche  now can easily cost the equivalent of $8 to $10 at a bakery in Caracas, while the country’s official minimum wage is less than a dollar a month.\n \n\n   \n  The stream of remittances from relatives abroad, a consequence of more than 7 million Venezuelans fleeing the country under Maduro to look for better opportunities elsewhere, is also falling short.\n \n\n   \n  “I had to increase how much I send back to my parents every month, but even with that, it’s not enough. They can barely make ends meet,” said Diego Mejias, 35, an architect in neighboring Colombia who provides for his parents in Caracas.\n \n\n   \n    War on inflation, one detention at a time\n \n\n   \n  The central bank stopped publishing inflation reports in October last year, when the country had managed to keep the rate at single digits for 20 straight months.\n \n\n   \n  Shortly afterward, things began to unravel.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Venezuelan security forces briefly detained several economists, including former finance minister Rodrigo Cabezas, for sharing pessimistic views. The interior minister called their comments destabilizing. Critics denounced the arrests as baseless.\n \n\n   \n  The economists were later released, but publishing economic figures remains taboo.\n \n\n   \n  For this report, CNN spoke with two private consultants who have access to reliable economic data. Both spoke anonymously for fear of government retaliation.\n \n\n   \n  CNN has also contacted Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who is in charge of Venezuela’s finances, and is waiting for a response.\n \n\n   \n  Both consultants estimated that inflation in Caracas is currently running between 20% and 30% a month and is destined to keep rising as long as the bolivar depreciation continues.\n \n\n   \n  Prices are slightly cheaper outside the capital in regions such as Tachira or Zulia, closer to the Colombian border, where many imported products cross into Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  Faced with the economic malaise, the government has cracked down on the black market for US dollars. In June, Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced the detention of 58 people on charges of “manipulating exchange rates.” Authorities also seized a dozen web pages advertising the sale of dollars and euros at rates different from the official one by the central bank.\n \n\n   \n  The moves have done little to stop the bolivar’s fall.\n \n\n   \n    Several causes\n \n\n   \n  Last month, the International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s annual inflation at about 270%, the highest in the world and a sharp increase from the 180% rate it estimated in April.\n \n\n   \n  For 2026, the outlook is even bleaker. The IMF forecasts Venezuela’s inflation to top 600% by next October.\n \n\n   \n  The bolivar’s plunge can be partially explained by the US military’s show of force, as nervous Venezuelans seek to purchase hard currency as a hedge against an uncertain future. But that is only one of the causes, the consultants told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  US sanctions against the Venezuelan oil sector, which is the nation’s largest source of foreign exchange by far, are also partially to blame.\n \n\n   \n  In July, the Trump administration renegotiated a license authorizing Chevron, a major US oil company, to export Venezuelan crude. Under the new terms of the license, Chevron was authorized to pay fees and royalties to Venezuela in oil but not in cash, effectively reducing Chevron’s crude exports from the country by half, according to Reuters.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Chevron said the company “operates globally in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its business, as well as the sanctions frameworks provided for by the US government, including in Venezuela.”\n \n\n   \n  The change has proved costly because Venezuela lost one of its few remaining sources of legitimate income. As a result, the government is now forced to sell even more oil on the black market at a discount to evade US government sanctions, one of the economists in Caracas told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    The future is crypto\n \n\n   \n  To make up for the missing income, the government recently allowed private companies to sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for the depreciated bolivar, with exchange houses openly supported by a new crypto-managing regulator, the National Superintendence of Crypto Assets, known as Sunacrip.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, Reuters reported that the government was preparing to increase usage of crypto assets in its oil exports to overcome the US sanctions. According to the specialized data collector Chainanalysis, Venezuela is second only to Brazil for crypto adoption rates in Latin America.\n \n\n   \n  Today, thousands of Venezuelans – from corporate bankers to retirees – regularly purchase US dollars on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It is even common to see shoppers at grocery stores trading currencies in the checkout lines.\n \n\n   \n  Not everyone has embraced the new normal. “Sending money to Venezuela has always been a mess,” said Mejias, the architect in Colombia. “Now it’s even more confusing to understand what rate is good and what is not, and for old people like my parents, even more.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/business/sonder-bankruptcy-marriott-deal-ends","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:27:00.000-05:00","title":"Collapse of Sonder, a Marriott-backed hotel chain, leaves guests stranded mid-stay","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sonder, a short-term rental company once valued at $1 billion and seen as a major competitor to Airbnb, collapsed after the sudden termination of its 20-year licensing agreement with Marriott due to severe financial difficulties.

D’Aoust probably didn’t expect his anniversary trip to end early, but he definitely didn’t think he’d have just 15 minutes to vacate his room.\n \n\n   \n  The early ejection wasn’t because of a fire or a fight, but a bankruptcy. Sonder, a short-term rentals company abruptly collapsed over the weekend when its partnership with Marriott ended, leaving many guests stranded mid-stay.\n \n\n   \n  D’Aoust was staying the weekend at a Sonder property in Montréal, Canada, when he got an  email  last Sunday afternoon that he needed to vacate his room by Monday at 9 am. That’s because Sonder’s licensing agreement with Marriott was “no longer in effect.”\n \n\n   \n  “I asked the staff if we could still stay until our checkout at 11 am, but the staff explained he had only received instructions to empty the building ASAP and that unfortunately we only had 10 to 15 minutes,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  D’Aoust is just one of the many travelers affected by Sonder’s shutdown following the sudden end of a deal with Marriott, which had let guests book and earn loyalty points at Sonder’s 9,000 furnished apartments and boutique hotel rooms in 40 cities across 10 countries.\n \n\n   \n  Marriott said in a  statement  Sunday that the planned 20-year licensing agreement had ended because of Sonder’s “default,” a.k.a. financial difficulties.\n \n\n   \n  The 2024 deal should’ve had been a boon for Sonder, which was  once valued at $1 billion  and considered a major Airbnb rival. Sonder sought to strike the sweet spot between a hotel and an Airbnb, offering guests the convenience of an all-digital check-in experience but for smaller properties ideal for solo travelers. However, the Covid-19 pandemic and a rough go in the  public markets  in 2022 ultimately spelled its doom. Sonder was relying on the strength of Marriott’s booking platform to give it a much-needed boost.\n \n\n   \n  Sonder said in a statement Monday that it’s “winding down operations immediately” and entering Chapter 7, a complete liquidation of its business. The company blamed “severe financial constraints arising from, among other things, prolonged challenges in the integration of the company’s systems and booking arrangements with Marriott.”\n \n\n   \n  Stories of guests being stranded mid-stay at Sonder properties are  littered  across social media, mostly putting the blame on Marriott. A Marriott spokesperson told CNN that it’s worked “tirelessly to remain informed about Sonder’s financial situation and develop action plans so that we can work to meet the needs of our guests.”\n \n\n   \n  “Marriott is in communication with guests who have existing reservations at Sonder properties booked on Marriott.com and through other Marriott channels, and we are in contact with third-party platforms to communicate with guests who booked on other channels,” a spokesperson said.\n \n\n   \n  For D’Aoust, that meant an early ending to his weekend away and a two-hour drive back home to Ottawa. But he’s thankful it was just one day lost, and he only missed out on a breakfast reservation.\n \n\n   \n  “I’d imagine it’s a little more stressful for folks that had much longer stays,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/uk/trump-bbc-sue-one-billion-explainer-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:49:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump Threatens to Sue BBC for $1 Billion Over Edited Speech Documentary","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Donald Trump threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over allegations that a documentary titled 'Trump: A Second Chance?' falsely edited a speech he delivered before the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, creating the impression he called for violent action.

the BBC for $1 billion? \n       \n  By Christian Edwards, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:49 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Donald Trump’s assault on the media went global this week, as he threatened to sue the BBC for  $1 billion  over a documentary that his lawyer claimed made “false, defamatory, malicious, disparaging, and inflammatory”  edits  to a speech the US president made before the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  The threat could tip the BBC into a financial abyss and has deepened the worst crisis for the British public broadcaster in recent history, raising questions about its future in a polarized media and political landscape.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you need to know.\n \n\n   \n    What is the scandal about?\n \n\n   \n  In October 2024, days before the US presidential election, the BBC aired a documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, the film gained positive reviews in the UK –  the Guardian praised  it for taking Trump and the MAGA phenomenon seriously – but attracted little attention in the US.\n \n\n   \n  And that’s how it might have remained, had it not been for a now-notorious leaked memo, which – amid a litany of other complaints about BBC output – revealed how in one small section, the documentary had spliced together comments made nearly an hour apart by Trump during his infamous January 6 speech.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump was shown to say.\n \n\n   \n  Trump actually said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  In a  letter  to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over how Trump’s speech was edited, which he conceded “did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    How did the scandal originate?\n \n\n   \n  Last week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a rightwing editorial slant, that has long been hostile to the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  In his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC’s news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights.\n \n\n   \n  He also criticized the “completely misleading” edit of Trump’s speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series “Panorama.” “If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people ‘say’ things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation’s guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Former BBC journalists have criticized the broadcaster for failing to address concerns   about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January.\n \n\n   \n  “They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott’s report,” Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two’s “Newsnight” program until last year, wrote on his  Substack . “It’s a serious mistake, why hadn’t they gripped it sooner?”\n \n\n   \n  Even when The Telegraph’s story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC’s media editor,  reported  Sunday   that a statement on the documentary had been “ready to go for days.” Instead, the BBC board decided to apologize in Shah’s letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah’s letter was published, the BBC reported Trump’s threat to sue.\n \n\n   \n    Have heads rolled?\n \n\n   \n  Yes. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, Davie conceded “there have been some mistakes” for which he had to take “ultimate responsibility,” but stopped short of mentioning the “Panorama” documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself.\n \n\n   \n  Turness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  “The buck stops with me,” she said in her resignation statement.\n \n\n   \n  Despite admitting mistakes, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. “I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said.\n \n\n   \n    What is the BBC? Who owns it?\n \n\n   \n  The broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A “royal charter”, which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government.\n \n\n   \n  It is funded by a “license fee” – an annual payment of £174.50 ($299) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster’s streaming service. It is a criminal offense not to pay the fee.\n \n\n   \n  Since its founding, the BBC’s mission has been to “act in the public interest” and provide “impartial, high-quality and distinctive output” to “inform, educate and entertain” its audiences.\n \n\n   \n  More profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country.\n \n\n   \n    Is the BBC impartial?\n \n\n   \n  Nominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences.\n \n\n   \n  But the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarized political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation’s television and radio sets.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC has long been criticized by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said Monday, calling for “a very much slimmed down BBC.”\n \n\n   \n  Farage said he spoke to Trump about the “Panorama” report last week. “He just said to me, ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’”\n \n\n   \n    What has Trump threatened?\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by “intentionally and deceitfully” editing the “Panorama” film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump’s team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to respond.\n \n\n   \n  The letter said that if those demands were not met, “President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.”\n \n\n   \n    Could the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages?\n \n\n   \n  Probably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits.\n \n\n   \n  It closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million ($627 million) – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for.\n \n\n   \n  Any payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade. The latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives.\n \n\n   \n    Why is the case being brought in Florida?\n \n\n   \n  In the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint.\n \n\n   \n  Still, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump’s argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London.\n \n\n   \n  “The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?” Stephens told CNN. “He’s going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this ‘Panorama’ and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?”\n \n\n   \n    Has Trump threatened media outlets before?\n \n\n   \n  Yes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay  $15 million  in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n \n\n   \n  In July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay  $16 million  to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. As with the BBC, Trump’s grievance was over editing in the program; he claimed the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit her and hurt him.\n \n\n   \n  Analysts said Paramount likely agreed to settle that case to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, which the Trump administration formally approved in July.\n \n\n   \n  Stephens, the lawyer, said that Trump might find it harder to get the BBC to agree to settle, since “he doesn’t have the sort of leverage” over the broadcaster that he did over Paramount.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/uk-suspends-caribbean-intelligence-sharing-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:42:00.000-05:00","title":"Exclusive: UK suspends some intelligence sharing with US over boat strike concerns in major break","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Kingdom has suspended intelligence sharing with the United States regarding suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean, citing concerns that US military strikes—launched in September 2025—violate international law and constitute extrajudicial killings.

That meant the ships would be stopped, boarded, its crew detained, and drugs seized.\n \n\n   \n  The intelligence was typically sent to Joint Interagency Task Force South, a task force stationed in Florida that includes representatives from a number of partner nations and works to reduce the illicit drug trade.\n \n\n   \n  But shortly after the US began launching lethal strikes against the boats in September, however, the UK grew concerned that the US might use intelligence provided by the British to select targets. British officials believe the US military strikes, which have killed 76 people, violate international law, the sources said. The intelligence pause began over a month ago, they said.\n \n\n   \n  The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last month that the strikes violate international law and amount to “extrajudicial killing.” The UK agrees with that assessment, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The British embassy in Washington and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. A Pentagon official told CNN that the department “doesn’t talk about intelligence matters.”\n \n\n   \n  Before the US military began blowing up boats in September, countering illicit drug trafficking was handled by law enforcement and the US Coast Guard, Cartel members and drug smugglers were treated as criminals with due process rights — something the UK was happy to help with, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  But the Trump administration has argued that the US military can legally kill suspected traffickers because they pose an imminent threat to Americans and are “enemy combatants” who are in an “armed conflict” with the US, according to a memo sent by the administration to Congress. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel  issued an opinion , which is still classified, reinforcing that argument, CNN has reported, and Trump has designated a number of drug cartels as “foreign terrorist groups.” The White House has said repeatedly that the administration’s actions “comply fully with the Law of Armed Conflict,” the area of international law that is designed to prevent attacks on civilians.\n \n\n   \n  But legal experts say the Law of Armed Conflict  would still apply to civilian drug traffickers , and the designation of a group as a foreign terrorist organization does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force. Several boats hit by the US have either been stationary or were turning around when they were attacked, CNN has reported, undermining the administration’s claim that they posed an imminent threat that could not be dealt with through interdiction and arrest.\n \n\n   \n  Senior US defense officials have also expressed skepticism of the military campaign. The commander of US Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey,  offered to resign  during a tense meeting last month with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after he raised questions about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Holsey will leave his post in December, just one year into his tenure as the SOUTHCOM chief.\n \n\n   \n  Lawyers specializing in international law within DoD’s Office of General Counsel have also raised concerns about the legality of the strikes, CNN has reported. Multiple current and former uniformed lawyers told CNN that the strikes do not appear lawful. Hegseth’s spokesperson has previously denied that any lawyers involved in the operations have dissented.\n \n\n   \n  Canada, another key US ally which has helped the US Coast Guard interdict suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean for nearly two decades, has also distanced itself from the US military strikes. The sources told CNN that Canada intends to continue its partnership with the Coast Guard, called Operation Caribbean. But the country has made clear to the US that it does not want its intelligence being used to help target boats for deadly strikes, the sources told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Canada’s defense  told Canadian press  last month that “it is important to note that Canadian Armed Forces activities under Operation Caribbean, conducted in co-ordination with the United States Coast Guard, are separate and distinct” from the US military strikes on suspected drug vessels.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/economy/tariff-rebate-check-proposal-what-to-know","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:35:00.000-05:00","title":"Trump Floats $2,000 Tariff Rebate Checks.

$2,000 tariff rebate checks. What you need to know \n       \n  By David Goldman, Elisabeth Buchwald, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:35 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump, embattled by America’s growing  affordability problems , has once again floated a unique solution: Sending Americans rebate checks for the tariffs that his administration has collected.\n \n\n   \n  “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump  posted on Truth Social  Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s a bold promise with several significant complications.\n \n\n   \n    What Trump proposed\n \n\n   \n  Trump has frequently floated the idea of tariff rebate checks. Prior to this weekend’s proposal, Trump in August had said Americans could  receive a portion of the tariff revenue .\n \n\n   \n  “We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” Trump said at the time.\n \n\n   \n  While American importers foot the initial tariff bill, they’ve been passing along some of those added costs to consumers, meaning Americans are indirectly paying for tariffs, too.\n \n\n   \n  The idea sounds similar to stimulus checks that went out in the wake of the pandemic recession — once towards the end of Trump’s first term, in 2020; and again in 2021 when former President Joe Biden was in office. But Trump suggested that these tariff rebate checks could be funded not by a general pool of taxpayer funds but instead from the money collected by US importers who pay the historic tariffs Trump has imposed on a vast number of goods from overseas.\n \n\n   \n    What the Treasury says\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s top economic adviser threw some cold water on the rebate checks.\n \n\n   \n  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was noncommittal about the proposal on Sunday in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” Bessent said no formal proposals have been made to distribute tariff revenue and suggested Trump’s mention of a $2,000 payment “could come in lots of forms,” including making up for lost revenue from not taxing tips, overtime and Social Security payments.\n \n\n   \n    Who qualifies and is there even enough money for this?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue, which includes a mix of various tariffs Trump has imposed and previous tariffs that were in place before Trump took office, according to the US Treasury.\n \n\n   \n  More than 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, the  IRS said .\n \n\n   \n  So a back-of-the-envelope calculation would put $2,000 stimulus checks at a total cost of about $326 billion. That’s more than the tariff revenue America has collected since Trump’s second term began.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said he would exclude wealthy Americans, but it’s not clear where the cut-off would be and whether that could make up for the difference.\n \n\n   \n  Even with an income threshold of $100,000 — far from the highest income tax bracket — around 150 million adults would qualify. That would cost the administration roughly $300 billion, wrote Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X.\n \n\n   \n  According to a Monday morning social media post, the president seems to think there would be enough money left after tariff rebate checks are doled out to help pay down the nation’s nearly $40 trillion in debt.\n \n\n   \n  “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  A White House official didn’t specify what requirements would need to be met to qualify for a check. “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” the official told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    What about the Supreme Court?\n \n\n   \n  Another complicating factor: The  Supreme Court appears skeptical  of the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. About $100 billion of the total tariff revenue so far has been collected through this method.\n \n\n   \n  If the court rules against the Trump administration, it may have to  return that money to businesses , which would significantly reduce the amount of tariff money available as a rebate for American households.\n \n\n   \n  It could also complicate the process of refunding businesses if money has already been distributed to individuals.\n \n\n   \n    Can Trump do this unilaterally?\n \n\n   \n  Almost certainly not.\n \n\n   \n  Congress maintains the power of the purse, and past stimulus checks have required Congressional approval, and it’s unclear if Trump has enough support to pass something like this.\n \n\n   \n    Would Congress support it?\n \n\n   \n  Although stimulus checks have proven politically popular in the past, they have come almost exclusively during recessions or emergencies. The American economy is in neither at the moment.\n \n\n   \n  Rebate checks could exacerbate rising prices at a time when Americans say  inflation and affordability  are their top concern. Sending out checks could give America’s economy a sugar rush at the worst possible time and could ultimately ding American households if the Federal Reserve needs to hike its benchmark interest rate to counteract rising prices.\n \n\n   \n  That could lose Trump some key votes among fiscal conservatives in his own party.\n \n\n   \n    When would my check come?\n \n\n   \n  Even if the rebate checks get approval, don’t hold your breath.\n \n\n   \n  During the pandemic, Americans who elected to receive direct deposit checks had the money in their bank accounts within about a week of the first stimulus package passing. Where it got much more dicey was for the Americans who elected to receive paper checks. That process took around 20 weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/politics/state-redistricting-maps-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:14:00-05:00","title":"Tracking states’ unprecedented redistricting efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In 2025, President Donald Trump and Republican leaders have initiated an unprecedented wave of politically motivated redistricting across U.S. states, primarily to preserve or expand their narrow majority in the House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

states’ unprecedented redistricting efforts \n       \n  By Amy O’Kruk, Ethan Cohen, Renée Rigdon, Fredreka Schouten, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        11:14 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  President Donald Trump and Republicans have launched an unprecedented effort this year to redraw state congressional maps to help protect the  party’s narrow majority  in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats have responded with redistricting efforts of their own setting off a series of fights across the country which will shape the midterm landscape and help determine control of Congress.\n \n\n   \n  The latest development is in Utah, where a judge rejected a proposed map drawn by the state’s Republican legislature and  ordered the use of one  which is likely to create a Democratic seat. Utah had to create a new map after a ruling that the map drawn by the state legislature in 2021 violated an anti-gerrymandering ballot measure.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting, or the process of redrawing congressional district boundaries, typically takes place  just once a decade , as states respond to updated population counts after the  decennial census .\n \n\n   \n  But this year, with a historically tight House of Representatives, redistricting has become a critical tactic to shaping the midterm races.\n \n\n   \n  The redistricting process is different in every state. In some places, state legislators can redraw the map on their own, and all that’s needed is the political will. In other states, the redraw might require changing the constitution, a lengthier process which often involves a direct vote of the people.\n \n\n   \n  Overall, Republicans have more opportunities to gain seats through new maps than Democrats do. Republicans have full control of government in more states and many Democratic states have  ceded the map-drawing power  to independent commissions, moves some of them are now trying to reverse.\n \n\n   \n  2025 has already featured an unprecedented level of politically motivated mid-decade redistricting, but there could be even more in store. In many states, legal challenges aim to overturn existing maps. And at the Supreme Court,  the justices may be poised  to strike down key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, a decision which would open the floodgates to even more aggressive maps.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional information \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/snap-west-virginia-government-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:33:00-05:00","title":"How can food be political?

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:33 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Onita Norris is constantly running the numbers to try to solve a problem with no good answer: Figuring out much her two children, both under five, will have to eat, and how much she will have to go without.\n \n\n   \n  The West Virginia single mother earns about $2,800 a month working 40 hours weekly for the state. About half of that goes toward rent. The rest is for daycare and her electric, water and phone bills, leaving her only about $100 from her paycheck for other expenses, including groceries.\n \n\n   \n  Aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, usually adds $265 to her monthly budget for food. But with benefits disrupted  as the government lurches into what is now its longest shutdown on record, Norris now must find other ways to feed her family.\n \n\n   \n  “Rather than myself having, like, a full plate of food along with my kids, I’m making sure that they have a full plate of food,” Norris said. “I may have either less, or I may not eat.”\n \n\n   \n  Tears come to her face as she worries she’s failing her children. “It feels like I’m failing them because I am trying, I’m trying to do all that I can, and, of course, as a human you get frustrated,” she said, “and I never want my kids to see that, or feel like I’m taking that out on them, for something as simple as dinner.”\n \n\n   \n  More than 40 million Americans rely on SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps, to pay for food. They are caught in the middle of a protracted budget  standoff between Republicans and Democrats in Congress who have, for more than a month,  been unable to come up with an agreement that would fund the government.\n \n\n   \n  The difficult circumstances SNAP recipients are facing have become one of the most pressing issues for lawmakers, who are under pressure to work harder toward an agreement to get the benefits fully funded again.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, the state that was the first testing ground in 1961 for what is now SNAP, some 15% of its 1.7 million   residents rely on the benefits today.\n \n\n   \n  Food banks in the state are struggling to meet demand. They were already dealing with budget cuts caused by federal belt tightening    toward the beginning of the year. Now, things are even more stretched as furloughed federal workers become new clients.\n \n\n   \n  One charity in Martinsburg, CCAP/Loaves & Fishes, saw the number of households it serves roughly double from 72 households per week to 159 in the third week of October, and 119 in the fourth.\n \n\n   \n  Even though it is better positioned than other pantries thanks to the generosity of the community and local churches, there are worries about how long it can continue to keep serving at such a rate.\n \n\n   \n  “Until the SNAP benefits are replenished, the federal workers go back to work, we’re going to be just slammed like this all day,” its president, Leigh Fleming, told CNN.\n \n\n   \n    ‘It’s a struggle out here’\n \n\n   \n  Following a court order, the Trump administration earlier this week said it would  partially fund SNAP for November.  But the funds won’t cover full benefits, and November payments for millions of Americans who rely on them have been delayed.\n \n\n   \n  Trump then appeared to threaten to withhold SNAP funding on Tuesday until Democrats voted to reopen the government. The White House later clarified the administration would follow through on its plan to fund partial food aid during the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  In West Virginia, the federal government’s responses have brought confusion and dismay.\n \n\n   \n  “I just don’t feel as though the folks at Washington quite understand the gravity of the situation,” said Norris. “I just don’t understand how we’ve come to a point where we’re using food in politics and being essentially political pawns.”\n \n\n   \n  Laura Bowles, a West Virginia mother of five children aged four to 13 — with a sixth on the way — said she had to explain to her older kids that “there are some right now in the government who can’t figure things out, and we can’t have everything we used to have right now.”\n \n\n   \n  For her family, it means having to buy less food. “My kids eat a lot,” she said. “And groceries are already so expensive these days — it was already hard,” Bowles said. Like Norris, she is cutting back her own food intake to make her kids’ meals stretch further.\n \n\n   \n  Her husband’s paycheck from Walmart, where he works full time and makes $14 an hour, usually covers all their household bills.\n \n\n   \n  But this month, without SNAP, it’s mostly going to groceries. That means the family has had to pick what other bills to pay.\n \n\n   \n  “I let my trash and internet bill slide already,” said Bowles. Only half the electricity and car insurance could be covered, she added, and the family are even cutting back on driving to the park to save money on gas.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a struggle out here. I am pregnant again, and that wasn’t part of the plan – but it was God’s plan,” she said. “I guess people struggle everywhere, but it’s hard here in West Virginia. It just feels extra hard here.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/tina-peters-pardon-push-trump","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:59:00-05:00","title":"Trump Being Urged to Intervene in Tina Peters Case, Sources Say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Tina Peters, a former Republican clerk in Mesa, Colorado, was convicted in 2024 on state charges of participating in a scheme to prove false claims of mass voter fraud in the 2020 election, including allegations involving Dominion and Smartmatic voting systems.

Marshall Cohen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:59 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Fresh off of  pardoning a slew of allies  who helped him try to overturn the 2020 election, President Donald Trump is being strongly encouraged to intervene in the conviction of Tina Peters, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  Peters, the former Republican clerk of Mesa, Colorado, was found guilty last year on state charges of participating in a scheme that hoped to prove Trump’s false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020. She was sentenced to nine years in prison and is serving her sentence at a women’s prison in Pueblo, Colorado. However, because she was found guilty on state charges, Trump cannot outright pardon her — that power belongs to Colorado’s Democratic governor. But that hasn’t stopped her allies from trying to get her out of prison.\n \n\n   \n  One of the people making the biggest push internally on her behalf is Ed Martin, who is serving as the pardon attorney at the Justice Department after he failed to get enough support to serve as the US attorney in Washington.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has continued to advocate for relief for Peters in recent weeks, several people familiar with the push told CNN, even though it is extremely unusual for the Justice Department to intervene in a state case this way. The department has already  involved itself  in a long-shot federal case, known as a habeas petition, that Peters filed in March, and urged a federal judge to free her from state prison while she appeals her conviction. That matter is still pending, but a decision is expected this year.\n \n\n   \n  Martin has worked behind the scenes, over the objections of some of his colleagues, to find a way to grant relief for Peters. Responding Sunday to a post about the case on X, Martin wrote, “We are working on it!”\n \n\n   \n  During her sentencing hearing, Peters continued to argue that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump. Colorado state Judge Matthew Barrett told Peters that he was convinced she was not apologetic for her behavior and “would do it all over again if you could.”\n \n\n   \n  “You are no hero,” Barrett told her. “You abused your position and you’re a charlatan.”\n \n\n   \n  After Trump lost in 2020, Peters got involved with other right-wing activists who tried to prove Trump’s fraud claims by allegedly breaching voting systems in Colorado,  Michigan ,  Georgia  and other states. They were acting based on false information, including from Trump’s own lawyers, that the 2020 results were rigged against him by machines belonging to Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic.\n \n\n   \n  Peters was  indicted  by a Republican prosecutor and convicted by a jury in her ruby-red county of felonies tied to a data breach in Mesa related to the scheme.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has since publicly threatened “harsh measures” against Colorado if Peters isn’t freed and has  called  her an “innocent political prisoner.”\n \n\n   \n  He has criticized Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and state Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats. Polis  has said  he won’t pardon Peters as part of any quid-pro-quo deal.\n \n\n   \n  From the La Vista Correctional Facility — a medium-security women’s prison in Pueblo — Peters has continued her advocacy through messages to her allies that they post on social media on her behalf. Last month, she directed her outrage at the Justice Department.\n \n\n   \n  “Where is everybody? I did what I was supposed to do” to “legally” expose supposed voter fraud in 2020, Peters wrote, adding, “The President has demanded my release four times… why is the DOJ defying Trump’s demands? Get off your a**es and get me out!”\n \n\n   \n  Peters has apparently latched onto an idea  recently floated  by those on the right that the Justice Department can move her from state prison into a more comfortable federal facility, because she needs protection as a witness in a potential federal probe into supposed 2020 voter fraud.\n \n\n   \n  To that end, her attorneys have claimed they have critical new evidence about the 2020 election.\n \n\n   \n  They have used her habeas petition to publicize new depositions that they took over the summer, supposedly of anonymous Venezuelan informants who said Dominion and Smartmatic machines can rig American elections — the same false claim that Trump, Peters and other election deniers have peddled since November 2020.\n \n\n   \n  But at a recent hearing, Federal Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak ruled that the depositions weren’t admissible in the habeas case. He also observed that “we’ve seen neither hide nor hair” of the Justice Department in the months after DOJ officials participated an April hearing about its unorthodox intervention in Peters’ case.\n \n\n   \n  Martin confirmed Monday on Trump ally Steve Bannon’s podcast that the Justice Department wants to see Peters moved to a federal prison.\n \n\n   \n  “(Deputy Attorney General) Todd Blanche is the guy leading on this. We did it in a way that puts the right kind of pressure on them,” Martin said of the Trump administration’s contacts with Colorado officials. “If you’re Colorado … if the feds say we want something, you change your tune.”\n \n\n   \n  A person familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Polis and Weiser, who is defending Peters’ convictions in state and federal courts, are “fully synced up” on how to resist Trump’s pressure campaign.\n \n\n   \n  “She’s doing her time,” the person said. “We don’t let threats affect us. We have a job to do and we’re going to do it. We are going to uphold the law.”\n \n\n   \n  When contacted by CNN, Polis’ office referred inquiries to the Colorado Department of Corrections. A department spokeswoman, Alondra Gonzalez, said there is currently no formal process underway to move Peters out of state custody and a transfer would require the approval of state prison officials.\n \n\n   \n  “Transferring an individual is an action typically initiated by the Colorado Department of Corrections, not an outside entity, and is based on our internal classification and threat-assessment protocol,” Gonzalez said in an email. “This process is most frequently reserved for complex cases involving significant, long-term safety and security needs. The Department has not initiated this process for Tina Peters.”\n \n\n   \n  “There is no basis for the (federal) Bureau of Prisons to request a transfer of her custody. Any scheme to prevent her from being held accountable under Colorado law is outrageous,” Weiser said in a statement to CNN, adding that he would oppose any move.\n \n\n   \n  One of Peters’ lawyers, Patrick McSweeney, previously told CNN that Peters hasn’t had any direct contact with Trump from behind bars, but she has heard about his desire to get her out, and “she appreciates the president’s interest in her case, which is unusual for him to be involved in an individual matter.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/anthony-lennon-oklahoma-sex-offender-arrest","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:51:00.000Z","title":"Oklahoma Sex Offender Arrested After 13 Years on the Run","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In March 2012, a crime scene at a Super 8 Motel in Moore, Oklahoma, revealed a suspicious setup involving a man named Anthony Lennon, who had recently been charged with possessing child sexual abuse material.

Here’s how officials found him \n       \n  By Chelsea Bailey, Lily Hautau, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:51 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On a Monday in March 2012, detectives with the Moore, Oklahoma, police department were called to a bloody scene at a Super 8 Motel.\n \n\n   \n  They arrived before dawn to find a pool of blood at the bottom of a staircase and a path of bloody footprints heading toward an ice maker.\n \n\n   \n  Lying face up underneath the bottom stair rail – almost as if it had skittered away during a struggle – was a Super 8 employee’s name badge.\n \n\n   \n  Police said it belonged to a man named Anthony Lennon.\n \n\n   \n  And that, officers would later tell CNN, made the entire crime scene feel suspicious.\n \n\n   \n  Mere days before he disappeared, prosecutors had charged Lennon with eight counts of possession of child pornography.\n \n\n   \n  But now, he was missing.\n \n\n   \n  Had Lennon been attacked and abducted? Or, as law enforcement would come to suspect, did he stage his own kidnapping and vanish into the night?\n \n\n   \n  Uncovering the truth would lead Moore police detectives and the US Marshals Service on a manhunt that would span 13 years.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a cat and mouse game,” Moore Police Chief Todd Gibson told CNN. “When you commit crimes – when you victimize children – the full resources of (the law enforcement) community are going to come after you, and it’s never going to stop.”\n \n\n   \n    A crime scene ‘made for TV’\n \n\n   \n  Moore Police Detective Jason Landrum still remembers getting the 4 a.m. call to respond to the Super 8.\n \n\n   \n  When he arrived, he said officers were treating the crime as a robbery with a possible kidnapping. But as he walked through the scene, Landrum said something felt off.\n \n\n   \n  The placement of the evidence was suspicious, he said: The name tag was face up, so Lennon’s name was visible; the shoe print; the blood it tracked.\n \n\n   \n  Even the blood splatter itself stood out to the seasoned detectives investigating the scene.\n \n\n   \n  We “worked numerous crime scenes – and have since then – and it’s definitely not normal the way the blood was on the ground,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  But subsequent testing, he added, confirmed the blood was indeed Lennon’s.\n \n\n   \n  The TV was still on in the motel’s office, Landrum said, and what appeared to be Lennon’s dinner – a sandwich and some potato chips – was sitting on the table. The register was also left open, he added, and papers had been scattered.\n \n\n   \n  All the signs pointed to a violent robbery and a possible abduction. But Landrum said the timing felt questionable.\n \n\n   \n  This was not the first time Lennon had been charged with possessing child pornography, more commonly described by law enforcement as child sexual abuse material.\n \n\n   \n  In 2010, Lennon pled guilty to five counts of aggravated possession of child sexual abuse material. He was sentenced to more than 20 years in prison, but a judge suspended that sentence and ordered the then 29-year-old to register as a sex offender as one of the conditions of his probation.\n \n\n   \n  By 2012, Oklahoma prosecutors felt they had amassed enough evidence that Lennon had violated his probation that they – once again – charged him with felony possession of child sex abuse material.\n \n\n   \n  But, according to officials, Lennon disappeared on the same day a $100,000 felony warrant for his arrest became active.\n \n\n   \n  “That was pretty coincidental to us,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  Coincidence or not, Lennon had indeed vanished – and he would remain missing for more than a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “It reads and sounds like a made-for-TV movie,” Gibson said. And it was only just beginning.\n \n\n   \n    ‘I hope he’s captured before I leave’\n \n\n   \n  Within hours of responding to the crime scene, Landrum said he called the US Marshals Service to request assistance on the case.\n \n\n   \n  “I was afraid that he was going to try and flee the country,” Landrum said. “So, I contacted them to help me get word out to the borders.”\n \n\n   \n  But the days after Lennon’s disappearance dragged into months, and eventually, years.\n \n\n   \n  “It would have been really easy for us to just put this in the deactivated file … ” Gibson said. “But there was never a time that we stopped looking.”\n \n\n   \n  To balance their regular caseload, Landrum said Moore police detectives passed the baton to the US Marshals, who specialized in tracking criminals across state lines and solving cold cases.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, Johnny Kuhlman, US Marshal for the Western District of Oklahoma, instructed his team to reopen the case and begin tracking new leads.\n \n\n   \n  Over the years, he told CNN, marshals have filed numerous search warrants, conducted multiple interviews and logged hundreds of miles on road trips as they investigated Lennon’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  “We’ve been to several different states looking (for Lennon), following up on leads that turned out not to be true,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier this year, the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office added Lennon’s name to the state’s  10 Most Wanted list .\n \n\n   \n  Landrum said he’s been haunted by the thought that Lennon could escape justice for more than a decade.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m getting closer to the end of my career, and this was one that stayed with me,” he said. “I always said that I hope he’s captured before I leave.”\n \n\n   \n  Then, two weeks ago, Landrum got the call he’d been waiting for.\n \n\n   \n    After more than a decade, officers finally make an arrest\n \n\n   \n  US Marshals had been following leads on a man named “Justin Phillips” who was living in Canton, New York – roughly 20 miles from the Canadian border.\n \n\n   \n  After months of investigating, marshals now believed “Phillips” was, in fact, Lennon, who’d been living in the state under an alias.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Moore police and the Marshals Service declined to share additional information about how they located Lennon, saying it could lead to additional charges.\n \n\n   \n  Within hours of receiving the call from the US Marshals, Landrum said he’d booked a flight to join investigators working the case about an hour outside of Canton.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s a small town,” Landrum said. “We knew our presence would be known fairly quickly with a large amount of us in that area, so we didn’t want to be anywhere close to him because we didn’t want to tip him off.”\n \n\n   \n  Landrum said he joined surveillance teams that trailed Lennon as he left his home in Canton and spent the day at the local college where he was enrolled under the alias.\n \n\n   \n  SUNY-Canton confirmed to CNN Monday that an individual using the name Justin Phillips was a student at the school studying in the Engineering Science program.\n \n\n   \n  Investigators followed him to his neighborhood grocery store – and swooped in to make their arrest.\n \n\n   \n  “We still hadn’t 100% confirmed it was Anthony, even though I knew it was because I’ve been staring at his pictures for 13 years,” Landrum said.\n \n\n   \n  But he waited to call Gibson and inform the rest of the Moore Police Department until a fingerprint analysis conclusively revealed what he knew to be true:\n \n\n   \n  After 13 years on the run, law enforcement had finally arrested Anthony Lennon.\n \n\n   \n  That night, as he was driving back to his hotel room, Landrum said he called former detectives who’d worked on the Lennon case and had since retired to share the news.\n \n\n   \n  “They haven’t forgot about this case,” he said. “And they were very, very excited.”\n \n\n   \n    He preyed on the ‘wrong community’\n \n\n   \n  But even with the fingerprint evidence, Landrum said, Lennon has continued to stand by the alias “Justin Phillips.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Lennon’s attorney, who confirmed she represents “a man alleged to be Anthony Lennon,” but stressed he is entitled to a presumption of innocence.\n \n\n   \n  She did not offer additional comment on the alleged probation violation and possession of child sexual abuse material charges that her client faces.\n \n\n   \n  Lennon holds a master’s degree in computer science, according to  the US Marshals , and was working toward a doctorate at the time of his disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson said he believes Lennon was able to remain hidden for so long, in part, because of his extensive knowledge of computers.\n \n\n   \n  But he credited the tenacity and dedication of dozens of officers, detectives and US Marshals for the apprehension of the man who he said has eluded justice for years.\n \n\n   \n  “Mr. Lennon has been living in multiple parts of the country on the run from the law for over a decade,” Gibson said. “He is a person that decided to prey on children in the wrong community.”\n \n\n   \n  “You may think, for a while, that you’ve gotten away with it, and you may get relaxed, and as soon as you let your guard down, you’ll have strong men (and) strong women, knocking down your door to bring you to custody and bring you to justice.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article

While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.\n \n\n   \n  Kirkland acted in such films as “The Way We Were” with Barbra Streisand, “Revenge” with Kevin Costner, “Cold Feet” with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard’s “EDtv,” Oliver Stone’s “JFK,” “Heatwave” with Cicely Tyson, “High Stakes” with Kathy Bates, “Bruce Almighty” with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie “The Haunted,” about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks’ “Blazing Saddles.”\n \n\n   \n  Her biggest role was in 1987’s “Anna” as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring to a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova. Kirkland won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination along with Cher in “Moonstruck,” Glenn Close in “Fatal Attraction, Holly Hunter in ”Broadcast News” and Meryl Streep in “Ironweed.”\n \n\n   \n  Kirkland’s small-screen acting credits include stints on “Criminal Minds,” “Roseanne,” “Head Case” and she was a series regular on the TV shows “Valley of the Dolls” and “Charlie’s Angels.”\n \n\n   \n  Born in New York City, Kirkland’s mother was a fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazine who encouraged her daughter to start modeling at age 5. Kirkland graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied with Philip Burton, Richard Burton’s mentor, and Lee Strasberg, the master of the Method school of acting. An early breakout was appearing in Andy Warhol’s “13 Most Beautiful Women” in 1964. She appeared naked as a kidnapped rape victim in Terrence McNally’s off-Broadway “Sweet Eros.”\n \n\n   \n  Some of her early roles were Shakespeare, including the lovesick Helena in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” for New York Shakespeare Festival producer Joseph Papp and Miranda in an off-Broadway production of “The Tempest.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think any actor can really call him or herself an actor unless he or she puts in time with Shakespeare,” she told  the Los Angeles Times in 1991.  “It shows up, it always shows up in the work, at some point, whether it’s just not being able to have breath control, or not being able to appreciate language as poetry and music, or not having the power that Shakespeare automatically instills you with when you take on one of his characters.”\n \n\n   \n  Kirkland was a member of several New Age groups, taught Insight Transformational Seminars and was a longtime member of the affiliated Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, whose followers believe in soul transcendence.\n \n\n   \n  She reached a career nadir while riding nude on a pig in the 1969 film “Futz,” which  a Guardian reviewer  dubbed the worst film he had ever seen. “It was about a man who fell in love with a pig, and even by the dismal standards of the era, it was dismal,” he wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Kirkland was also known for disrobing for so many other roles and social causes that Time magazine dubbed her  “the latter-day Isadora Duncan of nudothespianism.” \n \n\n   \n  Kirkland volunteered for people with AIDS, cancer and heart disease, fed homeless people via the American Red Cross, participated in telethons for hospices and was an advocate for prisoners, especially young people.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/sport/soccer-cristiano-ronaldo-2026-world-cup","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:03:00-05:00","title":"Cristiano Ronaldo Says 2026 World Cup Will Be His Last","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cristiano Ronaldo, the all-time top goalscorer in international soccer with 143 goals, has confirmed that the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be his final appearance in the tournament, marking the end of a 25-year football career.

force meets an immovable object?\n \n\n   \n  Both are equally powerful, deemed indestructible and when they do meet, the laws of physics are pushed to their limits.\n \n\n   \n  For two years now, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have been those dominant entities in tennis, redefining the boundaries of the game, carving up the Grand Slams between them and rewriting the record books.\n \n\n   \n  It’s apt then that in a year of fine margins, thrilling encounters and breathtaking athleticism, the gripping “Sincaraz” narrative boils down to one final chapter.\n \n\n   \n  The setting? Turin. The tournament? Nitto ATP Finals. The prize? To be crowned the year-end world number one.\n \n\n   \n  The stakes couldn’t be higher.\n \n\n   \n    Dominant duo\n \n\n   \n  Just as in 2024, the seemingly inseparable duo have swept all four Grand Slam titles in 2025 with each encounter proving more tantalising than the last.\n \n\n   \n  After Sinner defended his Australian Open title in January – his final tournament before serving a suspension for failing two doping tests – what followed was a trilogy of finals of epic proportions.\n \n\n   \n  A French Open for the ages saw Alcaraz prevail, a month later the Italian showed remarkable resilience to bounce back and claim his maiden Wimbledon crown before the Spaniard produced a stunning display to secure a second US Open.\n \n\n   \n  Ten majors so far between them – six to Alcaraz; four to Sinner – leaving the rest of the tour reeling by a considerable margin.\n \n\n   \n  Still only 22 and 24, respectively, and scarily with still room to improve, the rivalry is set to endure.\n \n\n   \n  But is that how they see it?\n \n\n   \n  “I think the word rivalry takes on the professional part, in the tennis side,” Alcaraz told CNN Sports.\n \n\n   \n  “We’re trying to find the weaknesses from each other on court but then when we shake hands and we are off the court, we’re totally different.\n \n\n   \n  “We sometimes forgot about the rivalry we were getting on tour and we became persons and that’s what it means, the word rivalry.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘I’m seeing him more than my mom’\n \n\n   \n  That mutual humility, respect and admiration on and off the court has been ever present since their first meeting as teenagers in Alcaraz’s professional debut in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  While their on-court showdowns – characterized by breathtaking rallies and heavy hitting – have left audiences on the edge of their seats, off-court their ever-growing friendship has equally captivated fans around the world.\n \n\n   \n  The duo took to the court for a practice session last week ahead of the main draw, which drew thousands of viewers to the tournament’s live stream.\n \n\n   \n  A post-practice selfie shortly followed, racking up plenty of social media attention.\n \n\n   \n  “When you practice together, see each other in the locker then it’s natural that you get to know each other better and better,” Sinner said of their burgeoning friendship.\n \n\n   \n  “You talk about family and life in general, sharing also some personal stuff.\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think it’s changed. It just has become better because we know each other better.”\n \n\n   \n  “I said in the summer, I’m seeing him more than, than my mom actually. … I never get tired of seeing him,” Alcaraz jokes.\n \n\n   \n    Race to the top\n \n\n   \n  For this week, at least, that friendship will have to take a back seat as the two vie for the both the season-ending title and honor of finishing 2025 as the tour’s top-ranked player.\n \n\n   \n  Sinner may have taken the bragging rights last year – claiming both in a sensational 2024 – but this time around it’s advantage Alcaraz.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard – who ended the year top of the tree in 2022 – currently holds a slender lead over his rival in the rankings.\n \n\n   \n  He knows that reaching the final with at least one round-robin win or sweeping his round-robin matches will guarantee that award for a second time.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard is firmly on course for that quest, having defeated Australia’s Alex de Minaur on Sunday in his opening match of the tournament.\n \n\n   \n  Lifting the title in Turin would bring with it differing sets of emotions for the two.\n \n\n   \n  For Alcaraz, a first Nitto ATP Finals trophy would cap off what he deems to be his best year to date, having won eight titles this season alone.\n \n\n   \n  The Spaniard began that quest on Sunday with victory over Australia’s Alex de Minaur in their round-robin clash.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t hide the results. It’s my best year so far without a doubt in terms of level, in terms of consistency” he acknowledges.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw myself grow up a lot since the last year to understand some situations, to realize what I have to do to get to know myself even more and what I need off the court.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is a general situation on and off the court which made this year my best.”\n \n\n   \n    Separated by a hair’s breadth\n \n\n   \n  Sinner meanwhile goes into Turin on a scintillating indoor winning streak having recently brushed aside Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime to win his maiden Paris Masters title.\n \n\n   \n  Whilst his powerful, pinpoint ball placement and supremacy on indoor courts makes him a strong favourite to reclaim his respective crowns, the Italian is aware of the threat posed by his nearest challenger and the expectation to deliver again in front of his supporters.\n \n\n   \n  “There is for sure this extra motivation and some pressure so it’s a privilege to be in this position,” he says.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s something great to finish the year with a win and with an incredible big trophy but you also don’t have to forget how the season went and everything we both have done for the two years, and it has been again a great year.”\n \n\n   \n  So where, if anywhere, will an advantage be gained?\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps, the secret weapon, could be Alcaraz’s latest bold statement: A dashing black and white haircut.\n \n\n   \n  Looking the part of a comic book hero capable of backing it up with his superhuman skills, the Spaniard hair is in its third incarnation since his initial buzzcut caused a stir at the US Open.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, it’s evolved into platinum blonde and now colors – as Sinner remarked – aptly resembling Turin’s powerhouse football team, Juventus.\n \n\n   \n  “My team are scared about it next year,” the Spaniard says smiling.\n \n\n   \n  “This year has been really good with the changes.\n \n\n   \n  “If something works, why should I change it?”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/government-shutdown-trump-rebate-checks-gop-health-care-analysis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:38:00-04:00","title":"Trump’s shutdown win just landed Republicans with a huge political headache","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump’s failed promises to deliver on health care reform have left Republicans facing a deep political crisis during a government shutdown.

November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s the Trump ship that never sails.\n \n\n   \n  The president was back at it on Monday, promising an imminent solution to America’s growing health care crisis — on which he has repeatedly failed to deliver in the past.\n \n\n   \n  “I tell you, we’re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time, where the people get the money,” President Donald Trump said, referring specifically to Americans thrown into crisis by  expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies . “We’re talking about trillions and trillions of dollars, where the people get the money,” he added, without giving details about a vague idea to  send cash to affected policyholders  to replace subsidies while bypassing insurance firms.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s off-the-cuff answer was a typical example of the waffle he sometimes conjures to escape a jam in a photo-op. But he could not disguise the downside of his “win” in the government shutdown, which looks set to end after Democrats failed to secure their top demand: the extension of  those enhanced Obamacare subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  Trump and Republicans once again own the issue of health care, with millions of citizens —  not just those on ACA plans  — afflicted by rising premiums and high deductibles against the backdrop of a  wider cost-of-living crisis . And just as in his first term, Trump lacks a comprehensive, detailed plan to bring relief to citizens who lack health care, who can’t afford the plans they have or who know that the loss of a job could leave them without any coverage at all.\n \n\n   \n  If the GOP cannot fix the immediate issue of the subsidies — and convince voters they have a serious solution to this and other affordability questions — their  2026 midterm election hopes  could take a dive.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s fogginess on health care is nothing new. Repeated unfulfilled promises to act took their place alongside his much-lampooned “ infrastructure weeks ” as punch lines in his first term. Trump’s pledges to replace Obamacare shimmered with hyperbole but delivered nothing, and the 2010 law survives despite multiple Republican efforts to destroy it.\n \n\n   \n  During the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “terrific.” At rallies, he promised Americans new health care that would cost less but be far better. If that sounds impossible, it’s probably because it is.\n \n\n   \n  Early in his first term, Trump promised that change was on the way. “Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!”  he wrote  on the website formerly known as Twitter in March 2017. The GOP failure to repeal Obamacare, partly because it couldn’t come up with an alternative, didn’t stop Trump’s sunny predictions. “The Republican Party will be soon be known as theparty of health care,”  the president declared  in March 2019.\n \n\n   \n  Second term, same as the first. In his debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024, Trump was mocked for  saying he had  “concepts of a plan” to make health care “better and less expensive.” More than a year later — and despite some significant efforts by Trump to bring down the cost of some prescription drugs — Americans are still waiting for his wider solutions.\n \n\n   \n    Republican divisions boil over health care\n \n\n   \n  The fight over health care was not just at the center of the government shutdown battle with Democrats. It’s tearing at Republican Party unity. It’s even estranged Trump and one of his most outspoken supporters,  Marjorie Taylor Greene . The Georgia representative broke ranks early in the shutdown to highlight  ACA insurance premiums  for her family that she said would double in price due to expiring subsidies. While no fan of the ACA, she lashed out at her own party. “Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” Greene wrote on X in October.\n \n\n   \n  Greene’s persistent criticism is a warning sign for House Speaker Mike Johnson after he called back the House to vote on the Senate plan to reopen the government this week. It might explain why he was so keen to keep the chamber dark during a shutdown that set internal GOP dissent simmering. Greene further distanced herself from Trump on Monday, saying on X that he should spend less time meeting foreign leaders and instead hold “nonstop” meetings on domestic policy.\n \n\n   \n  The president told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “I don’t know what happened to Marjorie. She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think.” Greene then told CNN, “I haven’t lost my way. I’m 100% America first and only!”\n \n\n   \n  Greene might now be regarded as a MAGA heretic by some in Trump’s orbit. But her comments on health care raise another possibility — that she’s far more in tune with the economic insecurity felt by regular Americans than a billionaire president and his wealthy Cabinet.\n \n\n   \n  She’s not alone. During the shutdown, a group of endangered House Republicans  wrote to Johnson  to urge him to address expiring enhanced ACA subsidies when the government reopens. “While we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,” they wrote.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Republican leader John Thune agreed to hold a vote in December on extending enhanced Obamacare subsidies as part of the deal with moderate Democrats to reopen the government. Chances of a Democrat-written bill passing are slim. But the vote will put GOP senators on the record and on a political spot.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson hasn’t pledged to hold a similar vote — one reason why progressive Democrats are angry about centrist Senate Democrats’ compromise to end the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The speaker told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” Monday that he’d always been willing to talk about rising health care costs, but that Democrats had squandered weeks of valuable time by triggering the shutdown last month. He promised debate on a plan to get to the “root cause” of the health care issue. But that is unlikely to help ACA policyholders forced to decide now whether to give up health plans they can’t afford or pay punitively rising premiums.\n \n\n   \n  Johnson could not tell Tapper whether there’d be a vote on this issue soon. “I’m not committing to it or not committing to it. What I’m saying is that we do a deliberative process. It’s the way this always works and we have to have time to do that,” the speaker said. But the tiny GOP majority gives little cause for optimism that an issue as complex and divisive as health care reform is something the fractious GOP and an absent president could handle.\n \n\n   \n  One tangible gain for Democrats in the shutdown drama was their highlighting of the ACA issue and attacks on Republicans for failing to fix health care. In  an NBC News poll  taken last month during the shutdown, 10% of respondents cited the cost of health care premiums as the single top issue deciding their vote for Congress next year. And 49% of respondents said Democrats would do a better job dealing with health care compared with 26% who thought the same of Republicans\n \n\n   \n   Many Democrats are furious  that their moderate Senate colleagues made a deal with Republicans to reopen the government because they see it as a betrayal of Americans on the health care issue. But Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who helped broker the deal and joined seven others in the Democratic caucus to back it, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan the deal would show whether Republicans were serious.\n \n\n   \n  “Finally, because of the shutdown fight, we’ve had a number of Republicans who have figured out that this is an issue for them,” the New Hampshire Democrat said. “So, now we’ll see. We’ll see if they are really going to work with us to make sure that Americans can afford their health insurance.”\n \n\n   \n  Viewing Democratic tactics, a cynic might wonder whether the party, which failed to make the enhanced Obamacare credits permanent during the Biden administration, laid a trap for Republicans on an issue their rivals always failed to solve, especially under Trump.\n \n\n   \n  But some Republicans don’t buy the idea that the party is vulnerable on health care, arguing that Democrats would be blamed for higher costs. GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt told CNN that “I think people know that Democrats own Obamacare, and it’s been a disaster.”\n \n\n   \n    How Trump has tried to lower some health care costs\n \n\n   \n  Republicans argue that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” domestic policy law had already made significant steps to make health care more affordable by loosening the power of insurance companies and by restoring choice and control, partly by  handing more responsibility to the states . But multiple health care analysts and groups say that the bill’s  cuts to Medicaid funding  could leave millions vulnerable to losing coverage and threaten many rural hospitals with closure.\n \n\n   \n  The administration has several initiatives designed to reduce the costs of prescription drugs for Americans. It plans to launch  TrumpRx , a direct-to-consumer website, early next year. Last week, the president unveiled a plan to make  certain obesity drugs  available for as little as $149 in an arrangement that gives pharmaceutical firms like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk tariff breaks. If this plan works, it could be lifesaving for many patients who can’t get the drugs through their insurers and can’t afford out-of-pocket prices to buy them.\n \n\n   \n  The initiative reflects Trump’s willingness to use government power to intervene in markets, which has also been seen in other sectors, and which flies in the face of conservative orthodoxy. A plan he recently floated to send money directly to ACA policyholders, instead of offering subsidies, also seems to spring from a similar motivation to shake up the industry.\n \n\n   \n  Yet the idea is fraught with uncertainties, including whether such payments would cover the shortfall of all the subsidies. Another question is whether it would simply make up the shortfall in subsidies to pay for premiums. Or would it be a separate payment that patients could use to pay for the costs of treatment directly?\n \n\n   \n  In the latter case of a payment that bypasses insurance firms, recipients might be exposed to massive costs if they get an adverse diagnosis. Trump told Fox News on Monday evening that he didn’t want money to go to insurance companies but that it would go into a separate account so people could negotiate their own, better health insurance.\n \n\n   \n  “They’re going to feel like entrepreneurs,” Trump said. But he gave no details of how such a complex scheme could help policyholders now, and did not explain how it would lower costs.\n \n\n   \n  And spiking health costs don’t only afflict ACA policyholders. If the government sent cash to certain Americans, how would that be fair to other taxpayers? And wouldn’t state-financed payments for health care go against everything the GOP believes?\n \n\n   \n  Such thorny questions, and the president’s past failures to deliver on health care, explain the Republican Party’s new but familiar political nightmare on an issue that causes anxiety for tens of millions of voters.\n \n\n   \n   This article has been updated with new reporting. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/entertainment/sydney-sweeney-female-boxing-movies","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"09:30:00-05:00","title":"Sydney Sweeney’s boxing movie was a bomb.

Why? Because we don’t always just make art for numbers, we make it for impact.”\n \n\n   \n  The film tells the story of Christy Martin, a pioneering American boxer, who survived a murder attempt by her trainer-spouse.

She played female boxer Claressa “T-Rex” Shields, who competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and has held multiple championships across various weight classes.\n \n\n   \n  It got positive reviews, but only earned $1.96 million in its opening weekend, picking up to $8 million during its entire domestic run, according to Box Office Mojo.\n \n\n   \n  “Against the Ropes,” a 2004 fictionalized version of the life of boxing manager Jackie Kallen, starring Meg Ryan, garnered negative reviews and slim big box office receipts to match.\n \n\n   \n  That played a role in Ryan stepping out of the field for a bit. During  a 2019 interview with the New York Times  Ryan was asked if “Against the Ropes” and another film, “In the Cut,” “had been better received by critics or audiences” would she have still have taken a break from her Hollywood career, as she did.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the feeling with Hollywood was mutual,” Ryan said at the time. “I felt done when they felt done, probably.”\n \n\n   \n  What about boxing movies about men? “Hands of Stone,” the Robert De Niro film about Roberto Durán, opened widely in 2016 and  seems to  have tracked very similarly to “Christy,” with a weak opening weekend and a slow follow.\n \n\n   \n  The Miles Teller biopic of Vinny Pazienza, “Bleed for This,”  similarly  failed to fill theaters. “Phantom Punch,” the 2009 Sonny Liston biopic starring Ving Rhames, performed so poorly it has been almost erased from  the permanent record. \n \n\n   \n  It might feel like audiences,  despite their love  of “Raging Bull” and the “Rocky” franchise, just don’t love biographical boxing movies about real people that much.\n \n\n   \n  Except, every once in a while, one film proves an exception to the rule. “The Fighter,” David O. Russell’s fictionalized biography of boxer Micky Ward, was a rare worldwide smash in 2010. Ron Howard’s 2005 “Cinderella Man,” about James J. Braddock and starring Russell Crowe, was also a rare critical and commercial success.\n \n\n   \n  The best-known women’s boxing films aren’t biopics.\n \n\n   \n  Michelle Rodriguez made her movie acting debut in “Girlfight,” a fictional independent film. She played a hot-tempered teen who decides to channel her anger into boxing. The very inexpensive film didn’t pull in a ton of money, but it did launch Rodriguez’s movie career, which has included the billion-dollar “Fast & Furious” franchise. It also made a name for Karyn Kusama, who later directed “Jennifer’s Body” and is an executive producer of “Yellowjackets.”\n \n\n   \n  Then there’s the biggest of them all: the fictional 2004 film “Million Dollar Baby.” Not only did it find commercial success, it met wide critical acclaim. It won best picture at the Academy Awards and stars Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won best actress and best supporting actor, respectively. Clint Eastwood, who pushed for the film to be made and costarred as well, also won a best director Oscar.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/world/mali-tiktoker-killed-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:39:00-05:00","title":"Malian TikToker Killed by Suspected Jihadists After Pro-Army Posts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A TikTok influencer from Mali, Mariame Cissé, was killed by suspected jihadists in Tonka, a village near Timbuktu, after posting pro-army videos that drew the attention of armed men.

Is that a good idea? \n       \n  By Samantha Delouya, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Most first-time homebuyers in the United States take out 30-year mortgages. Under a new proposal from the Trump administration, they may soon have an even longer loan option.\n \n\n   \n  This week, President Donald Trump introduced a new idea to tackle home affordability: a 50-year mortgage loan. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.”\n \n\n   \n  While Trump’s   proposal is light on details, administration officials say a 50-year mortgage would lower monthly payments, helping more Americans currently priced out of the market.\n \n\n   \n  But many housing experts warn the plan could backfire, raising the cost of homeownership by stretching out payments, adding more interest over time and driving up home prices.\n \n\n   \n  “This is not a good idea,” said Richard Green, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business. “The monthly payment savings would be really small. At the same time, you’re putting people at risk, because it takes a really long time for them to start paying down their loan.”\n \n\n   \n    Total interest payments could skyrocket\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year mortgage loan traces its roots back to the Great Depression. Over the last century, it has become the dominant way to purchase a house in the United States. Many Americans prefer   a longer loan period because payments are lower than those of, say, a 15-year mortgage.\n \n\n   \n  A 50-year mortgage could have even lower payments.\n \n\n   \n  “What it does is, it reduces the monthly payment quite a bit for a typical home for middle America by a few hundred dollars a month,” Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, said in a Monday interview on Fox. “We need to help people get back into homes.”\n \n\n   \n  But homeowners would end up paying far more in interest over time, Green said.\n \n\n   \n  Take a $450,000 home, for example. With a 30-year fixed mortgage at a 6.25% interest rate, the monthly payment would be about $2,771. Over the life of that loan, the homeowner would pay more than $547,000 in interest.\n \n\n   \n  With a 50-year loan at the same rate, the monthly payment would fall to around $2,452 – but total interest would balloon to about $1.02 million, or 87% more than on the 30-year loan.\n \n\n   \n  “With a 50-year loan, you’re paying a teeny, tiny amount to your principal loan early on, so your interest payments are not going down very much,” Green said. “It depends on what the interest rate is, but it could be like 30 or 40 years before you’ve even paid half your mortgage (principal) under those circumstances.”\n \n\n   \n  The best way to improve housing affordability is  to build more homes  where people want to live, Green said. A cheaper home loan might boost demand, but without adding new supply, it could actually push prices higher.\n \n\n   \n    Mortgage rates may differ for 50-year loans\n \n\n   \n  It’s unclear whether a 50-year mortgage would carry the same interest rates as a 30-year loan.\n \n\n   \n  “Until you figure out who the buyer is for that mortgage and how they’re going to model out the borrower behavior, it’s really tough to say anything more than the rate will probably be a little bit higher than the 30-year,” said Jeff DerGurahian, chief investment officer at loanDepot, a mortgage lender.\n \n\n   \n  A 50-year loan carries a higher risk of default because it stretches so long. Lenders may charge higher interest rates as a result. And since it would take borrowers much longer to build equity, a drop in housing prices could leave more homeowners owing more than their properties are worth.   \n \n\n   \n  There’s also a legal question surrounding 50-year mortgages. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, passed after the 2008 housing crisis, loan terms cannot exceed 30 years.\n \n\n   \n  “You would need a lot of legislation to bring this about,” Green said of the 50-year mortgage proposal.\n \n\n   \n  When asked, the White House did not provide details about any legislative plans.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement, a White House official said: “President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans. Any official policy changes will be announced by the White House.”\n \n\n   \n    A foot in the door to homeownership?\n \n\n   \n  Last year, the average age of first-time homebuyers in America climbed to a record high of 40 years old, according to  data  released last week by the National Association of Realtors. A combination of sky-high home prices and mortgage rates stuck between 6% and 7% have locked many young Americans out of homeownership.\n \n\n   \n  With a 50-year loan, some of those first-time buyers could be paying off their home loans well into their 90s.\n \n\n   \n  But Phil Crescenzo, a vice president at Nation One Mortgage Corporation, said the industry has been overly negative on the 50-year mortgage proposal.\n \n\n   \n  While homeowners would build equity more slowly than with a shorter loan, Crescenzo noted that, in some cases, a 50-year mortgage could still be better than renting and never accumulating any home equity at all.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s not like somebody would have to stay in that loan forever. It’s a starting point,” Crescenzo said, pointing out that homeowners always have the option to refinance their loans.\n \n\n   \n  “If I had the option where I’m renting the home or I can get a 50-year mortgage and I’m not going to gain much equity for a couple of years, I would still take that deal versus renting,” he said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/food/chipotle-sweetgreen-cava-earnings-problems-slop","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00-05:00","title":"Has the cash-strapped American worker fallen out of love with slop?","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on a significant downturn in the fast-casual dining sector, particularly among chains like Cava, Chipotle, and Sweetgreen, as younger consumers aged 25 to 35 cut back on spending due to economic pressures such as rising student loan repayments, record-low consumer sentiment, and higher unemployment.

\n       \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Purveyors of the so-called “slop bowl” just had another messy quarter.\n \n\n   \n  What was once the lowly desk salad has since expanded to a mish-mosh of options in a bowl, ranging from proteins like carne asada and lamb meatballs to toppings like tzatziki or  red chimichurri , and has become a staple of the American worker’s diet.\n \n\n   \n  But the big three slop slingers — Cava, Chipotle and Sweetgreen — all reported similar problems in their recent earnings: Younger customers, particularly those aged between 25 to 35, are pinching pennies and choosing to forgo the $15 (or $20) warm bowls.\n \n\n   \n  Instead, they are packing their lunches or gravitating toward fast food chains  offering deep discounts , thus hurting the trio’s bottom lines.\n \n\n   \n  The fast-casual restaurants face several issues, in particular that the “softer wage and spending growth” that had been affecting lower-income consumers “seems to be creeping up into the middle income and young professional consumer,” according to Brian Vaccaro, restaurant analyst at Raymond James.\n \n\n   \n  Anxiety around political issues, such as the government shutdown, as well as increased competition from value meals at fast food rivals, are also affecting their customer bases, Vaccaro said.\n \n\n   \n    Fast casual has become ‘too expensive’\n \n\n   \n  Cava, which serves customizable Mediterranean-style bowls, is one chain that’s feeling the effects. The stock, which surged 162% in 2024, has fallen nearly 60% this year.\n \n\n   \n  “We know our Gen Z consumers are certainly facing headwinds this year that may not have existed last year,” Cava CEO Brett Schulman told CNN, citing   the resumption of student loan repayments, record-low  consumer sentiment  levels and Gen Z unemployment that’s  “double the national rate.” \n \n\n   \n  Last week, Cava ( CAVA ) revealed that its traffic was flat for the second consecutive quarter, so it cut its same-store sales outlook to 3% - 4% (from 4% - 6%) for the rest of 2025.\n \n\n   \n  “When you look at the (fast-casual) industry since 2019, while sales have grown, transactions are actually down 7%,” he said. “The industry has gotten too expensive for consumers.”\n \n\n   \n  As a result, some of those once reliable customers are now buying more groceries to save money, said R.J. Hottovy, a restaurant analyst at data analytics firm Placer.ai.\n \n\n   \n  “These consumers are simultaneously shifting visits to grocery chains like Trader Joe’s and other alternative food retailers as they seek more affordable options,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  That was pointed out    during Chipotle’s earnings report,   which  showed miserable results  at the end of October. The chain cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter, and shares are down 50% this year.\n \n\n   \n  CEO Scott Boatwright said  younger consumers , particularly those aged 25 to 35   who make up a quarter of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re not losing them to the competition; we’re losing them to grocery and food at home,” he told analysts during Chipotle’s latest earnings call. “It is one of our core consumer cohorts. They feel the pinch and we feel the pullback from them as well.”\n \n\n   \n  He argues that Chipotle ( CMG ) is still more affordable than its competitors.\n \n\n   \n  “The fast-casual sector is just out of favor and has been deemed unaffordable and we are lumped into that,” he said, bristling at criticism that Chipotle has  become  too expensive . “But I will still tell you, we are still at 20% to 30% discount to our fast-casual peers in the sector.”\n \n\n   \n  Vaccaro agrees that Chipotle’s value proposition “remains very strong with an entry-level price point of less than $10 in most markets (excluding higher-cost markets   like New York).” But he thinks some consumers might have forgotten, since the chain typically avoids advertising around its prices.\n \n\n   \n  Still, Chipotle is faring better than Sweetgreen, the once high-flying salad and warm bowl chain whose stock finished nearly 200% higher in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  Shares have, however, nosedived 83% this year, and the company’s market cap is hovering at $680 million — a steep fall from its nearly $5 billion valuation when it went  public in 2021 .\n \n\n   \n  Sweetgreen ( SG ) revealed in its earnings   last   Thursday that same-store sales slid 9.5% and visits fell nearly 12%. That caps off a tough year for the brand, which ended a  salad subscription program  and axed selling fries after just five months.\n \n\n   \n  “The 25 to 35 (year old) consumer is the most under pressure, and they make up about 30% of our consumer base,” said Sweetgreen CFO Jamie McConnell on a call with analysts, adding that their spending declined about 15%.\n \n\n   \n  To lure back value-conscious customers, Sweetgreen this week will begin promoting that it has boosted protein portions by 25%.\n \n\n   \n  Despite the current problems, analysts say the chains are well positioned for the future. That’s because there will always be consumer appetite for “high quality, fresh ingredients at reasonable price points,” said Vaccaro.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/snap-benefits-recipients-struggling","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Many SNAP recipients are struggling — and confused — amid legal whiplash","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Millions of SNAP recipients across the United States are facing financial and emotional turmoil as the USDA issues conflicting guidance on food stamp benefits, while court rulings and a Supreme Court intervention create ongoing uncertainty.

confused — amid legal whiplash \n       \n  By Tami Luhby, Alisha Ebrahimji, René Marsh, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  When Trena Picou heard that the US Department of Agriculture agreed last week to issue partial  food stamp benefits  for November to comply with  a federal court order , she was hopeful that she’d get around half of her usual $263 allotment. The funds would help buy meat, potatoes, beans and rice for the two teen grandsons that she and her husband are raising.\n \n\n   \n  But the Houma, Louisiana, resident only received $64, which just covered a few packs of meat, cereal and milk and nearly brought her to tears.\n \n\n   \n  A few days later, her hopes were raised again when the  USDA said  it was processing full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, payments to comply with another court order. But the judge’s ruling was quickly  blocked by the Supreme Court , which left her depressed but not surprised.\n \n\n   \n  Now, she’s pinning her hopes on Congress soon  passing a spending package  that could reopen the federal government and get full SNAP assistance flowing again to tens of millions of Americans who depend on the aid to feed themselves and their families. The couple has had to use part of their disability payments to cover the grocery tab, leaving them worried about paying for rent and utilities.\n \n\n   \n  Though she’s had to deal with the uncertainty surrounding this month’s food stamp benefits since the  USDA announced in October  that it didn’t have the funds to pay them, the twists and turns of the past week or so have been “way worse.”\n \n\n   \n  “You make plans to buy groceries and then it’s gone,” Picou, 68, said of the potential to receive their benefits. “It’s pulling the rug out from under you, and you think ‘What am I going to do now?”\n \n\n   \n   Millions of SNAP recipients  like Picou have been suffering whiplash this month, with the USDA issuing  four different guidance memos  to states about distributing at least some benefits and the  two lawsuits  that aim to force the agency to issue payments working their way through multiple levels of the US courts system. A federal judge in Rhode Island first ordered USDA to provide  at least partial benefits  but last week expanded his ruling to require the agency to pay full benefits. The Supreme Court on Friday evening temporarily paused the judge’s order to require full payments to be distributed.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the Senate voted Monday on a  short-term spending bill  that would reopen the federal government for now but fund SNAP for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30.\n \n\n   \n  The benefits are starting to hit enrollees’ EBT cards, but it varies greatly by state. Some recipients of the program have received their full benefits this month, while others have only received a fraction of their usual allotment, while still others  remain in limbo , uncertain if or when their payments will arrive.\n \n\n   \n  With her eyes on the mail and ear to her phone, Katherine Broadway is on high alert for any piece of communication about the return of her vital food assistance, nearly $700 each month for her family of four. The only form of communication she’s received is an automated message about delayed payments from the number on the back of her benefits card.\n \n\n   \n  “It is getting absolutely frustrating for us,” she said. “We keep getting told one thing about SNAP and then five minutes later it’s not coming,” said Broadway, a retail worker from Northeast Ohio with two young daughters and a stay-at-home husband. “We are growing very impatient at this point for relief for the country in general.”\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, the couple had to take a payday loan to afford groceries they’re hoping carry them throughout the next two weeks. Despite the stress of doing mental gymnastics to balance her pantry and refrigerator with her bank account, she is putting on a brave face for her daughters while holding onto hope that the tough times don’t last.\n \n\n   \n  “I won’t lie, I have my little mental breakdowns,” she said. “I will go in the bathroom and I will cry because I am feeling so overwhelmed.”\n \n\n   \n  In Grand Island, Nebraska, Anthony Harris continues to wait for his family’s $389 in monthly SNAP assistance, while his mother in California received her full allotment on Friday after the Golden State rushed to distribute full benefits to its residents. He checks his EBT card daily but has yet to receive any benefits. Nebraska’s SNAP website continues to say that November payments “may be delayed or disrupted” due to the federal government shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  When the USDA said last week that it would provide partial and then full benefits, Harris figured he could buy more food for his 16-month-old son, Anthony, Jr, who particularly likes ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs.\n \n\n   \n  “We actually thought we’d have food this month and not have to worry,” said Harris, 46, who along with his wife, Tanya, have been going hungry at times to make sure their son has enough to eat.\n \n\n   \n  Now he’s doubtful that Nebraska will provide even partial benefits anytime soon. So he is going to work full time at Burger King, even though his current part-time position leaves him in great pain in his back and feet.\n \n\n   \n  Even residents who have received at least partial benefits are confused and concerned. They are worried about spending the funds on their EBT cards since they’ve heard that USDA wants states to undo the distribution, said Jimmy Chen, CEO of Propel, an app that 5.5 million SNAP households use to manage their benefits. They think they may owe money to the government if they use the cards.\n \n\n   \n  Also, those receiving partial payments are asking Propel why they received that amount. They fear that a mistake was made or that they’ll get the reduced amount going forward, Chen said.\n \n\n   \n  “There are a lot of things we’re asking families to juggle right now,” he told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  (A Department of Justice attorney, who is representing the USDA in court, told a federal judge Monday that the agency is not looking to rescind the funds on recipients’ cards.)\n \n\n   \n  For some SNAP beneficiaries, the ever-shifting landscape has just been too much to bear.\n \n\n   \n  While Onita Norris has tried to keep up with the constantly shifting legal and political developments surrounding SNAP funding, she admits she’s not tracking every update because it just causes “unnecessary added stress.” The Martinsburg, West Virginia, resident has yet to receive any funds for November.\n \n\n   \n  For her mental health, the single mother of two young children is limiting how closely she monitors the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I could obviously use the money, but I’m not going to keep logging in (into her SNAP account) and refreshing when it seems like they haven’t figured this out,” said Norris.\n \n\n   \n  Despite reports of a potential breakthrough in Congress to end the shutdown, she remains skeptical.\n \n\n   \n  “Just because they say it doesn’t mean that’s what’s going to happen,” she said. “Until I actually see something hit my account, it’s very much, ‘I’ll believe it when I see it.’”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/redistricting-utah-judge-democrat-leaning-district-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:40:00-05:00","title":"Judge adopts Utah congressional map that creates a Democrat-leaning district for 2026","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Utah judge, Dianna Gibson, rejected a Republican-drawn congressional map that was accused of gerrymandering, instead adopting a map proposed by the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government.

Press\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:40 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: AP\n \n   \n  A Utah judge on Monday rejected the new congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers, adopting an alternate proposal that creates a Democrat-leaning district ahead of the the 2026 midterm elections.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans currently hold all four of Utah’s House seats and had advanced a map poised to protect them.\n \n\n   \n  Judge Dianna Gibson ruled just before a midnight deadline that the Legislature’s new map “unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.”\n \n\n   \n  She had ordered lawmakers to draw a map that complies with standards established by voters to ensure districts don’t deliberately favor a party, a practice known as gerrymandering.\n \n\n   \n  If they failed, Gibson warned she may consider other maps submitted by plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led her to throw out Utah’s existing map.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson ultimately selected a map drawn by plaintiffs, the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government. It keeps Salt Lake County almost entirely within one district, instead of dividing the heavily Democratic population center among all four districts, as was the case previously.\n \n\n   \n  The judge’s ruling throws a curveball for Republicans in a state where they expected a clean sweep as they’re working to add winnable seats elsewhere.\n \n\n   \n  Nationally, Democrats need to net three US House seats next year to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP, which is trying to buck a historic pattern of the president’s party losing seats in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  The newly approved map gives Democrats a much stronger chance to flip a seat in a state that has not had a Democrat in Congress since early 2021.\n \n\n   \n  “This is a win for every Utahn,” said state House and Senate Democrats in a joint statement. “We took an oath to serve the people of Utah, and fair representation is the truest measure of that promise.”\n \n\n   \n  In August, Gibson struck down the Utah congressional map adopted after the 2020 census because the Legislature had circumvented anti-gerrymandering standards passed by voters.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling thrust Utah into a national redistricting battle as President Donald Trump urged other Republican-led states to take up mid-decade redistricting to try to help the GOP retain control of the House in 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Some Democratic states are considering new maps of their own, with California voters approving a map last week that gives Democrats a shot at winning five more seats. Republicans are still ahead in the redistricting fight.\n \n\n   \n  Redistricting typically occurs once a decade after a census. There are no federal restrictions to redrawing districts mid-decade, but some states — more led by Democrats than Republicans — set their own limitations.\n \n\n   \n  The Utah ruling gives an unexpected boost to Democrats, who have fewer opportunities to gain seats through redistricting.\n \n\n   \n  If Gibson had instead approved the map drawn by lawmakers, all four districts would still lean Republican but two would have become slightly competitive for Democrats. Their proposal gambled on Republicans’ ability to protect all four seats under much slimmer margins rather than create a single-left leaning district.\n \n\n   \n  The ruling came minutes before midnight on the day the state’s top election official said was the latest possible date to enact a new congressional map so county clerks would have enough time to prepare for candidate filings for the 2026 midterms.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans have argued Gibson does not have legal authority to enact a map that wasn’t approved by the Legislature. State Rep. Matt MacPherson called the ruling a “gross abuse of power” and said he has opened a bill to pursue impeachment against Gibson.\n \n\n   \n  Gibson said in her ruling she has an obligation to ensure a lawful map is in place by the deadline.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/climate/cop30-explainer-belem-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:46:00-04:00","title":"What is COP30 and why does it matter?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"COP30, the 30th United Nations climate conference, is underway in Belém, Brazil, with over 190 countries participating in urgent negotiations to address climate change.

\nUpdated: \n        5:46 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The  planet’s biggest climate conference , COP30, has kicked off with representatives from more than 190 countries descending on the Brazilian city of Belém. They will spend two weeks deep in negotiations — likely contentious — on how to rein in dangerous global warming.\n \n\n   \n  COP30 is supposed to be the summit where countries really get down to the details of how they plan to halt catastrophic climate change. There’s a huge amount at stake. Last year was the  hottest on record,  capping a  decade  of unprecedented heat, and the impacts are already roiling the planet — from  hurricanes  and  floods  to  fires  and  extreme heat .\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what to expect over the next two weeks.\n \n\n   \n    What are COPs?\n \n\n   \n  In 1992, more than 150 countries signed a UN treaty to limit the alarming rise of planet-heating pollution.  The first COP — which stands for “conference of the parties” that signed this agreement — took place in Berlin in 1995. Member states have been convening almost every year since.\n \n\n   \n  A breakthrough moment came in 2015. At COP21 in Paris, more than 190 countries approved the  Paris climate agreement , pledging limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and preferably to 1.5 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement set out a vision but not a detailed roadmap. To flesh out how the warming limit would be achieved, countries committed to submit national climate plans every five years for keeping the 1.5-degree ambition alive.\n \n\n   \n  COP30 marks the latest cycle of these. Countries were supposed to submit their plans for cutting climate pollution up to 2035 by a February deadline.  More than 90%  of governments missed it. Most countries  have now submitted  their plans, but some, including big polluters like India, have not.\n \n\n   \n    Why has COP30 been controversial?\n \n\n   \n  The pathway to the summit has been chaotic.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil’s choice of Belém as the COP30 location was symbolic. The city is known as the “gateway to the Amazon,” and the aim was to focus minds on the existential danger the vast rainforest faces.\n \n\n   \n  But Belém was not set up for the influx that accompanies COP. The city typically has around 18,000 hotel rooms and is expecting roughly 50,000 people. A dearth of lodgings meant rates spiked, and some countries said they  were being priced out  of the conference and out of the rooms where decisions were being made about their survival.\n \n\n   \n  Brazil also faced criticism for its decision last month to  approve exploratory oil drilling  at the mouth of the Amazon River, only a few hundred miles from Belém. Environmental advocates accused the COP30 host of hypocrisy.\n \n\n   \n  Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has made tackling deforestation a core aim and used the COP30 summit opening on Monday to speak  strongly in favor  of tackling the climate crisis. But he also supports oil extraction and has rejected claims of hypocrisy. “I don’t want to be an environmental leader. I never claimed to be,” he  said  at a pre-summit meeting last week, adding it would be “irresponsible” for Brazil to quit oil.\n \n\n   \n    What are the main issues at COP30?\n \n\n   \n  Forests are high on the agenda. Brazil is keen to make this the “Amazon COP,” and Lula wants to raise $125 billion for a fund that would pay countries to protect their forests.\n \n\n   \n  The most contentious issues at the summit are likely to be around finance and fossil fuels.\n \n\n   \n  The wrangle over how much richer countries should give poorer ones to help them tackle climate change and adapt to the impacts they disproportionately face is likely to continue.\n \n\n   \n  Last year, at COP29 in Azerbaijan, nations agreed to  provide $300 billion annually by 2035 , with a wider ambition to reach $1.3 trillion from a range of sources. A roadmap for scaling up climate finance was published last week and will form the basis for what are likely to be contentious negotiations.\n \n\n   \n  Then there are fossil fuels, the drivers of the climate crisis, which were mentioned in a COP final agreement  for the first time only in 2023  at COP28, when countries made an unprecedented call to transition away from oil, coal and gas.\n \n\n   \n  The world is different now, however. Trump is pushing for more fossil fuels, and some countries,  including many in South America , are rushing to exploit their oil and gas reserves. Petrostates and oil companies are  increasingly emboldened  to push back against any  language blaming fossil fuels  for climate change or committing to phasing them out.\n \n\n   \n    Does the world have a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees?\n \n\n   \n  The  United Nations says no , at least not in the near term. In a report this month, the UN said countries had acted too slowly to limit climate pollution and it was all but certain the world would exceed 1.5 degrees, at least in the near term.\n \n\n   \n  Based on current policies, the world is on track for 2.8 degrees of warming, according to the UN. If governments’ new pledges for the future are met, this could be brought down to 2.3 to 2.5 degrees.\n \n\n   \n  It is progress; a decade ago, the planet was on course for around a 4-degree temperature rise. But even this reduced level of heating will cause devastation and could push the planet over catastrophic tipping points, including  the loss of coral reefs  and the  melting of the ice sheets .\n \n\n   \n  If 1.5 degrees is overshot, the world could bring temperatures back down, but it would be exceptionally challenging and involve sucking large amounts of carbon out of the atmosphere  using techniques unproven at scale .\n \n\n   \n    What about the US?\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration will not  be sending a high-level delegation  to the summit. It follows a pattern of disengagement with global climate action that began with President Donald Trump  withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement  in January.\n \n\n   \n  The US rhetoric on climate action has heated up over the year, with Trump calling climate change “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” during a speech at the UN in September.\n \n\n   \n  The absence of the world’s biggest historical climate polluter from the summit will be keenly felt. Some experts fear it could give other countries license to dial down ambition.\n \n\n   \n  Others, however, believe the US absence may be beneficial as the Trump administration has proven a disruptive force in other global climate negotiations this year, helping derail what would have been two historic agreements: a  global plastics treaty  and  a tax  on the shipping industry’s climate pollution.\n \n\n   \n    What will come out of COP30?\n \n\n   \n  The closing session at the end of the two weeks is often delayed, sometimes by more than a day, as negotiators work around the clock to hash out a final agreement.\n \n\n   \n  Decisions at COPs are made by consensus, meaning countries must agree on everything — a feature which technically gives any nation a veto and can make progress very slow and fraught.\n \n\n   \n  At COP30, the aim is to create a roadmap of action for the next decade, and the final outcome could include commitments on finance, adaptation to climate impacts, nature, the clean energy transition, and possibly phasing down fossil fuels, although this will be incredibly challenging given current geopolitical headwinds.\n \n\n   \n    Reasons to be positive?\n \n\n   \n  While the world waits to see what might emerge from Belém’s vast conference halls, there’s a  more positive story unfolding  in the real world. Clean energy, dominated by solar, is gaining pace.\n \n\n   \n  In the first half of 2025,  for the first time ever , renewables overtook coal as the top source of global electricity — a major milestone, according to analysts.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/military-strikes-platforms-caribbean-pacific","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:00:00+00:00","title":"What the US Military Is Using to Strike Alleged Drug Boats","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The US military has launched a significant campaign against alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea since early September 2025, using MQ-9 Reaper drones, AC-130J gunships, and F-35 fighter jets.

\nUpdated: \n        7:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has undertaken a  campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats  in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea using a variety of drones, gunships, and fighter jets, according to people familiar with the assets being deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Most of the strikes have been carried out using MQ-9 Reaper drones, the sources said, which are remotely piloted aircraft used by the military and are typically armed with Hellfire missiles. Other strikes have been conducted by manned aircraft, including AC-130J gunships and fighter jets, the sources said.\n \n\n   \n  To date the Pentagon has not publicly acknowledged what aircraft or hardware the military is using to conduct the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Since early September, the US military has killed 76 people in 19 strikes that have destroyed 20 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has concentrated many of its assets in Puerto Rico, including the MQ-9 drones, F-35 fighter jets, and at least one AC-130J gunship. All have limited ranges and are likely being used for the strikes in the Caribbean. The gunship was  spotted  on October 9 armed with precision-guided missiles for striking ground targets, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, an  AC-130J  gunship operated by the US Air Force surfaced in El Salvador, at US Cooperative Security Location (CSL) Comalapa, according to photos and satellite imagery obtained by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The facilities in both Puerto Rico and El Savador are seeing highly unusual US military activity.\n \n\n   \n  Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, a US military installation that had been shuttered since 2004,  is now back up and running , according to satellite imagery and photos taken at the base.\n \n\n   \n  And while the US facility at El Salvador International Airport has regularly hosted surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft since it was set up in 2000, the outpost had until recently been used almost exclusively for unarmed aircraft, according to the United States Southern Command.\n \n\n   \n  The position of the facility near El Salvador’s coast makes it uniquely positioned to play a role in the US campaign in the Pacific Ocean. Previously, most potential smuggling vessels transiting the Pacific would have been too far from the types of attack aircraft sources said have been used for the campaign, all of which have limited range and were based either in Puerto Rico or the continental US.\n \n\n   \n  “Operating out of Comalapa provides more options and permits a much wider swath of the Pacific Ocean — through which much of the cocaine trafficked toward the United States passes — to be surveilled and defended,” explained Dr. Ryan Berg, the director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.\n \n\n   \n  Before the US began striking alleged drug boats in September, CSL Comalapa played a different role in fighting narcotics trafficking, historically hosting maritime surveillance aircraft, including a Navy P-8A and P-3 Orion operated by Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n \n\n   \n  The MQ-9 Reapers, at least seven of which are based in Puerto Rico, according to photos captured in Aguadilla, are predominantly used to strike targets with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, a weapon that was originally designed to destroy enemy tanks but that has become a workhorse for the military as part of drone operations against a range of ground targets.\n \n\n   \n  The AC-130J can carry the Hellfire but it is primarily armed with large guns. The AC-130J seen in photographs obtained by CNN in El Salvador had two cannons—including a 105mm howitzer— visible on the left side of the gunship.\n \n\n   \n  The Pentagon shifted its strategy in recent weeks to more frequently striking suspected narcotraffickers in the eastern Pacific Ocean, rather than the Caribbean Sea, because administration officials believe they have stronger evidence linking cocaine transport to the US from those western routes, CNN has reported. The intelligence suggests that cocaine is far more likely to be trafficked from Colombia to Mexico and eventually to the US, rather than Venezuela, the origin for some of the boats targeted in the Caribbean.\n \n\n   \n  Lawmakers have been seeking answers from the Pentagon about how much the counternarcotics campaign is costing taxpayers, but officials briefing Congress in recent weeks have not provided an overall dollar amount, sources said. Instead, administration officials have acknowledged that each strike typically costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, between the cost per flight hour of the platform and the cost of the munition used.\n \n\n   \n  One hellfire missile, for example, typically costs about $150,000, and reaper drones cost around $3,500 per hour to fly. An F-35 costs around $40,000 per hour to fly. The cost per flight hour of an AC-130J gunship is not public but its predecessor, the AC-130U, which was phased out in 2019, cost over $40,000 per hour to fly.\n \n\n   \n  The targeting for the strikes is being done via a joint US Southern Command/Special Operations Command targeting cell, with input from the intelligence community, according to two sources familiar with the matter. But  questions have been raised  about whether everyone the US has killed is truly a member of, or even affiliated with, one of the dozens of drug cartels the US has designated as terrorist organizations.\n \n\n   \n  In  several briefings  to Congress, including one last week, administration officials have acknowledged that they do not necessarily know the identities of each person on board a vessel before they attack it. Strikes are instead conducted based on intelligence that the vessels are linked to a specific cartel or criminal organization, CNN has reported.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, additional military assets are steaming toward the Caribbean, including the Ford Carrier Strike Group. A significant percentage of all deployed US naval assets globally have been located in  US Southern Command  since last month.\n \n\n   \n  Administration officials have told Congress that the Ford is moving there to support counternarcotic operations and conduct intelligence gathering, two of the sources said, but its deployment to the region is raising questions about whether President Donald Trump could soon launch strikes against Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  In a briefing last month, two senior US Special Operations officers could not explain why the administration needed so many powerful military assets stationed in the Caribbean just to blow up small boats, a source familiar with the closed-door session on Capitol Hill said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/us/shutdown-travel-problems-linger","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Why it may take years for air travel to recover from the government shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A government shutdown is severely disrupting U.S. air travel, with airlines forced to cut flight capacity by up to 10% at 40 major airports under emergency FAA orders.

take years for air travel to recover from the government shutdown \n       \n  By Alexandra Skores, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  While the government shutdown may soon be in the rearview mirror, it could leave air travel in a chokehold for months, and possibly years, to come.\n \n\n   \n  Until a deal is officially inked, airlines must continue to follow the Federal Aviation Administration’s  emergency order  to incrementally reduce flight capacity at 40 major US airports, up to 10%. Starting Tuesday, 6% of flights will be cut.\n \n\n   \n  The order calls for airlines to cancel flights seven days before they are scheduled to fly, and once they are canceled and passengers are informed, they can’t easily be reinstated.\n \n\n   \n  “There are significant challenges with these cancellations inside an airline, because it’s not easy to cancel randomly every day on 10% of our schedules and keep preserving those cancelations,” said Eash Sundaram, former chief digital and technology officer of JetBlue Airways. He now is the president of a technology venture fund called Utpata Ventures. “The airlines should be thinking about how hard it’s going to hit them in the next two to three weeks on the cancellations, and then the recovery process happens after that.”\n \n\n   \n  If controllers come back to the job, pilot and aviation consultant Kit Darby thinks it might take airlines a “week or two” to snap back.\n \n\n   \n  “If we can’t get it done this week (to end the shutdown), we’re starting to get to the point where it won’t be fully recovered by Thanksgiving,” Darby said. “I think if they do it this week, we can be very close to fully recovered by Thanksgiving.”\n \n\n   \n  However, passengers’ plans are in the hands of lawmakers to achieve a deal and secure a more reliable travel experience as the winter holidays creep closer.\n \n\n   \n    Controllers returning to work, or not\n \n\n   \n  Even when the government officially reopens, the number of controllers showing up to work might not immediately bounce back.\n \n\n   \n  Essential FAA employees who have worked during the shutdown will not immediately receive back pay, and some may choose not to return to work right away.\n \n\n   \n  The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said some of their members have taken second jobs and those side hustles may continue until they get their missed paychecks.\n \n\n   \n  Nick Daniels, president of the union, said it took two to two and a half months for controllers to get all their back pay after the last shutdown in 2019.\n \n\n   \n  President Donald Trump demanded Monday all controllers “get back to work, NOW” on Truth Social, recommending a bonus of $10,000 per controller who didn’t take time off during the shutdown. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later agreed with that sentiment, promising to work with Congress to reward controllers.\n \n\n   \n  Darby said in his experience, controllers go “above and beyond.”\n \n\n   \n  “They work extra hours, extra days,” Darby said. “Been doing it for a long time, have been poorly treated. But that’s just their nature.”\n \n\n   \n    Some controllers will never come back\n \n\n   \n  Some air traffic controllers will never return to their jobs and are retiring or quitting to find work where they will not be subject to government shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy told CNN, prior to the shutdown, only four controllers were retiring per day. Since the shutdown began, that’s changed to 20 to 25 retirees per day. Earlier this year the Department of Transportation offered bonuses to retirement aged controllers to stay on the job longer to help relieve the existing shortage, but the shutdown seems to be working against that effort.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s going to be harder for me to come back after the shutdown and have more controllers controlling the airspace,” Duffy  told CNN on Sunday . “So, this is going to live on in air travel well beyond the timeframe that this government opens back up.”\n \n\n   \n  “We’re going to have to find out how many actually resign, how many retired due to this shutdown, and truly start assessing all the different impacts the shutdown has,” Daniels said.\n \n\n   \n    The next generation\n \n\n   \n  Going into the shutdown, the nation’s air traffic control system was short by more than 3,000 workers, and a new effort to “supercharge” hiring this year has now been jeopardized by it.\n \n\n   \n  In September, before the shutdown, the DOT said it met its hiring goals for the year by recruiting more than 2,000 people. The FAA’s air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City was the “busiest” it has ever been,  an FAA official told CNN in July,  with roughly 800 to 1,000 more trainees in the pipeline than a year ago.\n \n\n   \n  Classes at the academy have continued during the shutdown but left some students questioning if a job where they could have to go for weeks without pay is something they want to pursue, Duffy said. Some students have dropped out as a result.\n \n\n   \n  The funding to pay trainees is also running out, he said last month. Would-be controllers get stipends to make ends meet as they go through schooling. If that stops, it “will be cataclysmic for them,” he said.\n \n\n   \n    The shutdown keeps going\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps the worst outcome would be if a deal takes a longer to come together or if it falls apart and the shutdown continues on for weeks more.\n \n\n   \n  On  Sunday, eight Democrats joined with Republicans  to advance the federal funding measure in exchange for a future vote on extending  enhanced Affordable Care subsidies .\n \n\n   \n  The House would also have to return and adopt the deal struck in the Senate before it is sent to President Donald Trump’s desk to be signed.\n \n\n   \n  The busy Thanksgiving travel period is just weeks away, and without a deal Duffy warned air travel could slow “to a trickle.”\n \n\n   \n  “I think we’re going to see air traffic controllers, very few coming to work, which means you’ll have a few flights taking off and landing at different airports across the country,” Duffy said. “But for the thousands of flights that happen every day to move people around the country for the great American holiday, it’s not going to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  If the shutdown has not been resolved at the end of this week, there is a big risk Thanksgiving travel could be disrupted, said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group. If the shutdown is resolved no later than the end of this week or even this coming weekend, then airlines should have enough time to reassemble their schedules and get flights back operating at normal levels by the time it is Thanksgiving, he added.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy even hinted Friday at hypothetically cutting capacity up to 20% of air traffic if the shutdown drags on.\n \n\n   \n  “If (a 20% cut) happens, the US air transportation system will be crippled,” Harteveldt said. “It will be very, very difficult for travelers to get where they are going for Thanksgiving, because airlines will have exhausted all of the easy light cuts.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/politics/schumer-senate-shutdown-democrats","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"04:00:00-05:00","title":"Schumer Faces Liberal Fury After Voting Against Government Funding Deal in November 2025","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faced significant backlash from liberal Democrats after voting against a government funding bill that allowed a centrist compromise with Republicans.

He’s facing liberal fury anyway. \n       \n  By Sarah Ferris, Manu Raju, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:00 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer went out of his way to embody the anger of his Democratic base during this fall’s funding showdown with Republicans — an intentional turnaround from his capitulation in March that turned him into a villain in his own party.\n \n\n   \n  He’s still taking the blame from many in his party anyway.\n \n\n   \n  Despite voting against the final deal on Monday night, the New York Democrat is again being pummeled by vocal Democrats across the party, who argue he allowed his centrist members to strike a deal with the GOP that fails to prevent spiking health care costs for tens of millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  In the immediate aftermath of the deal, many of his own Senate Democrats were mum about whether they’d continue to support him as leader. Multiple House Democrats called for him to resign. And a raft of Senate candidates trashed him as they look to survive tight Democratic primaries in key races.\n \n\n   \n  There is no immediate threat to Schumer’s leadership, according to multiple Democratic sources. Not one of the Democrats calling for Schumer to step down as leader is a current member of his caucus. Still, frustrations are mounting privately among Senate Democrats that Schumer and his leadership team lacked a long-term plan to secure real concessions from the GOP in the funding fight— and that the party ultimately ended up without a tangible legislative win, according to a half-dozen Senate Democratic sources. And there is growing chatter about what it means for his future after the 2026 midterms and if he chooses to run again in 2028.\n \n\n   \n  “He did the right thing in March,” Sen. John Fetterman told CNN, referring to Schumer’s decision to work with Republicans to avert a painful shutdown earlier this year. “But I think he’s discovering that you can’t get back into the good graces of the Indivisible folks,” he said, referring to the far-left activist group.\n \n\n   \n  Though Fetterman has been a vocal critic of his party’s strategy, the Pennsylvania Democrat said he would not directly criticize Schumer: “I’m not going to put a blade in my leader.”\n \n\n   \n  Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona wouldn’t directly say whether he had confidence in Schumer. Asked by CNN about the Democratic leader’s handling of the shutdown, Kelly pivoted to President Donald Trump, whom he called “an irrational president who doesn’t care about the American people.”\n \n\n   \n  Pressed again on whether he had confidence in Schumer, Kelly conceded that it had been a “rough” time for Senate Democrats. “I’ve been here four and a half years now, and [Schumer has] been the leader, and I understand why people look at this and say, well, this was kind of a rough period,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, pressed if he had confidence in Schumer, was also mum on the leader’s future. “I was glad to see that kind of unity,” Van Hollen said. “I’m disappointed in the result, but we will fight on another day.”\n \n\n   \n  The current wave of ire at Schumer comes months after the New York Democrat faced fierce backlash for diffusing that first funding fight of Trump’s second term — earning praise from GOP leaders. But this fall as another funding cliff loomed, Schumer reversed his stance and said Democrats needed to fight for expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies to help Americans pay down their premiums. Privately, Schumer was not involved in the centrist dealmaking and instead focused on keeping centrists like Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire from breaking with Democrats weeks earlier, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n \n\n   \n  One of those people, who is close to Schumer, said the leader was meeting with both centrists and progressives — convincing skeptical moderates to hold out longer, through the start of open enrollment on November 1. Separately, he was also strategizing with progressive colleagues like Sen. Bernie Sanders about how to keep the momentum up in the base to keep fighting. That person said it was a months-long effort by party leaders to keep the Senate Democratic caucus in line long enough to shut down the government — and force Republicans to talk about health care — for more than six weeks.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said Schumer was indeed working against the deal behind the scenes. “Senator Schumer didn’t want this to be the outcome, and pressed hard for it not to end like this,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  But he also added: “He didn’t succeed. Let’s not sugarcoat that.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked about whether Schumer should remain as leader, Murphy instead said there must be a caucus-wide solution to centrist Democrats bucking their party to reach a deal. “This has happened over and over. You cannot defend democracy effectively if you are not united as an opposition party, and we are repeatedly showing that we are not united,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, Schumer’s long-time deputy and former roommate, ultimately broke with the Democratic leader to supply a critical vote for the legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “He wasn’t happy about it,” Durbin told CNN when asked about Schumer’s reaction when he informed him about his position. “But he accepted it.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked if Schumer tried to prevent him from breaking ranks, Durbin simply said: “We passed that point.”\n \n\n   \n  There’s another key difference in the circumstances of this shutdown, compared to March: Schumer is getting backup from his fellow top New Yorker, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n \n\n   \n  Asked on Monday whether he believed Schumer was effective and should keep his job, Jeffries said: “Yes and yes.” In other media appearances on Monday, Jeffries has instead pinned the blame on the leading centrist in the group, Shaheen, describing her group as “random” and saying he doesn’t know her.\n \n\n   \n  On a private call among House Democrats on Monday, one member after another tore into the Senate Democratic centrists, according to two people listening to the call. One progressive, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, name-checked Schumer specifically but was particularly riled up about the handful of Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans to advance the deal on Sunday night.\n \n\n   \n  “Damn the senators that caved,” Jayapal said in response to those members, according to those two sources on the call. Jeffries, meanwhile, urged his caucus to direct their ire at Republicans, one of those people said — eager to avoid a circular firing squad.\n \n\n   \n  Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, urged his party to stay focused on the “main prize.”\n \n\n   \n  “People can have their opinions about the leaders, whether it’s Jeffries or Schumer, but all of us who are really appalled by what’s going on and the loss of health care, we have to stay focused on the main prize, and that is winning the next election so we have the capacity to push back and protect America,” Welch said.\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic infighting, however, has already begun.\n \n\n   \n  Outside of Washington, the loudest attacks have come from Senate Democratic candidates competing in tough primaries around the nation.\n \n\n   \n  “This happened because Chuck Schumer failed in his job yet again,” Graham Platner, a Democrat who’s in a tight primary race to flip Maine’s Senate seat, said in a  video  posted to X.\n \n\n   \n  “The old way of doing things is not working. We need new leaders in the Senate,” added Mallory McMorrow, a Democrat who is running in her own competitive primary in Maine, in a  video  trashing the deal.\n \n\n   \n  A third Democrat running in a Senate primary, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, tore into Schumer in a CNN interview on Monday, arguing that he’s not in control of the Senate Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s got eight Democrats going rogue here,” Moulton said. “That’s not leadership.”\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment, however, is far more muted in the current Senate Democratic caucus.\n \n\n   \n  When asked how she felt Schumer handled the negotiation, Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin told reporters, “I was disappointed yesterday.”\n \n\n   \n  “We need to meet the moment and we’re not doing that.”\n \n\n   \n  Freshman Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, though, made clear he does still back Schumer for leader.\n \n\n   \n  Asked if he has confidence in Schumer, Gallego responded: “This was a decision made by eight people,” making clear he didn’t think the New York Democrat could have changed the minds of the Democrats who flipped.\n \n\n   \n  “They clearly had a momentum. They clearly had their own goals. I think we all spoke to enough of them to bring them back, but we couldn’t get all of them, and I think it was going to be difficult for them to do that,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Pressed again, Gallego said, “I have confidence in him, yeah.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/10/22/india/india-new-delhi-pollution-diwali-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"02:50:00Z","title":"After Festival of Lights, New Delhi Plunged Into Toxic Darkness and the World’s Most Polluted Air","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After Diwali celebrations, New Delhi faced one of the world’s most severe air pollution episodes, with PM2.5 levels exceeding 40 times the World Health Organization’s guideline.

Esha Mitra, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:50 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Around 20 million people in  India’s  capital woke up on Wednesday breathing the most polluted air of any major city in the world, a day after celebrations for the  Diwali festival , during which revelers typically set off fireworks and firecrackers.\n \n\n   \n  As of Wednesday, New Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration – a measure of pollutants in the air – was more than 40 times the World Health Organization’s annualized guideline level, according to Swiss air quality monitoring company IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  New Delhi grapples with severe year-round pollution, but the winter months are typically worst, when millions of farmers in surrounding regions burn stubble in their fields to clear the way for the next crop.\n \n\n   \n  The sharp deterioration in air quality this week comes following celebrations for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, which traditionally involves the widespread use of firecrackers which release sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides into the air, as well as harmful heavy metals.\n \n\n   \n  In 2020, authorities enacted a complete ban on making, selling or using firecrackers in New Delhi, citing hazardous pollution levels.\n \n\n   \n  This year, the Supreme Court permitted the use of so-called “green” firecrackers – which manufacturers claim are less polluting – but only within a certain time window. However, residents reported that this curfew was poorly enforced, with people bursting firecrackers long after the deadline, and that “non-green” firecrackers still appeared to be available.\n \n\n   \n  “Year on year, it goes from bad to worse,” said resident Anushka Singh.\n \n\n   \n  The 30-year-old graphic designer said she usually stays at home at Diwali with her dog, to “help him through the incessant noise that doesn’t stop until late at night or early morning.”\n \n\n   \n  She described how her throat becomes scratchy, and her eyes begin to burn as she steps out of her home the day after Diwali.\n \n\n   \n  “Living in Delhi is a pain… I just wish that given the decades of data we would at least have stricter rules, ones that are actually implemented,” Singh said.\n \n\n   \n  Chandra Tandon, 52, who owns a corner store in the capital, said bursting crackers are “part of the fun and happens once a year,” but agreed that it becomes “difficult” for people who must endure the aftermath.\n \n\n   \n  “I was breathing in those fumes throughout and it’s definitely not good,” she said. “It would be good if we left the crackers burning to the kids… If you’ve lived in Delhi long enough, you know how bad it gets every year with the pollution. So, adults at least should do their part.”\n \n\n   \n    A long-term crisis\n \n\n   \n  Despite the city being the political heart of the country, officials have had little success in cleaning up Delhi’s toxic air.\n \n\n   \n  Previous attempts to curb pollution have included sprinkling water on the roads, restricting traffic by requiring vehicles with odd or even license plates to travel on alternating days, and constructing in 2018 two smog towers worth 200 million rupees ($2.4 million), intended to act as giant air purifiers.\n \n\n   \n  But a lack of strict enforcement and coordination means progress has been slow, experts suggest.\n \n\n   \n  India is also desperate to fuel its booming economy and meet the energy needs of its 1.4 billion people.\n \n\n   \n  On Wednesday, three Indian cities, including New Delhi, were ranked among the world’s most polluted, according to air quality tracker IQAir.\n \n\n   \n  Kolkata in the east was in fourth place, while Mumbai in the west ranked number 10.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/small-plane-crash-coral-springs-fl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00-20:30","title":"2 Dead After Small Plane on Hurricane Relief Mission to Jamaica Crashes in Florida Neighborhood","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A small Beechcraft King Air plane crashed shortly after takeoff from the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport in Coral Springs, Florida, killing Alexander Wurm, 53, and his daughter Serena, 22, during a hurricane relief mission to Jamaica following Hurricane Melissa.

The Austrian painter’s record is expected to be shattered again by a monumental, six-foot-tall portrait of a young heiress that was looted by the Nazis and nearly destroyed during World War II. Rarely seen for decades, it hung in the home of the Estée Lauder heir Leonard A. Lauder until the last years of his life (he passed away in June).\n \n\n   \n  Next week, “Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer” is expected to sell for above $150 million as the top lot in a sale of Lauder’s collection, hosted by Sotheby’s. The collection, which includes two other works by Klimt — both landscapes of Lake Attersee, estimated above $70 and $80 million — could fetch more than $400 million combined.\n \n\n   \n  Among the artist’s works, the portrait of Lederer, the daughter of his wealthiest Viennese patrons, is less known. Completed two years before Klimt’s death in 1918, the portrait features her in a gauzy, ornamental robe, surrounded by motifs from Chinese art. For many years, she kept a watchful eye over Lauder’s Fifth Avenue home in New York, with only occasional outings to be shown nearby, once at the Museum of Modern Art and a handful of times at Neue Galerie New York (founded by his brother). In 2017, however, Lauder loaned it to the National Gallery of Canada for its first extended stay, where it remained until earlier this year.\n \n\n   \n  While in his home, the painting was a jewel of his collection, first displayed in his living room, then relocated to his dining room to make room for a large Cubist work by Fernand Léger, according to the art historian Emily Braun, who worked as Lauder’s art advisor for nearly four decades.\n \n\n   \n  “He ate lunch whenever he was at home, and lunch would be at a little round table right by the painting,” she said over the phone.\n \n\n   \n  Just a short walk away, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, millions of visitors each year pass by Klimt’s companion portrait of Lederer’s mother, Serena. Painted around 15 years prior, the stylistic shift between the two works is apparent. Serena’s portrait is wispy and spare, contrasting the bold, lush qualities of Elisabeth’s composition. Yet both have the same dark, potent gaze, Braun notes.\n \n\n   \n  “You’ll see that Klimt is either mesmerized by (Serena’s eyes), or is smart enough a painter to know to draw out this incredible coal blackness,” she commented.\n \n\n   \n    Marked by tragedy\n \n\n   \n  Both paintings avoided a calamitous end during World War II, when Nazis impounded the Lederer’s vast art collection for more than a decade. Many of their works by Klimt were shown in a 1943 exhibition in Vienna, then stored in Immendorf Castle, which burned down at the end of the war. But the family portraits, excluded from the exhibition because of their Jewish heritage, were separated and ultimately spared.\n \n\n   \n  Elisabeth Lederer, just 20 years old at the time she sat for Klimt, was “an incredibly tragic figure,” Braun said. “Thank god this portrait survives.”\n \n\n   \n  Lederer lost everything before the war and died before it ended, at age 50, with the exact circumstances unclear. In the 1920s, as fascism began casting a long shadow, she became protestant and married a baron, but he divorced her just before World War II, the same year their young son died. Her family fled, but she remained in Vienna. She was vulnerable as a single Jewish woman, as Sotheby’s noted, so she claimed that Klimt, who died in 1918, was actually her father.\n \n\n   \n  “She was protected to a certain degree by this fabricated half-Christian, half-Klimt paternity, which was a ruse that was aided and abetted by her mother,” Braun explained. Klimt was a close family friend and her childhood drawing instructor, but he also had a reputation — allegedly fathering a number of children out of wedlock — “so this was just another example that was not far-fetched,” she added.\n \n\n   \n    A late-career masterwork\n \n\n   \n  Some works by Klimt have been the center of long sagas of  recovery and restitution , but in 1948, Lederer’s portrait was returned to her brother, Erich, who appears in drawings and paintings by Klimt’s friend and peer Egon Schiele. It remained in his possession until late in his life.\n \n\n   \n  The art dealer Serge Sabarsky acquired Lederer’s portrait in 1983, and sold it two years later to Lauder, who had taken a prudent interest in Klimt’s work. In the US, Klimt was a relatively obscure figure until the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum staged a joint exhibition with Schiele in 1965. Lauder, who was Hungarian and Czech, began collecting his works in the 1970s in part due to his own family’s ties to the region.\n \n\n   \n  “I can’t emphasize enough that he was a real historian. He was fascinated by European history… and cultural history,” Braun said of Lauder. “So on the one hand, you have his direct family connection and heritage. On the other, you have the historian’s awareness of Klimt and what he represented at the apex of Viennese culture. And thirdly, you have the sheer beauty and aesthetic strength of these pictures, which he recognized immediately. He had an incredible eye.”\n \n\n   \n  Klimt may be best recognized by his golden period, during which he produced the gilded Art Nouveau icons “The Kiss” and “Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.” But in the years before his death, at age 55, his geometric motifs became more fluid, his brushstrokes looser, and he was greatly influenced by East Asian art, of which he was an avid collector. The figures he painted around Lederer in her portrait were likely based on works of Chinese art that Klimt owned, according to Sotheby’s, while the Chinese dragon robe she wears in the painting was meant to be a striking symbol of power. It has been said that the artist did not want to part with the painting, which took years to complete.\n \n\n   \n  For a long time, the portrait of Lederer still carried the weight of her marriage — but that changed while in Lauder’s possession. Though Lederer was just 20 years old and unmarried when Klimt painted her, her portrait was called “Portrait of Baroness Elisabeth Bachofen-Echt” when he acquired it. Braun advised Lauder to change it, she recalled.\n \n\n   \n  “I said to Leonard, ‘It’s not right.’ This was commissioned while she was single. It was commissioned by her family, and her husband treated her so badly — why are we calling it by this title?” Braun said. “So we reverted to the original title, and that’s what it’s called now.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/11/asia/suharto-indonesia-national-hero-explainer-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Suharto, US-backed dictator, named national hero of Indonesia in controversial move","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former Indonesian leader Suharto, a US-backed military dictator known for overseeing mass killings during the 1965 anti-communist purge and a 31-year authoritarian rule, has been posthumously named a national hero by President Prabowo Subianto, a former general and son-in-law of Suharto.

Why is he now being named a national hero? \n       \n  By Jessie Yeung, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:39 AM EST, Tue November 11, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  For decades, he was a feared US-backed dictator whose regime oversaw bloody Cold War-era massacres, accused of diverting huge amounts of state money to propel his family into luxury and political power.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, he was posthumously named a national hero of Indonesia – prompting protests from human rights groups and victims who decried the award as whitewashing a repressive regime that left hundreds of thousands dead, according to historians.\n \n\n   \n  Former President Suharto was granted the title in a ceremony by Indonesia’s current leader, Prabowo Subianto – Suharto’s former son-in-law, himself a divisive figure as a former general who faced his own allegations of human rights abuses while in uniform.\n \n\n   \n  “A prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,” an announcer said during the award presentation,  according to Reuters .\n \n\n   \n  But as the roiling controversy shows, that characterization is hotly debated – and Suharto’s legacy is anything but straightforward.\n \n\n   \n    Who was Suharto?\n \n\n   \n  Born in 1921 when Indonesia was still a Dutch colony, Suharto rose to power after the country gained independence in 1949, climbing the army ranks to become a five-star general.\n \n\n   \n  Then came a bloodbath in 1965, sparked by a failed coup and the murder of a number of generals in the military.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto blamed the coup on communists, ousted then-President Sukarno – the country’s first post-independence leader – and sanctioned a hunt for those responsible.\n \n\n   \n  What ensued was a nationwide purge of alleged communists overseen by Suharto’s powerful military, with human rights groups and historians estimating that between 500,000 to one million people were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The United States supported the anti-communist massacres, providing lists of senior communist party officials, equipment and money to the Indonesian army, according to official documents that were  declassified in 2017 .\n \n\n   \n  In one document in late 1965, the US embassy in Jakarta sent a cable to Washington calling the crackdowns a “fantastic switch which has occurred over 10 short weeks,” along with an estimate that 100,000 people had been slaughtered, according to  the Associated Press .\n \n\n   \n  Many contend that those targeted during the purges were not communists but ethnic Chinese, or anyone with left wing views.\n \n\n   \n  In 2016, an international tribunal at the Hague found that the US, United Kingdom, and Australia were  all complicit  in the mass killings of 1965, which were deemed crimes against humanity.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto stayed in power for 31 years, during which he cracked down on critics and political opponents, and enforced his regime’s rule over territories including East Timor, Aceh, West  Papua  and the Maluku islands.\n \n\n   \n  Some of those territories were invaded with the tacit support of Western allies keen to prop up an anti-communist leader, at a time when proxy conflicts backed by the US and the Soviet Union raged across the Global South.\n \n\n   \n  He is praised by some for policies that fueled rapid economic growth and relative political stability. But at the same time, he siphoned off huge sums of money from state coffers, funding his family’s rich lifestyle and fueling public resentment.\n \n\n   \n  His rule finally came to an end in 1998 after the Asian financial crisis threw the country into economic turmoil, prompting widespread protests and forcing Suharto to resign – one of the last people power movements to sweep Southeast Asia and replace a Cold War-era autocrat with democracy.\n \n\n   \n  In the following years, Suharto’s children were prosecuted, and his youngest was convicted of corruption. In 2015, the Supreme Court ordered Suharto’s family to  pay back millions  in embezzled funds to the state.\n \n\n   \n  But Suharto himself never answered to his victims. Due to health problems in his final years, he died in 2008 without ever standing trial. He denied any wrongdoing until his death, at one point calling the embezzlement allegations “slander and defamation.”\n \n\n   \n    Why would Prabowo name Suharto a national hero?\n \n\n   \n  It’s not lost on many that Suharto was granted the posthumous honor by Prabowo – a longtime supporter of Suharto’s regime, and once a part of the strongman’s family.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo married Suharto’s daughter in 1983, though they divorced after Suharto was forced from power.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo was also a military commander during Suharto’s reign and served in controversial campaigns in West Papua and East Timor, casting doubts over his own human rights record. He is accused of kidnapping activists during the 1998 mass protests that led to Suharto’s downfall.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo has always denied the allegations that led to his dismissal from the military in 1998, the same year Indonesia broke free from Suharto’s authoritarian rule.\n \n\n   \n  Prabowo was  elected president in 2024  – with Suharto’s  former party, Golkar , throwing its support behind the candidate. During  his victory speech , Prabowo paid tribute to Suharto and thanked his ex-wife.\n \n\n   \n  At the time, some human rights experts voiced concerns that his presidency risked backsliding on the democratic gains made since Suharto’s authoritarian regime.\n \n\n   \n  Since then, Prabowo has expanded the military’s role into what were considered civilian areas, measures  heavily criticized  by civil society groups who say it would bring Indonesia back to Suharto-era militarism and authoritarianism.\n \n\n   \n  Besides Prabowo’s involvement, there are also still a number of Suharto loyalists in Indonesia. His political heirs have also tried to  redeem his image  in the last decade, portraying him instead as a strong leader who brought stability to the country.\n \n\n   \n  In places like Kemusuk, a village near Yogyakarta where he was born, his image is everywhere – from museum memorabilia celebrating his life to the souvenir T-shirts with his smiling face.\n \n\n   \n  Discussion of his rule remains largely taboo in Indonesia, with mixed opinions about his legacy.\n \n\n   \n    What has been the response?\n \n\n   \n  Ahead of the ceremony on Monday, activists gathered last week in Jakarta to protest against the act, holding placards that read: “Human rights violator” and “Suharto is not a hero.”\n \n\n   \n  Human rights groups lambasted the choice, with Amnesty International describing it as an attempt to rewrite history and pointing out Prabowo’s familial ties to Suharto.\n \n\n   \n  Andreas Harsono, the Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, also condemned the move.\n \n\n   \n  “The failure to hold (Soharto) and his abusive generals to account facilitates the whitewashing and distortion of history that is now taking place under Prabowo,” he wrote  in a statement .\n \n\n   \n  “This will make it even harder for Indonesian authorities now, and in the future, to end impunity for serious human rights violations and obtain justice for the victims and their families.”\n \n\n   \n  The title especially stings for the many survivors of violence and persecution under Suharto’s rule – and the families of his victims.\n \n\n   \n  “I was shocked, disappointed and angry with this government’s absurd decision,” Bedjo Untung told the  Associated Press.  Untong was imprisoned without trial for alleged Communist links between 1970-1979, during which he was tortured and his family faced hardship and discrimination.\n \n\n   \n  “It feels deeply unfair, we are still living with the suffering until today,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  Suharto’s defenders have taken a different view.\n \n\n   \n  “We don’t need to defend it ourselves… nothing is being hidden,” Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, Suharto’s daughter, told journalists after the ceremony on Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “We have expressed our gratitude to the president for appointing our father as the national hero and maybe because he is also a soldier so he knows what my father had done,” she added.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/israel-parliament-death-penalty-foreign-media-hnk-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:47:00-04:00","title":"Controversial death penalty and foreign media bills clear first reading in Israel’s parliament","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Israeli parliament has advanced two controversial bills: one expanding the death penalty to include terrorism and nationalist-motivated murder, championed by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and supported by Netanyahu after a ceasefire in Gaza, and another allowing the government to shut down foreign media outlets without judicial oversight, modeled after the 2024 closure of Al Jazeera.

It also rules out any option of allowing extenuating circumstances in the sentencing. Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to military law, while Israeli settlers are subject to Israeli civilian law.\n \n\n   \n  The UN has previously condemned Israel’s military courts in the occupied West Bank, saying that “Palestinians’ right to due process guarantees have been violated” for decades, and denounced “the lack of fair trial in the occupied West Bank.”\n \n\n   \n  UN experts said last year that, “in the occupied West Bank, the functions of police, investigator, prosecutor, and judge are vested in the same hierarchical institution – the Israeli military.”\n \n\n   \n    Foreign media bill\n \n\n   \n  In the same session, lawmakers also approved the first reading of a separate bill that would allow the Israeli government to shut down foreign media outlets without a court order.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal seeks to formalize what has been dubbed the “Al Jazeera Law,” after the Qatari network’s operations in Israel  were shuttered in 2024  by the Ministry of Communications. The ministry accused Al Jazeera of anti-Israel bias and of supporting Hamas through its coverage of the Gaza war.\n \n\n   \n  Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied those accusations and  condemned its closure  in Israel. Multiple Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza have also been killed by Israeli forces over the last two years.\n \n\n   \n  The new foreign media legislation, introduced by Likud lawmaker Ariel Kallner and backed by Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition, would make such powers permanent — even outside times of war or national emergency — and remove the requirement for judicial oversight.\n \n\n   \n  Reporters Without Borders (RSF)  condemned the proposal , calling it “the first nail in the coffin of broadcast media’s editorial independence in Israel.”\n \n\n   \n  “Against a backdrop of war and an upcoming election campaign, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is seeking to silence voices critical of the far-right coalition in power,” said RSF editorial director Anne Bocandé. “These legislative attacks will have lasting, negative consequences on Israel’s media landscape,” she warned.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/markets/warren-buffett-shareholder-letter","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"21:59:00-05:00","title":"Warren Buffett: ‘I’m going quiet’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Warren Buffett, the 95-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announces he will step down from the CEO role at the end of 2025 and will no longer write the annual shareholder letter, marking a significant transition in the company’s public communication.

  \n  By Jordan Valinsky, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:59 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Warren Buffett,  in his annual message  as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway to shareholders – a tradition dating back to 1965 – said that he will be “going quiet” after he steps down at the end of this year. But the 95-year-old is not going away just yet.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett will no longer write the message atop the company’s annual report, but he will continue to deliver an annual Thanksgiving message, and he will “step up” his philanthropy, giving away the $149 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock he continues to hold.\n \n\n   \n  “The Oracle of Omaha” has become an investing icon, a billionaire who has cultivated a folksy image, particularly through his letters to shareholders. Although his market moves are closely followed by investors around the world, Buffett has also worked to present himself as a cheerleader for America and ordinary Americans – and for capitalism.\n \n\n   \n  He is being replaced by Greg Abel next year. Abel, 63, is the vice chairman of non-insurance operations of Berkshire and was designated as Buffett’s successor in 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett once again praised his successor, writing that he “has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire’s next CEO.”\n \n\n   \n  Buffett   also gave an update on his health, admitting that to his “surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people.”\n \n\n   \n  But the nonagenarian isn’t getting any younger. Acknowledging the limited time he has left and the giant sum of money he wishes to give away, Buffett said he converted 1,800 shares, worth a combined $1.35 billion, into the company’s cheaper “B shares” and delivered them to four of his family’s foundations Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “To improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them, I need to step up the pace of lifetime gifts to their three foundations,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett says he has high – but realistic – expectations that the conglomerate he led for six decades will continue to thrive after he steps down as CEO. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) shares have risen more than 10% this year, with the company sitting on a $1 trillion market cap.\n \n\n   \n  “In aggregate, Berkshire’s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems,” he wrote. “However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll.”\n \n\n   \n    The oracle and his ice cream\n \n\n   \n  Buffett has managed to become a symbol of two seemingly disparate things over his decades in the spotlight: a relentless dealmaker and capitalist, wrapped up in an avuncular figure dispensing practical advice.\n \n\n   \n  Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meetings are like those of no other company, dubbed Woodstock for capitalists, with an exhibit floor showing off many of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway’s businesses.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, Buffett himself makes a point to appear on the floor and hype up those companies, from eating Dairy Queen ice cream to putting his face and name on limited-edition event merch, all while his security keeps back hordes of shareholding fans trying to take pictures or get a word in with the so-called Oracle of Omaha.\n \n\n   \n  His investing strategy has turned on an incessant search for value, with Berkshire Hathaway often sitting on giant piles of cash until just the right deal comes through. Few other CEOs have earned that level of patience from investors in a market that more often turns on expectations for short-term returns.\n \n\n   \n  Buffett expects the company to move on from him. But so much of Berkshire’s identity has become intertwined with its CEO. It’s hard to imagine the low-profile Greg Abel, for example, putting  his face on a ketchup bottle  to spur sales. Woodstock for capitalists might get just a little less festive from now on.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/asia/thailand-suspends-peace-accord-cambodia-intl-hnk","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:39:00-05:00","title":"Thailand ‘halts’ peace agreement with Cambodia hailed by Trump after landmine explosion injures troops","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thailand has suspended its peace agreement with Cambodia, signed in October 2025 in Malaysia and praised by former US President Donald Trump, following a landmine explosion on the border that injured four Thai soldiers.

Thailand and Cambodia then signed a peace declaration in Malaysia in late October in a ceremony witnessed by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the supreme commander of Thailand’s armed forces, Gen. Ukris Boontanondha, said he was “halting all agreements until Cambodia clearly and sincerely demonstrates that it will not be ‘hostile’,” according to a Facebook post from Thailand’s armed forces.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said: “Everything must stop.”\n \n\n   \n  “What we have been implementing all along — at this point, must now be considered halted until there is clarity,” Anutin said at the Royal Thai Police headquarters Monday.\n \n\n   \n  “What has happened has meant that the hostility that we thought would decrease against the threat to national security has not decreased. Since it has not decreased, we cannot proceed with anything beyond this.”\n \n\n   \n  The apparent major U-turn came after a landmine explosion injured four Thai soldiers in Sisaket province, northeastern Thailand, on the volatile border with Cambodia Monday.\n \n\n   \n  One soldier’s right leg was severed in the blast, while another suffered shrapnel wounds to the leg, the army said. The incident happened while troops were on a “routine patrol along a frequently used route,” said Maj. Gen. Winthai Suvaree, spokesperson for the Royal Thai Army.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand accused Cambodia of laying fresh landmines following the removal of a barbed wire fence, which was discovered on November 9.\n \n\n   \n  Winthai said the discovery “violates the signed joint declaration and will inevitably impact Thailand’s stance and various agreements.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN cannot independently verify the claims that Cambodian troops laid fresh landmines.\n \n\n   \n  The Cambodian government said in a statement it “categorically denies the allegations,” adding that it has not deployed new landmines “and will never do so.”\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia also said it is “gravely concerned” about reports that Thailand has suspended the peace declaration and it remains committed to implementing the peace accord.\n \n\n   \n  “Most minefields, from nearly three decades of Cambodia’s civil wars of the 1970s and 1980s, along the Cambodia-Thailand border have not yet been cleared due to the difficult terrains and the un-demarcated status of the border areas,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The situation remains calm,” Cambodia’s Ministry of Defense spokesperson said Tuesday after military forces from both sides communicated following the landmine explosion.\n \n\n   \n  The announcement from Thailand also calls into question the already tentative release of 18 Cambodian prisoners of war, who were scheduled to be handed over under the terms of the declaration.\n \n\n   \n    A fragile peace agreement\n \n\n   \n  In late October, Trump traveled to Malaysia as part of his three-leg tour of Asia and presided over the signing of a  peace declaration  between the leaders of Thailand Cambodia amid lavish praise of the US president for his mediation efforts in the border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The moment was considered by Trump as a major diplomatic victory, and another fillip to his much vaunted –  and often over-exaggerated  – campaign to have ended several wars.\n \n\n   \n  Thailand and Cambodia have fought brief skirmishes in recent decades over their disputed border and the fighting earlier was some of the most serious in years. Each side accused the other of starting the latest border flare-up and traded blame for the clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Trump had warned the two leaders that he would not make trade deals with either if the conflict continued – a threat that came as both faced elevated tariffs from the US under Trump’s global trade war.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration included a commitment to withdraw heavy weapons from the border, de-mining efforts, and to de-escalate tensions that erupted into the brief but deadly border conflict.\n \n\n   \n  The agreement was built on the truce signed in July, but fell short of a “peace treaty,” despite Trump  repeatedly describing  it as such. And  analysts had cautioned  of a long road ahead before a lasting peace deal would be achieved.\n \n\n   \n  Anutin had qualified the signing ceremony as a “concrete step towards peace” that would hinge on “full implementation” of the declaration. And Thai diplomats were carefully reticent about the joint declaration, calling it a “reaffirmation” of a ceasefire  both sides agreed  to in July.\n \n\n   \n  Hun Manet, the prime minister of Cambodia announced at the time “a strong commitment to fully and faithfully implementing this joint declaration.”\n \n\n   \n  The issue of landmines along the Thai-Cambodia border has also been a major point of contention for the Thais. The most recent border flare-up came after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion, with the incident prompting Thailand to downgrade diplomatic relations with its neighbor.\n \n\n   \n  In recent decades, Thailand and Cambodia have had a complicated relationship of both cooperation and rivalry. The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border – largely mapped by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony – that has periodically seen military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  Cambodia has previously sought a ruling from the UN’s International Court of Justice over disputed areas. However, Thailand does not recognize the ICJ’s jurisdiction and claims that some areas along the border were never fully demarcated, including the sites of several ancient temples.\n \n\n   \n  The site of the most recent landmine explosion was in an area close to Cambodia’s Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site that has been at the center of previous military clashes.\n \n\n   \n  The peace declaration did not resolve the territorial dispute over the two countries’ shared border.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/trump-china-france-students-universities","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"21:55:00-05:00","title":"Trump defends enrolling Chinese students at US universities — and takes a swipe at France","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"President Donald Trump defended the continued enrollment of Chinese students at U.S. universities, arguing that international students—especially from China—bring educational and cultural value, while criticizing France in a back-and-forth with Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham, who claimed the French are better.

\n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:11 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On the 38th day, the logjam began to break.\n \n\n   \n  After Republicans rejected a Democratic proposal to  reopen the government , a small group of moderate Democrats met with Majority Leader John Thune on Friday, forging a path toward resolving the record-long shutdown, multiple sources familiar with the negotiations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  By Sunday evening, the cross-aisle talks opened between Thune and Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Maggie Hassan, Angus King and Tim Kaine had yielded a deal that  eight Democrats broke ranks  to advance. By Monday evening, the Senate had  voted 60-40   to pass the measure, which now heads to the House before  President Donald Trump  – who’s signaled support — can sign anything.\n \n\n   \n  The government could now be reopened by the end of the week. What comes next is far less certain, with questions looming about the fallout for both parties as Democrats face internal recriminations and Republicans are forced to grapple with the political liabilities of rising health care premiums.\n \n\n   \n  The White House has sought to limit its public comments on the deal, wary of disrupting a tentative agreement that still faces a tricky path through the House. But internally, the sudden end to the impasse prompted a sense of vindication that the outcome that officials had predicted for weeks had finally come to pass, people familiar with the matter said.\n \n\n   \n  Trump and his top aides had decided in September to take a hard line against negotiating with Democrats, confident that the party would cave as soon as it became clear they wouldn’t win any concessions from the administration.\n \n\n   \n  “I think he made a mistake in going too far,” Trump told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in an interview Monday about Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against the deal later Monday but who had been kept in the loop on the moderates’ conversations with Thune, one of the sources familiar said.\n \n\n   \n  “He just went too far. He thought he could break the Republicans, and the Republicans broke him,” Trump added.\n \n\n   \n  But reaching that point took far longer than anyone in the White House anticipated; many officials believed Democrats would fold in a matter of hours to days. It also came at a cost, with Trump and Republicans taking the brunt of the public blame for the shutdown, culminating in a brutal set of state-level electoral losses last week.\n \n\n   \n  Spooked by those results, Trump in recent days had begun urging Republicans to abandon their strategy and unilaterally open the government by  eliminating the filibuster  — an idea that proved deeply unpopular with GOP leaders and succeeded only in dividing his party.\n \n\n   \n  Yet even as urgency built within the administration to find an end to the shutdown, officials contended that a similar level of pressure must be building on the Democratic side. In the weeks leading up to Sunday’s breakthrough, Trump aides  had privately discussed minor concessions  they might be willing to make to help Republican senators clinch an eventual deal, two people familiar with the deliberations said.\n \n\n   \n  Still, few expected the opportunity would come when it did, with Democrats riding high from the elections and their base louder than ever in urging them to hold the line.\n \n\n   \n  As the talks between Democratic moderates and Thune accelerated, some of the potential concessions that aides had contemplated quickly became a central component of the bipartisan agreement, as Democrats pressed for a reversal of the mass firings of federal workers that the administration had carried out during the shutdown and protections against future layoffs.\n \n\n   \n  The White House agreed. On Monday, Kaine told CNN that a provision barring further reductions in force through January had been key to convincing him to sign on to the deal.\n \n\n   \n  “I was the one negotiating the federal worker protections, and when I got a yes from the White House at 4:45 yesterday on the key component of guaranteeing no future RIFs, that was very persuasive to me,” the Virginia Democrat said.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats were also able to secure furloughed federal employees’ back pay — but not the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that had been their original and consistent demand.\n \n\n   \n  The acceptance of the deal came from a realization among Democrats that Republicans simply were not going to cave on that issue.\n \n\n   \n  “The question I was wrestling with is: if the tactic isn’t working and there were no prospects that it was going to work, then let’s move on, not make a lot of other people suffer in order to get a goal that wasn’t attainable,” King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said on CNN Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  There was immediate blowback. Leading Democratic figures and potential 2028 presidential candidates railed against the deal and its negotiators. House Democratic leadership even urged their members to put out statements calling on Democratic senators to hold the line Sunday night, a source familiar with the messaging push told CNN, and a range of House Democrats rushed to announce their “no” votes.\n \n\n   \n  But within the group of eight Democratic senators, the lawmakers argued that they’d made the only sensible move available, especially as the pain mounted for everyday Americans.\n \n\n   \n  “Now I understand that not all of my Democratic colleagues are satisfied with this agreement, but waiting another week or another month wouldn’t deliver a better outcome,” said Shaheen, who’s not running for reelection to her New Hampshire seat next year.\n \n\n   \n  While the quartet of Democratic former governors had worked in overdrive through a combination of meetings and phone calls out of King’s Senate hideaway, those negotiations hadn’t just begun over the weekend.\n \n\n   \n  Shaheen, Hassan — also from New Hampshire — and King had been quietly talking with Republican leadership for weeks to lay the groundwork for a deal. Thune had long said that the path toward a deal would be through conversations with rank-and-file Democrats, not Democratic leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Kaine told reporters that he spoke with Thune and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama throughout the negotiations over the weekend and made the case directly that the deal needed to include a moratorium on firings of federal employees.\n \n\n   \n  Asked whether he wished Democrats had cut a deal sooner, Kaine, who didn’t truly join the negotiations until after Tuesday’s elections, said of Republicans: “I didn’t fully understand how dug in they were.”\n \n\n   \n  In fact, moderate Democrats had agreed to give Schumer and their fellow Democratic senators one last shot to do it their way on Friday, filing into the chamber behind the New York Democrat as he presented his party’s latest offer to open the government in exchange for extending the ACA subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  But Republicans rejected it as a nonstarter.\n \n\n   \n  “Plan A was over on Friday when Republicans ruled it out,” one of the sources familiar with the negotiations told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  The eventual deal they did accept, however, presents a new quandary for the GOP. With Thune promising a separate vote on the subsidies next month, White House aides are already turning their attention to hashing out a coherent position on health care.\n \n\n   \n  “I think the question is how they push back on the inevitable Democratic narrative that Republicans are killing health care in the US,” one of the people familiar with the matter said. “What is the Republican response to the inevitable refrain: ‘They don’t have a plan.’”\n \n\n   \n  Said Shaheen: “We have a guaranteed vote by a guaranteed date on a bill that we will write, not that the Republicans will write.”\n \n\n   \n  Pressed on Republicans’ message on health care during a Fox Business interview on Monday, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair indicated the answer remained a work in progress.\n \n\n   \n  “We have a good plan to be able to address some of these issues that will begin to be worked on in earnest now,” Blair said, without offering specifics. “I expect that we’ll see action on that very soon.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/senate-vote-government-shutdown-funding","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:50:00.000-05:00","title":"Senate votes to end government shutdown, sending funding bill to the House","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate narrowly voted 60 to 40 to approve a bipartisan funding bill that ends the longest government shutdown in history, with eight Democratic senators crossing party lines to support it.

  \nUpdated: \n        10:50 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A small band of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans on Monday night to approve a funding measure to reopen the federal government — without securing their party’s demand to guarantee an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which help millions of Americans afford insurance.\n \n\n   \n  The funding compromise will now go to the House, where GOP leaders are hopeful it could pass as soon as Wednesday and end the longest-ever US shutdown. The recently struck deal, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign, would restore critical services like federal food aid, as well as pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n \n\n   \n  Eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus crossed the aisle to join with Republicans in the 60 to 40 vote. One Republican voted in opposition: Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n \n\n   \n  That shutdown has been politically painful on Capitol Hill. Republicans have repeatedly shouldered blame in  recent polling  for the funding lapse. And the deal, struck by Democratic centrists in the Senate, has ignited a fight within the party about its strategy in the already 41-day funding fight — and where they go next.\n \n\n   \n  Most Democrats were eager to keep fighting even as centrists declared that with Trump dug in, there was no real chance of securing policy wins on health care. Instead, those centrists secured the promise of a future vote on a health care bill of their choosing, which Democrats are determined to win GOP support on. It is far from guaranteed, however, that the bill will survive the Senate, let alone the House.\n \n\n   \n  The vote late Monday night caps a frenetic few days of negotiations inside the US Capitol, with quiet negotiations between the Senate centrists, GOP leaders and the White House throughout the weekend before formally unveiling their deal on Sunday. A bloc of eight members of the Democratic caucus took a critical first step to support that measure Sunday night, and all eight gave it final approval on Monday night.\n \n\n   \n  Those eight lawmakers were: Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin, Maggie Hassan, Tim Kaine, Jeanne Shaheen, Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman, Jacky Rosen and Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  While he did not vote for the final deal, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has drawn fury from the party’s left for allowing those centrists to strike the deal without any real wins on the Affordable Care Act subsidies that will soon expire and hike premiums for millions of Americans.\n \n\n   \n  Many Democrats in both chambers believe the party will be forced to relive the fight again on January 30, when the next tranche of funding runs out. The broader legislative package, however, would fund several key agencies, including ones that run federal food aid, as well as the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program, and veterans programs, through the remainder of fiscal year 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Now, attention will turn to House Speaker Mike Johnson and members of the House, who are making their way to Washington after being in their districts since mid-September.\n \n\n   \n  The House plans to vote on the Senate-passed bill to reopen the federal government as early as 4 p.m. on Wednesday, according to a notice from Majority Whip Tom Emmer. The notice forecasts multiple votes that day.\n \n\n   \n  The Republican speaker is likely to need the president’s help to muscle the package through his fractious conference in the coming days. But in an optimistic sign Monday, Trump told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins “I would say so” when asked if he personally approved of the deal making its way through the process on Capitol Hill.\n \n\n   \n  “I think, based on everything I’m hearing, they haven’t changed anything, and we have support from enough Democrats, and we’re going to be opening up our country,” Trump said. “It’s too bad it was closed, but we’ll be opening up our country very quickly.”\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Ellis Kim contributed to this report. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/08/us/melodee-buzzard-missing-search-update","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:24:00-05:00","title":"Wig disguises, a swapped license plate and a 1,000-mile drive: Where the search for 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard stands","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A 9-year-old girl, Melodee Buzzard, went missing in October 2025 after her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, reportedly took her on a 1,000-mile road trip across six states, with the last sighting near the Colorado-Utah state line on October 9.

month since Ashlee Buzzard packed her 9-year-old daughter Melodee into a rental car and left their home state of California — only to return three days later with no child and plenty of unanswered questions in tow, authorities say.\n \n\n   \n  As investigators  search for Melodee , they say their probe has uncovered a series of wigged disguises, a sprawling multistate road trip, and an “uncooperative” mother who has provided “no verifiable explanation” of her daughter’s whereabouts.\n \n\n   \n  The case took an unexpected turn on Friday when  Buzzard, 40, was arrested  on a charge of false imprisonment — but not for the disappearance of her daughter. “This crime is not connected to the ongoing search for Melodee, however, detectives are unable to fully outline the crime as it would impede their ongoing investigation,” the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what we know about the case — and the many questions that still remain.\n \n\n   \n    A

been participating in the remote study program her mother had recently enrolled her in.\n \n\n   \n  School district officials in the child’s hometown of Lompoc say Melodee was enrolled in August in an independent study program, which allows students to learn from home. That was  the last month  she was seen by the school, the sheriff’s office has said.\n \n\n   \n  It is not clear whether the school last saw Melodee virtually or in person, but the sheriff’s office said an administrator contacted police for a welfare check after her “prolonged absence.”\n \n\n   \n  The school’s August sighting helped narrow detectives’ timeline at the beginning of the investigation, when authorities were working with outdated childhood photos and family members who said they had not seen Melodee for years.\n \n\n   \n  In an interview  with NewsNation  last month, Melodee’s aunt, Lizabeth Meza, said she had not seen her niece in four years. The aunt said their extended family largely lost contact with the child after her father died in a motorcycle accident when she was a baby.\n \n\n   \n  When Melodee’s school asked for a welfare check on October 14, officers arrived at her mother’s home but only found Buzzard, who “provided  no verifiable explanation  for Melodee’s whereabouts,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Officers searched the home, but Melodee was nowhere to be found.\n \n\n   \n  The  sheriff’s office  said this week Buzzard “has remained uncooperative and has not confirmed Melodee’s location or welfare.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Buzzard.\n \n\n   \n    Melodee likely disappeared during a whirlwind multistate road trip\n \n\n   \n  Detectives have narrowed their investigation to a small but very eventful three-day window from October 7-10, in which they believe the mother drove Melodee more than 1,000 miles away — as far as Nebraska — crossing at least six states and trading license plates and disguises as they went.\n \n\n   \n  At the end of the three-day trip, Buzzard returned home with the rental car, this time without Melodee.\n \n\n   \n  The last time Melodee was seen was on October 9 in an area around the Colorado and Utah state line. Here’s what  investigators say happened  on their trip:\n \n\n   \n  Finding Melodee now hinges on detectives unearthing what happened to the girl after she was last seen on October 9.\n \n\n   \n  The sheriff’s office released a  travel-route map  of where they believe the mother and daughter traveled between October 9 and 10, and is asking businesses, gas stations, hotels, rest stops and residents along the route to review surveillance camera footage that may catch a glimpse of the child.\n \n\n   \n    A series of wigs may have provided quick disguises, investigators say\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who came across the mother and daughter may not recognize them in some publicly released pictures, as authorities believe Buzzard may have taken steps to conceal their identities, including tucking her daughter’s ringlet curls under a smooth wig.\n \n\n   \n  Surveillance footage from the rental car business in Lompoc on October 7 showed Buzzard and Melodee in what appeared to be wigs, the sheriff’s office said in a release that  shared a clip  of the video.\n \n\n   \n  Over the next three days, authorities say Buzzard appeared to swap wigs, trading fake, honey blonde curls for a darker wig closer to the style Melodee was seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “This change in appearance is believed to have been intentional to avoid recognition during travel,” the release said.\n \n\n   \n  Melodee’s grandmother, Lilly Denes, told CNN affiliate  KSBY  that when she first saw the surveillance images, she was overwhelmed.\n \n\n   \n  “I was totally numb and in shock. … This is just so shocking to me in that my granddaughter is dressed in a disguise,” Denes told the affiliate.\n \n\n   \n  “If she’s listening, we love you. We’re here for you, and we just want you to be happy,” the grandmother said. “Call me. There are numbers on the TV that you can call, and I will come pick you up.”\n \n\n   \n    Mother is accused of falsely imprisoning someone in unrelated charge\n \n\n   \n  In a sudden turn of events on Friday, the sheriff’s office  announced  while they were investigating Melodee’s disappearance, they learned her mother had recently “prevented a victim from leaving a location against their will.”\n \n\n   \n  “Although this arrest occurred during the course of the missing person investigation, it is not directly related to Melodee’s disappearance,” the sheriff’s office said.\n \n\n   \n  Buzzard has been charged with a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, according to the Santa Barbara County District Attorney’s Office. She is being held at a county jail with bail set at $100,000, records show.\n \n\n   \n  Prosecutors say the incident happened in Lompoc on November 6 and involved a person who is not Melodee, but investigators have so far been reluctant to share more details.\n \n\n   \n  The arrest comes about a week after the  FBI served search warrants  at Buzzard’s home and a storage locker, as well as the rental car Melodee was last seen in.\n \n\n   \n  “Sheriff’s detectives remain fully focused on locating Melodee and confirming her safety,” the Friday release said.\n \n\n   \n  Anyone who has seen Melodee or may have information about her whereabouts is encouraged to call the sheriff’s office or leave  an anonymous tip .\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/us/ashlee-buzzard-arrest-melodee-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:09:00-05:00","title":"Mother of missing 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard arrested on false imprisonment charge","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The mother of missing 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard, Ashlee Buzzard, was arrested on a felony charge of false imprisonment by violence, which authorities say is not directly related to her daughter’s disappearance.

Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  So much of the coverage of President Donald Trump’s pardons is focused on how political they are. And they are certainly political — extraordinarily so.\n \n\n   \n  But as Trump’s  latest batch of pardons  reinforces, that’s only half the story.\n \n\n   \n  The more ominous trend is not just that he’s pardoning political allies; it’s that he’s pardoning allies  in very transactional ways .\n \n\n   \n  He’s pardoning lots and lots of people who helped Trump, specifically.\n \n\n   \n  After previously dangling pardons over allies involved in sensitive investigations involving Trump himself — and later delivering those pardons — he’s now pardoned oodles of people who took illegal or legally dubious action on his behalf.\n \n\n   \n  Trump is creating a permission structure in which people will credibly think they can’t be held accountable in federal court, as long as what they’re doing benefits Trump. He’s been cultivating this for a long time, but he seems to be getting more brazen about it.\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s most recent pardons, which were announced overnight by Justice Department official Ed Martin, are for 77 people who played roles in trying to overturn his 2020 election loss. These officials include former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and the president’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, along with many of the people involved in the so-called fake electors scheme.\n \n\n   \n  The pardons are symbolic, in that these people haven’t actually been charged with federal crimes. Some of them face state-level charges, for which Trump cannot pardon them.\n \n\n   \n  But that’s also what makes these so notable. Trump is using this symbolic gesture to expand the ranks of people who went to great and legally dubious lengths to help him try to overturn the 2020 election and who later received pardons.\n \n\n   \n  When you combine these new pardons with the pardons and commutations given to  January 6, 2021, defendants  and Trump allies who testified in cases involving the president, across his two terms Trump has now pardoned more than 1,650 people who played significant roles in matters involving him personally.\n \n\n   \n  Those people account for more than 84% of pardons and commutations awarded by Trump. (Trump has otherwise  been remarkably stingy  with his clemency powers, when the matters didn’t involve him or his allies.)\n \n\n   \n  And many of these people engaged in violence,  including against police , in the name of helping Trump.\n \n\n   \n  What message does that send to other people who might go to remarkable lengths to help Trump carry out his agenda? To participate in legally dubious administration actions — things like  its boat strikes in the Caribbean ? To carry out his deportation agenda in rather brutal ways? Or to perhaps even try to help him stay in power, as more than 1,600 people did before receiving pardons for their actions?\n \n\n   \n  The sheer volume of these self-serving pardons is hardly the only indicator that Trump is wielding them for political and transactional purposes.\n \n\n   \n  Official reports from the various Russia investigations referred to how Trump  appeared to dangle pardons  over people who were in positions to provide potentially derogatory information about him. These people included former advisers Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn.\n \n\n   \n  Special counsel Robert Mueller  said in his report  that Trump’s repeated comments about potentially pardoning Manafort “had the potential to influence Manafort’s decision whether to cooperate with the government.”\n \n\n   \n  All were later pardoned by Trump in his first term. And perhaps most notably, Trump’s pardon of Manafort came after Manafort lied to investigators in ways that threw them off in a key portion of the probe.\n \n\n   \n  Manafort’s lies came after he cut a deal to cooperate with investigators. A bipartisan Senate report seemed to  regard these lies as particularly inexplicable , given they opened Manafort up to much more prison time.\n \n\n   \n  But ultimately, Manafort’s gamble appeared to pay off with Trump, when the president gave him the pardon he had repeatedly dangled as a potential reward for staying loyal.\n \n\n   \n  Both the Mueller report and the Senate report also referred to how Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said he was led to believe the Trump White House would help him with his pardon  if he stayed in line.\n \n\n   \n  Cohen told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he discussed a potential pardon with a  fellow Trump lawyer more than half a dozen times. He said the lawyer told him after he testified to Congress that Trump “heard that you did great, and don’t worry, everything’s going to be fine. He loves ya.”\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani himself also publicly floated pardons related to witnesses in the Russia investigation. He at one point  told the New York Daily News  that when “the whole thing is over, things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons.” He  told CNN  around the same time that “When it’s over, hey, he’s the president of the United States. He retains his pardon power. Nobody is taking that away from him.”\n \n\n   \n  And then there are the comments of another lawyer who figured prominently in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, John Eastman.\n \n\n   \n  Just a few days after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Eastman  emailed Giuliani , saying, “I’ve decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works.”\n \n\n   \n  We still don’t know who was keeping such a “pardon list,” or why. But it signaled that those around Trump seemed to sense their actions were at least legally problematic and were preparing accordingly very shortly after January 6.\n \n\n   \n  Indeed, some involved had either been  told their plans were illegal or acknowledged it  in the days and weeks beforehand, but they pressed forward anyway. Then they rather quickly seemed to start talking about pardons.\n \n\n   \n  Nearly five years later, Eastman has joined Giuliani in actually being on a Trump “pardon list.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/baseball-mlb-announces-gambling-safeguards","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:50:00-05:00","title":"MLB Announces New Gambling Safeguards After Guardians Pitchers Indicted in Betting Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Following the indictment of Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz for allegedly rigging pitches to facilitate fraudulent sports betting, Major League Baseball announced immediate restrictions on pitch-level wagers, capping individual bets at $200 and banning parlays on pitch outcomes.

Monday for “Flesh,” the story of an ordinary man’s life over several decades in which what isn’t on the page is just as important as what is.\n \n\n   \n  Szalay, 51, beat five other finalists, including favorites Andrew Miller and Kiran Desai, to take the coveted literary award, which brings a 50,000-pound ($66,000) payday and a big boost to the winner’s sales and profile.\n \n\n   \n  He was chosen from 153 submitted novels by a judging panel that included Irish writer Roddy Doyle and “Sex and the City” star Sarah Jessica Parker.\n \n\n   \n  Doyle said “Flesh” – a book “about living, and the strangeness of living” – emerged as the judges’ unanimous choice after a five-hour meeting.\n \n\n   \n  Szalay’s book recounts the life of taciturn István, from a teenage relationship with an older woman through time as a struggling immigrant in Britain to denizen of London high society. The author has said he wanted to write about a Hungarian immigrant, and “about life as a physical experience, about what it’s like to be a living body in the world.”\n \n\n   \n  Accepting his trophy at London’s Old Billingsgate – a former fish market turned glitzy events venue – Szalay thanked the judges for rewarding his “risky” novel.\n \n\n   \n  He recalled asking his editor “whether she could imagine a novel called ‘Flesh’ winning the Booker Prize.”\n \n\n   \n  “You have your answer,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Doyle, who chaired the judges, said István belongs to a group overlooked in fiction: a working-class man. He said that since reading it, he looks more closely when he walks past bouncers standing in the doorways of Dublin pubs.\n \n\n   \n  “I’m kind of giving him a second look, because I feel I might know him a bit better,” said Doyle, whose funny, poignant stories of working-class Dublin life won him the 1993 Booker Prize for “Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha.”\n \n\n   \n  “It presents us with a certain type of man that invites us to look behind the face.”\n \n\n   \n  Szalay, who was born in Canada, raised in the UK and lives in Vienna, was previously a Booker finalist in 2016 for “All That Man Is,” a series of stories about nine wildly different men.\n \n\n   \n  “Flesh” was praised by many critics but frustrated others with its refusal to fill in the gaps in István’s story – great swathes of life, including incarceration and wartime service in Iraq occur off the page – and its stubbornly unexpressive central character, whose most common remark is “Okay.”\n \n\n   \n  “We loved the spareness of the writing,” Doyle said. “We loved how so much was revealed without us being overly aware that it was being revealed … Watching this man grow, age, and learning so much about him – despite him, in a way.\n \n\n   \n  “If the gaps were filled, it would be less of a book,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  Szalay was considered an outsider for this year’s prize but had been rising up bookmakers’ odds in the days before Monday’s ceremony.\n \n\n   \n  The front-runners according to betting markets were British writer Miller for early-1960s domestic drama “The Land in Winter” and Indian author Desai for globe-spanning saga “The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny,” her first novel since “The Inheritance of Loss,” which won the Booker Prize in 2006.\n \n\n   \n  The other finalists were Susan Choi’s twisty family saga “Flashlight”; Katie Kitamura’s tale of acting and identity, “Audition”; and midlife-crisis road trip “The Rest of Our Lives” by Ben Markovits.\n \n\n   \n  The Booker Prize was founded in 1969 and has established a reputation for transforming writers’ careers.

A federal appeals court panel  affirmed the damages award  finding it “reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts” and rejected several of Trump’s legal challenges. Among them, the appeals court found that Trump had previously waived any claim of presidential immunity and said the Supreme Court’s decision last year involving criminal cases did not alter their view.\n \n\n   \n  Trump has asked for the full bench of judges to review the case. The Justice Department filed an amicus brief supporting review of whether presidential immunity can be waived “from civil damages liability predicated on official acts.”  Carroll’s response is due in the next few weeks.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/hannibal-gadhafi-released-lebanon-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:30:00-05:00","title":"Hannibal Gadhafi Released from Lebanese Detention After 10 Years","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Hannibal Gadhafi, the son of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, was released by Lebanese authorities in November 2025 after 10 years of detention, following a reduction of his bail from $11 million to $900,000 and the lifting of a travel ban.

Two security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, also confirmed that Gadhafi was set free.\n \n\n   \n  “Hannibal is officially free and has the full right to choose the destination that he wants,” al-Khoury said.

His lawyers said at the time that he didn’t have enough to pay that amount, and sought permission for him to leave the country.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, his bail was reduced to 80 billion Lebanese pounds (about $900,000) and the travel ban was lifted allowing him to leave the country once he pays the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The two judicial and one security official said the bail was paid by the Libyan delegation. The Justice Ministry of the Tripoli-based government also posted on its social media platforms that the Libyan delegation paid the bail.\n \n\n   \n  The judicial officials in Beirut said Gadhafi’s defense team withdrew a case against the Lebanese state that they had filed in Geneva last month over holding him without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Libya formally requested Hannibal Gadhafi’s release in 2023, citing his deteriorating health after he went on a hunger strike to protest his detention without trial.\n \n\n   \n  Detained in Lebanon in 2015, Gadhafi was accused of withholding information about the fate of Lebanese Shiite cleric Moussa al-Sadr who disappeared during a trip to Libya in 1978, although the late leader’s son was less than 3 years old at the time.\n \n\n   \n  Gadhafi had been living in exile in Syria with his Lebanese wife, Aline Skaf, and children until he was abducted in 2015 and brought to Lebanon by Lebanese militants who were demanding information about al-Sadr.\n \n\n   \n  Lebanese police later announced they had seized Gadhafi from the northeastern Lebanese city of Baalbek where he was being held, and he had been held ever since in a Beirut jail, where he faced questioning over al-Sadr’s disappearance.\n \n\n   \n  The case has been a long-standing sore point in Lebanon. The cleric’s family believes he may still be alive in a Libyan prison, though most Lebanese presume he is dead. He would be 96 years old.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sadr, who went missing with companions Abbas Badreddine and Mohammed Yacoub, was the founder of a Shiite political and military group that took part in the long Lebanese Civil War that began in 1975, largely pitting Muslims against Christians.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi was  killed by opposition fighters  during Libya’s 2011 uprising-turned-civil war, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.\n \n\n   \n  Hannibal Gadhafi, who was born nearly three years before al-Sadr disappeared, fled to Algeria after his father was toppled and Tripoli fell to opposition fighters, along with his mother and several other relatives. He later moved to Syria where he was given political asylum and stayed there until he was abducted.\n \n\n   \n  Moammar Gadhafi had eight children from two marriages.

streets of Washington, D.C., as part of President Donald Trump’s push to  send the military  into Democratic-run cities.\n \n\n   \n  Kanawha County Circuit Judge Richard D. Lindsay made the ruling after hearing arguments in a lawsuit by a civic organization that argued Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey exceeded his authority when he authorized the Guard’s deployment in August.\n \n\n   \n  “The question before this court is whether or not state law allows West Virginia to do this,” Lindsay said. “The court has found that.”\n \n\n   \n  The judge added: “This court believes that the federal law allows for the request made by the president to the governor.”\n \n\n   \n   West Virginia is among several states  that sent National Guard members to the nation’s capital. While the state National Guard has said its deployment could last until the end of November, it is consulting with the governor’s office and others on the possibility of extending the stay.\n \n\n   \n  Formal orders were issued last week  extending the deployment  of the District of Columbia’s National Guard in the city through the end of February.\n \n\n   \n  “We are pleased with the judge’s decision,” Jace Goins, the state’s chief deputy attorney general, said outside the court in Charleston. “The National Guard are going nowhere.

The state attorney general’s office sought to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacked standing to challenge Morrisey’s decision.\n \n\n   \n  “It was a simple issue of a broad, lawful request by the president and a lawful deployment by the governor. That’s all,” Goins said.\n \n\n   \n  Aubrey Sparks, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s West Virginia chapter, said she didn’t believe it was the correct decision.\n \n\n   \n  “I think that West Virginia law is clear,” Sparks said. “I think what the state was permitted to do here is to skirt past West Virginia law simply because Trump asked them to. And that’s not how the law works. We remain deeply concerned about it.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump issued an executive order in August declaring a crime emergency in the nation’s capital, although the Department of Justice itself says violent crime there is at  a 30-year low .\n \n\n   \n  Within a month, more than 2,300 Guard troops  from eight states  and the District of Columbia were patrolling under the Army secretary’s command.

by Mostafa Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        5:02 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Less than a year after his lightning power grab, Syria’s president is capping his transformation from jihadist to global statesman in a historic visit to the White House that says as much about the young leader as it does his push for his country’s diplomatic reinvention.\n \n\n   \n  Ahmed Al-Sharaa’s meeting on Monday – the first ever visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state – is his 20th foreign trip since appointing himself as president of  Syria  in January, and his second visit to the United States, following his attendance of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.\n \n\n   \n  But this meeting was  ﻿ the most high-profile and high stakes yet, a once-unthinkable encounter between the US commander-in-chief and a man who has faced American forces on the battlefield.\n \n\n   \n  “He’s a very strong leader,” US President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office following Monday’s visit, adding: “He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him. I get along with him … and we’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful.”\n \n\n   \n  It’s not the first time Trump has praised the Syrian leader. In May, after a brief  meeting  brokered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump hailed the 43-year-old Syrian leader as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past,” and ordered the lifting of some of the crippling US sanctions on Syria, a country that for decades had been firmly aligned with key American foes Russia and Iran.\n \n\n   \n  On Monday, the US extended its pause on most sanctions for another 180 days. However, the most stringent sanctions on Damascus remain and cannot be fully lifted without congressional approval. Al-Sharaa’s immediate goal in Washington was to push for their removal while urging Trump to pressure Israel to halt attacks on Syria and withdraw its troops from the south of the country.\n \n\n   \n  His broader objective, reflected in his extensive global travel, is to reverse Syria’s isolation, a legacy of the previous regime that left the country economically devasted and diplomatically shackled to a narrow axis of allies.\n \n\n   \n  Against this backdrop, the White House visit carries profound symbolic weight. Al-Sharaa played basketball with top US military officials after arriving in Washington on Sunday. But in his early twenties, he encountered the US as an enemy, joining Islamist insurgents battling American forces in Iraq. Captured and later released, he crossed into Syria in 2011 and established an Al-Qaeda-backed rebel army to fight forces loyal to then-President Bashar Al Assad.\n \n\n   \n  Trump nodded to Al-Sharaa’s multilayered past on Monday, saying: “We’ve all had rough pasts, but he has had a rough past. And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”\n \n\n   \n  Speaking to CNN last December, Al-Sharaa said he had gone through episodes of transformation through the years.  Using his nom de guerre , he said: “A person in their twenties will have a different personality than someone in their thirties or forties, and certainly someone in their fifties. This is human nature.”\n \n\n   \n  Monday’s visit demonstrated that shift: Syria is expected to announce that it is joining the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, a senior Trump administration official said, making Syria the 90th member of the D-ISIS Coalition.\n \n\n   \n  Al-Sharaa’s Syria will partner with the US “to eliminate ISIS remnants and halt foreign fighter flows,” the official said, adding that the visit is focused on “counterterrorism cooperation, economic development, and advancing regional peace and security.”\n \n\n   \n  After more than a decade of a brutal conflict against Assad’s autocratic regime, Al-Sharaa ended Syria’s long-stalemated civil war by launching a surprise offensive that swiftly toppled the 53-year Assad dynasty, an Arab relic of the Cold War.\n \n\n   \n  In their decades of power, the Assads aligned Damascus firmly with Moscow, relying on aid, arms and unwavering diplomatic backing. In Hafez al-Assad’s first full year in power in 1971, the Soviet Union established its strategic Mediterranean naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. And it was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decisive military intervention in 2015 that enabled Bashar al-Assad to survive the civil war.\n \n\n   \n  The Russians, who killed scores of Syrians during their campaign to keep Assad in power, continue to retain control of their military base in Tartus even after Assad’s fall. And last month, Al-Sharaa visited Moscow to meet Putin.\n \n\n   \n  As he has sought to build ties with Western nations, Al-Sharaa has been careful not to antagonize Moscow.\n \n\n   \n  “Engaging in a conflict with Russia right now would be too costly with Syria, nor would it be in the country’s interest,” Al-Sharaa told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview aired in October.\n \n\n   \n  Once sanctioned for terrorism by the West, the leader now appears to be on a global diplomatic charm offensive, bolstered by aggressive lobbying from regional heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Turkey, US allies eager to fill a power and economic vacuum left by Iran and Russia.\n \n\n   \n  For the US, Syria represents both a strategic prize and a significant risk as neighboring Lebanon spirals into instability and Iraq remains a fertile ground for Iran’s proxy militias.\n \n\n   \n  “The US is taking a large gamble on Ahmed Al-Sharaa and Syria,” Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told CNN. “As (US) Ambassador (Tom) Barrack has stated numerous times, the US has no alternatives. Lebanon is a failed state according to his assessment. Iraq is deeply penetrated by pro-Iranian militias,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  And despite a clear westward outlook, the former jihadist leader remains adamant on balancing Syria’s foreign policy away from conflict in an increasingly polarized world – a policy now followed by several developing nations worldwide.\n \n\n   \n  “In this new era, one doesn’t align completely with any side. We saw that with (Al-Sharaa’s) visit with Putin, who is an active ally with the Assad regime … and you see that with diplomacy on behalf of the Syrian government globally,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.\n \n\n   \n   CNN’s Kara Fox, Jennifer Hansler, Dalia Abdelwahab, Jomana Karadsheh, Eyad Kourdi contributed reporting.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/americas/ecuador-prison-deaths-asphyxiation-latam-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:15:00Z","title":"At least 27 inmates killed by 'asphyxiation' in southern Ecuador in wave of prison violence","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In a wave of prison violence in southern Ecuador, two rival gangs, Los Lobos and Sao-Box, engaged in deadly clashes at the Machala Detention Center.

Ecuadorian prison left at least 31 inmates dead on Sunday, including 27 who were killed by “asphyxiation,” officials said.\n \n\n   \n  In the first attack, the criminal group  Los Lobos  was targeted by a breakaway gang known as Sao-Box in the early morning, Interior Minister John Reimberg said Monday in an interview with Radio Centro Ecuador. At least four inmates in the Machala Detention Center were reported killed and roughly 36 were wounded. Two officers suffered nonserious injuries as authorities stepped in to regain control of the situation.\n \n\n   \n  Later in the day, Los Lobos carried out a “reprisal” attack against Sao-Box, killing 27 of its members by asphyxiating them inside several cells that both groups shared, according to Reimberg.\n \n\n   \n  “In retaliation, Lobos asphyxiated members of the other organization to avoid leaving signs of violence on their bodies,” the minister said.\n \n\n   \n  Prison guards discovered the bodies around 6 p.m. while carrying out routine inspections.\n \n\n   \n  Ecuador’s penitentiary system SNAI said in a previous statement Sunday that the inmates had “committed asphyxiation among themselves, which resulted in immediate death by suspension.” Authorities did not immediately clarify what they meant by “asphyxiation” or say whether the inmates were hanged.\n \n\n   \n  In response to inquiries from the press, including CNN, SNAI said Sunday that “authorities, operational teams and forensic medical personnel continue working at the scene, verifying information and attending to reported emergencies.”\n \n\n   \n  Asked why rival gang members shared cells, Reimberg noted that they were initially part of the same group, before Sao-Box broke off from Los Lobos over management disputes. He did not specify why they were still kept in the same place after the split.\n \n\n   \n  The first attack on Sunday was prompted by the transfer of inmates to a new maximum-security facility, SNAI said without providing details.\n \n\n   \n  Reimberg suggested that inmates across the country have been causing chaos to prevent authorities from transferring them to the new prison.\n \n\n   \n  The attacks in Machala are the latest in a series of deadly prison clashes throughout Ecuador.\n \n\n   \n  In September, a confrontation between rival gangs at a prison in the coastal city of Esmeraldas left at least  17 dead , according to the National Police. Three days earlier, an additional 14 inmates were killed in Machala.\n \n\n   \n  Since 2021, more than 500 inmates have died in Ecuador’s prisons, according to official figures.\n \n\n   \n  The wave of prison violence is happening despite the deployment of military and police forces in several penitentiaries. It’s part of an ongoing state of internal armed conflict that the government declared in January 2024 to try to quell criminal violence nationwide.\n \n\n   \n  Los Lobos is one of two Ecuadorian criminal groups that the United States said it would designate as foreign terrorist organizations in September. The designation allows the US to impose sanctions and share intelligence with Ecuador “that can be actioned for potentially lethal operations,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at the time.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/us/dhs-ice-immigrants-chicago-shooting","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"17:58:00Z","title":"DHS says agents were shot at amid chaotic day of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago area","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In November 2025, the Department of Homeland Security reported that Border Patrol agents were shot at in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood during an immigration enforcement operation.

Sottile, Sarah Dewberry, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        4:58 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Department of Homeland Security agents were shot at during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago Saturday, the agency said — as federal agents were also accused of using pepper spray and flash-bang grenades against protesters across the Chicago area.\n \n\n   \n  The incidents come as Chicago has emerged as the center of tense standoffs between federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations and frustrated and  angry community members  protesting the Trump administration’s wide-ranging deportation campaign. A federal judge  issued a ruling Friday  limiting federal agents’ use of force in Chicago, after they repeatedly used tear gas and other forms of force against protesters.\n \n\n   \n  The shooting took place in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood Saturday morning,  according to DHS . A male driving a “black Jeep” opened fire at Border Patrol agents, then fled the scene, said the agency. A suspect from Mexico was arrested in connection with the shooting, DHS said  in a post on X  Monday.\n \n\n   \n  DHS has framed the incidents as part of a series of attacks they say  target federal agents . “The violence in Chicago against law enforcement is unprecedented,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement shared with CNN. “These attacks are the consequence of vitriolic smears from sanctuary politicians and the media.”\n \n\n   \n  But immigrant advocates, local politicians, and legal groups said it is  federal agents  who are driving violence and chaos against angry but peaceful protesters and bystanders.\n \n\n   \n  “Yesterday was a day of terror,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, who says he witnessed flash grenades detonated in the street. “It follows an agenda of terror by this president.”\n \n\n   \n  Several DHS statements about its immigration crackdown in Chicago — “Operation Midway Blitz” — have  later been contradicted  by local officials, a civil rights attorney and a legal filing, fueling mounting skepticism of the agency’s claims. In Friday’s ruling, a federal judge said  Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino  “admitted that he lied” when he claimed he threw tear gas at protesters after a rock was thrown near his head, and said video disproved his account.\n \n\n   \n  The government’s evidence was “simply not credible” and its portrayal of Chicago “untrue,”  US District Judge Sara Ellis  said.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration filed a notice Sunday  appealing  Ellis’  order  limiting the use of force by federal agents involved in the Chicago immigration crackdown. The court document did not include the grounds for appeal.\n \n\n   \n  It is not immediately clear when the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case.\n \n\n   \n  The National Lawyers Guild Chicago said nine people in all were arrested and taken into federal custody Saturday. DHS says Border Patrol arrested eight US citizens and one “illegal alien.”\n \n\n   \n    Agents shot at by driver, DHS says\n \n\n   \n  Border Patrol agents were “accosted by a hostile crowd” while conducting an immigration enforcement operation around 9:30 a.m. Saturday near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue,  DHS said . The crowd “boxed them into a street and alleyway,” the agency said.\n \n\n   \n  “As they were apprehending a subject, agents came under direct gunfire when a male driving a black Jeep Wrangler fired multiple rounds,” reads DHS’ statement. “He immediately fled the scene.”\n \n\n   \n  There were no reports of anyone struck by gunfire, according to the Chicago Police Department, which responded to help secure the scene.\n \n\n   \n  Bovino didn’t name the suspect in an interview on Fox News Monday but described him as an “illegal alien” with a previous firearms conviction. CNN has reached out to DHS for more information. The FBI told CNN it does not comment on “potential investigative matters.”\n \n\n   \n  After the incident, “an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicles,” according to DHS. The agency said no Border Patrol agents were injured in the incident.\n \n\n   \n  Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a Monday news conference he had heard about the shooting. He said Bovino and federal agents “have absolutely no credibility because of the repeated lies, both to the courts and to the public, so we have no way to verify the reports,” but that federal authorities were investigating.\n \n\n   \n  “While I do not welcome federal agents operating in this capacity, I unequivocally condemn violence directed at them,” the mayor said  in a post on X. \n \n\n   \n  After leaving the scene of the shooting, Border Patrol agents “encountered a vehicle that attempted to ram their convoy” and   deployed a “Controlled Tire Deflation Device,” DHS said. Another driver was arrested after attempting to ram the convoy as agents proceeded toward an FBI facility, according to DHS.\n \n\n   \n    Flash bangs deployed in Little Village\n \n\n   \n  Then the Border Patrol agents “encountered protesters lying in the street near 26th and Pulaski,” according to DHS. The agency said the “rioters refused to comply with basic instructions and began throwing objects” and agents used “crowd control measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Matt DeMateo, a pastor at New Life Community Church, said he was driving at the intersection of 26th Avenue and Pulaski Road when he saw federal agents exit their vehicles, “guns drawn.” He says he didn’t hear “any warning” before flash-bang grenades were deployed.\n \n\n   \n  Videos from the scene taken around 11:10 a.m. show what appear to be agents in tactical gear exiting their vehicles in the street. Another video shows people standing around a white vehicle, some seemingly filming with their phones.\n \n\n   \n  A passenger in the white vehicle is seen in the video tossing an object out of the window. A loud bang sounds and smoke explodes, scattering bystanders as the vehicle starts to drive away. One person is seen in the video throwing something at the vehicle.\n \n\n   \n   Whistles  — a signal community members have used to alert others to the presence of federal immigration agents — ring out. “Get the f**k out of here,” one person was heard yelling.\n \n\n   \n  Alderman Rodriguez said he was attending his son’s chess competition nearby but stepped outside to join “rapid responders.”\n \n\n   \n  “People were vociferously protesting,” he said. But the federal vehicles “had a clear path to move out,” he said, and echoed DeMateo’s statement that he didn’t hear any warnings before the flash-bang grenades were detonated. He said he didn’t see any objects thrown at agents before the flash-bangs.\n \n\n   \n  One flash grenade exploded just a foot away from him, said   the alderman, who represents Chicago’s 22nd ward, sending him ducking for cover.\n \n\n   \n  “I think we stand here today, sick and tired of what’s happening here, not just in our country and not just in our city, but in our neighborhood and on our streets,” he said. “We want peace. We want tranquility.”\n \n\n   \n  Bovino was spotted at 26th and Pulaski by DeMateo, the pastor, in the Little Village neighborhood where DHS and the Border Patrol chief originally claimed  he was hit in the head  with a rock by a protester.\n \n\n   \n  “I saw right next to my van, Bovino pull the pin on another grenade, threatening to throw it,” said DeMateo.

The agency said it is working with PAHO and local public health leaders to slow the outbreak.\n \n\n   \n  Canada  had been considered measles-free since 1998.  A measles vaccine was first approved to be used in Canada in 1963, and various vaccination campaigns were successful. But in more recent years, vaccine hesitancy has grown, and vaccination rates fell below the target of 95% coverage for all recommended childhood vaccines,  research shows .\n \n\n   \n  “It’s important to say that all the other 34 countries in the region, they keep their certification as measles-free,” PAHO Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa said Monday. “This loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible.”\n \n\n   \n  However, with the change in Canada’s status, the Americas region officially loses its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  There are no formal consequences to losing such status. But until measles is eliminated worldwide, countries will face the risk of reintroduction and the spread of the virus, Barbosa said. The virus is so contagious that one infected person can transmit the disease to up to 18 others.\n \n\n   \n  As of last month, Canada had tallied more than 5,000 cases for the year — more than twice as many as the country has recorded in the past 25 years combined.\n \n\n   \n  The US has also seen large outbreaks this year and is on the verge of losing its elimination status.\n \n\n   \n  “We are hoping that the US is going to stop the transmission even before that deadline,” said Dr. Daniel Salas, executive manager of PAHO’s Special Program for Comprehensive Immunization.\n \n\n   \n  This year’s large US measles outbreak started in West Texas in January. It’s been declared over, but there is an investigation into whether a growing outbreak along the Arizona-Utah state line could be connected. Cases and outbreaks have also been reported in other states.\n \n\n   \n  “We are supporting all the actions that the US has been taking to actually control the outbreak to stop them,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  Mexico also has a recent outbreak, Salas said, concentrated mostly in Chihuahua, but there are also cases in Mexico’s southern states.\n \n\n   \n  “Definitely, they need to continue vaccinating,” Salas said.\n \n\n   \n  With hard work, Barbosa said, he believes that Canada can regain its measles-free status.\n \n\n   \n  “As we have demonstrated before with political commitment regional cooperation and sustain the vaccination, the region can once again interrupt the transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/media/bbc-trump-edit-lawsuit-turness-davie-media","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"15:04:00-05:00","title":"Trump threatens to sue BBC as broadcaster faces ‘fight for its survival’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC is in the midst of a public and political crisis following a misleading edit in a 2024 documentary about Donald Trump’s reelection campaign.

He is demanding at least $1 billion in damages.\n \n\n   \n  A BBC spokesperson told CNN that “we will review the letter and respond directly in due course.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump has sent several legal letters to other news organizations, including CNN, during his second term in office.\n \n\n   \n  The president’s legal threats often don’t amount to anything, but he does have pending lawsuits against the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the Des Moines Register.\n \n\n   \n  Earlier Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah issued a belated apology for the “error of judgment” with the October 2024 documentary. BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness tendered their resignations on Sunday as stories about the edit scandal consumed British media.\n \n\n   \n  There is no indication that the misleading edit was politically motivated. Nor is there any reason to believe that Davie and Turness knew about it ahead of time.\n \n\n   \n  However, a lawyer for Trump asserted Monday that the BBC defamed the president “by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election.”\n \n\n   \n  The letter, obtained by CNN, charges the broadcaster with defamation and claims that Trump has suffered “overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” despite no one seeming to call out the error at the time of the broadcast.\n \n\n   \n  Last week, The Telegraph, a longtime source of anti-BBC commentary, wrote about an “internal report” revealing the bad edit, and the story has since snowballed.\n \n\n   \n  The pre-election film spliced together different parts of Trump’s infamous January 6 speech at the Ellipse to make it sound like Trump told the crowd he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n \n\n   \n  Trump’s tone was certainly combative that day, but in the actual speech, his exhortations to “fight” were separate from his suggestion about walking to the Capitol to “cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n \n\n   \n  In a contrite letter to the head of a parliamentary committee on Monday, Shah said the BBC accepted that “the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘We are not perfect’\n \n\n   \n  The revelation about the misleading edit has contributed to an ongoing political fight over the BBC’s funding and future, with conservatives using the error as a new opportunity to denounce the British broadcaster.\n \n\n   \n  “The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack,” BBC veteran John Simpson wrote on X Sunday night. He praised Davie and Turness and said, “We’ve now got a real fight on our hands to defend public service broadcasting, because that’s under threat too.”\n \n\n   \n  This is ultimately all about trust: Who trusts the BBC, who doesn’t, and why.\n \n\n   \n  The BBC’s adversaries, including politicians who detest its news coverage and media moguls who want to take its market share, say the BBC has lost trust, perhaps permanently.\n \n\n   \n  They cite a wide range of perceived wrongs. Former conservative party leader Liz Truss, who had a brief term as prime minister in 2022, wrote on Sunday, “I’m glad the US President and the rest of the world are seeing the BBC for what it is. failure to tell the truth on everything from transgender ideology to economics to Gaza has done huge damage to politics and government in this country. This should be the end of nationalised broadcasting.”\n \n\n   \n  Conservative activists in the UK have long railed against the license fee that British households pay for BBC programs and services. The government is currently reviewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, including the license fee structure, ahead of the current charter’s expiration at the end of 2027.\n \n\n   \n  That review presents an opening for the BBC’s many critics to demand changes — at the same time, the BBC is trying to establish new revenue streams and transform itself for the digital age.\n \n\n   \n  Last week’s story in The Telegraph was based on a lengthy memo by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on editorial standards and guidelines. Prescott’s memo warned the BBC board about what he called serious problems with news coverage and “inaction” by the broadcaster’s leadership.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary was his first example, but he also cited concerns about coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, gender identity, racial diversity and other matters. He argued that “errors are repeated time and time again.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah responded on Monday and said the BBC has “published corrections where we have got things wrong; changed editorial guidance to make the BBC’s position on issues clearer; made changes to leadership where the problems point to underlying issues; and carried out formal disciplinary measures.”\n \n\n   \n  Shah also urged people to keep “a sense of perspective,” pointing to “thousands of hours of outstanding journalism” by the BBC.\n \n\n   \n  But a sense of perspective is usually the first thing lost in a media feeding frenzy. Veteran British journalist Alan Rusbridger wrote Monday that the BBC now finds itself “in a fight for its survival.”\n \n\n   \n  The Trump documentary error was “serious,” Rusbridger wrote, but the BBC’s enemies want to see the entire organization “wither or die,” which “would leave us all far worse off.”\n \n\n   \n  Robert Shrimsley, UK chief political commentator and executive editor of the Financial Times, said on X that it’s important to recognize the political dimensions of the dispute.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact that the BBC has made serious culpable errors does not negate the point that there is a real and concerted right-wing media campaign to destroy it,” Shrimsley said. “Both points can be true at the same time and the campaign would not end even if the errors did.”\n \n\n   \n  After reading all the press about the scandal from Kyiv, where he is on assignment, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale took to social media and expressed his pride in the organization.\n \n\n   \n  “We are not perfect; we must always strive to be better,” he wrote Monday. “But in a darkening world, we remain a shaft of light.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/pregnancy-gun-homicide-study","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"14:26:00-05:00","title":"Women face a much higher risk of homicide, especially from guns, during pregnancy","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pregnant women in the U.S. face a dramatically higher risk of firearm homicide than non-pregnant women, with a 37% increased rate found in a study published in JAMA Network Open that analyzed over 7,000 homicides between 2018 and 2021.

pregnancy \n       \n  By Jen Christensen, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        2:26 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  On April 9, 2020, after Shirley Scarborough made her daily call to a prayer line, she went to work and got another call: from the police department in Richmond, Virginia. Her youngest daughter, Francesca Harris-Scarborough, had been killed the night before.\n \n\n   \n  Police had found the 31-year-old’s car still idling. Scarborough’s daughter, who was three months pregnant, had been shot twice in the heart.\n \n\n   \n  “I wasn’t ready for it. I lost control of everything,” Scarborough said. “Everything went blank.”\n \n\n   \n  Francesca was part of a terrible trend in the United States: Homicide is the No. 1 way pregnant women die,  research  has  showed , but a new  study  finds that they are even more vulnerable than other women of childbearing age when there’s a gun involved.\n \n\n   \n  The study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open, looked at more than 7,000 homicides of women of childbearing age between 2018 and 2021. Pregnant women were found to have a 37% higher firearm homicide rate than women who weren’t pregnant, and more than two-thirds of pregnancy-associated homicides involved firearms.\n \n\n   \n  The presence of a firearm is known to be a key risk factor of intimate partner homicide. The new study showed that every 1% increase in state-level firearm ownership was associated with a 6% increase in all-cause homicide and an 8% increase in the firearm-specific homicide rate in pregnant women, even after adjusting for other factors.\n \n\n   \n  “Even incremental increases in firearm availability may contribute to measurable increases in homicide risk in pregnant women,” the researchers wrote.\n \n\n   \n  “It was really not surprising, if you think about it, that if firearms are more available, then that certainly it does increase your risk of homicide in general,” said study co-author Dr. Lois Lee, a senior faculty adviser in the Office and Health Equity & Inclusion and an associate professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. “So you could imagine, if you take away or at least decrease the number of firearms, then there would likely be many fewer deaths during pregnancy.”\n \n\n   \n  “And unlike medical conditions, which, yes, we do have many medical advances and can save many lives, but in some ways, those conditions are much less preventable, like eclampsia and sepsis,” Lee added. “This is predictable and potentially preventable.”\n \n\n   \n  The highest proportion of homicides in pregnant women was among those 20 to 24 years old. Among women who weren’t pregnant, it was ages 25 to 29. Most homicide victims were Black, whether they were pregnant or not.\n \n\n   \n  “Those findings suggest that these risks of homicide during pregnancy are shaped not just by individual factors but by broader systems of inequity and structural racism,” Lee said. “So it’s not just a solution at the individual level that’s needed, but there needs to be urgent change at a policy level, as well.”\n \n\n   \n  The study authors recommend safe storage laws and domestic violence firearm prohibitions.\n \n\n   \n  Although most states prohibit people with final protective orders from purchasing or possessing firearms, such laws should be expanded to require people to surrender their firearms even when there’s an emergency protective order on the books, said Dr. Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, who was not involved with the new research.\n \n\n   \n  “Usually, the first stage of that order process is often the most dangerous time for individuals experiencing intimate partner or family violence, since it is usually the first indication that an individual is going to be separating from an abuser,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Roskam said the most successful gun surrender laws also have strong follow-up. She points to a program in King County, Washington, that created  a multidisciplinary team  of prosecutors, law enforcement and court administrators who serve on a regional domestic violence firearm unit. It scours court documents and databases to make sure every individual involved in a domestic violence offense gives up every firearm.\n \n\n   \n  According to  King County , firearms are used in domestic violence homicides more than all other weapons combined in Washington state.\n \n\n   \n  “They really show respondents that they are very serious about ensuring this firearm relinquishment compliance. And since they have started doing this, they have been recovering a much larger number of firearms from these protective orders,” Roskam said.\n \n\n   \n  Scarborough has been working on her own programs so more women are spared her daughter’s fate. She created a nonprofit called  Cry Loud, Spare Not, Speak Up  that’s dedicated to empowering women affected by domestic violence and abuse in Virginia.\n \n\n   \n  In reading her daughter’s journals after her death, Scarborough said, she realized that although her daughter was successful and seemed happy, she had confidence issues that began when she was younger. Scarborough also started a program for girls  ages 12 and up  to cultivate self-esteem and grow their confidence.\n \n\n   \n  Each year, near the anniversary of Francesca’s death, Scarborough hosts another empowerment program for girls and women called “I Am Enough, I Know My Worth.”\n \n\n   \n  “This way she will never die. We can always try to help somebody,” Scarborough said. “Her death has really been my teacher. It’s changed my life. It will never be the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/business/visa-mastercard-deal-merchant-fees","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:47:00-05:00","title":"Visa and Mastercard May Reach Deal to Lower Merchant Fees, Threatening Rewards","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement to reduce interchange fees by 0.1% over five years, offering merchants more flexibility to add surcharges or refuse premium cards.

Your rewards card could get hit \n       \n  By Gordon Ebanks, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:47 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Visa and Mastercard have a potential deal with retailers that would lower fees for merchants, potentially lowering prices but threatening prized consumer rewards.\n \n\n   \n  The deal, which is still subject to court approval, could mean big changes for businesses and consumers. In 2024,  over a third  of all purchases were made with credit cards and those who use them might face new surcharges when they swipe or have to use another form of payment if businesses don’t accept their card.\n \n\n   \n  And because credit card companies finance credit card rewards, lower interchange fees may mean fewer perks. “If you were to lower interchange fees, you probably have to also lower rewards,” Joanna Stavins, principal economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston told CNN last month. That’s because “rewards are financed by interchange fees.”\n \n\n   \n  The two credit card giants have been entangled in a lawsuit brought by retailers for the last 20 years that alleged the companies have fixed the price of interchange fees — a large portion of the fees merchants pay when a customer makes a purchase with a credit card. The companies were close to reaching a settlement last year, but U.S. District Judge Margo K. Brodie  rejected  the $30 billion proposal.\n \n\n   \n  The proposal announced this morning would see the two companies bring down interchange fees by 0.1% over the next five years, give merchants the choice to add surcharges when customers pay with credit cards as well as the option to refuse premium cards, which often charge substantially  higher fees .\n \n\n   \n  “After more than 20 years of litigation, Visa and Mastercard have reached a proposed settlement with U.S. merchants of all sizes that would provide meaningful relief, more flexibility and options to control how they accept payments from their customers,” Visa told CNN.\n \n\n   \n  Mastercard said that “smaller merchants will gain in this settlement – more acceptance choices, reduced costs and simplified rules.”\n \n\n   \n  The proposal from Visa and Mastercard specifically states that the deal is not an admission of wrongdoing.\n \n\n   \n  The National Retail Federation, a powerful trade group representing retailers, called the proposal “ window dressing .” A press release issued in response to reports of the proposal said the reduction in interchange fees doesn’t go far enough to address the rise in interchange fees, which they say average around 2.35%.\n \n\n   \n  The European Union capped credit card interchange fees at 0.3% in 2015.\n \n\n   \n  Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that they believe the proposal from Visa and Mastercard, which has accumulated widespread opposition from retailers, is unlikely to be enacted.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s remarkable that anyone could think a temporary 10 basis point reduction — barely more than last year’s increase — is fair compensation for allowing a credit card duopoly to maintain their pricing cartel for eight more years,” said the National Restaurant Federation.\n \n\n   \n  “If the courts can’t fix this, it’s time for Congress to take action,” said the National Retail Federation’s General Counsel Stephanie Martz.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional reporting and context. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/government-shutdown-deal-takeaways","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:48:00-05:00","title":"6 Takeaways from the Shutdown Deal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The longest government shutdown in U.S. history appears to be ending after eight moderate Democrats broke ranks with the Senate Democratic Caucus to reach a deal with Republicans.

from the shutdown deal \n       \n  Analysis by Aaron Blake, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:48 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The longest shutdown in American history appears headed for a conclusion, after  eight moderate-leaning members  of the Senate Democratic Caucus broke ranks to  cut a deal with Republicans  on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n   Much has yet to play out  and votes still need to be held. But it looks as though enough Democrats have given up on demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare tax credits and have accepted much more modest concessions.\n \n\n   \n  So how did this happen? What did we learn? And where do we go from here?\n \n\n   \n  Here are some takeaways from the politics of it.\n \n\n   \n    1. Democrats caved, full stop\n \n\n   \n  The Democratic Party isn’t leaving this process with nothing. They got a couple of significant concessions.\n \n\n   \n  One is a commitment to hold a Senate vote on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies by next month — a vote that could apply real political pressure on Republicans. Democrats also got Republicans to agree to undo President Donald Trump’s attempts to lay off thousands of federal workers and to block any other such efforts through January.\n \n\n   \n  But there’s no question Democrats are the ones who folded, and somewhat curiously so.\n \n\n   \n  Virtually every poll showed them winning the blame game. They were fighting for something — an extension of the subsides — that those polls showed more than 7 in 10 Americans wanted. About  half of Americans wanted Democrats  to hold the line — something we just haven’t seen in recent shutdowns.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats could seemingly have drawn this out and forced the issue. But they didn’t.\n \n\n   \n  “The question was, is, as the shutdown progresses, is a solution on [the Obamacare tax credits] becoming any more likely?” said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and who voted to advance the deal. “It appears not.”\n \n\n   \n  That’s certainly disputable. What’s not disputable is that a handful of more moderate Democrats lost their nerve.\n \n\n   \n    2. Democrats face a new reckoning — at a really bad time\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps King and Democrats like Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire  who threw in the towel  were right. Perhaps Democrats never would have won their main concession, and the shutdown would’ve gotten much uglier for the country in the days and weeks ahead — and unnecessarily so.\n \n\n   \n  Perhaps worsening travel delays and Americans going hungry amid the legal fight over food stamps would ultimately have cost Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  We’ll likely never know.\n \n\n   \n  But what’s clear is that this cave came at a bad time for Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  It was finally looking like the party had some unity, purpose and wind at their backs after a year of being riven and lost in the wilderness. Some polling suggested Democratic voters, whose dim views of their party rendered it more unpopular than it’s been in decades, were  warming to their party’s brand again . The election results last week, following millions of people turning out to protest Trump at  “No Kings” demonstrations  last month, were especially encouraging for the party.\n \n\n   \n  But now Democrats will endure recriminations over whether the party truly has the stomach to fight Trumpism. The lawmakers who’ve advanced this deal appear to be in for some real vitriol from the base, and it’s likely to renew efforts to cast aside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats in some ways seem to be in a similar position to where the GOP was last decade, when a large portion of the party wanted to fight harder, but the more moderate and institutional ranks ultimately stood in the way of a bolder approach.\n \n\n   \n  None of which means this will sink Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. History suggests this shutdown will be a distant memory by then. Anybody who cares that much about the shutdown is probably a nailed-on Democratic voter anyway. And this issue could eventually redound to their benefit (for reasons we’ll get to).\n \n\n   \n  But it does complicate things internally right now.\n \n\n   \n    3. Trump’s hostage-taking worked\n \n\n   \n  One of the more frustrating aspects for the Democratic base will be how this ended.\n \n\n   \n  It wasn’t just that Democrats decided to give in; it’s that they did so in a way that appeared to reward Trump for heavy-handed tactics — again.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has in recent days ratcheted up the pressure points. It has fought in court to  avoid paying full SNAP benefits . And it has  reduced traffic at dozens of major airports , leading to  hundreds of canceled flights . (The administration said this move was about safety, but critics wagered it was  more about leverage .) Trump has also pushed the GOP to scrap the filibuster in ways that didn’t seem likely to go anywhere but might have concerned more institutionally minded Democrats.\n \n\n   \n  All of this comes after Trump explicitly targeted what he called “Democrat programs” with layoffs and funding cuts.\n \n\n   \n  This is a familiar tale by now. Trump has proved plenty willing to reach for all available leverage at his disposal, often violating political norms and possibly even the law in the process.\n \n\n   \n  And it’s worked for him. Institutions including colleges, law firms and media companies have repeatedly folded rather than fight Trump on these things, even when it appeared they had the upper hand. And that surely emboldens him.\n \n\n   \n  “Standing up to Donald Trump didn’t work,” King said Monday morning on MSNBC, “it actually gave him more power.”\n \n\n   \n  Expect plenty of Democrats to pull their hair out over that quote.\n \n\n   \n    4. Trump’s hubris was on full display\n \n\n   \n  The flip side of Trump’s approach, though, was that it betrayed some remarkable hubris.\n \n\n   \n  Just consider all that happened over the last six weeks — and how little care he took to mind the optics.\n \n\n   \n  The administration repeatedly fought to avoid paying full SNAP benefits. That provided lawmaking leverage, yes, but it also risked making it look like it  wanted  to use poor people and their hunger as leverage. The president attended  a “Great Gatsby”-themed party  at his Mar-a-Lago resort the night before Americans were due to start losing those SNAP benefits.\n \n\n   \n  Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House to build a $350 million ballroom that polls show the American people  are pretty skeptical of .\n \n\n   \n  He extensively promoted a  very marbled renovation  of the Lincoln Bedroom bathroom.\n \n\n   \n  And Trump’s efforts to gild the White House seemed to  continue apace .\n \n\n   \n  These are all pretty questionable moves, given not just the shutdown but also a series of troubling economic signs. But Trump, who’s taken to talking about  “affordability”  of late, seems unperturbed by how it might look.\n \n\n   \n  Meanwhile, his approval rating has  plumbed new depths   over the past two weeks .\n \n\n   \n    5. Republicans still have an Obamacare problem — and this could exacerbate it\n \n\n   \n  The best case for Democrats’ strategy is this: They were never going to get Trump and GOP leaders to commit to extending the Obamacare tax credits as part of a shutdown deal. But they could force an issue that’s a significant GOP liability, cast a spotlight on it and even force Republicans to take some tough votes and squirm a little.\n \n\n   \n  Regardless of whether that was actually the best Democrats could do, the pressure being applied on the GOP on health care isn’t insignificant.\n \n\n   \n  With around three-quarters of Americans supporting the tax credits, this issue poses very real political problems for Republicans. A recent Pew Research Center poll also showed  health care was the GOP’s worst issue  among a dozen tested, with 42% favoring the Democratic Party’s approach, compared with just 29% for Republicans’.\n \n\n   \n  Look at none other than  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene  of Georgia pleading with her party to renew these tax credits. Or the July  memo authored by Trump’s own pollster , Tony Fabrizio, making the case that letting the subsidies lapse could spell political disaster for the GOP in the midterms.\n \n\n   \n  If nothing else, this record-long shutdown could spotlight the choice Republicans are about to make. By voting for a deal that does not extend the subsidies and therefore allows premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans, Republicans will have made it clearer that this is what they fought hard for. They’ll be put on the record on the issue in an even starker way when the Senate takes a separate vote on the subsidies.\n \n\n   \n  If that measure were somehow to pass, it could pressure Speaker Mike Johnson to allow a vote in the House too.\n \n\n   \n  (Johnson did not take questions at a news conference Monday morning, but he has previously declined to promise such a vote, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune has pledged.)\n \n\n   \n  While Democrats want these tax credits extended from a policy standpoint, you could argue that the best thing for them from a raw-politics standpoint is for Republicans to reject them — and for voters to remember it come 2026.\n \n\n   \n  Republicans are already having to deal with explaining the  major Medicaid cuts in Trump’s big agenda bill  over the summer. And unlike those cuts, which are delayed until after the 2026 midterms, these premium increases will go into effect quickly.\n \n\n   \n  At the very least, Democrats have continued to fertilize a potent political argument on bad issue for the GOP.\n \n\n   \n    6. Maybe shutdowns can actually work?\n \n\n   \n  Former Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell often says shutdowns simply don’t work. He said in 2023 that they “never have produced a policy change and they’ve always been a loser for Republicans, politically.”\n \n\n   \n  This shutdown should challenge that conventional wisdom.\n \n\n   \n  No, Democrats didn’t get all or even most of what they wanted. But their ability to largely win the blame game suggests future shutdowns could be successfully leveraged, if the party forcing them plays its cards right.\n \n\n   \n  The big problem with the GOP’s shutdown strategies last decade seemed to be that the things they were shutting the government down over — defunding Obamacare and building a border wall — just weren’t that popular.\n \n\n   \n  Democrats showed that if you push for something that enough people favor, you might have a shot.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/hormone-therapy-menopause-fda-warning-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"20:00:00-05:00","title":"Black box safety warning to be removed from hormone therapy for menopause","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is removing the long-standing black box warning on hormone therapy for menopause, which was introduced in 2003 after the Women’s Health Initiative study linked hormone therapy to increased risks of cancer, stroke, and dementia.

menopause \n       \n  By Jacqueline Howard, Brenda Goodman, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        3:00 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  In a pivotal move, the US Food and Drug Administration said Monday that  it is taking steps to remove the lengthy “black box” warning  on many hormone treatments for women with menopause symptoms, a shift expected to give women more options for treatment and generate a flood of new prescriptions.\n \n\n   \n  Hormone therapy has long been on the market, but prescriptions plummeted after 2003, when the warning described increased risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, breast cancer and dementia.\n \n\n   \n  “After 23 years of dogma, the FDA today is announcing that we are going to stop the fear machine steering women away from this life-changing, even life-saving, treatment,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in announcing the change.\n \n\n   \n  Prescribing requires nuance, FDA officials said, especially around when women start hormone therapy. Some women still face some risks from hormone therapy, including those at increased risk of blood clots or who have previously had breast cancer.\n \n\n   \n  But for many women, the benefits may far outweigh the risks.\n \n\n   \n  “With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there’s no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,” Makary  posted on X  Monday morning.\n \n\n   \n  It could take months for the labels to change, but drugmakers are “very excited” to make the update, Makary said.  Label changes  will include updated guidance that hormones should be initiated in women who are younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause to optimize benefits and risks, and removal of guidance to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time — clearing the way for women to stay on the treatments for years.\n \n\n   \n  “We want people to talk to their doctors, and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications,” Makary said.\n \n\n   \n  Women’s health experts praised the move to update the boxed warning to reflect newer scientific evidence around menopausal hormone therapy but said individualized discussions of risks and benefits will still be needed.\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a past president of the Menopause Society, said the labeling change was overdue.\n \n\n   \n  “As a bottom line, I think given more than 20 years of class-wide labeling of hormone therapy, it is time to get the labeling right, and some of these changes that are proposed are very well-supported. Others may be controversial, but overall, it is a step in the right direction,” said Manson, who was one of the original investigators on the Women’s Health Initiative study that spurred the initial label change.\n \n\n   \n  “Right now, this box warning is a one-size-fits-all summary that hormone therapy increases the risk of all these conditions,” Manson said. “It doesn’t take into account whether it’s local estrogen or systemic estrogen, the age of the woman, the type of the formulation.”\n \n\n   \n  Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, said she is among many doctors who advocated for label changes for years.\n \n\n   \n  “Removing the scary boxed warning from local vaginal estrogen is a victory for women’s health and for those who care for and about menopausal women,” Pinkerton said in a statement. “Regarding the removal of the boxed warning for systemic hormone therapy, which is absorbed into the bloodstream and has systemic effects throughout the body, we appreciate the FDA’s thoughtful, nuanced approach. Discussions will be more complicated and need to be individualized, as different menopause therapies differ in potential risks.”\n \n\n   \n    What changed around hormone therapy\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of  menopause treatments  that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warned about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.\n \n\n   \n  The black box warning, or boxed warning, was added after  a large government-funded study , the Women’s Health Initiative, found in 2002 that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had some higher health risks compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.\n \n\n   \n  After the study and the label change, doctors became reluctant to prescribe them, and prescriptions for hormone therapy for menopause dropped by more than 70%. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25,  one study found .\n \n\n   \n  The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s been a total horrible tragedy that so many millions of women have been deprived,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, a New York-based internist and author of the books “ Don’t Let Your Doctor Kill You ” and “ The New Hormone Solution .”\n \n\n   \n  “Hormone therapy is important because for about 10 to 15 years before you go into menopause, your hormones start leaving you. As your hormones start leaving you, you need more hormones. And you don’t need hormone replacement; you need hormone supplementation,” Schwartz said.\n \n\n   \n  “Chronic illnesses like heart disease, Alzheimer’s, osteoporosis, cancer, they are diseases of aging, and one reason is the loss of hormones.”\n \n\n   \n  More recent analyses of the Women’s Health Initiative,  as early as 2010 , have since shown that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, can more safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don’t have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.\n \n\n   \n  “To this day, I still have patients coming in telling me their obstetricians or gynecologists have said to them they shouldn’t be taking hormones, because they’re going to get cancer. And not only will they not get cancer, the hormones will protect them from cancer,” Schwartz said. “We have the data.”\n \n\n   \n  In July, the FDA convened a panel of experts to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.\n \n\n   \n  In October, Makary  told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta  in an episode of the “Chasing Life” podcast that the agency was in “serious discussions” about what to do with the black box warning.\n \n\n   \n  “It’s really a tragedy. It’s maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It’s resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”\n \n\n   \n    Changing views on menopause\n \n\n   \n  The FDA action follows a wave of policies introduced across the country to improve menopause care at the state level. Most of the legislation has been related to insurance   coverage for menopause care, awareness and education, clinician training or menopause in the workplace.\n \n\n   \n  “When we think about the timing of this announcement, it’s not just the FDA making a move. It comes in the good company of now 19 states, red and blue alike, introducing more than 35 bills to improve menopause care,” said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, executive director of the Birnbaum Women’s Leadership Center at the  New York University School of Law , who has been tracking menopause legislation.\n \n\n   \n  “All these things are happening at the same time, and that’s in part because there is a loud and proud movement making these demands now, insisting that menopause care be equitable and treatments accessible, that menopause no longer be in the shadows and that we not be subject to misinformation,” said Weiss-Wolf, author of the forthcoming book, “When In Menopause: A User’s Manual and Citizens Guide.”\n \n\n   \n  The removal of the warning on hormone for menopause has long been in the making, experts said.\n \n\n   \n  “Back in 2014, the Menopause Society and other leading menopause experts had actually started  a petition to the FDA  to remove the label,” Weiss-Wolf said. “This is something that the menopause medical community has been asking for.”\n \n\n   \n  The action will change the landscape of care to make hormone therapy, especially estrogen, more accessible for midlife women, said Dr. Jayne Morgan, an Atlanta-based cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs at Hello Heart, an app that specializes in women’s health and cardiovascular research.\n \n\n   \n  “The fact of the matter is, estrogen is one of the primary drivers of the heart. There are estrogen receptors on the heart, on the brain, in the bones, so it’s like the fuel that drives our body. Once that fuel runs out, it’s just like a car, the car begins to sputter,” Morgan said.\n \n\n   \n  “Women live about  six years longer  than men, but we spend about 25% of our lives in lower quality of life,” she said. “That’s where hormone therapy can help.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/world/nicolas-sarkozy-released-prison-intl","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:29:00-05:00","title":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Released from Prison Pending Appeal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from prison in France after a court ruled he could be freed pending an appeal to his September 2025 conviction for criminal conspiracy related to a scheme that allegedly used Libyan funds to finance his 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for diplomatic favors.

Those efforts culminated in the violent riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. One of his first official acts in his second term was to pardon over 1,000 people who were charged or convicted in the January 6 ​attack.\n \n\n   \n  Presidential pardons only apply to federal charges, not state or local charges. None of the people on the list are currently charged with federal crimes, though some were named as unindicted co-conspirators in special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion case against Trump, which prosecutors withdrew after Trump’s 2024 election victory.\n \n\n   \n  However, state-level criminal charges are still pending against Giuliani, Meadows, many of the 2020 fake electors, and others on the pardon list. (They deny wrongdoing.) These 2020-related state prosecutions are ongoing in Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. These figures will likely try to use the pardon to aid their defense, though a presidential pardon doesn’t cover state crimes.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon also explicitly states that it does not apply to Trump.\n \n\n   \n  The pardon covers Jeffrey Clark, a top Justice Department official in 2020 who  tried to weaponize   the department’s powers to overturn the election. (Clark is now a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget.) Like Giuliani and Powell, Clark was an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal 2020-related indictment against Trump,  CNN previously reported .\n \n\n   \n  Clark said in  an X post  Monday that Trump had called him on Friday to inform him about the pardon. He said that he never asked for a pardon, defended his actions in 2020, and thanked Trump. But he also acknowledged the limits of clemency action.\n \n\n   \n  “I wish I could be declaring this legal nonsense over for good — a pardon should totally and abruptly kill off these federal bar and Georgia-federal attacks on me and many others,” Clark wrote. “Sadly, that’s not immediate reality.”\n \n\n   \n  Powell and Giuliani, both of whom served as Trump’s personal lawyers, were at the center of the sprawling conspiracy theories which baselessly claimed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. Giuliani  played a leading role  in the “fake electors” scheme which sought to block then-President-elect Joe Biden from taking office by presenting certificates from battleground states which falsely said Trump won the election, during the Congressional counting of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021.\n \n\n   \n  Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman said in a statement that the former New York City mayor “stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election,” adding that he “never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump’s decision.”\n \n\n   \n  Two of the architects of the fake electors scheme — lawyers  Ken Chesebro  and John Eastman — were also pardoned. Chesebro previously pleaded guilty in the Georgia election racketeering indictment.\n \n\n   \n  Also pardoned were Jenna Ellis, Trump’s 2020 campaign lawyer, and former Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward and her husband, Michael Ward.\n \n\n   \n  Ellis had been accused of working to spread false claims about widespread voter fraud. She  pleaded guilty  in the Georgia case and struck a cooperation deal that led to her Arizona charges  being dropped . The Wards were accused of acting as fake electors in Arizona. Also pardoned was Boris Epshteyn, a Trump campaign lawyer who prosecutors alleged  helped organized  the scheme and later served as one of Trump’s personal lawyer during his New York criminal trial in 2024.\n \n\n   \n  In a statement to CNN, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the people Trump pardoned as “great Americans.”\n \n\n   \n  “These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,” Leavitt said. “Getting prosecuted for challenging results is something that happens in communist Venezuela, not the United States of America, and President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime’s communist tactics once and for all.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN has reached out to Martin’s office for comment.\n \n\n   \n  Also last week, the president  granted clemency  to a retired New York City police officer who was convicted in 2023 for stalking a New Jersey family on behalf of the Chinese government.\n \n\n   \n  Trump also pardoned former Major League Baseball star  Darryl Strawberry  for a 1995 tax evasion charge.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional information.  \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/rastafarian-landor-dreadlocks-supreme-court","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:23:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Leans Against Rastafarian Man Seeking to Sue Prison Officials for Cutting His Dreadlocks","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court appeared hesitant to support a Rastafarian inmate, Damon Landor, in his attempt to sue prison officials for forcibly cutting his dreadlocks in 2020, despite the religious significance of the practice.

Rastafarian man seeking to sue prison officials for cutting his dreadlocks \n       \n  By John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:23 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court appeared unconvinced Monday that a  devout Rastafarian whose dreadlocks  were forcibly cut in prison five years ago should be able to sue correction officials for damages.\n \n\n   \n  Damon Landor had a few weeks left in his sentence for drug possession when guards at a Louisiana prison handcuffed him to a chair and shaved off the knee-length dreadlocks he had grown over nearly two decades. Minutes earlier, Landor had handed them a judicial opinion requiring prisons to allow dreadlocks for religious purposes.\n \n\n   \n  On the one hand, the case appeared tailor-made for a conservative Supreme Court that has consistently sided with religious interests in recent years. But over the course of nearly two hours of argument, it became clear that the conservative wing is far more concerned with allowing people to sue individual state officials as a way to  enforce federal spending laws .\n \n\n   \n  That’s largely because, several justices suggested, those individual state employees were not likely aware of the agreements states had made in exchange for federal funding.\n \n\n   \n  “Look, the facts of this case are egregious,” said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court’s conservative wing. But, she said, “we can’t decide a case just based on these facts.”\n \n\n   \n  Justice Neil Gorsuch, another conservative who is among the court’s most ardent supporters of religious rights, suggested that under Landor’s theory, a cisgender woman trying out for a sports team on a college campus that receives federal funding could sue a coach personally for $1 million in damages for allowing a transgender woman onto that team.\n \n\n   \n  It was a notable question in part because the court is expected in coming weeks to hear arguments on whether states may ban transgender athletes from competing on teams consistent with their gender identity.\n \n\n   \n  “As I understand it,” Gorsuch said, the federal appeals courts “are unanimously against you and have been for many, many, many years.”\n \n\n   \n  A panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals  ruled that Landor was not entitled to sue  under a 25-year-old law intended to protect prisoners’ religious interests.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative New Orleans-based 5th Circuit said that it “emphatically” condemned “the treatment that Landor endured,” but an earlier appeals court precedent settled the case against him. The full 5th Circuit ultimately  decided against  rehearing the case.\n \n\n   \n  Landor, who began serving a five-month prison sentence in 2020 for drug possession, had previously taken a promise known as the Nazarite vow to not cut his hair.\n \n\n   \n  He was incarcerated without incident at two other facilities before he was transferred to the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center with only a few weeks left in his sentence. And he came armed with a copy of an appeals court ruling from 2017 that allowed prisoners to have dreadlocks.\n \n\n   \n  Landor’s case at the Supreme Court rests on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA. Congress passed that law, and another that dealt with religious accommodation more widely, in response to a landmark but controversial 1990 precedent from the court. Five years ago, the  justices ruled that the other law , which has nearly identical language, does allow people whose religious rights have been burdened to seek damages against government officials acting in their individual capacity.\n \n\n   \n  But Louisiana countered that RLUIPA is effectively a spending contract between the federal government, which provides funding for state prisons, and state officials. The individual officials involved in Landor’s forced shaving were not a party to that contract, Louisiana said, so they can’t be held personally liable.\n \n\n   \n  Chief Justice John Roberts said Landor’s argument that state employees had received notice rested on a “legal fiction.”\n \n\n   \n  “I don’t think when the prison guard is hired, he says, ‘well, I want to see the federal conditions that you agreed to under the contract,’” Roberts said.\n \n\n   \n  The court’s three-justice liberal wing saved most of its toughest questions for Louisiana’s attorney.\n \n\n   \n  The court is likely to hand down a decision in the case next year.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/military-teachers-pay-shutdown","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:22:00-05:00","title":"Teachers working without pay in US military schools during shutdown received debt letters","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, civilian employees of the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) — including teachers and administrators — were working without pay.

Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Teachers and other employees of US military schools who have been working without pay during the  government shutdown  received letters this week telling them they owed money to the government, CNN has learned.\n \n\n   \n  Debt letters outlining that personnel have been “overpaid” by various amounts ranging from several hundred dollars to more than $1,000, according to letters viewed by CNN. The letters, sent by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, told employees they have 70 days from the date of the letter to pay the debts.\n \n\n   \n  On Thursday, the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) told employees that the letters were sent out in error due to a glitch that will be corrected once the government is funded. But impacted employees told CNN the letters added to the stress of Defense Department civilians who have been deemed essential and have worked without pay since the shutdown began on October 1. Sources familiar with the letters told CNN it was sent to not only teachers, but principals and other administrative DoDEA employees.\n \n\n   \n  “DoDEA claims it will be corrected at some point after the shutdown ends but gave no indication of when or what the process to correct it will be,” one employee said. “So, in the meantime, DoDEA teachers will continue to not only work for no pay but also be charged a debt for each day we are forced to work without pay.”\n \n\n   \n  Another DOD civilian pointed to longstanding issues with the military’s pay system and said they have little faith the issue will be resolved quickly. A third individual living overseas posted on social media that they received the letter and said the stress “is becoming overwhelming.”\n \n\n   \n  The DoDEA system has 161 schools at home and abroad at US military installations, according to the agency’s website, and teaches more than 60,000 students. As of 2022, there were more than 11,000 full-time personnel within DoDEA.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has ensured active members of the military are being paid throughout the shutdown.\n \n\n   \n  The director of the DoDEA, Beth Schiavino-Narvaez, told employees in an email on Thursday, which was obtained by CNN, that the agency is aware of the “various pay-related issues.” DoDEA is “working closely with the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) to obtain all necessary information regarding the problems that are employees are experiencing due to payroll status changes,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  The issue largely was due to a coding error due to the shutdown, Schiavino-Narvaez’s email said. All employees must be identified by a code for “Leave Without Pay” during the lapse in appropriations for timekeeping purposes, she said. Teachers and administrators’ salaries are based on the number of days in a school year they are paid for, the email goes on to explain, and therefore when a Leave Without Pay code is entered into the pay system, “the payroll system automatically adjusts for overpayment because fewer than the required number of days will be recorded.”\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, due to the age of its system and regulatory requirements, DFAS is unable to override these adjustments, and a debt letter is automatically issued,” the director’s email said.\n \n\n   \n  Schiavino-Narvaez specifies in the email that once the government is funded, timecards will be corrected – but she also told employees that it may take “several pay periods to fully reconcile and cancel” any outstanding debt.\n \n\n   \n  Employees “are not required to make any payments on debt letters at this time,” she said, adding that she recognizes “we are all experiencing extraordinary challenges due to the lapse in appropriations.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN  previously reported  that the morale of civilian employees around the globe — many of whom are veterans or military family members themselves — is dropping rapidly with many considering leaving government service.\n \n\n   \n  The first affected DoDEA employee told CNN that to say the director’s reassurances “don’t mean much is an understatement.”\n \n\n   \n  “They have no urgency to correct this and just tell us to basically wait and hope for the best,” the employee said, “because they don’t know how to fix this and don’t seem overly concerned with finding a method to fix this.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/09/entertainment/hot-ones-jolly-food-celebrity-interviews","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:24:00Z","title":"Wings, Fried Chicken and British Delicacies: How an Appetite for Originality Transformed Celebrity Interviews","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how food-themed celebrity interviews — exemplified by shows like Hot Ones, JOLLY, and Chicken Shop Date — have transformed the landscape of celebrity media by promoting authenticity, cultural connection, and real human interaction.

     \n  By Yahya Salem, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:24 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  Woody Harrelson, the acclaimed actor known for his mellow and jovial energy, was breaking down, barely able to string together coherent sentences because his mouth was on fire from the ludicrously spicy hot sauce that coated his fried cauliflower. Of course, the pain is what you order by coming on Hot Ones, the beloved hot wings YouTube show.\n \n\n   \n  Once it was over, Harrelson still coughing, admitted to  host Sean Evans , “You nearly killed me, dude … and I say that with all due respect, because I know you nearly kill people on the daily.”\n \n\n   \n  Harrelson said that he never thought he’d do the show because he used to think he didn’t have what it took to get to the end of the  poultry gauntlet . “And now, here we are,” he said, victorious.\n \n\n   \n  That sentiment, while proclaimed in jest, captures a current appetite among many celebrities and fans alike to break away from conventional interviews in favor of more authentic and flavorful content.\n \n\n   \n  And what else like breaking bread – or chicken wings or, you know,  yeast extract  – has the ability to break that artifice, foster trust and entice celebrities to lower their guards for a playful exchange to which audiences can relate.\n \n\n   \n  “The hardest part of the interview is penetrating all of that artifice to get something real,” Evans told CNN in a recent interview.\n \n\n   \n  Ollie Kendal, one-half of the food content creator duo, JOLLY, put it even more succinctly in a separate conversation with CNN: “It’s the language everyone speaks: Food…Everyone’s got to eat.”\n \n\n   \n  And trust that people eat up the chance to see Gordon Ramsey serenade Evans with his trademark colorful language while chugging bubblegum-pink stomach soother on what has become Hot Ones’ most watched episode, or John Cena stoically brave the potent musk of British Black pudding (blood sausage) with JOLLY as he declares it a sign of sophistication.\n \n\n   \n  Hot Ones, JOLLY and Amelia Dimoldenberg’s  Chicken Shop Date  – with billions of combined total views and tens of millions of subscribers – are some of the most visible examples of the genre’s popularity.\n \n\n   \n  Many descendants have followed, including traditional media companies that are still trying to find new spins on the concept. (See: The NYT’s launch of “The Pizza Interview,” which asks press-touring celebrities to toss some dough while trying not to get their likely borrowed outfits covered in sauce.)\n \n\n   \n  In what is arguably the boom of the feed-the-famous frenzy, a natural question has emerged: Is it reaching the point of being bloated or is there more to feast on?\n \n\n   \n    Spicing up the press tour\n \n\n   \n  Food’s place within entertainment has never been a gimmick. In fact, it’s an interviewing tradition that dates back decades and has taken many forms.\n \n\n   \n  Jessa Moore, a media specialist with experience in food and tech, points out that culinary hosts like Martha Stewart and Ina Garten have featured celebrities on their shows since the nineties and early aughts. Even  I Love to Eat , the first network TV cooking show to air in the US back in 1946, featured famous designer and actress, Elsie de Wolfe.\n \n\n   \n  Morning shows, too, have for decades welcomed celebrities into their set kitchens for early-morning meal-making.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is entertainment, it’s something you bond over,” Moore told CNN, “Food is culture. People want to interact with each other, and food provides the glue for that.”\n \n\n   \n  In the mid-2010s, the format saw a new iteration of the approach emerge with a gourmet of YouTube shows featuring hungry celebrities – a disruption to what Evans called a “boring,” “PR-driven flight pattern.”\n \n\n   \n  “Hot Ones” mixed up the media blitz. Ten years after its first episode, it is now a desired destination for megastars such as Jennifer Lawrance, Idris Elba,  Lady Gaga  and Shaquille O’Neal, whose reactions to the exponential Scoville levels have been immortalized in internet lore.\n \n\n   \n  “What these food-driven formats reveal is that adding a slice of real life to the interview process (a meal, a drink, or any shared activity) invites authenticity, connection and unexpected honesty,” Lindsay Colker, founder of Elevate Communications, a Los Angeles-based public relations and consulting boutique, told CNN. “And that’s where the magic and the viral moments tend to happen.”\n \n\n   \n  Colker highlighted the format’s ability to blur the lines between “press appearance and personality showcase,” which is aided by hosts who are “often culture-shapers in their own right - disarming, conversational and curious.”\n \n\n   \n  “They know how to draw out personality instead of polished talking points,” she said.\n \n\n   \n  But she emphasized that food-themed interviews – and the wave of new media at large – are complementary and not a replacement to traditional celebrity coverage.\n \n\n   \n  What’s remarkable about these YouTube food-themed interviews is the fact that the ingredients to their success aren’t concealed in secret family heirloom or fabled recipes; no 11 herbs and spices kept away from the other online creators. It’s a straightforward blend of originality, ingenuity and accessibility.\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY had already invested years in creating food content prior to featuring celebrities in their videos. Josh Carrott, the other half of JOLLY, and Kendal said that getting celebrities to share food and culture away from the “sterile, sanitized junket world,” is not a fading gimmick they’re squeezing for views.\n \n\n   \n  “Food is like the great connector,” Carrott said. “I think over the years, our content has evolved into sharing culture through food.”\n \n\n   \n    ‘Like’ and subscribe\n \n\n   \n  Evans likens the growth of food-themed interviews to that of podcasts, which were once relatively obscure but are now omnipresent.\n \n\n   \n  “The landscape is going to shift,” said Evans, “But, overall, if you like interview shows, you have certainly tons of options, and I think at a higher quality now than 10 years ago.”\n \n\n   \n  Evans celebrates the growth of the niche from “barren, empty shelves” to a marketplace filled with great offerings, but he also acknowledges the concerns that it might be too much, conceding that audience fatigue is plausible in the midst of what he described as the “boom times” of the genre.\n \n\n   \n  Moore said that no matter how famous a host or a guest is, or how elaborate and slick a production is, an unauthentic product will not resonate with audiences.\n \n\n   \n  Colker echoed the sentiment.\n \n\n   \n  “These types of appearances only fatigue clients when they start to feel repetitive or disconnected from their story,” Colker said. “The sweet spot is where creativity meets comfort and when it feels natural, not performative.”\n \n\n   \n  JOLLY’s approach to content creation has always centered the fans as its North Star, which they try to follow through endless trial and error, as well as excruciating analysis of audience metrics. This includes an examination of the kinds of brands and celebrities JOLLY looks to associate with, the best platforms to reach their audience and even the lengths of videos.\n \n\n   \n  “The focus for us has been: Can we make good content that people want to see?” Kendal said, “We’re not really interested in doing content for content’s sake.”\n \n\n   \n  Whether food-themed interviews have reached their inflection point, let alone oversaturation, is yet to be determined. For now, the proof is in the pudding as more online creators and legacy media outlets continue to add to the loaded pantry of this genre.\n \n\n   \n  In 2024, Vogue revived an infrequent online cooking segment under a new title,  Now Serving.  YouTuber Quenlin Blackwell’s rebranded her FEEDING STARVING INFLUENCERS series to now feature celebrities. And across the pond, broadcaster Nick Grimshaw and Michelin star chef Angela Hartnett launched  Dish,  where celebrities enjoy conversations over one of Hartnett’s acclaimed creations.\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, other creators and outlets have seemingly started to  abandon the concept. Harper’s BAZAAR’s online series,  Food Diaries , was abruptly discontinued in 2023 after a six-year run, and internet personality, Joey Camasta, concluded his raunchy take on the concept after only one season of  Could I Get in Your Pantry?  \n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to Hearst and Camasta for comment.\n \n\n   \n  But as long as the media climate provides the perfect temperature for these shows to grow and expand, and until audiences are satiated to the point of nausea, creators will continue to cook up fresh ideas.\n \n\n   \n  Carrott and Kendal are already manifesting their dream episodes: southern biscuits and gravy versus English tea and biscuits with Matthew McConaughey, and going through the Waffle House menu with Prince Harry.\n \n\n   \n  “That’s kind of a perfect example of what we want to achieve,” said Carrott. “Sharing culture and authentic passion over a meal with someone.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-project-athena","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"13:11:00-05:00","title":"A plan written by Trump’s NASA pick was leaked.

leaked. Here’s what to know about ‘Project Athena’ \n       \n  By Jackie Wattles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        1:11 PM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  A 62-page document written by President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again pick to run NASA,  billionaire Jared Isaacman , outlines a sweeping, ambitious, and at times controversial plan for the space agency.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman, who was  tapped  to be NASA administrator after Trump was elected in 2024, only to see his nomination  retracted  months later, was  renominated  for the top job last Tuesday.\n \n\n   \n  While Isaacman has publicly acknowledged the leaked document, which is labeled May 2025 but was recently leaked to several news outlets, he  said  in a social media post that “parts of it are now dated.” He did not specify which portions were obsolete.\n \n\n   \n  It nonetheless set off a flurry of speculation about how the space agency would function with Isaacman at the helm. A copy of the document was obtained and authenticated by CNN.\n \n\n   \n  In his statement, which was posted the day of his renomination, Isaacman  said  that “Project Athena,” as the paper is titled, “was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.”\n \n\n   \n  “I would think it is better to have a plan going into a responsibility as great as the leadership of NASA than no plan at all,” the statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  Among the proposed goals are revamping some NASA centers to focus on nuclear electric propulsion, establishing a new Mars exploration program, and embracing an “accelerate/fix/delete” philosophy to reshape the agency.\n \n\n   \n  If enacted, many of the policies laid out could significantly alter the day-to-day lives of NASA workers and transform the 67-year-old agency.\n \n\n   \n  “I think it is presenting a more dramatic set of changes than many in the space community were expecting,” said Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society, of the document.\n \n\n   \n  Some lawmakers have also expressed concern about how Isaacman might seek to reform NASA campuses across the country.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman still faces a confirmation vote in the Senate and would need Congressional approval for many of the objectives mapped out in the document.\n \n\n   \n  As a tech CEO — who made his fortune by founding payments company Shift4 at age 16 and has twice  flown to orbit  on self-funded SpaceX missions — Isaacman is an unorthodox pick for NASA’s top role.\n \n\n   \n  Space agency administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics and public servants.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman has also garnered broad support within the commercial space industry, where he’s perceived as an energetic outsider ready to usher NASA into a new era.\n \n\n   \n    A power struggle\n \n\n   \n  According to a source familiar with the matter, the original Project Athena document was more than 100 pages. Isaacman made only three hard copies of a truncated 62-page version and distributed them to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and his chief of staff. The leak — according to a recent Ars Technica report and a source who confirmed the account to CNN — looked to have been part of an effort by Duffy, who is temporarily running NASA, to spur controversy and potentially thwart Isaacman’s renomination.\n \n\n   \n  CNN previously  reported  that Duffy has said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  A spokesperson for Duffy previously denied that he’s said he wishes to remain in the NASA administrator job, and Isaacman said in his social media statement, posted after the “Project Athena” document was leaked, that he believes Duffy has “great instincts and is an excellent communicator.” (The spokesperson for Duffy did not offer comment for this story.)\n \n\n   \n  “If there is any friction, I suspect it is more political operators causing the controversy,” Isaacman said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman was renominated for the NASA post on November 4, one day after reports about the Athena document began circulating in the news.\n \n\n   \n  “I think (the people who leaked Project Athena) thought this would ruffle feathers amongst the delegations that care about human spaceflight,” said one former NASA official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private document. “I will tell you — it hasn’t worked.”\n \n\n   \n  CNN reached out to nearly a dozen senators whose home states have NASA centers that could be pegged for major changes, according to the Project Athena document. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland — the home of Goddard Space Flight Center — offered the most detailed responses.\n \n\n   \n  Van Hollen said in a statement that he had met with Isaacman earlier this year and he “looks forward to another hearing to discuss further with him why the next space race and the search for habitable planets runs through Maryland.”\n \n\n   \n  “To protect our nation’s innovation leadership, he must be more than a rubber stamp for the Administration’s chainsaw approach to our space science initiatives,” Van Hollen said.\n \n\n   \n  Warner, whose state houses NASA’s Langley campus, urged Isaacman to “engage with Congress and reconsider any plan that threatens these world-class facilities and the communities that depend on them.”\n \n\n   \n  “The reported proposals to downsize or privatize key missions at Langley and Wallops would be a serious mistake, jeopardizing critical scientific capabilities and the talented workforce whose expertise keeps the United States at the forefront of aerospace research,” Warner’s statement reads.\n \n\n   \n  No lawmaker reached by CNN indicated how they intended to vote on Isaacman’s confirmation.\n \n\n   \n    A Mars shot and nuclear propulsion\n \n\n   \n  One eye-popping proposal in Project Athena is to set up a new Mars program, dubbed “Olympus.”\n \n\n   \n  Much of that vision, the source familiar with the document told CNN, was intended to align NASA with SpaceX’s goal of sending an uncrewed Starship spacecraft to the Martian surface next year.\n \n\n   \n  SpaceX’s plan, which CEO Elon Musk  discussed  publicly in May, “was going to be a more-or-less free mission that SpaceX was going to do anyway,” the source said. The thinking was that NASA could step in to provide support through the Olympus program at minimal cost to taxpayers, according to the source.\n \n\n   \n  The document also includes numerous mentions of setting up an expansive program to pursue nuclear electric propulsion — which involves powering spacecraft engines with electricity from small nuclear reactors. The technology could one day provide steady, long-lasting power for faster and more flexible deep-space missions, including Mars travel.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has pushed publicly for expanding such research, writing in an August op-ed for  RealClearScience  that he coauthored with Newt Gingrich that the space agency should focus on tasks and research “no other agency, organization, or company is capable of accomplishing.”\n \n\n   \n  Nuclear electric propulsion is an example of such a focus area, the op-ed argues.\n \n\n   \n  “Our competitors are not waiting. China and Russia are investing heavily in nuclear space technologies. If America wants to lead, NASA must take on the hard problems again and do the near-impossible,” Isaacman and Gingrich wrote in the article.\n \n\n   \n  Project Athena also suggests setting up a demonstration mission to dock a nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft with a crewed vehicle in orbit, according to the leaked paper.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s nuclear vision also proposes that NASA centers working on projects like the  Space Launch System rocket  — including the Marshall and Michoud facilities in Alabama and Louisiana — shift their focus to nuclear electric propulsion development when the SLS program concludes.\n \n\n   \n  When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said Tuberville had not met with Isaacman yet but he “will, of course, ask about Marshall.”\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the document noted that it was crafted around the same time the Trump White House drafted the President’s Budget Request, or PBR, which called for canceling NASA’s SLS rocket and some other major projects that could have left multiple NASA centers without a cornerstone program.\n \n\n   \n  The source said that Isaacman began compiling the Project Athena document in late 2024 and updated it as he had conversations with policymakers. The source also said that Isaacman did not help draft the PBR.\n \n\n   \n  With this summer’s “Big Beautiful Bill” expressly extending the SLS program through at least the next four missions, it appears Isaacman may delay implementing a bold new focus on nuclear electric propulsion research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman  said  November 4 on social media that he hopes to zero-in on those pursuits only after a “foundation” of lunar exploration has been built.\n \n\n   \n    To the moon\n \n\n   \n  When the Project Athena document was drafted in early 2025, Trump had already signaled a renewed interest in Mars — even mentioning exploration of the planet in his  inaugural address  while staying silent on NASA’s ongoing efforts to return astronauts to the moon.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman echoed Trump’s Mars ambitions during a confirmation hearing in April, saying he intended to pursue exploration of the red planet in tandem with NASA’s moon program. However, questions about how he would fund such projects  loomed .\n \n\n   \n  In the months since, however, the moon has emerged as the  clear policy priority  amid a renewed space race with China, which is aiming to land its taikonauts on the lunar surface by 2030.\n \n\n   \n  The recent push to bolster NASA’s moon missions, including a $10 billion influx Congress gave the agency’s human spaceflight efforts in July, “brings clarity to the topic,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  But Isaacman is back in the running for the top NASA job at a time when the agency’s plans for a crewed moon landing, called Artemis III, are  in flux .\n \n\n   \n    Shifting lunar plans\n \n\n   \n  The Artemis III mission, which is slated to launch later this decade, currently hinges on SpaceX’s Starship ferrying NASA astronauts down to the lunar surface.\n \n\n   \n  But some policy experts have grown increasingly  concerned  that Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — is too large, novel and complex to meet NASA’s urgent timeline.\n \n\n   \n  Duffy recently signaled  a willingness to boot SpaceX  off the project, saying he would ask the company and its chief competitor, Blue Origin, to show how they could expedite development of their respective lunar landers.\n \n\n   \n  Those remarks prompted an acerbic response from Musk, a friend of Isaacman’s, who referred to the interim NASA leader as “ Sean Dummy .”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has not publicly said whether he would support sidelining SpaceX from the Artemis III mission. But a source familiar with the matter said that Isaacman has expressed an intention to partner with whichever company most quickly produces an astronaut-worthy lunar lander.\n \n\n   \n  The Project Athena “plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.\n \n\n   \n  “The plan valued human exploration as much as scientific discovery,” Isaacman said. “It was written as a starting place to give NASA, international partners, and the commercial sector the best chance for long-term success.”\n \n\n   \n    Uncertainty for science\n \n\n   \n  The source familiar with the Project Athena document said some of the more controversial aspects of the plan warrant more explanation.\n \n\n   \n  One line item in the document, for example, states that Isaacman intends to take “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine” — a proposal that critics say said could impede the nation’s ability to gather crucial environmental data.\n \n\n   \n  The document also maps out similar policies that could be applied across many of NASA’s initiatives, such as recommendations to embrace “science-as-service” for future projects.\n \n\n   \n  Such measures, calling for researchers to focus on purchasing data from the private sector, could mark a significant change for the agency.\n \n\n   \n  Similar policy philosophies have been tried at NASA, particularly in the 1990s during a “better, faster, cheaper reformulation,” Dreier noted. But enthusiasm waned for that approach when a  pair of Mars missions  were lost.\n \n\n   \n  And the commercial space industry may not be in a position to take up all the tasks Isaacman’s Athena document suggests it can, he said.\n \n\n   \n  “It places a lot of faith on the commercial marketplace to deliver in ways that it hasn’t had the chance to fully be tested on,” Dreier said.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s social media statement also acknowledges his “science-as-a-service” concept “got people fired up” but clarified that he intended to focus on purchasing data from Earth observation satellites: “Why build bespoke satellites at greater cost and delay when you could pay for the data as needed from existing providers and repurpose the funds for more planetary science missions (as an example)?”\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman has also publicly defended science programs such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was slated for budget cuts in the PBR. And he stated he’d be willing to spend his own money to get the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope off the ground. “I was prepared to personally cover the cost to launch Roman — if that’s what it took to get to the science,” Isaacman said in a June social media  post . (That same promise appears in the Project Athena document.)\n \n\n   \n  “Anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue,” Isaacman’s November 4 statement reads.\n \n\n   \n    A rankled workforce\n \n\n   \n  Among the other proposals in the Project Athena document are plans to hasten NASA’s reorganization. The agency has already lost roughly 4,000 of its 18,000 employees as part of the Trump administration’s deferred resignation program.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman said in his social media statement last week that he wishes to move away from rolling out piecemeal change and instead implement “a single, data-driven reorganization aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy between leadership and the engineers, researchers, and technicians.”\n \n\n   \n  Extensive changes, however, could further disgruntle a workforce that has been  reeling  from looming budget cuts and what employees have  described  as political distractions and discordant communication from leadership.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s document also details myriad other plans to change how the agency operates — such as conducting a sweeping review of NASA’s boards and committees to suspend any that “delay decision making,” and reimagine the space agency’s approach to risk assessment.\n \n\n   \n  “We will ensure safety is at the forefront of our decisions but achieving the mission of NASA means accepting that some risks are worth taking,” the document reads.\n \n\n   \n  Former NASA astronaut and SpaceX advisor Garrett Reisman, who has long said he believes NASA may have become too risk-averse in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster, told CNN in a November 8 phone interview he was encouraged to see that Isaacman hopes to reevaluate that aspect of the agency.\n \n\n   \n  It would be unwise, he added, to start eliminating safety organizations — but they could be revamped to create a “healthy tension” between risk assessors and engineers seeking to push boundaries.\n \n\n   \n  However, he cautioned that “it’s really hard to know in the moment if you’re going too far or not,” Reisman said. “It’s a very difficult thing to do, so I wish him good luck.”\n \n\n   \n    A leader of change\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman is generally well regarded across the space industry, where he has largely been viewed as a passionate leader who can enact visionary change.\n \n\n   \n  In an emailed statement, Dreier, the Planetary Society executive, acknowledged that the Project Athena document “was prepared in a different era.” NASA has since received billions of dollars for projects including lunar exploration, Dreier noted, and science advocates have demonstrated an outpouring of opposition to Trump’s proposed cuts to research.\n \n\n   \n  Isaacman’s renomination to the NASA chief job now presents “a good opportunity to engage on some of these proposals, particularly as they relate to science,” Dreier added.\n \n\n   \n  In his social media post, Isaacman said that, if the Project Athena document becomes public, “I will stand behind it,” adding that he believes “there are many elements of the plan that the space community and NASA would find exciting.”\n \n\n   \n  But he did not wish to debate the plan “line-by-line while NASA and the rest of the government are going through a shutdown,” according to the November 4 post.\n \n\n   \n  More broadly, Isaacman has suggested he intends to enter the NASA job with an open mind and adjust course based on feedback.\n \n\n   \n  In a social media post in June, for example, Isaacman wrote that he “didn’t love” being approached by “people who thought they were uniquely NASA’s savior.” He added: “I have little interest in doing the same.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-special-treatment-commutation-raskin-whistleblower","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:43:00-05:00","title":"Ghislaine Maxwell gets special treatment in prison, Rep.

Hodges  allowed same-sex couples to marry.\n \n\n   \n  The court did not explain its reasoning to deny the appeal, which had received outsized attention – in part because the court’s 6-3 conservative majority three years ago overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion that 1973 decision established. Since then, fears about Obergefell being the precedent to fall have grown.\n \n\n   \n  “Today, love won again,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “When public officials take an oath to serve their communities, that promise extends to everyone – including LGBTQ+ people. The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences.”\n \n\n   \n  Mat Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, the legal group that represented Davis, said the former clerk would now face “crippling monetary damages based on nothing more than purported hurt feelings.”\n \n\n   \n  “Like the abortion decision in Roe v. Wade, Obergefell was egregiously wrong from the start,” Staver said. “We will continue to work to overturn Obergefell. It is not a matter of if, but when the Supreme Court will overturn Obergefell.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court today is far different and far more conservative than the one that decided Obergefell in 2015, which is part of what had given LGBTQ advocates pause about the Davis appeal.\n \n\n   \n  Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key swing vote who authored the Obergefell decision, retired in 2018 and was replaced by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon who was also in the Obergefell majority, died in 2020 and was succeeded by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative.\n \n\n   \n  Three current justices – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito – were in dissent in Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  Kennedy’s opinion spoke eloquently of the most fundamental values of family, love and liberty.\n \n\n   \n  “No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,” Kennedy wrote. “In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.”\n \n\n   \n  The Obergefell decision prompted a massive celebration that began outside the Supreme Court on the day it was decided in late June of 2015. That evening, the White House was lit in rainbow colors. Many same-sex couples rushed into courthouses to wed. Nearly 600,000 same-sex couples have since married, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.\n \n\n   \n  But some conservatives viewed the outcome as a betrayal and predicted future conflicts with religion. Davis, who at the time was the clerk of Rowan County in Kentucky, cited her religious objection to same-sex marriage as justifying her decision to withhold marriage licenses to all couples. She was sued by multiple couples in the county, and a jury ordered her to pay $360,000 in damages and legal fees.\n \n\n   \n  After a federal court found she had violated a court order to issue licenses, Davis was also thrown in jail for several days.\n \n\n   \n  Writing in dissent, the late Justice Antonin Scalia blasted the court’s decision as a “threat to American democracy.”\n \n\n   \n  “The substance of today’s decree is not of immense personal importance to me,” he wrote. “But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today’s judicial Putsch.”\n \n\n   \n  Davis had argued that it was time “for a course correction” on Obergefell.\n \n\n   \n  While virtually all of the focus on Davis’ appeal was aimed at her request to overturn Obergefell, the bulk of case actually dealt with a series of more technical questions. In appealing the damages verdict against her, the former clerk argued that the First Amendment’s religious protections should shield her from legal liability, particularly since she is no longer a public official. The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument.\n \n\n   \n  Several conservatives justices had signaled in recent weeks that there was no great appetite to reopen Obergefell. Barrett  told the  New York Times  last month there are “very concrete reliance interests” at stake when it comes to same-sex marriage. Alito, while criticizing the precedent broadly during an address in Washington earlier this fall, stressed that it was a “precedent of the court that is entitled to the respect afforded by the doctrine of stare decisis.”\n \n\n   \n  At the same time, there have been worrying signs for LGBTQ rights groups – particularly when it comes to cases involving transgender Americans. In recent months, the high court handed down a major decision allowing states to ban the use of  puberty blockers and hormone therapy  for trans youth, allowed the Trump administration to bar transgender Americans from serving in the military and allowed the administration to require US passports to include sex markers consistent with a  person’s sex at birth .\n \n\n   \n  Mary Bonauto, a veteran civil rights attorney at GLAD Law who argued the Obergefell case, celebrated the court’s quick rejection of Davis’ appeal.\n \n\n   \n  “The only thing that has changed since  Obergefell  was decided is that people across the country have seen how marriage equality provides protection for families and children, and that protection strengthens communities, the economy and our society,” Bonauto said. “Today millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of relief for their families, current or hoped for, because all families deserve equal rights under the law.”\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court’s decision to decline to hear the Davis appeal sets no precedent. If another appeal arrives threatening to undermine or overturn Obergefell, the court will review that appeal from scratch.\n \n\n   \n   This story was updated with additional details and reaction. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/mail-in-ballots-supreme-court-mississippi","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:56:00-05:00","title":"Supreme Court Agrees to Decide If Mail-in Ballots Can Arrive After Election Day","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Supreme Court has agreed to rule on whether states can count mail-in ballots received after Election Day, following a Republican-led lawsuit challenging Mississippi’s law that allows ballots to be received up to five days after Election Day if postmarked by Election Day.

decide if mail-in ballots can arrive after Election Day \n       \n  By John Fritze, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:56 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The Supreme Court  agreed Monday  to decide whether states may count mail-in  ballots received after Election Day , taking up a Republican-led lawsuit that could affect election laws in more than a dozen states across the country.\n \n\n   \n  It is the latest of several high-profile voting cases to make it on to the Supreme Court’s docket this year as the justices are asked to deal with controversies dating back over the past several elections.\n \n\n   \n  Fifteen states allow regular mail ballots to be accepted after Election Day, including  presidential battleground Nevada . Most of the nation’s battleground states – including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – require ballots to be received by Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  Other states accept military ballots after Election Day.\n \n\n   \n  A Mississippi law, enacted during the Covid-19 pandemic, allows ballots to be received up to five days late, so long as they are postmarked by Election Day. The Republican National Committee and others sued over that law, claiming the provision violated a federal law that fixes the date for the election.\n \n\n   \n  “With rare outliers, the states mandated that ballots must be received by election officials by election day,” the RNC told the Supreme Court in written arguments this year. “But recently, an increasing number of States – including Mississippi – have deviated from that practice by permitting at least some ballots to be received after election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Officials in Mississippi, where  Trump carried more than 60% of the vote , have questioned the RNC’s logic. An election, they told the Supreme Court, is the choice of an official.\n \n\n   \n  “Voters make that choice by casting – marking and submitting – their ballots by election day. The election has then occurred, even if election officials do not receive all ballots by that day,” Mississippi officials said in written arguments. “Under Mississippi law, voters cast their ballots by election day.”\n \n\n   \n  Raising doubts about ballots that were not counted until after Election Day was key to President Donald Trump’s efforts to delegitimize the 2020 election. The question in the case is about ballots that were received after the election, not ballots that are received before the election but not counted until later.\n \n\n   \n  The conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that Mississippi was  violating federal law by counting mail ballots that arrived after Election Day , but the court notably stopped short of blocking the state’s policy before the 2024 presidential election.\n \n\n   \n  The Supreme Court is already considering other important cases involving voting and elections. It heard arguments in October in a case challenging the power of the Voting Rights Act to limit  discrimination in redistricting . The Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority  signaled deep skepticism  in that case over the creation of a second majority Black district in Louisiana in a case that could have nationwide implications.\n \n\n   \n  And a majority of the court late month indicated it would likely back a Republican congressman from Illinois who is challenging a state law that allows  mail ballots to be received after Election Day , a decision that would let him proceed with a potentially explosive lawsuit that lower courts had rejected.\n \n\n   \n   This story has been updated with additional details. \n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/entertainment/sissy-spacek-carrie-blood","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:47:00-05:00","title":"Sissy Spacek says getting doused in fake pig’s blood was ‘terrible’","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Sissy Spacek reflects on her experience filming the infamous blood-dousing scene in the 1976 horror film 'Carrie,' describing it as 'terrible' due to the sticky, unpleasant nature of fake pig’s blood.

The US military carried out another attack against suspected drug boats on Sunday, killing six people in the Eastern Pacific, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n \n\n   \n  The military launched two lethal strikes against two separate vessels “operated by designated terrorist organizations,” Hegseth  wrote on X , without disclosing which organizations the ships’ crew are believed to have been affiliated with.\n \n\n   \n  “These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said.\n \n\n   \n  The US military has killed 76 people in 19 strikes that have destroyed 20 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States.\n \n\n   \n  There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before

Meet the stylish teen dresser snapped at scene of heist \n       \n  By Caroline Baum and Saskya Vandoorne, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:25 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As all eyes turned to the Louvre after the  shocking theft  of the  French crown jewels , one especially stylish figure on the museum grounds caught the internet’s attention: a sharply dressed young man, wearing a three-piece suit and a fedora tilted just so.\n \n\n   \n  As speculation swirled about the identity of the so-called “French detective” pictured at the scene, 15-year-old Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, who featured in the photo, was enjoying his new double life.\n \n\n   \n  The teenager met CNN at his home in Rambouillet, about 30 miles southwest of the French capital, to discuss the social media furor.\n \n\n   \n  Though he may cite fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot as a style icon, Pedro confirmed that he was not involved in any investigations and that he had not been able to locate any of the €88 million ($102m) stolen crown jewels.\n \n\n   \n  He learned about the viral photo when a friend showed him a TikTok video with the now-famous image. The video had nearly 6 million views.\n \n\n   \n  “In the moment, it was, like, very funny. And we went back to the Louvre to see the reaction of the people,” he told CNN. “People maybe recognized me, but I’m not sure.”\n \n\n   \n  Pedro had planned to spend October 19, the day of the Louvre heist, at the famed museum with his mother and grandfather. When the trio arrived to find the museum closed, the stylish highschooler was unknowingly photographed by an AP journalist documenting the crime scene.\n \n\n   \n  What many online commentators had deemed a detective outfit is simply Pedro’s everyday look.\n \n\n   \n  “For me, it’s important to dress classic. And I like to dress like that because I love history, especially the 20th century,” he said.\n \n\n   \n  The young history buff has been embracing 40s-era fashion for almost a year now, he said. His obsession with the style began when he dressed as Jean Moulin, a hero of the French resistance during World War II, for carnival, a festive period celebrated in many countries ahead of Lent. Amid the parades and costumed festival-goers, he found a liking for the new look.\n \n\n   \n  “He realized the effect he had on other people,” his mother, Félicité Garzon Delvaux, explained. “Everyone looked impressed. Okay, something is happening there.”\n \n\n   \n  Since then, he has adopted the vintage style everywhere, even at school.\n \n\n   \n  Unlike many of his classmates, Pedro does not own sweatpants. He is not, however, above reaching for the cargo pant on occasion.\n \n\n   \n  Good taste has long been a topic of discussion for the Garzon Delvaux family.\n \n\n   \n  Pedro’s mother, who brought him to the Louvre on that eventful day, grew up in Chartres, about 50 miles southwest of Paris, “in a museum” with an art curator for a mother and a prolific French storyteller for a father.\n \n\n   \n  In their home in Rambouillet, paintings, antiques and knick-knacks line walls and shelves in a manner reminiscent of an exhibition.\n \n\n   \n  “The beauty of things is always very important in our family,” Félicité affirmed.\n \n\n   \n  Due to her husband’s job as a diplomat, the family moved often, living in England, Spain, Bangladesh, and eastern France before returning to Rambouillet four years ago.\n \n\n   \n  Some of the Pedro’s most striking pieces have been gathered from around the world.\n \n\n   \n  His vintage Soviet watch, for example, was bought in an antique store in Calcutta and repaired with parts that he sourced from Bulgaria with his father.\n \n\n   \n  His first tailored suit was commissioned at the age of 12 during a year spent in Bangladesh.\n \n\n   \n  Asked what he wants to do in the future, Pedro said he was interested in pursuing diplomacy like his father and paternal grandfather, or perhaps joining the military.\n \n\n   \n  The young man conceded that the uniforms may have something to do with the matter.\n \n\n   \n  But despite his carefully cultivated appearances, Pedro remains an enthusiastic young man of his own generation.\n \n\n   \n  When asked if his friends at school appreciate his style, he was quick to respond.  “Yeah, I think I have a lot of aura.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/health/alcohol-heavy-drinking-stroke-wellness","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:00:00.000-05:00","title":"Protect Your Brain by Cutting Down on Alcohol Consumption","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A new study published in Neurology finds that heavy alcohol consumption — defined as three or more drinks per day — is associated with an average of 11 years earlier onset of brain bleeds (bleeding strokes).

your brain by cutting down on alcohol consumption \n       \n  By Gina Park, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        10:00 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  It’s second nature for some people to pour a glass of wine on a nice evening or to pop open a can of beer during a sports event — but when does drinking become too much?\n \n\n   \n  Heavy alcohol use, which researchers defined as regular alcohol consumption of three or more drinks per day, is linked to more severe brain bleeds (or a bleeding stroke) and earlier long-term brain damage, according to a study published November 5, in the journal  Neurology .\n \n\n   \n  “A bleeding stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage, is when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing blood to leak out and damage the surrounding brain tissue. Bleeding strokes account for about (15% to 20%) of all strokes,” Dr. Mitchell Elkind, chief science officer of brain health and stroke at the American Heart Association, said in an email. He was not part of the study.\n \n\n   \n  “The other kind of stroke, about 80%, is an  ischemic stroke , in which a clot or blockage of the blood vessel occurs and there is a lack of blood flow to part of the brain, causing it to die from lack of oxygen and nutrients,” Elkind said. “Bleeding strokes are typically more dangerous and disabling.”\n \n\n   \n  Some  17%  of adults in the United States binge drink and 6% drink heavily, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024,  29.7 million  Americans ages 12 and older had alcohol use disorder, a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption that can cause impairment of physical or mental health.\n \n\n   \n  “People who were drinking an average of three glasses of alcohol per day had their brain bleeds on an average of 11 years younger than compared to people who were drinking less glasses of alcohol,” said Dr. M. Edip Gurol, the study’s lead author.\n \n\n   \n    Who is at risk of a bleeding stroke?\n \n\n   \n  In the United States,  795,000 people  experience a stroke each year, and 10% of those are bleeding strokes.\n \n\n   \n  “Unfortunately, anyone — even children — can have a bleeding stroke. But the risks go up quickly with age, especially after age 55 or so,” said Elkind, professor emeritus of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University. “The most important risk factor for brain hemorrhage overall is high blood pressure, or hypertension. Hypertension increases with age. Recently we have been seeing more strokes in younger people due to increasing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in young adults.”\n \n\n   \n   Nearly half of American adults , or 119.9 million people, have hypertension or high blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  Some  symptoms  of high blood pressure include headaches, shortness of breath and nosebleeds.\n \n\n   \n  “Another important cause of strokes in younger people is the use of illicit substances: so not just alcohol, but use of cocaine, methamphetamine and other stimulants, heroin and other injected drugs, can lead to strokes and brain hemorrhages,” Elkind said. “Alcohol — and stimulants, in particular — can increase blood pressure, leading to higher risk of strokes of all types, including bleeding.”\n \n\n   \n  Other than stroke,  hypertension  can also cause chronic kidney disease, heart disease and artery disease.\n \n\n   \n  “For patients who had a brain bleed or patients who have MRI markers of higher than usual brain bleeding risk such as brain microbleeds, I recommend them to completely stop alcohol intake or use it very sparingly,” said Gurol, a vascular neurologist at Mass General Brigham, suggesting no more than up to six times per year and never exceeding more than a glass over 24 hours.\n \n\n   \n    Decreasing your risk of a bleeding stroke\n \n\n   \n  Elkind recommends getting your blood pressure under control to help prevent a stroke.\n \n\n   \n  “Get it checked by a doctor or at a local pharmacy,” he said, “and if elevated, get it under control through lifestyle change and medication, if needed.”\n \n\n   \n  An easy way to lower blood pressure is to do aerobic exercises, such as  walking . Following good  walking form  by standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms and practicing  conscious or nasal breathing  will help regulate your body.\n \n\n   \n  Changes in your diet, such as  reducing salt intake  and following a  Mediterranean diet , can also improve heart health and lower blood pressure.\n \n\n   \n  The new study’s findings were based on data collected from 1,600 adults with a median age of 75 who were hospitalized for intracerebral hemorrhage. Participants were all admitted patients at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and were predominantly White.\n \n\n   \n  Since data was collected retrospectively, it “could be biased by the occurrence of the hemorrhage itself: people or proxies may report higher levels of alcohol consumption after a life-changing event like a cerebral hemorrhage. This could lead to biased estimates of the effect,” Elkind said. “In a true prospectively designed study, the data about alcohol consumption would be collected before the hemorrhage had occurred.”\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5601771","dateOfPublication":"2023-04-05","timeOfPublication":"20:30:00Z","title":"Government Proposes Expanded Surveillance Measures Amid Public Outcry Over Digital Privacy","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A recent article has brought renewed attention to the issue of digital privacy in the face of expanding government surveillance.

Now, two decades later, she's back with  What to Eat Now , a revised field guide for the supermarket of 2025. Nestle recommends what she called a \"triple duty\" diet aimed at preventing hunger, obesity and climate change: \"Eat real food, processed as little as possible, with a big emphasis on plants,\" she says.  Interview highlights On how supermarkets are in the business of selling products, not providing nutrition  The more products you see, the more you're likely to buy. Therefore, the products that are organized so that you cannot miss them are in prime supermarket real estate. And companies pay the supermarkets to place their products at eye level, at the ends of aisles — those have a special name, end caps — and at the cash register. When you see products at the catch register, they're paying fees to the supermarket by the inch of space. And that's how supermarkets make a lot of their money, is through slotting fees. And, of course, what this does is it keeps small producers out, because they can't afford to make those kinds of payments. ... I mean, we're talking about thousands, or in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And every single product that is in a supermarket is placed where it is for a reason. On how dollar stores got into the food business \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       They started out by selling the most popular ultra-processed foods. ... They're going to have chips. They're going to have sugar-sweetened cereals. They're going to have every junk food you could possibly think of. That's what they make their money off of. They will have a few fruits and vegetables, a few sad bananas, a few sad apples, maybe some pears, maybe some green vegetables, but not very many, and they'll be in a case off somewhere because they have to offer those. Because they're taking SNAP benefits, they're required to meet the stocking requirements of the SNAP program, which requires them to have a certain number of fruits and vegetables. … And [dollar stores are] just everywhere. And during the pandemic, particularly, they just proliferated like mad, and they undercut local stores. They're cheaper. They have poorer quality food, but the prices are lower. Price is an enormous issue.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you want a Trader Joe's or a Whole Foods or a Wegmans in your neighborhood, you've got to have hundreds of thousands of people within walking distance or quick driving distance who make very, very good incomes or the [people] aren't gonna go there. They're going to close the stores that are not performing well, meaning having lots and lots of people spending lots and lots of money at them. And so as the big grocery stores have closed in inner city neighborhoods, the dollar stores moved in. On food waste in America \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Our food system in the United States produces  4,000 calories  a day for every man, woman and little tiny baby in the country. That's roughly twice what the population needs on average. So waste is built into the system. Because that's how the subsidies work. The agricultural subsidies encourage food producers to produce as much food as possible because they get paid for the amount of food that they produce.  On initially agreeing with  Robert F. Kennedy Jr .'s \" Make America Healthy Again \" approach to the food industry I was very hopeful when he was appointed, because he was talking about, let's get the toxins out of the food supply. Let's make America healthy again. Let's make America's kids healthy again. Let's do something about ultra-processed foods. Let's do something about mercury and fish. And a lot of other issues that I thought, \"Oh, how absolutely terrific that we're going to have somebody who cares about the same kind of issues I do. This is very exciting.\"  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       When President Trump introduced his nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on social media, President Trump talked about the food industrial complex. I nearly fell off my chair! I thought, \"Here's the president sounding just like me. What's going on here?\" So then we had the first MAHA report, the first Make America Healthy Again report, which talked about a lot of these issues and put in an aspirational agenda. \"We're going to work on this, this and this\" — all of that sounded terrific. And then the second report came out and they had backed off on nearly all of the things that I thought were really critically important. On why she believes the food system needs a revolution I think it would start with transforming our agricultural production system to one that was focused on food for people instead of animals and automobiles. We would need to change our electoral system so that we could elect officials who were interested in public health rather than corporate health. We would need to fix our economy so that Wall Street favors corporations who have social values and public health values as part of their corporate mission. Those are revolutionary concepts at this point because they seem so far from what is attainable. But I think if we don't work on that now, if we do not do what we can to advocate for a better food system, we won't get it. And it's only if we advocate for it that we have a chance of getting it. And you never know, sometimes you get lucky. … I tell people that they can't do it on their own, that even the act of going into a grocery store and trying to make healthy choices means that you, as an individual, are up against an entire food system that is aimed at getting you to eat the most profitable foods possible, regardless of their effects on health and the environment. So you have to join organizations. You have to join with other people who are interested in the same issues and concerned about the same problems and get together with them to set some goals for what you'd like to do and then work towards those goals. Because if you don't do it, who will? Therese Madden and Anna Bauman   produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

Today, my guest is Marion Nestle, the molecular biologist-turned nutritionist and food policy scholar whose voice has helped decode for decades what we eat and why it matters. Her well-known book \"What To Eat\" became a consumer bible of sorts when it came out in 2006, guiding readers aisle by aisle through the supermarket while exposing how industry marketing and policy steer our food choices. Two decades later, she's back with \"What To Eat Now,\" a revised field guide for the supermarket of 2025, where ultra-processed foods, plant-based meats, corporate organics and our ability to have food delivered to our very doorstep have rewritten the rules. Nestle's journey began in the classroom. When she first began teaching a nutrition course in the early '70s, she says it felt like she was falling in love with the subject. She went on to serve as associate dean for human biology at the University of California San Francisco and as staff director for nutrition policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, where she helped shape dietary guidelines for Americans in the 1990s. Nestle is the author of 15 books, including \"Safe Food: The Politics Of Food Safety\" and \"Soda Politics.\" We recorded this conversation last week, as courts and Congress were battling over SNAP benefits for more than 42 million Americans during the government shutdown. And Marion Nestle, welcome to FRESH AIR. MARION NESTLE: Oh, glad to be here. MOSLEY: Well, Marion, before we dive in, I want to talk to you a little bit about what's happening with SNAP benefits. Food banks are already reporting that they have been inundated with people in need of food. I want to know what you're thinking about in this moment, what this moment reveals, maybe about how fragile our food system here in the U.S. is right now. NESTLE: Well, I think what it reveals is how fragile our economy is. We have 42 million people in this country, 16 million of them children, who can't rely on a consistent source of food from day to day and have to depend on a government program that provides them with benefits that really don't cover their food needs and only cover part of their food needs. And these - this amount of money is under attack and is looked at as a cash cow that will, instead of paying for people's meals, will pay for tax cuts for people who have lots and lots of money to begin with. It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. It's unprecedented. We have never punished the poor as badly as we're punishing them now. MOSLEY: You know, when you first began your journey in nutrition, I think I heard you say that people actually questioned whether food and politics went together, that, like, food is not political. People were really surprised by that. You went on, then to talk about how in America, we don't have a problem with a lack of food. It's about poverty. It's about policy. How are you seeing these forces play out right now in the way the government is approaching nutrition assistance? NESTLE: Well, when I wrote my book \"Food Politics\" in 2002, the first question I got asked was, what does food have to do with politics? Nobody asks me that anymore. Part of that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and what he's doing, which is so obviously political around food, and everybody can see what's happening with food assistance. When I look at what's happening in food assistance, I'm just stunned at how similar this is to what happened in the 16th century when the English passed the English food laws. And they were passed with the idea that the poor were poor not because of bad luck being born into the wrong family or circumstances beyond their control, but the idea that the poor were poor by choice and that what they wanted was to live on handouts. And the idea that hundreds of years later we're still thinking the same way is just shocking to me. MOSLEY: RFK Jr. is at the HHS, talking about toxins and ultraprocessed foods, many of the issues that you also talk about, too. You guys seem to be aligned on many things. Do you see a genuine opening here for food policy reform? NESTLE: Well, I was very hopeful when he was appointed because he was talking about, let's get the toxins out of the food supply. Let's make America healthy again. Let's make America's kids healthy again. Let's do something about ultraprocessed foods. Let's do something about mercury in fish. And a lot of other issues that I thought, ooh, how absolutely terrific that we're going to have somebody who cares about the same kind of issues I do. This is very exciting. And when President Trump introduced his nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on social media, President Trump talked about the food industrial complex. I nearly fell off my chair. I thought, here's the president, sounding just like me. What's going on here? So then we had the first MAHA report, the first Make America Healthy Again report, which talked about a lot of these issues and put in an aspirational agenda. We're going to work on this, this, this, this, this and this. All of that sounded terrific. And then the second report came out, and they had backed off on nearly all of the things that I thought were really critically important. MOSLEY: You have been skeptical of his antivaccine rules... NESTLE: Oh, from the beginning. MOSLEY: ...Ideas, though. NESTLE: I'm a public health person, and I see vaccination as one of the - well, first of all, I'm old enough that I remember what it was like when we didn't have vaccinations. You know, I remember what it was like to be a kid in the era of polio. You couldn't get - go swimming in the summer. You couldn't play with your friends in the summer. It was terrifying, absolutely terrifying. You never knew when something absolutely terrible was going to happen and paralyze you for life. I remember what it was like before measles vaccines, when kids were sick, kids died, just like kids are getting sick and dying now. And to go back to that makes no sense to me at all. MOSLEY: What were some of the things that were the most important to you that you felt like were dropped in that second run? NESTLE: Oh, marketing to children, reduction of ultraprocessed foods, cleaning up food in schools, getting the toxins out of the food supply at the production level and other kinds of things that - there were things that had to do not only with Health and Human Services but also with the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. But these things didn't happen. What did happen were declared MAHA wins. And the MAHA wins are companies voluntarily agreeing to remove artificial color dyes from their products, which I'm in favor of. I think that's great. But Fruit Loops with vegetable dyes are still Fruit Loops. M&Ms with vegetable dyes are still M&Ms. It's not going to make a big difference in the food supply. On ultraprocessed foods, they've said they want to define them, but that's all they've said. They're investigating the possibility of looking at marketing to children, and - but with no sense at all that there are regulatory initiatives that they're considering. And they declared a big win when Coca-Cola said it would substitute cane sugar for high fructose corn syrup, something that I termed nutritionally hilarious because they're basically the same biochemically. And they're not going to make any difference at all. If you want to reduce obesity in the United States and help people eat more healthfully, you've got to do things like change the agricultural subsidy structure. You have to stop the ability of food companies to market ultraprocessed foods, especially to children. You need better school food. You need universal school meals. You need much more money in school meals than presently exists. You have to look for ways to make healthy foods an easier and less expensive choice, and look for every public policy that you can to do those kinds of things. And I don't see that happening. MOSLEY: You've worked inside of governmental agencies, so you kind of know a bit about how the machine works. What do you think happened between that first Make America Healthy Again guideline or proposal and the second one - why they were so drastically different, why the priorities changed in such a stark way? NESTLE: Well, they found out what lobbying was about. You know, I mean, they were hit with - and there's a fair amount of evidence that they met with agricultural producers. They met with food industry representatives. And the food industry representatives and the agricultural producers told them what the effects of these kinds of changes would be on the bottom lines of these industries. I'm sure they talked about job losses. I'm sure they talked about having to move their businesses overseas. I'm sure they had all kinds of lobbying threats like that. I wasn't there. I didn't witness it, but I can assume that that's what happened because that's what always happens. MOSLEY: Do you think that when it comes to public health, there seems to be - I don't know if you would call it, like, stratifying or siloing. Like, there are vaccines. There's food. There's medicine. And why don't you think the government looks at it in a holistic way, as a holistic approach? NESTLE: Well, because there's so many - there's so much private industry involved in this and so much ideology. This is a government that has an enormous amount of ideology, with some very ideology-based views of what public health is about. You know, the idea that natural immunity is better than vaccination immunity or that fluoride is poisoning children, or that seed oils are poisoning America or that high-fructose corn syrup is poisoning America. I mean, these are not ideas that are backed by science, but we're in a era in which science is just considered just one way of looking at things, and people have different sets of facts that they believe. And this is part of food politics now in a way that's very troubling. MOSLEY: If you're just joining us, my guest is Marion Nestle, whose new book, \"What To Eat Now,\" looks at how food choices, politics and policy collide in today's supermarket. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF WOOKIE SONG, \"SCRAPPY\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, we're talking to Marion Nestle, a molecular biologist turned food policy advocate whose research and writing have shaped how Americans think about nutrition, marketing and the power structures of the food industry. Her new book, \"What To Eat Now,\" revisits her classic 2006 guide in light of today's changing food landscape. So first off, I want to say your method. You approach this book like an investigative journalist. You visited stores wherever you traveled. You interviewed managers. You make a point to say, though, that supermarkets are a business. They are not in the business of nutrition at all. And I think that when you say it out loud, it's, of course. But I think there may be maybe an implicit thing or a subconscious idea that I'm going to the grocery store, and there have been good choices that have been picked out for me for the good of my health and nutrition and not necessarily because it's about selling things. But there are some things that really set for us what we see when we walk into a grocery store - the things that are at eye level for us, like slotting fees. You call them suspiciously like bribes. NESTLE: Yes. MOSLEY: What... NESTLE: Sorry. MOSLEY: ...Are slotting fees? NESTLE: Sorry about that. MOSLEY: What are they, and how do they impact what we encounter when we walk... NESTLE: Well, they're... MOSLEY: ...In the grocery store? NESTLE: They're payments that food companies make to grocery stores to stock their products where people will see them. You know, there are rules about sales in supermarkets. The more products you see, the more you're likely to buy. Therefore, the products that are organized so that you cannot miss them are in prime supermarket real estate. And companies pay the supermarkets to place their products at eye level at the ends of aisles - those have a special name; end caps - and at the cash register. When you see products at the cash register, they're paying fees to the supermarket by the inch of space. And that's how supermarkets make a lot of their money, is through slotting fees. And of course, what this does is it keeps small producers out because they can't afford to make those kinds of payments. MOSLEY: 'Cause these payments are pretty expensive. NESTLE: Very expensive. I mean, we're talking about thousands or, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And every single product that is in a supermarket is placed where it is for a reason. There is research. I mean, what I can't believe and just can't get over is the amount of research that goes into it - the amount of consumer research, focus groups, camera research. I mean, every kind of social science research that you can think of is used to plot out how people are going to walk through the stores, where the items are placed, what people are going to see, what they're most likely to buy. And what you want to do, of course, is you want to place the most highly profitable items where they're going to get the most viewers. And it's not - and, you know, the joke is, of course, if you want a bottle of milk, you've got to go to the far corner, the furthest corner from the entrance. The purpose of that is not only to keep the milk cold because the refrigeration is along the wall, but also to get you to walk through the store, preferably through as many aisles as possible. MOSLEY: Because it's a staple, so they know you're going for milk and eggs and meats. So to have to walk through the entire store to get there, then you go through all of that ultraprocessed stuff and all of the packaged stuff. NESTLE: It's great for your step count. MOSLEY: You mentioned something about camera research. This is so fascinating. When you say camera research, you mean the cameras that are in the store, but also the cameras that are in the self-checkout. NESTLE: Well, and also, there are studies that are done where they put cameras where they watch customers, you know, and just watch what people do and set up different experiments within the store and check the way people respond to them. The purpose of a supermarket is to sell as much food as possible to as many people as possible as often as possible, at as high a price as they can get away with. I can't say that enough. That's its purpose. MOSLEY: You have this handy little list of the top grocers in the U.S. And the list is from 2023, but I think the list still stands even in 2025. And the names won't surprise many - Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Publix. But there's also one on the list that's relatively new, and that's Dollar General. How did dollar stores get into the food business? NESTLE: Well, they started out by selling the most popular ultraprocessed foods. If you want to buy an ultraprocessed food, you go to a dollar store because there it is. They're going to have chips. They're going to have sugar-sweetened cereals. They're going to have every junk food you could possibly think of. That's what they make their money off of. They will have a few fruits and vegetables - a few sad bananas, a few sad apples, maybe some pears, maybe some green vegetables, but not very many. And they'll be in a case off somewhere because they have to offer those. Because they're taking SNAP benefits, they're required to meet the stocking requirements of the SNAP program, which requires them to have a certain number of fruits and vegetables - it's just been raised to seven varieties - in order to be allowed to accept electronic benefit transfer, the benefits for SNAP recipients. And they're just everywhere. And during the pandemic particularly, they just proliferated like mad, and they undercut local stores. They're cheaper. They have poorer-quality food, but that - but the prices are lower. Price is an enormous issue. MOSLEY: These dollar stores - they're everywhere. But they're also concentrated in very specific places, in poor and urban neighborhoods. NESTLE: Well, yes, because large grocery chains don't want to be in those neighborhoods. But, you know, if you want a Trader Joe's or a Whole Foods or a Wegmans in your neighborhood, you've got to have hundreds of thousands of people within walking distance or quick driving distance who make very, very good incomes or the stores aren't going to go there. They're going to close the stores that are not performing well, meaning having lots and lots of people spending lots and lots of money at them. And the - so as the big grocery stores have closed in inner-city neighborhoods, the dollar stores moved in. MOSLEY: You know, I grew up with a grocery store chain in the Detroit area called Farmer Jack. And it was there for many, many decades, and then poof. I think it was the early 2000s. They just disappeared. And it seemed to be that way throughout the country in places, in major cities. When did we start to see these family-run stores like that close? It was before the pandemic. NESTLE: Oh, it was long before the pandemic. I mean, the tendency has been - you know, it's the same thing everywhere in the economy. Get big or get out, so that the top three chains in - or three or four grocery chains own more than half the business, 60%, 70% of the business. And whenever you have a highly concentrated industry, like the meat industry, for example, where three companies own 85% of the meat, they get to set prices. They get to set the rules of the game. They get to go to Congress and to the president and say, we don't want dietary guidelines to say anything bad about our products. And we want the president to keep meatpacking plants open during the pandemic, even though it's killing lots of people. MOSLEY: Our guest today is Marion Nestle, author of \"What To Eat Now\" and one of the most influential voices in food politics. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Tonya Mosley, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF TODD GARFINKLE'S \"VULGARITY IN TROPICAL LIVING\") MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley, and we're talking with Marion Nestle, whose new book, \"What To Eat Now,\" explores how our food system has changed, from the rise of ultraprocessed foods to the shifting politics of what's on our plates. OK, Marion. You identify three nutrition concepts that have emerged since your first run of \"What To Eat\" in 2006. And those three things are the food systems have changed, ultraprocessed foods and triple-duty diets. And I want to slow down and talk about all three, but I want to first have you give us a brief understanding of each. So in 2006, you wrote about processed foods. A few years later, we were introduced to ultraprocessed foods. Give us some examples of ultraprocessed foods. Just remind us of what's the difference. NESTLE: Oh. Well, ultraprocessed is a specific category of food named by Carlos Monteiro, who's a public health professor in Brazil who came up with the concept. And it's - these are industrially produced foods that contain large numbers of color, texture and flavor additives that you don't necessarily have access to in supermarkets or in your home kitchen. And they're now associated - consumption of a lot of them is now associated in literally hundreds of studies with poor health outcome. Those studies are observational, and they cannot prove causation. But we now have very, very well-controlled clinical trials - at least three of them so far - that show that people who eat a lot of ultraprocessed foods take in more calories than they otherwise would if they were eating unprocessed or minimally processed foods. And the easiest example to explain the difference is corn on the cob is unprocessed, canned corn is processed and Doritos are ultraprocessed. MOSLEY: OK. Yeah. They're designed to be irresistible... NESTLE: You... MOSLEY: ...Basically addictive. Like, you can't stop eating a bag of Doritos. NESTLE: You can't eat just one. MOSLEY: One of the things that's so fascinating is you write that ultraprocessed foods are responsible for as much as a third of the environmental damage from food in wealthy countries. First of all, explain that. And why is that? NESTLE: Well, that has to do with the cost of production of the ingredients, plus the packaging, plus the waste, plus everything that goes into taking a food, transforming it industrially into something that doesn't look anything like the food to begin with. And then you've got all that packaging to deal with. I want to talk about the food system a little bit, too, because it's so relevant to this. The easiest way to describe the food system is, again, with corn because if you look at the 12 billion bushels of corn that are produced in the United States every year, roughly 45% of them is - of that corn is used to feed animals. Another 45% is used to make ethanol for automobiles, and don't even get me started on that. I think it's just crazy. Leaving - maybe 10% of the corn that's produced in the United States is food for people in all its forms, not only corn on the cob but corn ingredients, high-fructose corn syrup. All of that falls into that 10% category. We don't have a food system that's aimed at producing food for people. We have a food system that's aimed at producing feed for animals and fuel for automobiles. But the emphasis on animals is not very good for our environment because beef are the - the production of beef causes the largest release of greenhouse gases of any other food in the food system by a very large margin. So we would be much better off eating diets that had more plants and less animal. Not no animal, necessarily, but certainly a lot less. And that's where the triple-duty dietary advice comes in because the diet that is best for preventing hunger, preventing obesity and its consequences and preventing climate change is one and the same diet, which is to eat real food processed as little as possible, with a big emphasis on plants. MOSLEY: Right. Triple-duty diets. It's a diet that simultaneously addresses hunger, obesity and climate change. NESTLE: Yeah, and it's the same diet as the one that's best for health. Isn't that nice? I mean, it's really... MOSLEY: It all works out. NESTLE: It all works out, you know, and easily, easily summarized by Michael Pollan in his famous seven words - eat food, not too much, mostly plants. I took 700 pages to do the same thing. MOSLEY: Well, I mean, OK. That solution seems clear. Eat more plants. Eat less beef. But you write that the American food supply provides twice as many calories at the same time as needed, while 40% of food produced is thrown away. And we're talking about this right as we also are understanding that there's global hunger. Eight hundred million people face global hunger. So how do we talk seriously about triple-duty diets addressing food insecurity when the fundamental structure of our food system is designed to overproduce and waste food? NESTLE: Well, that's why I think food systems thinking is so important. If you - the - our food system in the United States produces 4,000 calories a day for every man, woman and little tiny baby in the country. That's roughly twice what the population needs on average, so waste is built into the system. It's built. MOSLEY: Yeah. Why, though? NESTLE: Because that's how the subsidies work. We - the agricultural subsidies encourage food producers to produce as much food as possible because they get paid by - for the amount of food that they produce. Ten percent of the waste occurs at the supermarket level - surprisingly little. Supermarkets have gotten really good at inventory control. They're very, very good at it, and there's very little supermarket waste. You think there's going to be a lot, they're going to be throwing away a lot of produce, but they really don't. And then 20% of it is at home. And that's something we can do something about, but it's only a small part of the problem. It's a much bigger problem. It's a systems problem because it's built into the system. MOSLEY: Is there a country or countries that have successfully implemented anything close to this triple-duty dietary approach? NESTLE: Not that I can think of offhand. You know, the European - there are countries in Europe that can - they're much smaller than us, and they are somehow able to manage these kinds of things a lot better than we do. We have a lot to learn from countries in Europe on - along those lines and a lot to learn from countries in Latin America about how to prevent obesity and its consequences, through labeling rules and rules about marketing and that sort of thing. But we're Americans. We don't listen to anybody else. MOSLEY: There is something that you write about when it comes to ultraprocessed foods that I was really surprised by - that some of those same products are flooding into rural areas where hunger is highest here in the United States but also in parts of Africa and western Asia and the Caribbean, and they're pushed by these aggressive marketing tactics and these low prices. Help us understand what's going on here. Are wealthy nations essentially creating these foods then exporting them to the world's poorest regions? NESTLE: Well, of course they are. I mean, you have an American product with American aura of modernity and identity. And these products are not so expensive that nobody can afford them. They're cheap enough so that even poor people can afford them. And they're sold in these countries. I mean, when I was writing my book \"Soda Politics,\" it was right at the time that Coca-Cola - there were only a couple of countries in the world that still did not have Coca-Cola. One of them was Myanmar, you know, formerly Burma. And there was - the effort that Coca-Cola made to introduce Coca-Cola into Myanmar was astounding to me. First of all, they had to teach people how to like cold drinks because there was no history of drinking cold drinks in that country. And so they would teach people how to drink cold drinks. They had to - I mean, they had to go through educational efforts, putting an enormous amount of money into having the country open up to Coca-Cola. And - you know, and I saw this on a trip to India some years ago. There was a box of an American breakfast cereal on a - you know, on a shelf, and it was marketed as having the nutrition of two chapatis and being better than Indian breakfast foods. So these are deliberate attempts to try to replace traditional foods in these countries with American ultraprocessed products. And the - you know, that's a form of food colonialism. I don't know what you would call it. But it's certainly not good for the health of the people in those countries. MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Marion Nestle, a longtime food policy scholar and author of \"What To Eat Now.\" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR, and today we're talking to Marion Nestle, a molecular biologist turned food policy advocate whose research and writing have shaped how Americans think about nutrition, marketing and the power structures of the food industry. Have you done any research or study on the sophistication of marketing to children today? I have a 12-year-old, so they don't watch TV. They're not in the same ways that I used to be marketed as a young person. It's not the same anymore. But they have their favorite YouTube celebrities or their games, their video games and gamers. And are there any regulations about those spaces, and have you done any research about that type of marketing? NESTLE: I haven't personally done the research, but there are research studies coming out one after another after another - a lot of them from the Rudd Center on Food Policy - that looks at digital marketing to children, and it's horrifying. I mean, it's just absolutely gasp inducing because we don't see it. As adults, we don't see it. We're not watching social influencers. We're not watching AI algorithms. We're not watching any of this stuff aimed at getting kids to want products. And the level of sophistication of the marketing is extraordinary because it's algorithm-run. And they can tell, by the kinds of things that kids click on, what they're interested in, and they feed them more and more about what they're interested in. And there are now influencers who are paid to market products, but they don't have to declare it. They're supposed to declare it, but they don't always. And there's very little monitoring of it. I mean, I think what's going on digitally is so beyond what most people can comprehend. Certainly, it's beyond what I can comprehend. And I'm somebody who's been deepfaked - or there's a deepfake ad going around on the internet that I didn't... MOSLEY: Oh. NESTLE: ...Have anything to do with, and it looks like... MOSLEY: That's you? NESTLE: And it looks like me, and it sounds like me, and it's - I didn't do any of it. And... MOSLEY: What is it marketing? NESTLE: It's marketing some kind of product to - or an idea that you should fast and not eat breakfast. I mean, it's really weird. And it's impossible to get it taken down, and it's all over the internet. And it's not me, but it sure looks like me and sounds like me, sort of. And so, you know, you have kids dragged into this, and they're not capable - until they're 12-, 14-, 16-years-old, really - of telling the difference between marketing and real content. MOSLEY: You know, I know people always ask you, what do you eat? But I actually think I want to ask a different question because I know that you've said that you're a total foodie who views food as one of life's greatest pleasures. I mean, and we all eat. But how do you maintain that joy while knowing everything that you know? NESTLE: I just really love the taste of food. I really love it. I always have since I was a young child at a summer camp where I got to pick vegetables from a garden and discovered what real vegetables taste like, I've just loved them ever since. And, you know, good food is available everywhere. And I'm lucky enough and privileged enough to be able to afford it. I don't eat that much anymore because I'm ancient, and I don't have much metabolism left. So my metabolism is so slowed down. I don't eat much, but I love to eat. But in general, I think you can eat healthily at any grocery store in America if it's got any kind of variety. You just have to know what to choose and know how to pick. But it asks a lot of the customer. MOSLEY: You have said something pretty astounding that's kind of been staying with me. I've heard you say this a couple of times, that our food system is unfixable without a revolution. What would that revolution look like? NESTLE: Well, I think it would start with transforming our agricultural production system to one that was focused on food for people instead of animals and automobiles. We would need to change our electoral system so that we could elect officials who were interested in public health rather than corporate health. We would need to fix our economy so that Wall Street favors corporations who have social values and public health values as part of their corporate mission. Those are revolutionary concepts at this point because they seem so far from what is attainable. But I think if we don't work on that now, if we don't do what we can to advocate for a better food system, we won't get it. And it's only if we advocate for it that we have a chance of getting it. And you never know. Sometimes you get lucky. MOSLEY: I mean, you know, it seems so daunting when you say all of those things, especially at this moment, in the political climate that we're in at this time. And I just wonder, what do you tell people on an individual level as they think about, well, what are the things that I can do to actually be a part of a bigger revolution to fix our food system? NESTLE: Well, I tell people that they can't do it on their own. You know, that even the act of going into a grocery store and trying to make healthy choices means that you as an individual are up against an entire food system that is aimed at getting you to eat the most profitable foods possible, regardless of their effects on health and the environment. So you have to join organizations. You have to join with other people who are interested in the same issues and concerned about the same problems and get together with them to set some goals for what you'd like to do. And then work towards those goals because if you don't do it, who will? MOSLEY: Marion Nestle, it's been a pleasure to talk with you. Thank you so much. NESTLE: Thank you.

The order keeps in place at least for a few more days a chaotic situation. People who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed their families in some states have received their full monthly allocations, while others have received nothing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The order will expire just before midnight Thursday. The Senate has approved a bill to end the shutdown and the House of Representatives could vote on it as early as Wednesday. Reopening the government would restart the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, but it's not clear how quickly full payments would resume. The justices chose what is effectively the path of least resistance, anticipating the federal government shutdown will end soon while avoiding any substantive legal ruling about whether lower court orders to keep full payments flowing during the shutdown are correct. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only one of the nine justices to say she would have revived the lower court orders immediately, but didn't otherwise explain her vote. Jackson signed the initial order temporarily freezing the payments. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Beneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments. How quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it's easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones. Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount. An urgent need for beneficiaries In Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday. Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year. That stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what's left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"It's kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,\" Malliard said. \"To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.\" The political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help. \"I figure that I've spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,\" said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a \"little food pantry\" in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York. SNAP has been the center of an intense fight in court The Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for about 1 in 8 Americans. The administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to pause that order. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       An appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume, and that requirement was set to kick in Tuesday night before the top court extended the order blocking full SNAP payments. Congressional talks about reopening government The U.S. Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans. President Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it \"looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending.\" Still, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn't be up to the courts. \"The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. \"The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.\" After Tuesday's ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media: \"Thank you to the Court for allowing Congress to continue its swift progress.\" The coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion. \"The chaos was sown by USDA's delays and intransigence,\" they said, \"not by the district court's efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/g-s1-97245","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:54:00-05:00","title":"With an upcoming vote in the House, an end to the shutdown is in sight","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"After 41 days of a record-long government shutdown, the U.S. Senate passed a continuing resolution to reopen federal operations, funding most agencies through January 30, 2026, with full SNAP support through September 2026.

The measure  would fund much of the government through Jan. 30 and provide funding for some agencies through the end of next September. But the shutdown will not end right away. The U.S. House of Representatives must also pass   the legislation, which is not guaranteed, before President Trump can sign it into law. House leadership has told members to return to Washington for a vote as early as Wednesday afternoon. Seven Democrats and one independent senator voted with nearly every Senate Republican to approve the stopgap funding bill after a more than monthlong impasse that resulted in missed paychecks for millions of federal workers, delayed food assistance benefits and air travel disruptions. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the sole GOP no vote.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The funding package includes language to reverse reductions in force of federal employees by the Trump administration during the shutdown, protections against further layoffs through the end of January, backpay for federal employees and a trio of appropriations bills, including one that will fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026. \"This is a great victory for the American people, and it shows that the Senate can work,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Me. A deal without Democrats' health care demands But the deal does not include an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums that are set to expire later this year. Most Democrats have refused to vote for a funding measure that did not include a concrete path to preserve the subsidies. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Sunday that he would hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the expiring subsidies. Thune has said throughout the shutdown that Republicans would only negotiate on the subsidies once the government was open. \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       But the majority of Senate Democrats disagreed that this was the best deal they could get, doubting that Republicans would agree to extend the subsidies without the pressure of an ongoing shutdown. After Democratic victories on election night last week, some senators said it was a mistake to back down. \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., said on the floor before the vote. \"The people I work for need more than that. They need health care that they can afford, not a symbolic vote.\" Over the weekend, a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement to end the shutdown after holding a series of on-again, off-again talks over the last several weeks. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who helped drive the bipartisan negotiations, told reporters Monday that more than eight members of the caucus had initially pledged to support the deal, but some backed out ahead of the vote.  On to the House House leadership alerted members Monday morning that they would have 36 hours' notice to return to Capitol Hill for a vote. The House has not conducted official business since the chamber passed its version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. While Speaker Mike Johnson has held near-daily press conferences at the Capitol, many rank-and-file have not been in for weeks. \"At the very moment that they do that final vote, I will call all House members to return as quickly as possible,\" Johnson told reporters Monday and, noting the ongoing shutdown-related air travel delays, told members, \"You need to begin right now returning to the Hill.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Moving the measure through the House could require some arm-twisting. Many Democrats have indicated they will not support the deal, and some hard-line Republicans may not be inclined to vote for it either. But Johnson projected confidence Monday that the measure can pass and said Trump is ready to sign it. Coming health care debate Democrats now need to come up with health care legislation that can get the support of enough Republicans. Some Republicans in the House and Senate  have expressed interest  in preventing the Affordable Care Act premiums from skyrocketing, but many have also talked about the need for reforms like income caps and fraud prevention. A few weeks is not much time for an overhaul, and people are deciding now whether to keep their  insurance plans  next year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"If we want to get a bill that has bipartisan support, we've got to address some of those issues,\" Shaheen told reporters on Monday. \"I think the White House is going to engage on this because the president has figured out, and his pollsters have been very clear, it's more of an issue for people in red states than it is in blue states. If he [doesn't], well, shame on him.\"   Speaker Johnson, though, told reporters on Monday that he would not guarantee an ACA vote in the House should a bill pass the Senate. The government funding situation is not fully resolved for the year, either. The full-year funding measures passed by the Senate include money for agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs and the legislative branch. Congress still needs to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution runs out again at the end of January.  NPR's Barbara Sprunt and Deirdre Walsh contributed reporting. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/10/sport/nfl-wrap-week-10","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:52:00-05:00","title":"The week of the upset: Everything you might have missed from NFL Week 10","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"In NFL Week 10, several key developments marked a pivotal season shift.

2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  As the days grow shorter and darkness comes on quicker, the  NFL  season continues with a pivotal Week 10 delivering the same madness to which fans are accustomed.\n \n\n   \n  The week was more eventful than usual, starting with the NFL trade deadline that was highlighted by the New York Jets making headlines after a shocking fire sale that saw Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams find new homes in Indianapolis and Dallas respectively.\n \n\n   \n  Sunday got started bright and early with Jonathan Taylor leading the Colts to an overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons in Germany, which led right into multiple teams in the bottom of the standings finding a way to secure victories.\n \n\n   \n  It also saw the New England Patriots officially commandeer their spot among the league’s elite and many blowouts in the late-game slate, including an appearance from President Donald Trump.\n \n\n   \n  Here’s what you may have missed on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n    Colts run all over Falcons in Germany\n \n\n   \n  The NFL’s penultimate international game of the season took place at Berlin’s Olympiastadion and delivered one of the best games of the season.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor powered the Colts to a 31-25 overtime victory over the Falcons in the first regular-season NFL game in the German capital.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old rushed for 244 yards and three touchdowns, becoming just the fourth player in league history to record at least 200 rushing yards and three rushing scores in a game twice in his career, joining Jim Brown, Adrian Peterson and Derrick Henry.\n \n\n   \n  An 83-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter put the Colts ahead 22-17, but Atlanta answered with a one-yard touchdown from Tyler Allgeier to retake the lead with just over a minute left. Colts quarterback Daniel Jones then led an eight-play drive, setting up Michael Badgley’s 44-yard field goal to force overtime.\n \n\n   \n  Taylor sealed the win for Indianapolis with a walk-off eight-yard touchdown in overtime, moving the Colts to an AFC South-best 8-2 record while the Falcons dropped to 3-6.\n \n\n   \n  The Washington Commanders and Miami Dolphins will close out the international slate on November 16 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.\n \n\n   \n    The week of the upset\n \n\n   \n  The Jets, New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins haven’t had much to celebrate this season.\n \n\n   \n  But on Sunday, all three teams managed to pick up a victory.\n \n\n   \n  The Jets secured their first win of the season two weeks ago against the Cincinnati Bengals and were well-rested coming off their their bye week.\n \n\n   \n  Riding that momentum, the Aaron Glenn-led squad faced the other Ohio-based team – the Cleveland Browns – and won 27-20 for their second consecutive win.\n \n\n   \n  Special teams played the hero for Gang Green, scoring touchdowns on a kickoff return and a punt return with running back Breece Hall’s 42-yard receiving touchdown to cap it all off. Both teams are now 2-7. The Jets will look for their first three-game win streak since 2023 when they face the Patriots on Thursday Night Football next week.\n \n\n   \n  Questions are swirling throughout the NFL about the futures of head coach Mike McDaniel and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa after the firing of general manager Chris Grier a week ago.\n \n\n   \n  And a tough task was on hand for the Fins, facing the Buffalo Bills – a team that Miami had lost to seven-straight time entering the game at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday.\n \n\n   \n  The Fins blew out Buffalo 30-13 to snap the losing streak to their divison rivals and easing any qualms – at least for now.\n \n\n   \n  The Saints turned to their rookie, second-round pick Tyler Shough, against division rivals Carolina Panthers and did he deliver.\n \n\n   \n  The 26-year-old, out of Louisville, threw for 282 yards and two touchdowns in their 17-7 win to improve to 2-8 on the season.\n \n\n   \n    Patriots are back. Are they here to stay?\n \n\n   \n  Times were tough for the Patriots in the years following the departure of Tom Brady and Bill Bellichick.\n \n\n   \n  With Mike Vrabel returning to Foxborough as head coach—a place where he won multiple Super Bowls as a player—and rookie quarterback Drake Maye emerging as the franchise leader they hoped for, New England has reestablished itself among the league’s elite teams.\n \n\n   \n  The Pats marched into Tampa Bay and defeated Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers 28-23 as Maye passed for two touchdowns and rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson rushed for two more on the ground.\n \n\n   \n  After a 4-13 record last season, New England finds themselves with a 8-2 record and an AFC East division lead.\n \n\n   \n    A late-game slate filled with blowouts and the president\n \n\n   \n  All the excitement fans were presented with earlier in the day was completely wiped up by the three-game late slate, which all featured blowouts.\n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump became the first sitting president to attend a regular-season NFL game since President Jimmy Carter when he arrived Sunday at Northwest Stadium in Maryland for the  Washington Commanders  game against the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  While the President was met with boos, so were the Commanders as they were crushed 44-22 by the Detroit Lions.\n \n\n   \n  Sam Darnold is yet again proving why he is one of the most underrated quarterbacks in the league after leading the Seattle Seahawks to a 44-22 win over the Arizona Cardinals.\n \n\n   \n  The former first round pick 178 yards and a touchdown while defensive lineman DeMarcus Lawrence returned two fumbles for touchdowns in the win. Seahawks find themselves in a race for the NFC West division with the Los Angeles Rams, who also won Sunday in convincing fashion.\n \n\n   \n  Matt Stafford threw for four touchdowns in the team’s 42-26 win over the short-handed San Francisco 49ers.\n \n\n   \n  Both teams find themselves with a 7-2 record with seven games remaining.\n \n\n   \n  There is still one game to go in the week with the reigning Super Bowl champions Philadelphia Eagles visiting Titletown, USA, to face the Green Bay Packers on Monday Night Football.\n \n\n   See Full Web Article \n\n"},{"source":"https://lite.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/timeline-us-strikes-caribbean-pacific-vis","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"09:01:00-05:00","title":"Timeline of US Strikes on Boats That Have Killed 76","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States military has conducted 19 targeted strikes on vessels between September 2 and November 9, 2025, resulting in the deaths of 76 people and the destruction of 20 boats.

have killed 76 \n       \n  By Michael Rios, Avery Schmitz, Matt Stiles, CNN\n \n\n       \nUpdated: \n        9:01 AM EST, Mon November 10, 2025\n     \n\n\n\n     \n  Source: CNN\n \n   \n  The US military has killed 76 people in 19 strikes that have destroyed 20 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the United States. There had been three survivors of those strikes, two of whom were briefly detained by the US Navy before being returned to their home countries. The other is presumed dead after a search by the Mexican Navy.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has told Congress that the US is now in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels beginning with its first strike on September 2, labeling those killed “unlawful combatants” and claiming the ability to engage in lethal strikes without judicial review  due to a classified Justice Department finding .\n \n\n   \n  Some members of Congress as well as human rights groups have questioned that finding and argued that potential drug traffickers should face prosecution, as had been the policy of interdiction carried out by the US before President Donald Trump took office.\n \n\n   \n  The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n \n\n   \n  Military officials have said that no US service members have been harmed in the strikes.\n \n\n   \n  Here is the timeline of the attacks:\n \n\n   \n     September 2, first attack \n \n\n   \n  The first strike on a vessel in the Caribbean took place on September 2.\n \n\n   \n  Trump announced the offensive on his social media accounts and said that under his orders, US forces “conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.”\n \n\n   \n  “TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  “Let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!” he added.\n \n\n   \n  CNN reported that Defense Department officials have not, during briefings to members of Congress, presented conclusive evidence that the targets of the first attack were members of Tren de Aragua, and that those briefed said military officials could not determine the intended destination of the boat with certainty.\n \n\n   \n  CNN also reported that the boat appeared to have turned around before it was struck.\n \n\n   \n  The strike killed 11 people.\n \n\n   \n     September 15 \n \n\n   \n  Less than two weeks later, the US military carried out a second strike against a vessel in international waters, killing three.\n \n\n   \n  Trump said the vessel was allegedly “transporting illegal narcotics” from Venezuela.\n \n\n   \n  “These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests,” he added.\n \n\n   \n  The strike came amid rising tensions with that country, as the United States deployed military assets to the region.\n \n\n   \n  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the strikes on boats as “serial executions” and called on the UN to investigate, while saying that the US is seeking regime change. Venezuela’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said it amounts to “an undeclared war,” while the foreign ministry denounced Washington’s “military threat.”\n \n\n   \n  At the time, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they expected more activity in the Caribbean in an effort to reduce drug traffic into the US.\n \n\n   \n     September 19 \n \n\n   \n  Four days later, Trump announced another lethal military strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.\n \n\n   \n  “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans,” Trump posted on Truth Social alongside a video of the operation.\n \n\n   \n  Three people were killed in the strike.\n \n\n   \n     October 3 \n \n\n   \n  Hegseth announced that the US military had carried out a fourth strike in which four people died.\n \n\n   \n  The attack took place in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela, Hegseth wrote in a post on social media.\n \n\n   \n  He did not say which alleged terrorist organization the boat was linked to, but added that “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”\n \n\n   \n     October 14 \n \n\n   \n  Six people died in the fifth US strike on a vessel, this boat described by officials as off the Venezuelan coast.\n \n\n   \n  Once again, Trump said the vessel was “affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” but he did not name a specific group or provide evidence of the boats activities.\n \n\n   \n  In a letter to Congress in early October, the Pentagon said Trump had determined that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with the drug cartels his administration designated as terrorist organizations, and that cartel traffickers are “unlawful combatants.”\n \n\n   \n     October 16 \n \n\n   \n  The US carried out a sixth strike on a boat in the Caribbean. This was believed to be the first operation in which not all crew members on board were killed.\n \n\n   \n  The two survivors, one each from Ecuador and Colombia, were  sent back to their home countries  after being briefly detained on a US Navy ship.\n \n\n   \n  “At least 25,000 Americans would die if I allowed this submarine to come ashore. The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump  posted  on Truth Social.\n \n\n   \n  Jeison Obando Pérez, 34 years old, was identified as the survivor repatriated to Colombia in a post on X by the country’s minister of the interior, Armando Benedetti. Pérez arrived “with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator,” said Benedetti, who added that he had received medical attention.\n \n\n   \n  The survivor from Ecuador, was identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño Chila, 41 years old, according to a record from the National Police of Ecuador accessed by CNN.

Why not? Is it OK to wait? \n         By Mara Gordon \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 7:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Q: I just found out I'm pregnant. According to my period tracking app, I'm about five weeks along. But I can't get a first prenatal appointment until I'm nine weeks in. I'm super stressed out. Why can't I see a doctor sooner? And is it really OK to wait that long? First of all, congratulations! And don't worry. It's normal to want to see a doctor right away when you see those two side-by-side lines on a positive pregnancy test. But it's also pretty typical to have trouble getting an appointment to confirm you're pregnant. A physician friend of mine also recently went through this. Even with insider connections at her hospital, she couldn't see a doctor for another month. So she texted one of the OB/GYNs in her office and asked her to do an ultrasound between her scheduled appointments! My friend was lucky she could access this workaround. But I've always wondered why early pregnancy care isn't available to those of us who don't have an OB/GYN on speed dial. Many prenatal providers won't schedule patients until eight or nine weeks of pregnancy — at the earliest. Waiting a month to see a doctor isn't necessarily a bad thing, since most pregnancies will go on to be healthy. But it can feel like a  long  time, since most high-sensitivity home pregnancy tests  can confirm a pregnancy  on the first day of your missed period, which is usually around four weeks along. So if you're eager for an earlier appointment, here's what you should know. Do you have a medical question you’d like an honest answer on? Write us at  thrive@npr.org , and we’ll consider your question for the column. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       A lot of people want earlier prenatal care In one 2016 study, about  15% of participants  said they couldn't get a first prenatal appointment as quickly as they wanted. Dr. Kavita Vinekar , an OB/GYN whose work focuses on early pregnancy, thinks that number might be even higher. Vinekar got interested in caring for patients in the earliest stages of pregnancy because it's such a vulnerable period. She surveyed patients at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia and learned that people were doing whatever they could to confirm the pregnancy, even if prenatal practices were turning them away. Close to 50% of patients had gotten an ultrasound somewhere else before their first prenatal appointment, while 25% had visited an emergency room.  Almost 15% of those who had gotten an ultrasound had been to what's known as a crisis pregnancy center, which offers anti-abortion counseling without licensed medical care. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Why it's hard to get these appointments Seeing patients in the first weeks of pregnancy, Vinekar says, is a radical departure from what many doctors learn during training. In the earliest stages, it's hard to give patients definitive answers about the health of the pregnancy. That's because it can be difficult to visualize an early pregnancy on an ultrasound. \"We have been told: 'Do not see people in early pregnancy,'\" Vinekar said. '\"You're just going to open up a whole can of worms. You're going to be creating stress when they don't need to be stressed.'\" But some patients are stressed when they  can't  see a doctor, especially if they're worried they might be having a miscarriage. Unfortunately, Vinekar says that miscarriage risk is actually a major reason why prenatal practices won't schedule patients early on. They aren't set up to take care of the  estimated 15% of pregnancies that will end in the first trimester , so they try to delay taking on patients until eight or nine weeks, when miscarriage is less likely. Early pregnancy loss can be tricky to diagnose and may require multiple urgent follow-up appointments. Also, practices may not want to leave those appointment slots open, because if nobody schedules, they could lose money. Here's what you can do while you wait If you're waiting on a first prenatal appointment but want medical advice sooner, your best option may be trying to see your primary care provider. If you have an OB/GYN, you could make an appointment with them, too. In my primary care practice, I often talk to patients who have just found out that they're pregnant. They have questions about everything from miscarriage risk to whether or not they can eat sushi. Many of my pregnant patients start feeling nauseous weeks before their first prenatal appointment is scheduled. They're frustrated they can't see an OB/GYN to get some relief. So instead, they call me — and I'm happy to help out. If you're experiencing nausea, heartburn, or breast tenderness but don't yet have an OB/GYN appointment, don't hesitate to call your family doctor or visit an urgent care. Even if we aren't experts in pregnancy, we can usually offer treatment for these common — and unpleasant — symptoms. What to do if you are worried about miscarriage As a family doctor, I sometimes get calls from pregnant patients who are bleeding and cramping and are worried they're having a miscarriage. First, don't panic. Light spotting in pregnancy can be normal. I usually do my best to get my patient in for an urgent ultrasound in a radiology practice with experience diagnosing early pregnancy and miscarriage. Unfortunately, that can also sometimes take several weeks. If you already have an OB/GYN, you can also make an urgent appointment with that doctor. If you don't see anyone for routine reproductive health care, a Planned Parenthood or a community health center may also be able to get you in. Since only an  estimated 4% of miscarriages require ER-level care , I try to reassure my patients that what they're experiencing usually isn't life-threatening. Unless they're having severe bleeding, it can be safe to wait it out. And, of course, I always tell my patients that if they've had a miscarriage, it isn't their fault. Most miscarriages are due to abnormalities in the developing fetus. It's almost never due to something they've done wrong. Still, most patients want to confirm if they're having a miscarriage right away. In that case, the ER is always an option. Doctors there can usually do an ultrasound and help get pain under control. But because miscarriage is a high-stakes diagnosis and  not all doctors are trained  in early pregnancy ultrasound, the ER may not be able to answer all your questions. Future solutions for early care I hate having to tell my patients all this, but our health care system doesn't do a great job of caring for patients who are having miscarriages — or have anxiety about early pregnancy. Take the story of Asha Spacek-Hobbs, who had a pregnancy loss before her youngest was born. The Philadelphia mom couldn't get an urgent appointment with an OB/GYN. She said it was \"like trying to book a flight to Antarctica.\" But the ER experience, she says, wasn't definitive either. \"I left the hospital, believe it or not, not totally knowing if I actually had a miscarriage,\" Spacek-Hobbs said. \"No one would actually say it.\" Vinekar has seen this all too many times. \"We've historically shied away and abandoned them,\" she said. \"Maybe that's actually the time they need us the most.\" That's why Vinekar and her team have started a clinic they call the Jefferson Early Pregnancy Program, which is almost like an urgent care for people who have just found out they're pregnant. When patients call in, they're offered appointments within a few days. Vinekar hopes these early pregnancy appointments can help patients get evidence-based miscarriage care right away — without waiting for hours in an emergency room. And she hopes her model will spread so it's easier for people around the country to get early pregnancy care. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5487719","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:45:00-05:00","title":"James Vanderbilt's 'Nuremberg' explores the human horror in a Nazi leader's story","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Vanderbilt's film 'Nuremberg' is a psychologically nuanced exploration of the 1945 trials of Nazi leaders, focusing on the complex relationship between psychiatrist Douglas Kelley and Hermann Göring.

Adolf Hitler had killed himself in his bunker in April 1945, but his second-in-command, Hermann Göring, was among the Nuremberg defendants. Before the trials began in November of that year, American psychiatrist Douglas Kelley spent dozens of hours speaking with and evaluating the Nazi officials. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       That lesser known story, told in Jack El-Hai's 2013 book  The Nazi and the Psychiatrist , is the inspiration behind a new film. Its theatrical release coincides with the 80th anniversary of the start of the Nuremberg trials — the first international criminal trials and a precursor to the International Criminal Court.  At the heart of James Vanderbilt's  Nuremberg  is the complex relationship between Kelley and Göring. \n       \n       Youtube Video \n       \"They both wanted to get something out of the other one,\" writer-director Vanderbilt told NPR's  Morning Edition  host Leila Fadel. \"Kelley has the highest ranking living Nazi basically dropped into his lap and sort of goes, this is an opportunity to dissect the nature of evil. Göring, on the other hand, is looking for his last moment on the world stage.\" Ultimately, Kelley is haunted by his own conclusion, as described in his memoir  22 Cells in Nuremberg , that the Nazis were fundamentally no different than the average person and that their atrocities could be replicated anywhere. \"Göring was by all accounts an incredibly charming and funny individual,\" Vanderbilt said. \"The fact that he loves his wife the same way that we love our spouses, that he loves his children [daughter] the same way we love our children, to me that doesn't excuse anything. It actually makes it all the more horrifying.\" The material has some parallels with Vanderbilt's script for the 2007 thriller  Zodiac , where one man becomes obsessed with another's crimes. In  Nuremberg , Russell Crowe leads a stellar cast as Göring — a role for which he learned to speak German — while Rami Malek plays Kelley. Michael Shannon is Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, who served as the chief U.S. prosecutor at the trials.  \"Nuremberg was a pretty remarkable moment in history where the world came together to choose justice over vengeance and do something that I think was truly a good act,\" Vanderbilt said. Jackson helped stand up the tribunal in short order, involving British, French, Soviet and U.S. judges. He did so because, as his character puts it in the film, \"the world needs to know what these men did.\" He also hoped to prevent the horrors of World War II from ever taking place again. That last part proves most elusive, as the film hammers home repeatedly, though not very subtly. In Göring's cell, with his superiors pressuring him to find out what the Nazi figurehead might say on the stand, Kelley asks the military commander what drew him to Hitler. Göring's response? \"He made us feel German again.\" Vanderbilt denies he was inspired by President Trump's campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again,\" but the parallels are unlikely to escape audiences. \"I wrote that scene 12 years ago,\" he said. \"I felt it was relevant then, and I certainly feel it's relevant now. And I think, unfortunately, it will be relevant in the future.\" In  another true-to-life subplot , Howie Triest (Leo Woodall) returns to Germany to serve as a U.S. military translator at Nuremberg, after having fled the country for the U.S. because he was a German Jew. He tells Kelley in the film: \"Do you want to know why it happened here? Because people let it happen.\" A pivotal moment in the film comes when  wartime footage  shot as Allied troops reached the concentration camps is shown in the courtroom. The images of emaciated survivors and bodies piled up, dozens of them pushed on top of one another by a bulldozer, have lost none of their shocking horror 80 years later. \"It was something from the very beginning I knew I wanted to do,\" Vanderbilt said. He told his actors to avoid doing any research for the scene in order to perform it fresh. So, on a set built to the exact specifications of the Nuremberg courtroom, with 300 extras and four cameras turned on each of the lead actors, the team observed a moment of silence. Then, they switched on the projector. \"What you see in our movie is the reaction of those actors\" in that moment, Vanderbilt said. \"I wanted to put you as an audience member in the same shoes as the people were in the courtroom that day when this footage was first shown to the world.\" The broadcast version of this story was produced by  Phil Harrell .  \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Nearly eight decades ago, the Nuremberg trials held by the Allied powers revealed the full horror of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime during World War II. The new film \"Nuremberg\" focuses on the Nazis' second in command, Hermann Goering - played by Russell Crowe - and the psychiatrist tasked with monitoring him, Douglas Kelley, played by Rami Malek. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NUREMBERG\") RAMI MALEK: (As Douglas Kelley) Goering is, above all things, a narcissist. The only thing he cares about is building Germany up and then becoming her leader. He does not care about the Jews. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) So he's fine with them dying. MALEK: (As Douglas Kelley) And he's fine with them not. The only thing Hermann Goering cares about is Hermann Goering. Does that sound like a man who dedicates himself to the extermination of an entire race? FADEL: Much of the tension revolves around how Goering and Kelley try to outsmart each other, leading to a showdown in court. \"Nuremberg\" is directed by James Vanderbilt. JAMES VANDERBILT: Kelley has the highest-ranking living Nazi basically dropped into his lap, and sort of goes, this is an opportunity to dissect the nature of evil. He goes, you know, what made these men able to commit the crimes that they did? What sets them apart from us? Goering, on the other hand, is, you know, looking for his last moment on the world stage. He's looking to define himself. And I think they both ultimately end up having an enormous effect on each other's lives in ways that neither of them anticipated. And that sort of duality was something that I just immediately went, that's - I've never seen that. For me as a filmmaker, you know, you look at the duality between those two men and you go, there's something really rich and dramatic there. FADEL: I think what struck me, too, is Kelley comes to this conclusion that there's not very much that sets Goering apart from the rest of humanity. There isn't a special kind of evil. And I thought about that a lot. I mean, I've worked in lots of different conflicts and watched human beings do absolutely awful things to other human beings. VANDERBILT: Goering, you know, was by all accounts an incredibly charming and funny individual. You know, somebody once described him as the best dinner party guest you'd ever have over to your house, which is not what you think of when you think of the Nazis. And I was just sort of taken by the idea of exploring that. And, you know, the fact that he loves his wife the same way that we love our spouses, that he loves his children the same way we love our children - to me, that, you know, doesn't excuse anything. It actually makes it all the more horrifying. FADEL: The moment that this is coming out into the world, with concerns around the rise of authoritarianism, and I wanted to just play one clip. It's an interaction between Goering and Kelley from the film. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NUREMBERG\") MALEK: (As Douglas Kelley) Let's talk about Hitler. RUSSELL CROWE: (As Hermann Goering) That's interesting. You have not asked me this directly before. MALEK: (As Douglas Kelley) I'm curious what the attraction was. He was a failed painter and not a very good soldier, yet was worshipped and revered. CROWE: (As Hermann Goering) He made us feel German again. FADEL: He made us feel German again. If you could just describe this moment in this film and what you think it says to an audience today in 2025. VANDERBILT: I mean, it's interesting because I wrote that scene 12 years ago. FADEL: Yeah. VANDERBILT: You know, and so it was relevant then, and I certainly feel it's relevant now. And I think, unfortunately, it will be relevant in the future. You know, Goering was someone who - from his perspective, you know, the Treaty of Versailles was a terrible thing. And they needed to build themselves back up, and they needed to feel pride in their country again. And that's one of the things that he, as well as Hitler, sort of exploited in terms of their rise to power. Nuremberg was a pretty remarkable moment in history where, you know, the world came together to choose justice over vengeance and do something that I think is - was truly a good act. FADEL: There was a moment during the trial where you show real footage that was shot in the concentration camps. VANDERBILT: Yes. FADEL: Emaciated survivors, bodies piled up. This - I had to almost look away, but I forced myself to watch where the bulldozers are just bulldozing, like, dozens of bodies on top of each other as if they're rubble. Tell me about that choice. VANDERBILT: It was something from the very beginning I knew I wanted to do. And as we were casting and I started being able to hire these incredible actors, I said to each of them, you know, listen. I know that you love doing research, and I love that about you. But do me a favor and don't watch the footage because on the day that we shoot this, I want it to be fresh to you. And we were in our courtroom set, which was built to exact specifications of the real Nuremberg courtroom, down to the inch. And we brought out the projector, and we had a moment of silence. And I had set up four cameras, one on each of our lead actors, and then we showed the film. And what you see in our movie is the reaction of those actors. Those images are, I think, as powerful today as they were 80 years ago. And I wanted to put you as an audience member in the same shoes as the people who were in the courtroom that day when this footage was first shown to the world. You know, one of the - you know, the reasons the trial were put on by Robert Jackson, Michael Shannon's character, was because he felt that this needed to be recorded - that if we just shoot these men and possibly make them martyrs, people generations later won't believe what happened. FADEL: The case law established in the Nuremberg trials is still used today... VANDERBILT: Yes. FADEL: ...Paved the way for the creation of an International Criminal Court. I want to play a moment from the film - the chief U.S. prosecutor, Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, played by Michael Shannon, explaining his vision. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"NUREMBERG\") MICHAEL SHANNON: (As Robert H. Jackson) It would have to be a completely international effort. All of the Allies would have to participate - the U.S., Britain, France, Russia. You can't do it without the Russians. Four international judges. WRENN SCHMIDT: (As Elsie Douglas) You're talking about a tribunal. SHANNON: (As Robert H. Jackson) Exactly. The world needs to know what these men did. SCHMIDT: (As Elsie Douglas) It's a logistical nightmare. SHANNON: (As Robert H. Jackson) I know, but it has to be done. FADEL: What is the historical significance of the trials today? VANDERBILT: I mean, I think it's enormous. It was the first international tribunal. It was sort of, you know - someone described it as sort of building the airplane while you flew it. The historical significance, hopefully, is that we remember there was a moment where something like this could happen and people chose to do the right thing, even though it wasn't the easy thing. Both of my grandfathers fought in World War II, so I grew up with stories about this period of time. I had friends who lost family members in the camps. You can read the books and you can watch the documentaries and you can hear the facts and figures, but a movie makes you feel things. FADEL: That's director James Vanderbilt. His new film is \"Nuremberg.\" Thank you so much. VANDERBILT: Thank you. And a note - Sony Pictures Classics is a financial supporter of NPR. We cover it like we cover anything else. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5599118","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:56:00-05:00","title":"U.S. Appeals Order to Use American Sign Language Interpreters at White House Briefings","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Department of Justice is appealing a federal court order requiring the White House to provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation during press briefings when President Trump or press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks.

In a court filing on Friday responding to U.S. District Judge Amir Ali's ruling, the Justice Department requested clarification on which types of events should have ASL interpretation available. The DOJ said it believes the services should be limited to regularly scheduled briefings and not other events where the president takes questions from the press. It notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that the White House's current vendor agreement for ASL interpretative services requires 24 hours' notice. \"In the unlikely event the vendor cannot produce an interpreter to provide simultaneous briefing despite 24 hours' notice, the White House intends to publish the ASL interpretation as soon as practicable,\" the DOJ said in Friday's filing. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The department said the White House is working to \"establish a publicly accessible channel showing ASL interpretation that would be provided simultaneously with every press briefing subject to the injunction.\" The DOJ said the judge's order should not apply to remarks made in a broad set of scenarios. \"The White House does not understand 'press briefings' to encompass events with other purposes, such as a ceremony or a speech, at which the President may choose to take questions from the press,\" the department said. Ali  issued the preliminary injunction  on Nov. 4 and ordered the Trump administration to update the court on compliance by last Friday. \"White House press briefings engage the American people on important issues affecting their daily lives — in recent months, war, the economy, and healthcare, and in recent years, a global pandemic,\" Ali wrote in the order. \"The exclusion of deaf Americans from that programming, in addition to likely violating the Rehabilitation Act, is clear and present harm that the court cannot meaningfully remedy after the fact.\" The government's appeal of Ali's order is being filed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The White House stopped using live ASL interpreters at briefings and other public events when President Trump began his second term in January. The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) and two deaf men  filed the lawsuit  against Trump and Leavitt in May. The suit also names White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, along with the offices for president and vice president. It alleges the White House's failure to provide ASL violates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in programs conducted by the federal government. The suit also claims the White House is in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments, which protect free speech and provide for due process, respectively. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In a new filing on Monday, the NAD told the court the White House has failed to comply with its order and argued the injunction covers all publicly announced press briefings, including those scheduled with less than 24 hours' notice. The group's interim CEO, Bobbie Beth Scoggins, told NPR in a statement last week that the organization is pleased that deaf and hard of hearing Americans will soon regain access to important information from the government. \"American Sign Language and accurate captioning are both essential to ensuring full and equal access to information,\" Scoggins said. \"ASL and English are distinct languages, and captions alone cannot meet the needs of everyone in our community. The court's ruling affirms what we have long known: equal access to information from the White House is not optional. We deserve the same timely, direct access to White House briefings as everyone else.\" Ali's order specifies that the ASL interpretation must be visible and signed by a qualified interpreter. He was not persuaded by White House arguments that it does provide closed captioning. \"The defendants correctly note that the plaintiffs are entitled only to reasonable accommodation. But it is not reasonable — indeed it can hardly be called an accommodation at all — to transcribe press briefings into a language that Ford and many NAD members do not know,\" Ali said in his opinion. Ali is referring to plaintiff Derrick Ford, of Anderson, Ind. According to the NAD, hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. communicate mainly in ASL, and many deaf and hard of hearing people do not know English. ASL has its own vocabulary and grammar that is different from English. The judge stopped short of granting the group's request to require ASL interpretation at briefings and events conducted by the vice president, first lady, and second lady. Ali also declined at this time to require that interpretation be provided to news networks and uploaded to the White House website and social media pages. Scoggins says the NAD will continue to vigorously pursue all relief sought in its lawsuit. The preliminary injunction is intended to give temporary relief to the group and the plaintiffs, as the case plays out in the legal system. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5596107","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:17:00-20:00","title":"This podcast says 'I've Had It' with Republicans – and Democrats who don't fight back","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The political podcast 'I’ve Had It,' hosted by middle-aged women from Oklahoma Jennifer Welch and Angie 'Pumps' Sullivan, has gained significant popularity by offering a raw, confrontational, and often impolite critique of both the Trump administration and key Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer, and Cory Booker.

It only takes a few seconds of listening to get a sense of who hosts Jennifer Welch and Angie \"Pumps\" Sullivan consider their target audience — and the target of their ire. \"Patriots, Gaytriots, Theytriots, Blacktriots, Browntriots and to all the crusty motherf****** that don't support them, you can f*** off,\" one recent episode began. Welch is an interior designer. Sullivan, an attorney. They're two middle-aged suburban women from Oklahoma — and one-time Bravo reality TV stars — whose show has come to represent a vocal coalition of a liberal base who has, well, had it, with Democrats. \"It feels like the 'Preservation Party,' that they want to preserve the status quo,\" Welch said in an interview. \"It almost feels conservative in the sense that they are not evolving and they are not moving.\" Speaking to NPR at the end of October, Welch and Sullivan talked about the show's rising popularity and the Democratic Party's unpopularity among voters who say its leaders don't fight against President Trump enough. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, they're writing strongly worded letters and it's like, this guy's tearing down democracy,\" Sullivan said of the House and Senate Democratic leaders. \"We need more action than we need strongly worded letters.\" The two hosts have different backgrounds — Welch is a lifelong liberal atheist who's always been outspoken and just moved to New York City for a spell, while Sullivan was raised as a conservative evangelical Christian who has slowly become more comfortable with sharing her political views. Both say that key Democratic Party leaders are not doing enough to stand up for marginalized groups, to support young and progressive candidates like mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York City, or to push back against Trump policies. One of those recent moments on display was with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who was asked about Israel's war in Gaza. More specifically, he was asked if he thought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \"a war criminal,\" allegations that Netanyahu has rejected. \"These are questions that a lot of people think are the important litmus tests that are loaded and hot,\" Booker said, visibly flustered. \"My urgency is to be an effective leader in bringing an end to this crisis. And I get these questions all the time that, to me, undermine my urgency.\" The same senator who spoke for 25 hours on the floor in April to protest the Trump administration, Welch said, filibustered what should be a simple yes or no question. \"The thing with Cory Booker is, I can disagree with him if he's f***** honest,\" Welch said of the interaction. \"But to give us a chicken**** cowardice answer about 'Is Benjamin Netanyahu a war criminal?' The answer to that is objectively yes.\" Her answer illustrates another reason some folks can't get enough of I've Had It: a brand of raw, unvarnished and often impolite descriptions of American politics right now. In an episode called \"America's Dumbass Dictator\" that premiered on Election Day last week, Sullivan bemoaned what she called the \"propaganda machine of MAGA\" around the suggestion that Trump could illegally run for a third term. \"I feel like we've gone from either you're on the side of legality, the Constitution and democracy, or you're full-blown fascist and you don't give a s***,\" she said. Welch says the podcast's tone is just how people talk: \"a little bit of gossip, a little bit of policy, a little bit of 'F yous'... it's more digestible, it's more interesting that way.\" She also points to Trump's new media successes and how he makes politics more conversational. \"I disagree with everything he says, I think he's a compulsive liar, etcetera… but the way we talk is really the way Trump has been doing it the last ten years on podcasts,\" Welch said. Sullivan adds that the duo's self-deprecating humor is key. \"I do think that since we don't take ourselves so seriously — like so many politicians — it makes us more like just a gal pal that you're running around with,\" she said. Online, clips from the show have gone viral for their salty language and pejorative descriptions of Trump, Vice President Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans. But it's their withering rebukes of Democratic Party leaders — sometimes to their faces — that have also helped the duo gain millions of followers across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and more. \"Hakeem and Chuckles – that's what we call Chuck Schumer – and the Cory Bookers of the Democratic Party, if they don't get their s*** together, a grifter much like Donald Trump will come in and fill that void,\" Welch said.

Also, the fact that we're novel — that, I think, is kinda sad.\" At a time when the political podcasting space is dominated by the manosphere and a search for the \"Joe Rogan of the Left\" to bring voters back to the Democratic Party, the \"I've Had It\" hosts say their show is trying to nudge elected officials back towards the voters. \"I'm cautious to have the mentality that a lot of leftists do: 'Let's just burn it all down, it's the only way we're going to get better,'\" Welch said. \"I say, let's confront and push the politicians we have as far as we can. And if that makes them both vulnerable to primary, then they weren't the right leader for us anyway.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5604818","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00+00:00","title":"When the dust settles on the shutdown deal, Democrats will likely still have the edge","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article examines the political fallout from the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, where a deal to end the shutdown was reached after only eight Democratic-leaning senators crossed the aisle, defying the majority of their party.

       Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         On its face, the likely  beginning of the path  to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history is a major Democratic capitulation. Most congressional Democrats were against the deal that eight of the senators, who caucus with them, crossed the aisle to vote and reopen the government. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the move a \"terrible mistake\"; Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said it was indefensible; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, declared it a \"policy and political disaster.\" And there were far harsher things said about the deal on social media across the political spectrum of people left of center, not just the most progressive. Make no mistake: bridging the divide is going to be a significant challenge. But despite the intense blowback, the result in the end might not be all that bad for Democrats in next year's midterm elections. Consider that affordability was the dominant issue in the off-year elections, where  Democrats won sweeping victories . If it's the most important issue next year — and it very likely will be — then Democrats will likely retain the advantage. What's more, if Republicans do vote against health care subsidy extensions in December — when a promised vote is to take place as part of this shutdown deal — then the GOP will fully own the increased health care costs that come with it. Democrats could also look like the adults who took the high road, recognizing the very real pain that a lot of people were beginning to feel when President Trump and his administration were beginning to turn the screws on the most vulnerable. So, Democrats' biggest challenge heading into next year's midterms may be keeping progressives on their side — and fired up to vote — after what many of them are viewing as the latest show of weakness from a party, as they see it, defined by that weakness. A Democratic vise Democrats put themselves in a very difficult position from the very beginning of this fight. Any acute observer could have seen this coming — and realize Democrats had nothing but bad options. Republicans dug in, figuring at least enough Democrats couldn't handle the pain of millions losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits as well as federal worker furloughs and layoffs. And they were right. \"Most of us up here have voted repeatedly with the Democratic strategy,\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said. \"But after 40 days, it wasn't going to work.\" It's hard to \"win\" a fight when one side broadly cares about whether the government is open and working properly and the other thinks government is the problem. For Kaine and the seven others who crossed over to join most Republicans in voting to end the shutdown, a commitment to hold a vote to extend health care subsidies, combined with the protections for federal workers and SNAP benefits, was enough. \"I don't think much of anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,\" said Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who voted repeatedly to end the shutdown. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, is one of the three Democrats who has also been voting to end the shutdown, said bluntly: \"It wasn't working. It's been six weeks. Republicans made it clear they weren't going to discuss the health care issue, Affordable Care Act tax credits, until the shutdown was over.\" \"Waiting another week, or another month, wouldn't deliver a better outcome,\" New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. \"It would only mean more harm for families in New Hampshire and all across the country.\" Not everyone agrees with that reasoning, including swing-state Sen. Elissa Slotkin from Michigan. \"I always said it's got to do something concrete on health care,\" she said of an agreement to reopen the government. \"And it's hard to see how that happened.\" Leadership problems Democratic leaders also were ostensibly against the deal to reopen the government. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no, though there are questions about whether Schumer allowed the senators, who went ahead with the votes, to do so. None of the senators who came out in favor of the shutdown deal are in imminent political jeopardy, given they're not facing reelection next year, and two of them are retiring. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Leader Schumer, are opposing this bill in the Senate,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday. He pointed out that the Trump administration's actions when it comes to federal workers leaves most Democrats \"deeply skeptical\" of their \"intentions.\" And on health care, Republicans, he noted, have not acted in \"good faith,\" given that it's the party that tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times. \"It doesn't change the core problem here,\" Jeffries said of the shutdown deal. \"We need to decisively address the Republican health care crisis on behalf of working-class Americans, everyday Americans and middle-class Americans.\" But Schumer already faced significant pushback when he abandoned the fight in March and voted to keep the government open. And given the party's movement toward ousting older leaders, the shutdown deal could spell trouble for the 74-year-old New Yorker as a party leader, even if he didn't vote for it. A changing party — from pragmatism to pugilism in the age of Trump Schumer is certainly not representative of how the Democratic Party is changing. And the moderates, who signed onto this deal, also very much represent the old guard of the party. For as much that's made of how much the GOP has changed since Trump came into office — and it has been a lot — the Democrats have changed as well. Democrats have moved from pragmatism to pugilism. As an example of that, in April of 2017, just after Trump began his first term, an  NBC poll found  that 6-in-10 Democrats favored making compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation. But that has completely flipped. As of March of this year, the last time there was a threat of a shutdown, two-thirds of Democrats said they think Democrats in Congress should instead stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington. Not every progressive sees what happened as a total disaster for the left. Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, who is generally a pretty pragmatic progressive, sees a silver lining. He described the deal as \"embarrassing,\" but  sees progress for the left : “[T]here’s a difference between the deal itself and where the deal leaves Democrats and the broader anti-Trump opposition. This deal shows us that Democrats still don’t have the caucus they need for this fight that will be going on at least through this decade. But the shutdown also accomplished a lot. And not withstanding the WTF fumble at the 10-yard line, it’s still a dramatically different caucus than we had in March. … Democratic voters need to keep demanding more, keep up the pressure and keep purging the Senate caucus of senators who are not up to the new reality.” He also points out that if this deal goes through, there will be another funding deadline at the end of January. At that point, if Democrats don't extract health care extensions or anything else of consequence, there will be another opportunity for leverage. Over the next year, there will also likely be primaries from the left and expect the shutdown positioning to be a litmus test for those primaries — and for 2028. In the meantime, Democratic officials are banking on voters having a short-term memory, that with time, progressives will take a victory in the progress they've made in moving the party to a more fighting stance — and the issue landscape will propel them to winning next year. And winning cures a lot of divisions. \n         \n         Transcript \n         LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Here's where the longest federal government shutdown stands. The Senate voted last night to end it. The House has yet to vote. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Republicans got roughly what they demanded, reopening the government without extending subsidies for health insurance. Just enough Senate Democrats agreed to do without extending those subsidies, although the Senate at least will vote on them soon. So what does that mean for the party that was trying to find some way to assert itself? FADEL: Coming up, we'll hear from Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. We begin with the big picture. INSKEEP: NPR's senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro's been following that. Domenico, good morning. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Great to be with you. INSKEEP: What's a way to think about this result? MONTANARO: Well, you know, Democrats are certainly right now getting a lot of backlash from the left and, you know, for some understandable reasons. I mean, they feel like they continue to get rolled, that the party promises one thing and then, in the end, caves or doesn't quite keep up the fight. So you understand a lot of the irritability from the left about this toward Democrats. But it might not be as bad for Democrats in the long run here into the 2026 midterm elections. I mean, they have the opportunity, Democrats, to look like the adults in the room who care, you know, if people go hungry. And they also raised the issue of health care subsidies, which many weren't talking about before this shutdown fight. INSKEEP: Yeah. MONTANARO: And if they get this promised vote in December on health care subsidies, then it's certainly going to draw a dividing line and Republicans are really going to own that issue. And there were divides between, you know, people in the party before these off-year elections. Democrats still swept across the country. And the reason why was because of that issue of affordability. That's still likely to be the top issue next year, too. INSKEEP: Oh, this is interesting. So if Democrats did well in last week's elections and at least raised their issue, even if they didn't win the issue in this shutdown fight, is there any particular danger for the Democrats who voted to reopen the government? MONTANARO: You know, I think we're going to see potentially more primaries in the next year. I think the left has certainly gotten more activist and more engaged in this fight. But remember, most Democratic members of Congress were against this move. INSKEEP: Yeah. MONTANARO: You know, I think they're going to try to sell that to their constituents. I think what we're seeing is also indicative of a changing Democratic Party, one that's moved from really a pragmatism to a pugilism in the age of Trump, really wanting fighters. It was a party that was far more willing to compromise than it is now, and polling is showing that. There was an NBC poll, for example, in 2017, that found that 6 in 10 Democrats are more likely favoring compromising with Trump. During his second term here, that's flipped. Two-thirds of Democrats earlier this year, in that same poll, said they thought members of the party should stand on principle instead. That was back in March, right around the time when there was almost a shutdown before Democratic leader Chuck Schumer pulled the plug and worked with Republicans to keep it open. INSKEEP: Is Senator Schumer in any trouble? MONTANARO: I think he's in a really tough position, frankly. I mean, he held the line for 40 days, saying... INSKEEP: Yeah. MONTANARO: ...Don't reopen the government unless Republicans negotiate on these health care subsidies, but senators defied his public comments. So either he was unable to keep everyone on the same page, or he tacitly allowed folks to vote this way. And there's some question about that because none of the people who came out in favor of this deal are up for reelection next year. Two of them are retiring. It was really a group that could weather the political blowback on this. And look, he's 74. He's not where the party is heading right now. It would not be surprising, as I've heard other Democrats and Democratic strategists say, to see him not leading the party in 2027, regardless of the outcome of next year's midterm. INSKEEP: Who has the advantage heading into those midterms? MONTANARO: You know, I still think it's hard not to see it being Democrats. You know, affordability was the main issue of the past election. It's very likely to be again next year. And if that's the case, and the cost of living is still pinching people's pockets, then with Trump and Republicans in charge, it's still going to be an edge for Democrats. Plus, Democrats have the issues on their side. In addition to affordability, there's health care. And as we know, congressional elections and control of the House are determined in these swing districts, and winning is going to cure a lot of ills if the environment stays the way it does. INSKEEP: And also people keep voting against whoever is in. So... MONTANARO: Yeah. INSKEEP: ...Democrats have the advantage there. Domenico, thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're welcome. INSKEEP: Domenico Montanaro. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/1234569831","dateOfPublication":"2024-02-28","timeOfPublication":"20:20:00-20:20","title":"Featured Tiny Desk Concerts on NPR Home Page","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On February 28, 2024, at 2:20 PM EST, NPR's homepage features a collection of selected Tiny Desk Concerts, showcasing intimate live performances by various artists.

Click here to subscribe now . When I sit at my desk, I'm constantly   confronted by chaos: Post-its in every color, candy wrappers, multiple headphones, books and mugs of tea.  I can never seem to get a handle on my clutter. How can I clean up my space — and keep it that way?  That's a question that  Star Hansen  thinks a lot about. She's a professional organizer who teaches classes on home organizing and has been featured in over 30 TV shows and online series on the subject.  She believes that keeping your home neat and tidy is a continual process. \"Organizing is not a one-and-done task to complete,\" she says. You have to take the time to \"create systems that work for you.\" Hansen shares more about her decluttering philosophy — along with useful strategies to keep our messes at bay.  1. Understand your clutter  Hansen says everyone's clutter tells a personal story. \"What becomes clutter and where your clutter accumulates can say a lot about what's going on with you.\"   If you have unwanted piles of stuff accumulating around your house, ask yourself:   \"What's making this hard to get rid of?\" she says. \"A lot of times, the trip-up is from holding on to the past or wanting a different reality than the one we're living in.\" That blazer that hasn't fit for years? Maybe it reveals a yearning for your former profession. Those 20 pairs of chopsticks in your kitchen drawer? Maybe they're speaking to your guilt around waste and sustainability.  When you understand the reasons behind your clutter, says Hansen, it's a lot easier to know what to keep and what to get rid of.  2. Start small  When it comes to organizing, don't bite off more than you can chew, says Hansen. If you start off with too big a goal, you might get discouraged if the job takes too long. So don't try to revamp your entire garage in one afternoon. Instead, start with something less challenging, like your purse or one single bathroom drawer. Save more complicated items, like tax paperwork, or sentimental items, like family photos and memorabilia, for last. These kinds of organizational projects often take the most time and emotional energy, says Hansen, so you'll want to build up your decluttering muscle first. You can also work within short time constraints. Say you only have an hour to declutter your home this week. Hansen says to divide that time into 20-minute intervals. For the first 20 minutes, look for trash to throw away. The next 20 minutes, identify anything you want to give away or donate. Spend the last 20 minutes putting items back where they belong.  Setting realistic goals and breaking tasks up in to manageable portions can help keep you invested in the process, says Hansen. \"What we're looking for is small wins.\" 3. Take the emotion out of it Once you've chosen an area to declutter, take inventory of everything you have in that space, says Hansen. If you're tackling your kitchen, for example, take every item out of the drawers and cabinets and sort them into organized piles on your kitchen countertop and dining room table.  Then comes the hard part: figuring out what to get rid of. At this stage, Hansen suggests looking at your items with neutral eyes. Go through your things \"as though you're helping a friend and none of your stuff means anything to you,\" she says.   That attitude can help you let go of things you don't need but feel sentimental about, like the dented frying pan you've had since college, or extra items you keep around just in case, like the five wooden spoons in your utensil drawer.  4. Ditch the fancy storage boxes  Decluttering doesn't have to come with a hefty price tag, says Hansen. Most of the time, the containers you need to organize your stuff are already in your clutter somewhere – so shop your own closet first, she says. Instead of buying new drawer organizers, use old shoeboxes, gift boxes or even Tupperware. Be creative, says Hansen — that's one of the joys of decluttering.  Hansen likes using old iPhone boxes, for example, to store small items. They're sturdy enough to last a long time and can be used for anything from jewelry to office supplies.  5. Make it easy to stay organized It's easy to be organized the day after decluttering, when tidiness is still top of mind. But what happens when you come home from a trip and are too tired to unpack your luggage? Or when you get the flu and are too sick to clean up? The key to staying organized is to create practices that can be easily maintained, says Hansen. \"Make a system that works for you even when you've got to work, when you've got a cold.\" For example, label storage containers on all four sides so they're easier to spot. Make sure  your most used items are always the easiest to reach.  Most importantly, she says, celebrate your progress as you go. \"Brag to your friend, show your spouse, allow yourself to really enjoy the fact that you've done something,\" she says. \"It's not a small thing to get a handle on our clutter.\" More great organizing tips from Life Kit Organize your kitchen cabinets.

Give a little, get a lot with NPR Plus. ANDEE TAGLE, HOST:   This is NPR's LIFE KIT. I'm Andee Tagle, a reporter for this show. And also, I'm a bit of a mess, literally. Looking at my desk, I see reminder Post-its in every color lining my computer screens, hair ties hanging off the pens in my trusty pen cup, dusty photobooth pictures from a wedding last spring, a leftover candy wrapper from yesterday's afternoon snack and four - yes, four - different water cups and water bottles, amazingly, all half empty, in or around my immediate space. I share this embarrassing, overly cluttered truth with you because I could use some help. Are you ready to jump into it? STAR HANSEN: I am, yeah. TAGLE: Lucky for me, Star Hansen specializes in fresh starts. HANSEN: I'm a certified professional organizer and clutter whisperer. TAGLE: Star's decluttering philosophy has been featured everywhere, from HGTV to the OWN network to a TED Talk. She's all about understanding the story behind the messes we make for ourselves and getting to the why of the things that take up space in our lives. HANSEN: Clutter does speak to us. Clutter is talking to us because we are talking to ourselves through our clutter. And so what becomes clutter and where your clutter accumulates says a lot about what's going on with you. TAGLE: So my desk? It's shouting at me about busy workdays and procrastination and fast approaching deadlines. I like to call the mess in my office creative chaos. But if I'm really being honest, all that stuff probably impedes my work more than it helps. And there are a lot of different things in life like this. HANSEN: Clutter looks like anything you can imagine. Clutter looks like the way we talk to ourselves. It looks like our calendar. It looks like our Netflix queue. You know, it's not just physical stuff. It's anything that is causing chaos in our lives. TAGLE: So what can we do about it? Star says the first step is setting any shame aside. HANSEN: What we want to do is start looking at our clutter with curiosity instead of judgment. TAGLE: Then accept that decluttering isn't a one-time fix. It's an ongoing process that requires reflection, not just pretty boxes and a label maker, But we'll talk about that part of it, too. HANSEN: You know, it's like we have this assumption that we should just jump and get rid of things, right? Thanks to all the, like, makeover shows and all of that, it's just, like, so easy. Just get rid of it. But it's not, right? The more that people address that deeper root of the clutter, the easier it is to release the clutter. TAGLE: In this episode of LIFE KIT, the art of decluttering. We'll talk with Star about how to find the root of those emotional attachments to your stuff, tips for letting go and strategies for creating intentional clutter-free spaces that stick. Star, in every place I've lived, no matter how organized I am, no matter how big or small the space, no matter, you know, what good intentions I go in with it with, I always, always end up with a junk drawer. You know, it starts as the utility drawer - you know, batteries, that spare thing of scissors, tape, things like that. And then inevitably, it just gets away from me - every takeout menu, a catchall for my condiment packets or just, you know, napkins. You get the picture. I don't need to go on. But it's a habit that I just can't seem to shake, and it haunts me. What might that clutter be saying to you? HANSEN: Well, let's dive into the superficial level first, which is just we're busy and it's not a priority. Like, would you rather get rest, sleep eight hours tonight, or clear your junk drawer? Would you rather, you know, cuddle with your puppy or clear your junk drawer? Like, it's just not a high-priority activity. So that's part of it. So we just want to name that and let it be OK. That ideally stops us from feeling that shame and guilt build up. The second part is - the junk drawer is a great example of an unhoused, you know, graveyard basically. So, like, where do the things go that don't have a home? TAGLE: Yeah. HANSEN: And generally speaking, it's because we're not quite sure of like, oh, I don't know, do I want that? You know, I might need that extra silverware set from takeout. TAGLE: And then never, ever use them. HANSEN: Totally. And also, too, you're bumping up against those feelings that we have in a disposable, consumer-driven society, which is what a waste. What a waste of that tree that created the chopsticks. What a waste of the plastic that's housing the chopsticks. So we're not just dealing with clutter, we're looking at our value system. So you holding on to those chopsticks is you saying, I don't want to waste on our beautiful, precious planet. And it's really complicated because we live in a world where to not accumulate excess requires a next level veracity of, like, saying no. And then we wonder why we're all kind of drowning in stuff. We have so much thrown at us all the time. TAGLE: What about if you live with someone who has a very different clutter personality than you? So, for example, I tend towards maximalism when it comes to decor. My partner is very much team clean, open spaces. HANSEN: So what's really important is you want to make sure that you all have established your safe spaces. So - and when I say safe spaces, I just mean, where are you allowed to clutter? Because every person should be able to behave with their stuff the way that they naturally need to and want to because sometimes people need and want a chaotic energy around them. If you look at artists, have you ever walked into an artist's studio that was, like, perfectly organized and minimalist? TAGLE: Yeah, it's not clutter. It's creative chaos. HANSEN: Totally. I have a client who's neurodivergent, and she thrives in having her clothes everywhere. And her husband has been diagnosed with OCD, and he can't tolerate it. So they have to create different corners of the house that are for them. Then you want to come together and say, OK, great, consciously, what are we choosing for this room? What are the rules and guidelines for this room? And this is tricky because a lot of times, we move into the house and we are just, you know, hobbling over that finish line, dragging ourselves by one fingernail to cross. And we barely have energy to unpack boxes, let alone set up intentions... TAGLE: Right. HANSEN: ...And set up rules for, you know, life. So it's really important that you take the time. It doesn't matter if you moved in five years ago or five days ago, taking the time to say, wow, I'm noticing that we are having some incongruence in this room. Can we get on the same page? Because one of the things that's really important is for some people, clutter is not something you're going to just eliminate. You're not going to suddenly become a minimalist. And what we want to do is stop judging people who experience clutter in their lives and who it's part of how they process. TAGLE: That's great. What I'm hearing there, just, like, in many other facets of relationships, is that there's going to be some compromises, and everyone needs their own space, too. Is clutter a problem if it doesn't bother you? Does clutter only become a problem when it bothers you? HANSEN: It is only a problem if it's a problem for you. And it's really important that we mind our own side of the street because, again, you don't know what someone is going through. It sounds like I'm very pro-clutter, and in some ways I am. It is OK to have your clutter. It is OK to have a layer of chaos and disorganization in your life. If we can be OK with that, it allows us to stop the shame, stop the judgment, start to see what the root of it is so we can actually have a chance of letting it go. As long as we're judging and shaming and attacking ourselves, that clutter is going to hold tight because we need it, you know, to, like, protect ourselves. But the minute that you can say no, you know, it's OK that it's here, and no thank you to your opinion very much, this is how I'm living my life, and it's my journey and I'm going to walk it on my own - that's a much stronger position for you to be in because then the clutter is your choice. TAGLE: We're adults, and we get to make the rules. HANSEN: Exactly. Exactly. TAGLE: I'd love to move into the practical a little bit. Any specific tips for making incremental progress on your clutter? HANSEN: So when it comes to home organizing, you do really want to start in the easiest place first. I don't recommend starting with the most emotional things or paperwork - you know, memorabilia and paperwork are two things that I say, please save that for further down the line because those two tend to be the most emotionally triggering. We are looking at organizing as creating a skill set. Like, most people, if they have recurring clutter, do not feel like they have a handle on the process of organizing. And so you don't want to start, you know, with the most difficult thing first. Like, if you were going to go for a run, you're not going to choose to run the Big Sur marathon at a... TAGLE: Sure. Lifting weights - you go with five pounds before 10 pounds HANSEN: You, like, ease in, yeah. But then the other thing is when we look at how the mainstream world talks about organizing, they're talking about creating systems. They're talking about putting things in a pretty box with a label and giving it a home, right? And oftentimes, they're also talking about letting go of things. So in my experience, those are two very small pieces of a much bigger puzzle. When it comes to getting organized, if you're only trying to do those two things - getting rid of things or setting up systems. You are missing a lot of other really important stuff that creates organization and maintains organization. TAGLE: Star says she's big about setting an intention for a space. So look around that messy office or living room and think... HANSEN: What is it that I want to do in this room? How do I want it to feel? And, you know, what do I want it to look like? How do I know what to keep and get rid of? TAGLE: For me, it's the bedroom. I store a lot of my clothes under my bed. To be fair to me, my apartment is super short on storage. But also, I have a really hard time letting go of clothes. And they can sometimes take over our bedroom entirely. Star says to help, start thinking about three to five activities you want to do in the room. HANSEN: You're going to sleep. You're going to store clothes. You're going to connect with your partner, right? Those are maybe three things that we would say in that space. And we would pull all the clothes out. And I always tell people, don't make decisions as you go. What you want to do is you want to look at your stuff with neutral eyes, like as though you're helping a friend and none of your stuff means anything to you. TAGLE: OK. HANSEN: Just pull them all out, and then you want to put them into categories in a clear, neutral space. So, like, say, on top of the bed. So what you want to do is all jeans go here. All T-shirts go here. All socks go here. So you categorize everything all together. Then, once you've pulled everything out and it's all in categories, then you want to go through each pile and make a decision. Does this stay or go, stay or go? That's what we're kind of looking for, right? And then once you've gone through all the piles, one pile at a time - and we're looking at doing that the easiest to the hardest. So if you're like, oh, jeans are my kryptonite, save that for the end. Socks - I need to get rid of socks. Start there. Whatever's easy, start there. Go through each pile. And then once you're done going through everything, you want to take all those things that you're going to get rid of and get them out right then because you want to give yourself that openness, that freedom, that space to think. As long as you're looking at things you already made the decision to get rid of, you're kind of keeping yourself stuck in the past. So get it to the car to be donated or by the door. TAGLE: Physically move it out of that space. HANSEN: Yeah, get it out of there. And then you want to go through each pile and you want to say, OK, where am I going to store this? That's when we're talking about building systems. OK, great. Well, I want all my T-shirts hung, so you hang your T-shirts. I want all of the jeans folded and put into this bin underneath my bed. Fold it, put it underneath there, label it on all four sides, shove it under there. You're going to go through each category in that way. When we look at the concept of clutter as a whole, it's like one giant blob of chaos versus, oh, what am I going to do with my jeans? What am I going to do with my tank tops? And it becomes easier to dial in to. TAGLE: Once you found a home for everything, Star says it's time to personalize your space and make it beautiful. HANSEN: If you put some things in the closet, for example, do you want to paint the wall green? Do you want to hang a painting from your aunt? What do you want in there that reminds you of you and makes you feel happy? Because no one wants to live in a surplus store, you know? We want to feel personal. So what you want is that when you open that door, when you go underneath the bed, there's something that just makes you feel happy and peaceful and recognize yourself. Because when you decorate or when you kind of personalize a space, it stops you from adding more clutter. There's something about it that we won't kind of defile an area if we feel an endearment to it. And then from there, you want to decide, what's your maintenance plan, right? So it's pretty. It's set up. Now how am I going to maintain this? What I always tell people is make your maintenance systems for your laziest day. We all are superheroes when we are well-rested and, like, feeling good. And the truth is what happens when you come home from traveling? What happens when you get the flu? Those are the moments where we really lose our systems because suddenly we've gotten lost because things didn't go according to plan. TAGLE: It makes sense to me that, you know, when things are pretty, when they feel good, it's easier to have that investment and hopefully a long term investment, right? You want to give yourself the ability to invest in these things. But on that note, there are a lot of - there's a lot of beautiful and also very expensive ways to get organized these days. You know, I'm thinking about Instagram ads very aesthetic containers and all the videos I see for people's immaculate walk-in pantries? Does decluttering have to come with a price tag? HANSEN: What I have found in all my years of organizing is in every pile of chaos is the solution, meaning that when I come into somebody's house and we're organizing an entire room, yes, I could go and buy bins and boxes, but I have never not found the organizing solution buried in the chaos. We all have bought boxes over the years that then become clutter or, you know, things that we had best intentions with. So, yes, look, the organizing industry is a $12 billion a year industry and growing, right? It's just getting bigger and bigger. So it's an industry, just like anything else, and it wants you to spend money and do all of that. For some people, they really, really want that. You do not need to do that, right? A lot of these systems are hidden. A lot of these systems, you are never going to look out again, you know? And so what you're looking for is function more than anything else. I promise you, there is something in your house that you can use for that, even if it's, like, a box from your iPhone that you're not using anymore. But the quality is so good you don't want to get rid of. TAGLE: I have so many of those. HANSEN: Totally. Well, they make... TAGLE: (Laughter). HANSEN: ...They're so good, and they make great, like, drawer organizers. You just take those little inserts out, put them in the drawers. They're amazing. They'll last forever. So just knowing that you have this option to shop from within your own home is really powerful. And it's really important to take the time to create systems that work for you and how you really think. TAGLE: Yeah. It's not a one size fits all. This is up to you and how you want to do it, so make it fun. Make it fun where you can. What about decluttering tips for small spaces, or maybe storage ideas for small spaces? HANSEN: So the smaller your space, the more intentional you have to be. You might want to really lean in and have, like, oh, I want to keep this and this and this. But if you're in a small space, you have to have those three questions that I asked you really dialed in. What are the three to five activities you want to do in the space, how do you want it to look and how do you want to feel? You need to live from that like it's your Bible, like nothing exists in that space that isn't in alignment with those values because you just don't have the space for it. And it's really vital that we say, this is my intention and I'm moving forward. So when it comes to those spaces, you want to - yes, of course - like, have things that are multi-functional. Maximize the vertical space of your home. You know, organize and hang things on walls and in closets and really do as much dual functionality as you can. Also, see what you can get away with when it comes to multi-use items. TAGLE: Sure. That makes sense. So just really taking the time to be thoughtful about it. Maybe you have a couch that you'd really like to keep so that you don't have to buy a new couch. But if you have to walk diagonal in your studio apartment all the time, then it's not going to do you much good. HANSEN: Yeah. And, you know, we live in this wonderful time where you don't have to buy things all the time. There's infinite options for how you can source things without spending a lot of money. So I'm not saying go and spend a million dollars, but what I'm saying is get clear about what the right solution is. Stop living with the version that doesn't work for you. When you're in small spaces, you don't have the luxury of holding on to something because it's good enough or it used to work. You've got to be very sharp and clear about how you're going to use those spaces and map them out and then find the right things. And it might take time, but that's really, really vital in small spaces. TAGLE: I want to touch a little bit on relief versus completion. When you're tackling big projects or when you're just in the middle of it and you can't see your way through, can you talk to us a little bit about how to avoid overwhelms and some tips or strategies for - you know, for staying on top of it and not losing the thread? HANSEN: Absolutely. You can say, I'm not going to be in servitude to this clutter. I am choosing to take X amount of time to devote to clearing this clutter. So instead of saying, I'm going to take as long as this clutter takes to get organized - because the truth is, you could spend five hours on a pile of clutter, 20 minutes on a pile of clutter or five days on a pile of clutter, and you get to determine how long. So you could say, I'm willing to give this one hour. And in one hour, you just make it better. You don't have to get it completed fully, all the way done, because that's a moving target. You can just say, I'm willing to give this an hour and really give yourself that hour, and do the best that you can. Like, sometimes getting organized is not about this thorough, down-to-the-needle, you know, process. Sometimes it's just, I just need to walk in this room. And so that might look like you just walking through with a garbage bag and grabbing everything that's trash that you can see with your eye, or the same with donations. Or saying, I only have an hour, but I need to walk in this room and boxing things up and stacking it so that it gives you a breezeway, like, a real walkway. And so you really have to notice, like, OK, what is it that I need from this process right now? What kind of resources am I able to devote to it? Because again, we have this idea that we're supposed to, like, get it all done. And it's like, that's not always the case. And what if that's OK? What if this is you accomplishing something very big in small, manageable steps? What if that's enough? And I promise you it is, because it's not - the people who stay organized are not the ones who go and get the house renovation and do the whole thing in one weekend. That leads to backsliding, oftentimes. It's the people who stay consistent and keep moving through, a step at a time. Those are the people who really experience long-term organization. So just keep moving forward. That's the most important thing. TAGLE: That was Star Hansen, a professional organizer, also known as the Clutter Whisperer. By the way, Happy New Year.

       \n        \n           Heard on  Morning Edition \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump has bragged many times about the revenue tariffs are bringing in — money paid by American businesses, who pass some of the costs on to consumers. Over the weekend, Trump  pushed the idea  of paying that money back to Americans, in the form of $2,000 payments. The idea is in no way a detailed proposal, but what Trump has said about it presents multiple steep challenges for the administration: the plan may cost far more than Trump is saying, and Trump's rhetoric around tariff revenue may undermine his administration's pro-tariff arguments at the Supreme Court. In addition, his administration is already saying that the plan won't even involve direct payments to taxpayers, even while Trump continues to push that notion. Trump summarized much of what he's said about his tariff rebate plan speaking with reporters on Monday. \"We're going to issue a dividend to our middle income people and lower income people of about $2,000,\" he said. \"And we're going to use the remaining tariffs to lower our debt.\" While details are scant,  budget experts  are  already saying  that there just isn't enough money for this idea. \"Even with the most conservative estimates applied to it, it doesn't work,\" said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. By her math, if the rebates went to people making under $100,000 per year, that would cost way more than the amount of revenue tariffs will bring in. \"So you'll see at least a $100 billion gap there between what we can expect the tariffs to generate for the U.S. government versus what the president is promising to spend on tariff rebates for American citizens.\" She added that even if the money went out only to people making $75,000 or less annually, there still wouldn't be enough revenue, by her calculations. In other words, the proposal could add to the debt — the opposite of what Trump said he wanted it to do. \"To me, this seems less of a thought out policy proposal and more of, 'A $2,000 check sounds good. People are struggling with affordability. They're tired of inflation. What can I say to make them think I'm trying to do something?'\" York said. Then again, the White House is already saying the plan might not involve a straightforward check or payment sent to taxpayers, like the stimulus money during the height of COVID. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC's  This Week  on Sunday that voters might receive the money in the form of tax cuts that Congress  already passed  earlier this year. \"The $2,000 dividend could come in lots of forms,\" Bessent said. \"It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. You know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security.\" NPR asked the White House for additional details on the plan.  \"The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,\" said a White House official not authorized to speak on the record. Talking about revenues puts the Trump administration in a tricky position right now. Just last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments against some of Trump's tariffs, with tariff opponents saying Congress — not the president — has the power to levy taxes. In response, administration lawyers argued before the Supreme Court that revenues aren't the point of the tariffs. \"These are regulatory tariffs,\" Solicitor General John Sauer said to the justices. \"They are not revenue-raising tariffs. The fact that they raise revenue is only incidental.\" Asked on Sunday to square that argument with Trump's revenue talk, Bessent said the tariffs are ultimately meant to bring businesses back into the U.S. No matter what, Congress would have to authorize any payments. And even if the government were open, it's not a given that would happen. \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Here is one thing that President Trump has said in recent months about the revenue being brought in by tariffs. That's money paid by American businesses, who pass on some of the costs to consumers. The president is suggesting that some of that money should go back to Americans. As NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports, Americans should not count on seeing the check just yet. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Trump is calling the payments dividends, but they are by no means a fleshed-out proposal. He briefly discussed them with reporters on Monday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: One of the things we're going to do, we're going to issue a dividend to our middle-income people and lower-income people of about $2,000. And we're going to use the remaining tariffs to lower our debt. KURTZLEBEN: That's most of the details he has provided on the idea. While details are scant, budget experts are already saying that there just isn't enough money for this idea. Erica York is one of them. She's vice president of federal tax policy at the right-leaning Tax Foundation. ERICA YORK: Even with the most conservative estimates applied to it, it doesn't work. KURTZLEBEN: By her math, if the rebates went to people making under $100,000 per year, that would cost way more than the amount of revenue tariffs will bring in. YORK: You'll see at least a $100 billion gap there between what we can expect the tariffs to generate for the U.S. government versus what the president is promising to spend on tariff rebates for American citizens. KURTZLEBEN: In other words, the proposal could add to the debt. Then again, the White House is already saying the plan might not involve a straightforward check sent to taxpayers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that voters might receive the money in the form of tax cuts that Congress already passed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCOTT BESSENT: It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda, you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security. KURTZLEBEN: NPR asked for additional details on the plan, but the White House did not answer directly. Talking about revenues puts the Trump administration in a tricky position right now. Just last week, administration lawyers argued before the Supreme Court that revenues aren't the point of the tariffs. Solicitor General John Sauer said this to the justices.

Trump's National Guard deployments and related court battles stand \n         By Juliana Kim \n        \n           Updated Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 11:56 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         President Trump has significantly escalated the use of  the National Guard  in his second term. Over the past six months, Trump has suggested or ordered mobilizing Guard troops to nearly a dozen cities — all run by Democratic mayors and in states mostly run by Democratic governors. The Trump administration has argued the move was necessary to reduce crime, quell protests, or safeguard federal buildings and personnel. Meanwhile, critics have called it a  dangerous abuse of power . The troop deployments have sparked court battles and protests. Here's the latest. Oregon: Stalled in court  After weeks of legal wrangling, U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut on Nov. 7 issued a permanent block against sending troops to Portland over anti-ICE protests. In her order, Immergut wrote that federal action was not justified for the demonstrations in Portland, which she described as mostly peaceful or quickly managed by local law enforcement. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling,  member station OPB reported. The Trump administration on Sept. 28 activated  200 members of the Oregon National Guard  for federal duty following protests near an ICE facility in Portland. Oregon and Portland officials sued the Trump administration and later, Immergut granted a temporary restraining order blocking a troop deployment. A week later, the Trump administration attempted to send the California National Guard to Portland without the approval of California's governor. Immergut temporarily blocked that move ahead of a trial, which began on Oct. 29 and lasted three days. Illinois: Stalled in court  Guard operations in Chicago have been on hold following a temporary restraining order issued last month. Now all eyes are on the nation's highest court, which the Trump administration has asked to lift the court order blocking the troop deployment. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the emergency appeal. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mobilized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard to Chicago on Oct. 4. About 200 members of the Texas National Guard were also deployed, according to the  U.S. military's Northern Command . Troops were assigned to protect ICE facilities and personnel, as well as other federal property. In response, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago  filed a lawsuit  against the Trump administration, alleging that the troop deployment was unlawful. T ennessee: Ongoing In mid-October, a group of Democratic lawmakers and officials filed a lawsuit in state court against Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others, arguing that Memphis did not face a \"rebellion of invasion\" which is the standard for deploying the Tennessee National Guard under the state's constitution. A court hearing on the suit took place on Nov. 3. The case is ongoing. Troops were activated by Lee, with support from Trump, as part of an effort to tackle crime in Memphis. Guard members are part of a task force that includes other federal agencies and they began patrols  on Oct. 10 . Lee previously said troops are in support roles and not tasked with making arrests. Last month, Memphis Democratic mayor Paul Young  said  there were about 150 Guard troops deployed in the city. Although Young has previously questioned the use of the Guard in Memphis, he was not part of the lawsuit against the deployment. Back in September, the Memphis City Council failed to pass a resolution to formally ask the state to not send the Guard. Washington, D.C.: Ongoing About 2,300 troops from D.C. and several states are stationed in the nation's capital. Soldiers are largely tasked with patrols and beautification efforts like clearing trash, spreading mulch and pruning trees. Troops will remain in the nation's capital through the end of February, The Associated Press  reported . Trump sent hundreds of Guard members to D.C. on Aug. 11 alleging that the city is experiencing a \"crime emergency.\" The District of Columbia sued over the troop deployment, accusing the Trump administration of violating the Home Rule Act by mobilizing troops to D.C. without the mayor's consent. A federal judge heard arguments on Oct. 24 and did not make a ruling from the bench. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The use of troops in D.C. has also been challenged in a state that sent them. In West Virginia, a civic organization filed a lawsuit against the state's governor, arguing that the situation in D.C. did not meet the criteria to deploy the West Virginia National Guard. On Nov. 10, a judge in West Virginia ruled that the deployment can continue, according to The  Associated Press . California: Ongoing but reduced presence  On June 7, Trump mobilized the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration raids in the city — some of which had turned into  clashes with local police . In total, some 4,000 guard troops and 700 Marines were deployed. The Pentagon began withdrawing troops in mid-July. A  legal battle  has since ensued, with the state of California accusing the Trump administration of exceeding its legal authority by deploying troops without the consent or input of the state's governor. About 100 guard members remain in California for federal service, according to the U.S. Northern Command. Next possible cities Over the past few months, Trump has suggested sending troops to a handful of more cities, including New Orleans, New York City, Baltimore, San Francisco, Oakland and St. Louis, Mo., citing public safety concerns. \"We want to save these places,\" Trump said on Sept. 15 after announcing the creation of the anti-crime federal task force in Memphis. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Some Republican-led states have welcomed the support. Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe authorized about 15 members of his state's National Guard to help ICE with \"administrative, clerical, and logistical duties,\" member station STLPR  reported . The move came at the request of the Department of Homeland Security and the mission is set to last through September 2026. In Louisiana, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry  requested  federal assistance to activate up to 1,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard to combat \"high crime rates\" — not just in New Orleans, but also in Shreveport and Baton Rouge.

Counterintuitive though it may seem, that's the advice of world-renowned relationship researchers and clinical psychologists Julie Schwartz Gottman and John Gottman.  \"Conflict really has a purpose,\" says John Gottman, \"and the purpose is mutual understanding.\"   In the 40 years they've dedicated to the study and practice of fostering healthy, long-lasting relationships, the Gottmans have found that the happiest and most successful couples don't avoid conflict, fear or anger – they just know how to fight fairly and productively. The Gottmans' new book, published in January,  Fight Right: How Successful Couples Turn Conflict into Connection , is a guide to doing just that. It aims to teach couples \"how to have conflicts that don't push them apart but instead produce connection and compassion for one another,\" says Julie Schwartz Gottman.   Pulling from decades of relationship research and thousands of hours of interviews and therapy sessions with couples, the Gottmans identify some of the most common fights — and offer research-backed solutions for coming out the other side stronger.  1. 'The Flood'  What it is:  According to the Gottmans, feeling \"flooded\" is the state of being psychologically and physically overwhelmed during a conflict.  \"When you feel deeply attacked and there's no way out, people will move into flight or fight\" mode, in which stress hormones course through the body, says Julie Schwartz Gottman. As a result, \"they cannot think straight. They cannot hear well. It's a terrible state to be in.\" What this conflict looks like in real life:  Your friend says something insensitive to your girlfriend over dinner. \"You never back me up!\" she complains on the way home. \"You're supposed to be on my side!\"  You try to defend yourself, but she won't let you off the hook. Your heart rate rises. Your palms go sweaty. You turn away and go silent, refusing to respond to anything she has to say.  How to handle this type of conflict:  Put your fight on pause, say the Gottmans.   This idea may seem strange for couples who follow the adage \"never go to sleep angry.\" But the Gottmans say if one or both partners are \"flooded,\" taking a break is the best way to keep a bad argument from getting worse.  So the next time you feel your jaw clench or your stomach drop during a spat, stop the discussion and ask your partner to take a break. A pause can be as short as 20 minutes or as long as 24 hours – aim for enough time that you'll both have cooled down, says Julie Schwartz Gottman. Once you agree on a timeframe, get out of each other's space and – here's the hardest part –  don't think about the fight,  John Gottman says.  Instead of feeling like a victim, dwelling on what your partner said or planning out your argument, Julie Schwartz Gottman says it's important to spend this time away from your partner doing something self-soothing. Read a book, listen to a podcast, go for a run – do anything that will give your body \"a chance to metabolize all the stress hormones\" and allow you to come back to the conflict with a calm body and a clear mind, she says. 2. 'The Standoff' What it is:  A \"standoff\" is a disagreement in which both sides feel they have to \"win\" the argument, says John Gottman. It's a common problem. In a 2020 study of over 40,000 couples beginning couples therapy, the Gottmans found that  84 percent of the heterosexual couples  they interviewed said they were struggling with an inability to compromise.  What it looks like in real life:  You and your partner have reached an impasse about where to send your son to school. You feel strongly about the local public school down the street. But your partner wants him to attend private school like he did. How to handle this type of conflict:  To get out of gridlock and find some common ground, the Gottmans suggest doing an exercise they created for couples in therapy who can't find a compromise. They call it the \"Bagel Method\" – named because of its shape. It's designed to help people in relationships understand the core of their desires in a disagreement and find the validity and beauty in their partner's point of view.  To do the \"Bagel Method\" exercise, each partner draws two concentric ovals on a piece of paper. In the inside oval, write down what you absolutely cannot compromise on regarding the issue. Write down what you  can  compromise on in the outside oval.  So, the inside oval for you might say: \"my son will have a quality education,\" \"he will stay connected to the local community\" and \"we're supporting public education.\" Your outside oval might say: \"maybe we can move him to private school during high school,\" \"he can get involved in the local community in other ways\" and \"we can ask him when he's old enough to weigh in on the decision.\"  Then, compare and contrast your \"bagel\" with your partner. Ask each other why the things in the inner circle are so important to you. Discuss where your flexible areas overlap and workshop some possible compromises. Here, that might look like sending your son to private school but enrolling him in local after-school soccer, then assessing how things are going after a year.  The Gottmans say after doing this exercise, couples are often surprised by how much flexibility they have and how much compassion this creates between them.  \"It's so important to understand that your partner is not your clone. They are a different human being with a different internal world,\" says Julie Schwartz Gottman. So, conflict is an understandable and healthy part of being in a relationship, say the Gottmans. When it happens, just remember it's possible to \"communicate with love and affection, even when you disagree.\"  3. 'The Bomb Drop' (The Harsh Startup)  What it is:  This fight is characterized by a harsh startup, attacking your partner with anger and criticism, often out of the blue and without context for the other person, says John Gottman – hence the name.  What this conflict looks like in real life:  Let's say you and your partner are trying to save up, but you get the credit card bill and find they've overspent again. As soon as your husband walks through the door you yell, \"I can't believe how irresponsible you are!\" How to handle this type of conflict:  Starting a conflict with negativity like this often portends poor outcomes, say the Gottmans. In fact, their research shows that  the first three minutes of a fight  determines not only the way a conversation will go but also the future of a relationship. The 1999 study looked at the behavior of 124 newlywed couples and found that when couples began a fight with negative emotions like criticism, contempt, defensiveness or stonewalling, they were very likely to break up down the road.   So if you and your partner want to go the distance, the Gottmans suggest starting your disagreements with a gentler approach. \"What that means is you point your finger not at your partner, but at yourself,\" says John Gottman. In order to do that, try using the Gottman formula, developed in response to that 1999 study, for soft start-ups: Say: \"I feel (emotion) about (situation/problem) and I need (a positive and specific action your partner can take to help improve the situation).\"   So, \"You're so irresponsible with money!\" transforms into: \"I feel really stressed (the emotion) about our budget this month – it looks like we're going to be short again (the situation). Can we sit down together and plan how to cut some of our expenses (the positive need)?\"  Hurling blanket accusations or criticisms gives your partner no choice but to go on the defensive. But this approach creates space for your partner to understand the issue and show up for you, says Julie Schwartz Gottman.

JOHN GOTTMAN: What we're seeing a lot is couples in the United States are engaged in kind of a standoff. So they start by presenting the issue as a defect in their partner's personality, which just leads the partner to become defensive. And it escalates very quickly into a standoff, an attack, defend, standoff. And when that happens, it really is very dangerous for the future of the relationship. SEGARRA: Any of that sound familiar? If so, it's time to change how you view your disagreements. JOHN GOTTMAN: Conflict really has a purpose, and the purpose is mutual understanding. SEGARRA: That was Julie and John Gottman, world-renowned researchers and clinical psychologists who've been married for more than 30 years and have spent the last 40 dedicated to the study and practice of fostering healthy, long-lasting relationships. They've watched thousands of couples argue, and they are able to predict with over 90% accuracy if a couple will stay together after witnessing just three minutes of a conflict. Yeah, how you fight matters a lot more than you might think. The Gottman's new book, \"Fight Right,\" details the keys to successful conflict found in couples that master love. JOHN GOTTMAN: A couple that stays together and, you know, pretty much likes one another over time, and they're pretty satisfied with the relationship, that's a master. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Versus a disaster, which is a couple that typically has really terrible conflicts and grows more and more distant and more and more unhappy. So we don't want to be disasters. But the great thing is that disasters can become masters simply by reconfiguring how they talk about their conflicts and become more connected. JOHN GOTTMAN: Good point, Julie. SEGARRA: On this episode of LIFE KIT, we're going to learn how to fight right. Reporter Andee Tagle talks to the Gottmans about some of the most common fights in relationships, why they happen and how we can turn conflict into connection. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ANDEE TAGLE, BYLINE: If you want to fight right, you first need to understand what Julie and John call the conflict culture of your relationship. Being aware of your fighting style and that of your partner's will make it easier to connect amid conflict. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: So first of all, what people can do is ask how was conflict handled in your family when you were growing up? A lot of times, we will either imitate what our parents or our caretakers did when we were growing up or we will go the opposite direction. And that background determines what our culture of conflict is. We might be conflict avoiders, which means we may just agree to disagree, but we don't resolve problems by really hashing out our own position on the issue and trying to reach a compromise. Or we may validate each other in talking about conflict, which means we'll express our feelings somewhat but very rationally, and we will move to problem-solving very quickly. We may not explore as deeply as we need to what's going on in our own position on the issue. And third, we may be volatile, which means lots of emotion, lots of intensity, lots of passion when we express our emotions. None of those is bad. It's simply a matter of recognizing which you are - avoidant, validating or volatile - and talking with your partner about what kind of discussion and conflict helps you feel more comfortable and more listened to. TAGLE: OK. Let me just make sure I understand. In order to understand our styles, to start, we need to interrogate our past and interrogate our influences. What else? What's next? JOHN GOTTMAN: One of the things that's very important, Andee, is the ratio of positivity to negativity in a conflict discussion. And what we found was, whatever style of conflict you have, the masters of relationships, the ones that stay together happily, have this ratio of five times as much positive emotion as negative emotion in a conflict discussion, which means that they're really creating this sort of lubricated climate of understanding by just expressing interest, and nodding their heads, and, you know, vocalizing and saying, oh, interesting, tell me more about that, you know? Oh, wow, you know? And that kind of feedback, that eye contact and vocalization lubricates the wheels of communication, whereas when there's a standoff, people don't express any affection. There's very little humor. And they're kind of, you know, like stone walls just sort of standing there and really being opposite of one another and disagreeing with their partner constantly as opposed to trying to reach mutual understanding. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Let's call this takeaway two. Whenever possible, but especially in conflict, aim for the positive - a little humor, offering some validation or a simple, OK, I see your point, can go a long way in maintaining a successful relationship. Now let's turn to some of the most common fights people have. The first one I want to cover with you, I am extremely guilty of. But if you tell my husband, I will deny... (LAUGHTER) TAGLE: ...That I said that. You call it the bomb drop. Please, can you tell us what we're talking about? Give us an example of the bomb drop fight. JOHN GOTTMAN: Sure. A lot of times, it comes from not feeling entitled to really ask for what you need and suppressing your irritation and your upset and not talking about it. And then when it finally does come out, it's almost like you've dropped a bomb on the relationship. And what typically happens is you express your discomfort by describing your partner, not describing yourself. So we call it harsh startup, and you really describe your partner in very negative terms and say, you know, the problem in this relationship is that you're so selfish; you're inconsiderate; you only think about yourself. And they go on and on, really pointing a finger at their partner, and that's guaranteed to lead to defensiveness. So that's what a bomb drop is. TAGLE: The defining quality of this type of fight is that it kind of comes out of nowhere, you know? Like, you're walking along, and everything's fine. It seems like you're having a good day, and it's suddenly like, I can't believe you, right? JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. TAGLE: You have been awful for the past 10 years. (LAUGTHER) TAGLE: Right? Is that - do I have that right? JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. Exactly, you got it. TAGLE: OK. So we don't want to do the harsh startup or drop that bomb. John, can you explain the alternative, what you call the soft startup? JOHN GOTTMAN: What that means is, you point your finger not at your partner but at yourself and say what you feel about a situation - not about a person, but about a situation - that is irritating or upsetting you. And then you talk about what you do need. And in effect, the masters are giving their partner a recipe for succeeding with them, a way to shine for them. So I feel, about what, and here's what I need. And a positive need is the opposite of what you don't need, what you don't want, what you're upset about. So you really have to do a little bit of work to think about, what do you want? And so this softened startup has those three parts to it - I feel, about what, and here's what my positive need is. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Let me give you an example of the difference between a harsh startup and a softened startup. So let's say that your partner's mother is coming over for dinner tonight. TAGLE: OK. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: And she always finds something to criticize you about, no matter what. It's your cooking, it's your cleaning, you know, whatever - or your child raising, she always criticizes you. So you want to bring this up to your partner. A harsh startup would sound like this. Dear, your mother is a wart on the back of humanity. TAGLE: (Laughter). JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: All right. OK. How's your partner going to respond to that? Probably not well, unless your partner totally agrees with you, that's always a possibility. However, softened startup would sound like this. Honey, I'm really feeling nervous - there's the emotion - about your mother coming over to dinner tonight. She often find something to criticize me for. That's the situation. Would you please stand up for me if she does that again? There's the positive need. That's how your partner can shine for you. JOHN GOTTMAN: And Andee, let me contrast that with when you do this following thing, then I feel this way, and I don't like that, that's in an attack mode because it immediately puts the other person in a defensive place, you know? So here, you're not saying you're the fault of my emotion, you're saying this situation is really frustrating for me or upsetting to me, and here's what I need from you. And that's a whole different way of being gentler in starting up talking about a conflict issue. TAGLE: So takeaway three - when it's time to fight, start soft. That formula again is I feel plus situation plus positive need. By using that I statement, keeping the discussion about only the matter at hand rather than your whole relationship or your partner's character, and asking them for exactly what you need to feel connected, you're providing your partner space to react calmly and a roadmap for a successful conversation. OK. Moving on to another type of fight - the flood. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: So this part of John's earliest research that was so significant. He would have a couple talking to one another, sitting in chairs, looking as calm as can be. But he and his colleague, Dr. Robert Levenson, also measured heart rate. They measured how much people jiggled in their chair. They looked at their facial expressions. And what they saw, particularly in heart rate, is that people could be speaking fairly calmly or maybe shutting down, but their heart rates were over 100 beats a minute. What that signifies is that your whole physiological system is very, very upset, and you've moved into fight or flight. Now, what are the situations that make you feel that way, either facing a saber-tooth tiger or facing your partner who's criticizing you... TAGLE: (Laughter). JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: ...And attacking you. And when you feel deeply attacked and there's no way out, people will move into flight or fight and they cannot think straight, they cannot hear well, it's a terrible state to be in. We call that flooding. The antidote to that is that as soon as somebody notices the signs that they're starting to flood - and everybody may have different signs of that in their own bodies, like getting hot or maybe their jaw getting clenched or their inability to breathe deeply - you have to say to your partner, can we please take a break right now? And then it's very important for that person to say when they will come back to continue the conversation. The other person needs to say, sure, let's take a break, and they will feel better knowing from the other person that they will be able to continue the conversation in a certain amount of time. While you're on the break, here's another thing that's a little bit different than what you would think... TAGLE: Sure. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: ...You do not think about the fight. So what you have to do is something self-soothing during your break that calms you down. It could be just reading a book, reading a magazine, or meditating, going for a run, listening to music, anything that takes your mind off the fight so your body has a chance to metabolize all the stress hormones that have been released in your body from being in fight or flight, and your body can calm down. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: Takeaway four - it's OK to put your fight on pause - really, seriously. This one might feel hard for those of us who were raised on the phrase, never go to bed angry. But the research shows, when you're feeling overwhelmed, it's probably best to take a break. John and Julie recommend anywhere from 20 minutes up to a 24-hour pause to reset, calm down and then come back to the conflict table with a clear head. Next up - tackling the fight called the standoff. It's the kind of fight where both sides feel they have to win. But John and Julie say conflicts in relationships shouldn't have winners and losers. Here's what to do instead. You talk about an intervention in the book called the bagel method to, quote, \"help couples in conflict find a true compromise that feels good to both partners.\" Can you tell me a little bit more about the bagel method? JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Yes. So John and I really, really love bagels. Therefore, it's the bagel method. But for some of you not being familiar with bagels, you can call it the doughnut method. So here is what it looks like. If you take out a piece of paper, and you draw two concentric circles - a small one in the middle and a great big one outside that - it looks like a doughnut. In the center circle, before talking to one another, what are the things in your position on the issue that you cannot compromise on, that are so important to you, so core to your identity, to who you are, that if you gave up one of those or some of those, it would feel like you were giving up the bones of your body? But now listen. In the outer circle, this is where you put the things you're more flexible about, and those tend to be the nitty-gritty details of what you might arrive at for a compromise, like when something happens, where it happens, whose goes first, how much money do you spend, how much do you save, et cetera. How long does something last? TAGLE: Maybe your partner wants to move to sunny California, but you want to be closer to your family in Boston. Or your boyfriend wants to keep renting, but you're ready to buy a condo. Try takeaway five. If you've come to an impasse, use the bagel method. Write out what's truly non-negotiable on the inside and where you might have room in the outer circle. You might be surprised by what you find. JOHN GOTTMAN: Compromises often fail because people give up too much just for the sake of peace in the relationship, and so they don't put in those inflexible areas what's really important to them about their position on this issue. And when you give something really central up just for the sake of peace, it builds resentment, as opposed to in the bagel method, you can actually say, here's why this is so important to me; here's why I'm kind of inflexible about this; here's why that has to be part of our compromise; I have to feel like my dream is being honored in some way. And then the compromise doesn't get sabotaged in the future. TAGLE: Great distinction. So compromise is important, but it's also really important that you be true to yourself within it, that you not give up too much. JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. Exactly. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: And honor your partner's dreams as well, if you possibly can. JOHN GOTTMAN: Right. TAGLE: Our last takeaway, takeaway six - repair. Repair. Repair. This idea comes up again and again in the Gottmans' research. The couples who make it make an effort to stay connected and reduce harm to one another before, during and after a fight. That can look like a comment, a gesture, a joke. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: A repair is something that takes you right on back to the high road through saying something helpful right in that moment. JOHN GOTTMAN: Well, the thing about repair is that it needs to really be perceived as a repair by your partner. So one thing you can do that's very different is to say, I'm feeling defensive. Can you say that in a gentle way? You know, now, you're not getting defensive. You're just saying, I'm feeling defensive, or, I need to calm down, or, your point of view is very interesting; say more about it. These are all repairs that you can use. And we actually spent seven years - two graduate students of mine mostly did this, Amber Tabares and Janice Driver - studying what repairs worked and what repairs failed. Any repair you would use in a business meeting will fail in a love relationship, so things like, oh, let's consider our alternatives and evaluate them - anything that's really intellectual. But anything that's emotional, really, and self-disclosing really works much better, saying, you know, I feel like we're getting stuck; you know, tell me more about your point of view so I understand it better. TAGLE: So repair - very, very important, very critical - also, usually the most difficult part, at least if you're me, it can feel impossible to reach across the table and hold your spouse's hand after a big fight. You know, even when or maybe especially if you know it could make a big difference in that moment, right? What advice can you share with us about making and accepting repair attempts? JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: OK. So the one that you described, which is taking your partner's hand, is really extreme, and I'm right there with you, Andee. I could never do that, either. But if you've said the wrong thing, and you're aware that you've said the wrong thing, you can say as a repair, or your partner can, you know what? I just blurted that out. Let me try again. That's a repair. How about bringing in some positivity, a little bit of positivity? What John was talking about when he talked about the ratio that's so important, of five positives to one negative to make it a healthy conflict conversation, well, positives can include things like, interesting, I never thought of it that way; fair enough; good point; oh, OK; tell me more. Those are all positives. JOHN GOTTMAN: And we quote William Shakespeare here in \"Merchant Of Venice,\" where Portia says, \"the quality of mercy is not strained. It drops as the gentle rain from heaven, and it blesses both he who shows mercy and he who gives mercy.\" And the same thing with repair. Both people are blessed by a repair that's effective - the person making the repair attempt and the person receiving the repair attempt - so that if both people, you know, know about repair, then they can use it together. TAGLE: Julie, John, thank you so much for joining us today. I have learned so much. You've given me so much to work with. I really appreciate it. JOHN GOTTMAN: Thank you, Andee. JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN: Andee, this has been a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TAGLE: OK. Let's recap. The conflict in your relationship is an opportunity for connection. Here are things to remember to fight right. Takeaway one - understand your fighting style. Are you avoidant, volatile, validating? And how does that contrast with your partner's culture of conflict? Takeaway two - aim for five positive interactions for every negative interaction. That's the sweet spot for a solid relationship. Takeaway three - start soft. That three-part formula is, I feel, plus the situation and finally ask for a positive need. Takeaway four - if you're feeling flooded, put your fight on pause. Decide with your partner how long you need to cool down. Then walk away, and do anything else but think about your fight until it's time to return to the table. Takeaway five - if you need to find a compromise, try the bagel method - non-negotiables in the center, items of flexibility in the outer ring. Takeaway six - repair, repair, repair. I know - trust me; I know - just how hard it can feel to reach out to your partner in the middle of conflict, but remember; you're on the same team with the same goal of understanding each other. Offer each other grace wherever you can.

Buckle your seat belt. Use your turn signal. Stop at the red light. But there may be scenarios on the road that you feel less prepared for. What should you do if your car starts to skid on ice? If someone is being aggressive toward you on the highway? If your car falls into a body of water? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Hector Carias, an officer with the California Highway Patrol, explains what to do in these emergency situations. The key is to stay vigilant, he says. \"Driving should take 100% of your concentration, 100% of the time. Being defensive behind the vehicle can only bring positive outcomes.\" Motor vehicle crashes are  a leading cause of death  in the United States, killing more than 120 people everyday, according to 2022 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But they are preventable. Carias, who works out of CHP's Central Division office in Fresno, Calif., shares his top road safety do's and don'ts. 1. DON'T speed.  It can make it harder to avoid potential hazards on the road, and it can make car crashes more severe, Carias says. If someone is tailgating you, \"move over one lane and let them pass. There's no reason for you to speed up.\" 2. DO call 911 if you're being threatened by another driver . \"If someone is brandishing a firearm or a car has been following you, contact 911,\" Carias says. Don't engage. Officers will send help. If they can't get to your location on the highway, \"Don't stop. Our dispatch will stay on the phone with you and give you directions to a designated location, where an officer will try to meet you.\"  3. DON'T slam the brakes if you have engine trouble on the highway.  If your car stalls or runs out of gas on the road, put your hazard lights on right away and release the accelerator, Carias says. \"Try to veer to the right shoulder of the freeway and come to a safe stop,\" then call roadside assistance or 911.  4. DO hop into the passenger seat while waiting for help in the right shoulder lane.  It can be safer than sitting in the driver's seat. You want to position yourself as far away from traffic as possible. And buckle up, Carias says. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       5. DO get as far away from your car as possible if you see smoke or flames coming out of the engine.  In the event of a car fire, pull over, turn off the engine and move yourself at least 100 feet away from the burning vehicle,  according to  the U.S. Fire Administration. Don't try to fight the fire. 6. DO slow down in extreme rainy conditions.  \"Give yourself more time to be reactive\" to road hazards, Carias says. And turn on your headlights.   Rain can make it hard to see the road and for other drivers to see you. \"I have a little saying that goes, 'if your wipers are going, your headlights are glowing.'\" 7. DON'T accelerate or slam the brakes if you're skidding on ice.  \"Once you've already started sliding, you're kind of going along for the ride,\" Carias says. Cautiously turn your wheel in the direction you want the car to go, and straighten the wheel as you feel the car straighten out,  according to AAA . \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       8. DON'T turn on your high beams in heavy fog.  \"Fog is essentially water molecules. Shining bright light at those molecules is just going to reflect that light back to you and make it harder to see,\" Carias says. Instead, turn on your headlights and fog lamps if you have them. 9. DO unbuckle your seatbelt and start to roll down the windows the moment your car falls into a body of water.  \"Don't try to open the door,\" Carias says. Once a vehicle is more fully submerged, the pressure from the water against the windows and doors  can make it difficult to open them .  Escape through the open window and exit to safety. If you can't roll down the window, \"do your best to shatter the window using your elbow or whatever you can,\" Carias says. For peace of mind, purchase a window punch to keep in your car. 10. DO keep emergency supplies in your car.  That includes a first aid kit, water, jumper cables, a flashlight and blankets, Carias says. AAA  also recommends  keeping a basic set of tools and road flares or reflectors.  This episode was produced by Margaret Cirino. The digital story was edited by Meghan Keane.

However, not all women are candidates due to pre-existing medical conditions such as breast or uterine cancer, heart disease, or clot risk. Newer formulations—such as transdermal delivery and micronized progesterone—are considered safer than older methods. While local, low-dose vaginal estrogen has negligible risks and may safely have its black box warning removed, systemic estrogen (like pills) still requires careful consideration.

things to know \n         By Allison Aubrey \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n           Heard on  All Things Considered \n        \n      \n\n         Women should not suffer through menopause with hot flashes, night sweats and poor sleep. That's the message from FDA Commissioner  Dr. Marty Makary. The agency announced it will remove \"black box\" warning labels from estrogen-based hormone therapy, which treat the symptoms of menopause, saying the warnings have made women scared to try the therapy and doctors reluctant to prescribe it.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The warnings stem from the early 2000s when data from the  Women's Health Initiative study  found hormone therapy increased risks of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and breast cancer. But, women in that study were given a type of hormone therapy formulation that is no longer commonly used. And the average age of women in the study was 63, which is now considered too late to start hormone therapy. Now, experts say there's a lot more known about safe and effective combinations, when therapy is initiated earlier. \"If you're under age 60 or within ten years of menopause onset, when you start hormone therapy, you're going to see improvements in hot flashes, sweats, fewer sleep disruptions, \" says  Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton , a menopause expert at the University of Virginia Health.  She also points to protection against bone loss and fractures, as well as potential benefits for heart health, brain fog and overall quality of life. \"When it's dosed appropriately, hormone therapy can be given safely and have multiple benefits,\" she says. But here's an important reality check: \"Not all women can take hormone therapy,\" Pinkerton says. She says some women have medical conditions or symptoms that can make hormone therapy risky. \"It's really important that women have a discussion with an informed health care provider because you want to know what are the benefits and risks for you,\" Pinkerton says. So, here are some things to consider when talking to your healthcare provider about hormone therapy for menopause. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       1. When should you start hormone therapy?  Experts recommend starting estrogen therapy before the age of 60 or within ten years of the start of menopause — which begins one year after your last period. Many women remain on birth control through perimenopause, which can help with hot flashes and night sweats as hormones fluctuate.  Once you're through the menopause transition and you don't need pregnancy prevention, then it doesn't make as much sense to use birth control, Pinkerton says, because it's typically stronger than the amount of estrogen used in menopause hormone therapy, so that's a good time to talk to your provider about hormone therapy options. 2. How long should you be on hormone therapy? In general, women stay on hormone therapy for three to five years, but that's not a hard and fast rule.  \"For women who have persistent symptoms or bone loss — which can be treated with hormone therapy — we will continue it,\" Pinkerton says. But, it's important to keep assessing each year. \"It's about working with the patient to come up with what's safest and best,\" Pinkerton says. \"We don't take someone off [hormone therapy] just because it's been three to five years, \" says Lauren Streicher of Northwestern University. She points to differences in how long menopause symptoms persist, noting that Black and Hispanic women tend to  experience symptoms for longer    time periods. 3. How has hormone therapy changed? Science has  evolved over the last 20 years , since the results of the Women's Health Initiative came out. And, importantly, there's been a shift in how estrogen is administered, as well as new formulations of hormones. For instance, many women are now prescribed patches instead of pills. \"We know that oral therapy can slightly increase the risk of blood clots and stroke,\" Pinkerton says, so providers often opt for transdermal therapy for women at risk of these conditions. Transdermal patches, gels or rings deliver estrogen that is absorbed directly through the skin which research shows can  lower the risk  of blood clots. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Also, women enrolled in the WHI study were given synthetic progestin which was linked to an increased breast cancer risk. But, now doctors can prescribe   micronized progesterone  that has fewer side effects. Micronized progesterone is  a bioidentical hormone  with a molecular structure identical to the endogenous progesterone produced in the ovaries. 4. Do all estrogen products carry the same risks? No. Local estrogen, such as low-dose vaginal creams, target symptoms such as vaginal dryness, painful sex, bladder control and reduced risk of urinary tract infections. This is different from systemic estrogen, delivered through pills, patches or gels. Systemic estrogen is a higher-dose treatment that circulates throughout the body to address symptoms including hot flashes and night sweats, and can carry a higher risk of side effects. \"I think most would agree that with local, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy that the risks are negligible,\" says  Dr. Monica Christmas , director of the Menopause Program at the University of Chicago. \"For local, vaginal estrogen, it's reasonable to remove the black box warning. I don't think we need to scare people unnecessarily,\" Christmas says. However, for higher dose, systemic estrogen therapy — which is absorbed into the blood stream — including estrogen pills, Christmas and other menopause experts are more equivocal about removing the black box warning.  \"It provides a pause,\" Christmas says, and prompts patients to discuss the risks with their providers.\" 5. Who should avoid hormone therapy?  Some women have medical conditions that can make hormone therapy more risky. This includes women with estrogen sensitive breast or uterine cancer, and women who are at high risk for or have had a heart attack, stroke, blood clot, or pulmonary embolism. \"It's really important that women have a discussion with an informed health care provider because you want to know what are the benefits and risks for you,\" Pinkerton says 6. Are there alternatives for women who don't  want to take hormone therapy? The Food and Drug Administration has approved two non-hormonal medications to treat severe hot flashes in menopause. According to the FDA, about 80% of menopausal women experience hot flashes which can include  sweating, flushing and chills  that last for several minutes. Lynkuet , which was approved last month, and  Veozah , which was approved in 2023, are both oral medications that work by  targeting the neural activity  that causes hot flashes during menopause. Lynkuet has been shown to reduce the severity and frequencies of hot flashes.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The National Institutes of Health has  tips for managing symptoms,  including limiting alcohol and caffeine, and maintaining a healthy body weight. And early-stage research shows hypnotherapy and mindfulness meditation may help manage hot flashes. Some people find herbal remedies helpful.   A study of medicinal plants  including sage, lemon balm, red clover and licorice finds they may be effective in the treatment of menopausal symptoms like hot flashes. \n         \n         Transcript \n         STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   The FDA is removing warning labels from estrogen products used to treat menopause. The agency says the warnings about increased risks of heart attack, strokes, blood clots and breast cancer are outdated and misleading. NPR's Allison Aubrey reports. ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: For years, women have heard mostly about the risks of hormone therapy, and many doctors have been hesitant to prescribe it because of the FDA's black box warnings. But menopause experts say it's now clear that there are safe combinations and doses. Here's Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton of the University of Virginia. JOANN PINKERTON: If you're under age 60 or within 10 years of menopause onset when you start hormone therapy, you're going to see improvements in hot flashes, sweats, fewer sleep disruptions. AUBREY: As well as protections against bone loss and fractures and potential benefits for heart health, brain fog and quality of life. PINKERTON: Hormone therapy, when it's dosed appropriately, can be given safely and have multiple benefits, but not all women can take it. AUBREY: Dr. Pinkerton says some women have medical conditions that can make taking hormone therapy more risky. PINKERTON: So that's an estrogen-sensitive breast or uterine cancer, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolisms. And, you know, it's really important that women have a discussion with an informed health care provider 'cause you want to know what are the benefits and risks for you. AUBREY: The black box warnings were based on data from studies, including the Women's Health Initiative, that pointed to cancer and blood clot risks. But the science has evolved a lot over the last 20 years, and importantly, there's been a shift in how estrogen is administered and new formulations making it lower risk. For instance, many women are now prescribed patches instead of pills. PINKERTON: Now we know that oral therapy does slightly increase the risk of blood clots and stroke. So if you have women who have risk factors or are older, you want to think about doing transdermal therapy. AUBREY: Transdermal patches, gels or rings can deliver estrogen directly through the skin, which may lower the risk of clots. And instead of giving women synthetic progestin, as was given in the Women's Health Initiative study and was linked to an increased breast cancer risk, doctors can now prescribe alternatives, such as micronized progesterone, which is identical to what's produced naturally in the body and has fewer side effects. Now, many menopause experts support the FDA's decision to remove warning labels from some estrogen products, but they don't all carry the same risks, explains Dr. Monica Christmas of the University of Chicago. She says many women benefit from estrogen creams for painful sex, bladder control and reduced risk of urinary tract infections. MONICA CHRISTMAS: I think most would agree that with local, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy that the risks are negligible for most people. So I do think for the local vaginal estrogen, it is reasonable to remove that black box warning. I don't think we need to scare people unnecessarily. AUBREY: However, for higher-dose, systemic estrogen therapy, including estrogen pills, Christmas and other menopause experts are more equivocal about removing the warnings. CHRISTMAS: One of the nice things about the black box warning is that it does provide that pause. It allows patients to want to ask their health care provider what the black box warning means, what potential risks there may be and what the safety is. AUBREY: Women should not have to suffer with menopause symptoms, and Christmas says there are many options, including nonhormonal alternatives. She recommends talking to health care providers to help decide what's best.

women join the army to fight Russia \n         By Joanna Kakissis, Tetiana Burianova, Polina Lytvynova \n        \n           Tuesday, November 11, 2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         KYIV and KHARKIV, Ukraine — Maryna Mytsiuk spends her free time at a shooting range outside Kyiv, hyper-focused on hitting her targets. She's got to practice. She's waiting for a call that, any day, will send her to war. \"Of course, I'd like to be in a combat position,\" said Mytsiuk, a 27-year-old folklore scholar who speaks Japanese and works at a nonprofit. \"With my build and height, I'm not a natural fit for that … so I'm training very hard.\" She is among a growing number of Ukrainian women joining the military as Russia's full-scale war on the country nears its fourth year, and troops remain in short supply. This comes as an end to the fighting appears no closer than it was when President Trump took office in January vowing to quickly broker peace. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Mytsiuk said the Ukrainian military has become much more receptive to women since the early days of the full-scale invasion, when Ukrainian men were lining up at recruitment centers to become soldiers. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She wanted to sign up, too, but was told she would be best off in the kitchen, she said, \"where I could make dumplings.\" Mytsiuk, however, plowed ahead. She enrolled at a military university for a second degree, graduating this summer. She looked into several brigades and applied to those with special forces units. She had difficult conversations with her mother and her boyfriend, a soldier. Both strongly oppose her decision. \"I see women my age getting married, having children,\" she said. \"I can't help having thoughts, like am I doing the right thing? But there's no turning back now.\" Sooner or later, she said, she believes everyone in Ukraine who is able to will have to fight, especially with no ceasefire deal on the horizon. Soldiers by choice Men between the ages of 25 and 60 can be drafted in Ukraine, but women are exempt. \"We are volunteers choosing to fight,\" Mytsiuk says. Ukraine's military  says  more than 70,000 women were serving in the country's armed forces as of January. Oksana Hryhorieva, the military's gender adviser, says though that's only about 8% of the country's total armed forces, the number of women has risen 40% since 2021. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"Until parliament passed a 2018 law,\" she said, \"the military was patriarchal, and women were not legally allowed to serve in combat positions or study all disciplines at military universities.\" Women who joined battalions when Russia invaded parts of eastern and southern Ukraine in 2014 did fight on the front line but were classified as noncombatants. \"For example,\" Hryhorieva said, \"we had biathletes who were great snipers, but according to their documents, they were cooks. It was totally unfair.\" Now, she says, women make up about 20% of military cadets and thousands are officially serving in combat positions. They include  fighter pilots ,  artillery commanders , drone operators and engineers. NPR met several women serving in various military units this year. Some brigades, including Khartiia and Azov, which are both part of Ukraine's National Guard, feature women in their advertising campaigns. In one popular Azov  recruitment video  released this summer, two dads in a car shop talk about their kids. One says his son is trying to find a job at a critical enterprise to exempt him from military service. The other says he has a daughter — and she's a soldier. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       The Khartiia 13th National Guard Brigade,  founded  by a Ukrainian billionaire in early 2022 as a volunteer battalion, is based in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. It's well-resourced and an innovator in robotic warfare.  \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       This spring, the brigade launched a female-centered recruitment campaign  featuring  a soldier in the ground robotic systems division named Jess. She is shown on a field, a white ribbon tying back her red hair, testing land drones that are used to deliver water, food, fuel and ammunition to soldiers in front-line positions. \"I am the only woman in this unit,\" she says. \"I am 21 years old.\" The drone operators \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       At a Khartiia camp in northeastern Ukraine earlier this year, two drone pilots — Yevheniia and Dasha — examined newly assembled first-person view (FPV) drones at a small hut with a 3D printer. The scent of shorn wood, metal and instant coffee wafts through the air. NPR is using only the drone pilots' first names and call signs at the request of the Ukrainian military, which cited security concerns. Yevhenia, 19, resembles Arya Stark from  Game of Thrones . She uses the military call sign \"Furia,\" after the ancient Greco-Roman goddesses who punished evildoers for their sins. She said male soldiers often ask her: What are you doing here? \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"And I say, I have to be here, and that's that,\" she said. \"And why drones?\" she added. \"I think because I love to play computer games.\" She and Dasha were among three women in an FPV drone unit of 15. Dasha, 23, is tall and stern. She uses the call sign \"Galactica.\" She was briefly married and, before the war, was making plans to become a police officer. Dasha said her mother wept when she left for basic training. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"My mother wanted me to stay at home, be a wife, have children,\" Dasha said. \"And I chose what she calls a man's profession, living with a constant threat on my life.\" Another drone operator in the unit is in a muddy field a short drive from camp. Daria is a former software engineer in her early 30s. She is testing a new aerial drone as the sun sets. \"A lot of my relatives don't even know I'm here,\" she said. \"They say, 'She needs to go to Europe and be in some safe place.'\" Daria volunteered as a humanitarian worker in the early days of the full-scale invasion, working 20 hours a day shuttling food and other supplies to front-line areas. She never felt like she was doing enough. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I'm Ukrainian, I'm a part of this country, and I need to help,\" she said. She learned how to assemble and fly first-person-view drones, which are outfitted with video cameras and guidance systems controlled remotely. Some brigades told her there weren't many jobs for \"girls\" but Khartiia welcomed her drone skills. \"Here,\" she said, \"they knew what to do with me.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       She said she has lost touch with many friends since joining the military. Male friends have fled the country to avoid the draft. She said she has struggled not to judge them. \"It's their choice,\" she said, frowning. \"They can do what they want to do. I can't say, 'Everybody needs to be like me.' Though I want [to], honestly.\" The medic Earlier this year in the city of Sumy, also in northeastern Ukraine, a combat medic who had just left the front line walked into a beauty salon. Olena Ivanenko, who goes by the call sign \"Ryzh,\" was exhausted. She slumped in a plush chair, then closed her eyes as a beautician shaped her eyebrows, then polished her nails. \"I know that in three days my nails will be grimy again,\" she said. \"But looking at clean nails for one day gives me such relief and pleasure. For me, it's as routine as breakfast.\" Ryzh is 44 and ran restaurants before joining the military in 2023. She was with the 47th Mechanized Brigade before joining 412 Nemesis, a brigade in Ukraine's unmanned systems, this year. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \"I decided after three months of service that I would stay in the army forever,\" she said. \"I will not return to civilian life. I feel very comfortable here. I feel like I am 100,000, million percent in my place.\" Her service has also brought considerable heartbreak. She calls them \"the dark dates.\" In one battle in 2023, many in her unit died, including one of her closest friends. \"He was the first to get blown up,\" she said, \"and I pulled him out of the dugout. This is probably the hardest thing for me in the whole war so far.\" Ryzh herself was wounded in the leg after a Russian tank fired at her. (She has since recovered.) She said she speaks a lot to civilians about what soldiers face on the front line. She has noticed the divide between soldiers and civilians growing. \"Soldiers say we are working for victory, and civilians say we want peace,\" she said. \"But peace and victory are different things.\" The military intelligence analyst At a Kyiv exhibition hall this spring, Ukraine's military intelligence unveiled state-of-the-art sea drones — and three members of the elite unit that operate them. A  Ukrainian cover  of the song \"Sonne\" by the German gothic metal band Rammstein blared as the soldiers strode onto the stage. They appeared in disguise, in balaclavas and sunglasses. When they spoke through microphones, their voices were distorted for security reasons. One was Xena, like the warrior-princess of the 1990s TV series. A version of these sea drones, equipped with rockets and machine guns,  downed  a Russian fighter jet in the Black Sea earlier this year. \"Our challenge,\" Xena said, \"is to lure the Russians out of their bases and then hunt them. We intend to keep adapting these sea drones until we can target and hit Russian fighter jets, helicopters and ships under any conditions.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Xena has been a military analyst for a decade and joined this elite unit after the full-scale invasion, which has fueled a rapid innovation of weapons in Ukraine. She said she's used to being the only woman on her team. \"And it's not easy,\" she said. \"I do feel support from my guys, but sometimes they can act like kids, you know? They see my support role as bringing them cookies or tea — or something like that.\" She laughed into her balaclava and said she has more important things to worry about, like staying alive. \"Motivation helps,\" she said. \"Motivation to win this war.\" A death, and a new life In early September, a large crowd filled St. Michael's domed cathedral in Kyiv for a soldier's funeral. As a military band played, pallbearers carried out the coffin past mourners kneeling in respect. The family clutched a framed portrait of the fallen soldier: a smiling young woman with wire-rimmed glasses. Daria Lopatina, 19, was an engineer with the special forces of the Azov brigade. She had dropped out of the Kyiv School of Economics to defend Ukraine. Saluting her coffin was Ruslan Shelar, who works at the Defense Ministry with Lopatina's father. Shelar said he has noticed more women enlisting, especially those under 25. He points out Lopatina was 8 years old when Russia backed paramilitaries to seize parts of eastern Ukraine and illegally annex Crimea in 2014 — before the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. \"She grew up with war,\" he said, \"surrounded by people who had taken part in it. Her path was set.\" Ukraine's armed forces do not disclose Ukrainian casualty figures, so it's unclear how many female soldiers have died. The stakes are clear to Maryna Mytsiuk, the new recruit in Kyiv waiting for her military assignment. \"I constantly think about it, about death,\" she said. \"But it's better to die on the battlefield than from a missile hitting your apartment in Kyiv. Better to die fighting than die on your knees.\" Olena Lysenko and Hanna Palamarenko contributed reporting from Kyiv. \n      \n"},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5435668","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-02","timeOfPublication":"05:00:00-04:00","title":"Want Fewer Morning Aches?

You might need to change the way you sleep \n         By Andee Tagle \n        \n           Thursday, October 2, 2025 • 5:00 AM EDT \n        \n        \n      \n\n         Ever wake up with a sore lower back or achy shoulders that just ruin the rest of your day? Or get up from bed and try to greet the morning, only to find your neck is too stiff to turn to the window? Morning muscle pain along your spine is often the result of hours of improper support while sleeping, says  Ellen Wermter , a nurse practitioner who runs  Restorative Sleep Medicine , a sleep clinic in Virginia. One easy way to guard against it, say medical experts, is to focus on your sleep posture. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Sleeping in an awkward position tends to create gaps between your body and your pillow or mattress, Wermter says. \"Your soft tissue is going to want to sag into those gaps, and the muscles tense to make up for that\" in order to protect against potential injury. Over the course of a night, that muscle tension can cause inflammation and pain, Wermter says — and bad sleep from all that tossing and turning to find a more comfortable position. Whether you sleep on your back, side or stomach, experts share advice for those looking to minimize morning aches and pains. Sleep the same way you stand  The best defense against an achy neck or back   in the morning is to sleep just like you stand, Wermter says.   When you sleep in a position that follows the natural curvature of your spine, it reduces the possibility of muscle strain. While lying down, your body should form a straight line from the top of your head to your tailbone. Wermter suggests placing   your ears over your shoulders and your shoulders over your hips. Point   your chin straight ahead, not tucked into your chest or stretched up toward the sky. Aim for symmetry with your arms for proper circulation. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       If you're a back sleeper, this tip will be easier to follow. But if you're a side or stomach sleeper, you may need to adjust your sleep space for better spinal alignment — or even train yourself to sleep in this position, Wermter says. Avoid sleeping on your stomach  While this position can open up airways for struggling snorers, it's often associated with its potential downsides, Wermter says. That includes neck, back and shoulder aches, and fragmented sleep from switching positions more often throughout the night. When you sleep on your stomach, it's easy to overextend your neck, she says. Creating breathing room for yourself often pulls your neck out of that ideal spinal alignment. Choose the right pillow for your head   It's important to rest your head on something that supports your spine and promotes maximum restfulness at night, says  Dr. Fabian Morales , a sports medicine physician. Back sleepers:  Morales suggests a pillow with medium firmness and loft, or something with an ergonomic design. \"A good orthopedic pillow designed to support the curvature of the neck can minimize your risk of neck pain down the line. It reduces pressure on the neck and supports alignment,\" he says. Side sleepers:  To find a pillow with the right loft for side sleeping, \"measure from the bend of your neck to the edge of your shoulder,\" Wermter says. The ideal pillow will support your head without pushing your head and neck further up. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Stomach sleepers:  If you're stuck on stomach sleeping, Wermter says it might be best to go without a pillow to avoid extra strain on your neck. If you do need some cushion, aim for low-loft options to keep your spine aligned. Replace your pillows every few years or as soon as you notice your pillow starts to lack support, Morales says. Pillows hold on to dirt and dust — and they lose their structure over time, which can lead to aches and pains. Support any gaps with smaller pillows  When your spine isn't properly supported, pain is likely to follow, Wermter says. That's why it's important to align and cradle the entire length of your spine — not just your head and neck — to make up for any gaps between your body and the mattress. Use smaller pillows or even rolled up blankets or towels. Back sleepers:  Be mindful of any gaps at the small of your back or under your knees, which can be a source of lower back pain. Add support to those areas as needed, Wermter says. Side sleepers:  Many side sleepers like placing a small pillow between the knees or hugging a body pillow to align the hips and reduce pressure in the hips and lower back, she says. Stomach sleepers:  Wermter says just sleeping on a flat surface is fine for stomach sleepers, but some may find that a thin pillow under the hips and stomach can reduce strain on the back. Opt for a mattress that's not too soft and not too firm  Evaluate the quality of your mattress and replace your bed every seven years at most, says Wermter. If a mattress is too soft, the heavier parts of your body can sink and your spine will likely get out of alignment. If a mattress is too firm, it can create those pain-inducing gaps between body and bed. Try other pain relief remedies  What should you do if you have a great sleep setup and you still wake up with an achy back or a crick in your neck? It's a very common experience, especially as we age and our spines experience more wear and tear, says  Dr. Charla Fischer,  an   orthopedic spine surgeon at NYU Langone Health. That kind of muscle pain can be, well, a pain in the neck — but is usually not cause for major concern. Consult a medical professional if you have consistent pain for a week or more; experience numbness, tingling or weakness in the neck, arms or hands; or if you just have concerns, Fischer says. Otherwise, don't forget the power of basic pain relief remedies. Take  over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication , massage the area, do gentle stretches, or place ice or heating packs in 20- to 30-minute bouts on your body. Don't underestimate the power of a hot shower, she says. \"It can go a long way in calming down those unhappy muscles.\" This story was edited by Malaka Gharib. The visual editor is Beck Harlan.

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) often finds himself at odds with his party. He's unapologetically  pro-Israel  at a time when fewer members of Democrats are. He spent the fall railing against the  federal government shutdown  and he, along with a few other Senate Democrats, broke from the party and struck a deal with Republicans. \"It's always been wrong for us to shut the government down,\" he told NPR. \"Rightly, [Democrats] criticize the Republicans when they've shut the government down. It's wrong. It's reckless.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In an interview with  All Things Considered  host Scott Detrow, Fetterman posed a question to his critics: \"What exactly am I guilty of?\" \"I suffered from depression and I made a recovery and I won an election,\" he said. \"And I went on to be an unapologetic supporter of Israel. And I happen to think that we have to have a secure border and I think it's wrong to shut our government down.\" Fetterman spoke with NPR in a conversation tied to his new memoir,  Unfettered , about his 2022 Senate campaign that saw him suffer a stroke and fall into a deep depression. The interview text below has been edited for length and clarity. Interview highlights Scott Detrow:  This is a book about an election cycle where you suffered a stroke and you struggled with serious depression. Sen. John Fetterman:  Profound depression. Honestly, I know millions of Americans suffer from it. And when you hear the expression that you can't get out of your bed — that's true. Detrow:  Last time I interviewed you, you had just returned to the Senate from Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center]. It was a pretty emotional conversation. You were still processing your treatment and what came next. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       I wanted to ask a little bit about that because there's parts of this book where it seems like you're saying that you've, at times, regretted being so open about your mental health struggles. Is that accurate? Fetterman:  No. I don't regret it. But people have been willing to use it or to create an impression that's just not true. And it's an honest conversation because a lot of people have had those things. And I've had a lot of people reach out to me over the years since and it's an honor to speak to people, to their experience, because sometimes people can feel alone. And I've always wanted to make that conversation as simple as it can to just stay in this game. Because I've had people in my life make the decision to leave. And that's not a fail, they didn't fail. But that's a decision that they can't come back [from]. And how heartbreaking that is and how sad that is. Detrow:  You're talking about suicide. Fetterman:  Yeah, absolutely. It's not a weakness. And that's [I want to be] a voice saying, \"hey, look, that's a lie. I don't know what your recovery looks like, but as long as you stay in it, I promise you you will get better.\" Detrow:  I want to ask about Israel. You were very out front about [supporting Israel]. You never changed your tune. I'm wondering, as the Israeli attacks and bombing of Gaza continued, were there any points where you second guessed the place that you had staked yourself? Fetterman:  [Israel] had an opportunity to take out the Iranian nuclear facilities. I was the only Democrat that supported that. I was actually charging for those things. You know, that comes from Trump. Well, then I happen to agree with it. And now, can you imagine if they would have acquired a nuclear weapon there? And now what is behind this constant violence there? Is it Israel or it's because Iran funding these proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah doing these kinds of terrible things. And that war would have ended when you sent back all the hostages. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Detrow:  So, at no point in the conflict did the balance shift for you as you thought about this in the context of 69,000 Palestinians dead? Fetterman : No one breaks down how many actual Hamas fighters or other people that were involved in that. So, we're not really sure. The only time you see members in Hamas is when they're handing over funerals and rallying. Otherwise, they embed themselves in the civilians and they were forced to fight a war through an urban situation. Why can't people condemn putting tunnels under hospitals and embedding themselves in where civilians are? And you know, because they can't fight a real war. So, that's why they use civilians as human shields. And that's the tragedy.

2025-11-11T05:07:05+00:00\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday extended an order blocking full SNAP payments, amid signals that the government shutdown could soon end and food aid payments resume. The order keeps in place at least for a few more days a chaotic situation. People who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed their families in some states have received their full monthly allocations, while others have received nothing. The order, which is three sentences long and comes with no explanation on the court’s thinking, will expire just before midnight Thursday. The Senate has approved a bill to end the shutdown and the House of Representatives could vote on it as early as Wednesday. Reopening the government would restart the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, but it’s not clear how quickly full payments would resume. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on Ruling follows path of least legal resistance The justices chose what is effectively the path of least resistance, anticipating the federal government shutdown will end soon while avoiding any substantive legal ruling about whether lower court orders to keep full payments flowing during the shutdown are correct. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only one of the nine justices to say she would have revived the lower court orders immediately, but didn’t otherwise explain her vote. Jackson signed the initial order temporarily freezing the payments. The court’s action doesn’t do anything to settle uncertainty across the country. Beneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments. How quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it’s easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones. Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount. An urgent need for beneficiaries In Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday. Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year. That stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what’s left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen. “It’s kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,” Malliard said. “To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.” The political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help . “I figure that I’ve spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,” said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a “little food pantry” in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York. SNAP has been the center of an intense fight in court The Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for about 1 in 8 Americans. The administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to pause that order in a ruling late Sunday. An appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume , and that requirement was set to kick in Tuesday night before the top court extended the order blocking full SNAP payments. Congressional talks about reopening government The U.S. Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans. President Donald Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it “looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending.” Still, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn’t be up to the courts. “The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. “The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.” After Tuesday’s ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media: “Thank you to the Court for allowing Congress to continue its swift progress.” The coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion. “The chaos was sown by USDA’s delays and intransigence,” they said, “not by the district court’s efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.” ___ Associated Press reporter Cara Anna in Carthage, New York, contributed."},{"source":"https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5462829","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"10:01:00-05:00","title":"The Supreme Court Will Hear a Challenge to Grace Periods for Mail Ballot Returns","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging state mail ballot grace periods, with Mississippi at the center of the legal dispute.

it will hear a case that could decide whether states can count postmarked mail ballots that arrive after Election Day — something that about 20 states and territories currently allow. Mississippi is one of those states, and in June, its top election official  asked the court  to hear a lawsuit filed by the Republican National Committee that argues the state's five-day mail ballot grace period violates federal law. An appeals court sided with the RNC. The ruling, which came while voters were casting ballots in last year's presidential election, did not go into effect immediately. Sixteen states plus Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C. , currently accept and count mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day — typically, only if those ballots are postmarked on or before Election Day. More states have grace periods like that just for military and overseas voters. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       States provide this wiggle room to voters in case they forget to return their mail ballots ahead of time, if there are issues with the postal service, or if there are other unforeseen issues like bad weather and natural disasters. The GOP has argued that Congress alone — not states — has the right to decide when elections end, and that Congress established a uniform Election Day. The RNC filed multiple legal challenges to various state grace period laws ahead of the 2024 election, including in the swing state of Nevada. Since then,  GOP-led states including Utah have eliminated their mail ballot grace periods , and President Trump has  sought to end them nationally via executive order . During the 2024 election, hundreds of thousands of mail ballots were counted that were received by officials after Election Day. In Washington state, for instance, where the vast majority of voters cast mail ballots, officials  reported  that \"more than 250,000 Washington ballots postmarked on time arrived after Election Day.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       Joyce Vance, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law,  told NPR last year  that Republicans are \"trying to set up a possible rule for the future where only ballots that are cast and counted on Election Day count,\" which she said made more sense for voting patterns a hundred years ago. \"It doesn't reflect the modern reality where we have early voting days and have mail-in voting days precisely to accommodate the fact that not everybody can get away during normal business hours on a Tuesday to vote,\" she said. The Mississippi case becomes the third related to voting taken up by the Supreme Court this term. Justices are considering another mail-ballot case that centers on  whether candidates have standing to sue over voting regulations , and  a high-profile challenge to the Voting Rights Act . \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/britain-bbc-crisis-trump-panorama-a392fb275af25216ea23537c6f4347e4","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:17:25+00:00","title":"Trump Threatens Legal Action Against BBC Over Edited Speech","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC over the editing of a Jan. 6, 2021 speech, where a key portion was spliced to imply a call for violent action.

updates on President Donald Trump and his administration LONDON (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC over the way a speech he made was edited in a documentary aired by Britain’s national broadcaster. BBC chairman Samir Shah on Monday apologized for the “error of judgment,” which triggered the resignations of the BBC’s top executive and its head of news. Director-General Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness quit Sunday over accusations of bias and misleading editing of a speech Trump delivered on Jan. 6, 2021, before a crowd of his supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington. The hourlong documentary — titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” — was broadcast as part of the BBC’s “Panorama” series days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. Shah said the broadcaster accepted “that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.” Related Stories President Trump’s granddaughter, Kai Trump, has brought buzz to an LPGA tournament 3 MIN READ Schumer faces criticism as shutdown nears end, but his job appears safe 5 MIN READ AP Interview: Newsom says Trump climate-fighting absence is ‘doubling down on stupid’ 5 MIN READ A letter from Trump attorney Alejandro Brito demands the BBC “retract the false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements,” apologize and “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused,” or face legal action for $1 billion in damages. The BBC said it would review the letter “and respond directly in due course.” Top executives quit Trump had earlier welcomed the resignations of the two BBC executives. He posted a link to a Daily Telegraph story about the speech-editing on his Truth Social network, thanking the newspaper “for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” He called that “a terrible thing for Democracy!” In a resignation letter to staff, Davie said: “There have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility.” Turness said the controversy was damaging the BBC, and she quit “because the buck stops with me.” She defended the organization’s journalists against allegations of bias. “Our journalists are hardworking people who strive for impartiality, and I will stand by their journalism,” she said Monday. “There is no institutional bias. Mistakes are made, but there’s no institutional bias.” Trump speech edited Pressure on the broadcaster’s top executives has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph published parts of a dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. As well as the Trump edit, it criticized the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. The “Panorama” episode showed an edited clip from the January 2021 speech in which Trump claimed the 2020 presidential election had been rigged. Trump is shown saying: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” According to video and a transcript from Trump’s comments that day , he said:  “I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. “Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.” Trump used the “fight like hell” phrase toward the end of the speech, but without referencing the Capitol. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said. In a letter to Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Shah said the purpose of editing Trump’s words had been “to convey the message of the speech” so that viewers could understand how it had been received by Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground. He said the program had not attracted “significant audience feedback” when it first aired but had drawn more than 500 complaints since Prescott’s dossier was made public. Shah acknowledged in a BBC interview that “it would have been better to have acted earlier. But we didn’t.” A national institution The 103-year-old BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters — and criticism from its commercial rivals — because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households who watch live TV or any BBC content. The broadcaster is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed. It’s frequently a political football, with conservatives seeing a leftist slant in its news output and some liberals accusing it of having a conservative bias. It has also been criticized from all angles over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. In February, the BBC removed a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of an official in the Hamas-led government. Governments of both left and right have long been accused of meddling with the broadcaster, which is overseen by a board that includes both BBC nominees and government appointees. Some defenders of the BBC allege that members of the board appointed under previous Conservative governments have been undermining the corporation from within. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesman, Tom Wells, said the center-left Labour Party government supports “a strong, independent BBC” and doesn’t think the broadcaster is biased. “But it is important that the BBC acts to maintain trust and corrects mistakes quickly when they occur,” he said. ___ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed from Washington."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/maine-platner-tattoo-election-4d3ca54926361449a16a770cce6082aa","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"13:46:40+00:00","title":"Graham Platner Faces Public Scrutiny Over Nazi Symbol Tattoo in Maine Senate Race","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Graham Platner, a first-time Democratic candidate running for a U.S. Senate seat in Maine, faced intense scrutiny after discovering that a tattoo he received while serving in Croatia in the early 2000s featured a skull and crossbones design, widely recognized as a Nazi symbol.

Ostberg, a self-proclaimed “baby tattooer” who has been licensed to ink for just two years, was eager to help. For Ostberg, the request wasn’t abnormal — covering up a design is a common practice in the tattoo world — and Platner’s willingness to take action when learning about the image’s connection to Nazis was reflective of the friend Ostberg had known for years.

2025 • 5:00 AM EST \n        \n        \n      \n\n         The set-up for a typical Jesse Welles video is simple: the 32-year-old stands in an open field under a string of powerlines, clutching an acoustic guitar. From behind a tousled, curly mop of hair, he stares straight into the camera and starts singing. \"If you're in need of a gig that'll help you feel big, come with me and put some folks in detention,\" he deadpans in one song, a scathing critique of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. \"We can sneak around town, hunting working folks down, I hear they get a great benefit plan.\" \"Join ICE\" is just one of the dozens of songs Welles routinely shares on social media. They're often short and satirical tunes, riding on his coarse voice and fingerpicked guitar strings, that respond to the major headlines of the week. They challenge the narratives presented to Americans by governments and corporations; they draw historical parallels and unearth underlying tensions that lead people to blame one another for institutional injustices. On the Internet, Jesse Welles' songs are major hits. Thousands of people flock to the comments, calling him a modern day  Bob Dylan  or  Woody Guthrie . Since he started regularly posting clips last year, Welles has amassed more than 3 million followers on TikTok and Instagram combined, not to mention his over 600,000 YouTube subscribers. The Recording Academy has also taken notice; last week, Welles  received  four Grammy nominations in the folk and Americana categories. He's become one of the most visible examples of a new generation of digital-savvy artists bringing folk traditions to a modern medium. \"We've never been this informed,\" Welles tells NPR about Americans today. \"Pair being informed with being disempowered — being that aware and having so little hard influence on the aspects of your life that you're so awake to. I think that explains a lot of people's frustration.\" Welles wasn't always a country-leaning singer-songwriter. He spent years playing in different iterations of rock bands, experimenting with folk and  grunge . Nearly a decade ago, he signed to a label in Nashville, burnt out and went back home to Arkansas. In 2024, after his father suffered a heart attack, the now-independent artist says he had a spiritual awakening that put him on his current path. The songs began to pour out, some political and some not. So far, his music has addressed the  war in Gaza ,  the Epstein list  and the Trump administration's claims that Tylenol is  linked  to autism. Although Welles' lyrics skew pro-working class and anti-violence, fans trying to neatly categorize his political affiliations might run into trouble. In August, he raised some eyebrows when he appeared on  The Joe Rogan Experience . A month later, he released a song condemning the  assassination  of  Charlie Kirk . It sparked both praise and backlash. On TikTok and Instagram, some people questioned how Welles could mourn a man who often made bigoted statements about minorities and helped elect the same politicians the singer criticizes in his lyrics. Welles says that for him, there's no use in trying to control how people perceive him or how they attempt to project partisan lines onto his music. His bottom line, he says, is radical nonviolence. \"I visit a lot of different echo chambers. I pop in, pop out — see what's going on in different corners,\" Welles says. \"You start to wonder, where's the throughline? Because there's obviously an issue, but neither corners' justifications for their actions or reactions is really satisfying. So I think I just started looking for some sense.\" Audiences on and offline are right there with him. Welles released multiple studio albums this year, which include collaborations with rising Americana stars  Sierra Ferrell  and  Billy Strings . He was awarded the 2025 John Prine Songwriting Fellowship and performed at both Newport Folk Festival and Farm Aid. He's also been selling out shows across the country, where he's been joined onstage by  Joan Baez  and  John Fogerty . Welles' success shows that his music is resonating widely, as a new generation of artists revive bold, plainspoken protest music for today's digital age. A long tradition of protest songs Protest music has always been deeply embedded in the American fabric, but its popularity has come and gone. Tammy L. Kernodle, a musicologist and professor at Miami University, says there's been different moments throughout history in which the folk music of particular communities or ethnic groups has been used for mass mobilization. \"When we talk about folk music, we're talking about the music that developed out of the everyday experiences of people. It was part of their ritual,\" she explains. \"Within those repertoires, there's always been songs that have been about articulating people's frustration.\" Throughout the 20th century, folk music played a key role in organizing movements across labor, politics, race and gender. From the Great Depression to the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, the struggle for liberation played out explicitly in protest songs and implicitly in the emergence of new genres like rock, disco and hip-hop. But as the century came to a close, Kernodle says folk songs documenting people's realities and advocating for social change became less and less central to pop culture. \"When we started to move into the last decades of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, those messages started to be filtered out because of the infrastructure and how music became so vastly commodified because of globalization,\" Kernodle says. \"The industry began to work against it.\" \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In the early to mid-2000s, major labels and mainstream radio stations mostly shied away from songs with overt political messaging, though folk, punk and protest scenes still flourished underground. With the rise of social media, it became easier for artists to bypass industry gatekeepers. In the last decade, hip-hop has largely carried the torch of musical protest,  particularly  during the Black Lives Matter  mobilizations  of 2020 and the rise of the COVID-19  pandemic . Today, anyone can write a song and upload it to the Internet, but they're also competing with a flood of information: a 24-hour news cycle, personalized algorithms and never-ending scrolling. With an increasingly fractured attention economy and a deeply polarized society, many people are looking for spaces of connection; communities that take their concerns seriously and make them feel heard. Kernodle says the simplicity of a front-facing camera and a banjo or guitar calls back to earlier folk traditions; simpler days of someone singing about their day on a front porch or in a town hall — and it carries real power. \"We are moving into a society that wants to read less. Most of us are getting our information from this very visual culture: TikTok, Instagram and all of these things,\" Kernodle explains. \"Music is also underscored. So these individuals are doing what their predecessors did, but on a different digital platform.\" How one artist cuts through the noise  One of those artists is Mon Rovîa, who's racked up more than 1 million followers across TikTok and Instagram, all before releasing his debut album. Born in Liberia during the West African nations' first civil war, he was adopted by an American missionary family as a child. Mon Rovîa moved around a lot growing up and gravitated towards reading and writing poetry; as he got older, he settled in Tennessee and began channeling his energy into music, initially dabbling with hip-hop and bedroom alt-pop. In 2022, he planted his feet into an Afro-Appalachian sound that blends indie folk influences like  Fleet Foxes  and  Bon Iver  with the musical traditions of the region he now calls home. He says music did not play a big role in his early childhood in Liberia — but given Appalachian folk music's  deep roots  in West African instruments and rhythms, Mon Rovîa's sound comes full circle, doubly honoring his identity. He writes guitar and ukulele-driven melodies that nudge his honeyed vocals to the forefront, often reminiscent of the intimate folk songs of British troubadour Labi Siffre. On TikTok, he'll share videos of himself playing and singing with friends, or will overlay his songs over clips of himself making tea. This kind of content is often at odds with the attention-grabbing, chaotic pace of the algorithm. Amid that slow tranquility, Mon Rovîa delivers messages against oppression, gun violence and war. \"A lot of times, the world is already too loud and angry,\" he tells NPR. \"Peace and thoughtfulness can cut through a lot of that noise.\" His song \"Heavy Foot,\" which he performed during his Grand Ole Opry debut this summer, rallies around collective care and empathy in the face of hostile politicians and systems of power. \"Do you see the man on the screen, just a puppet but you never see the strings,\" Mon Rovîa sings. \"Calling it a war 'n not a genocide, telling us it isn't what it seems.\" On social media, he's shared the song over clips of pro-Palestinian protests around the world, as well as with text that reads: \"'Who radicalized you?' I did NOT recite 'with liberty and justice for all' every morning at 7AM just to be called radical for wanting liberty and justice for all.\" Beyond social media, he also performed alongside Jesse Welles at this year's Newport Folk Festival and is selling out national tours. Although Mon Rovîa didn't initially set out to make protest music, he says he's embracing the movement. \"I think the important piece about protest music is the truth factor,\" he says. \"I think it becomes protest because we put that word around it, but really it's just a search for the truth. To reveal it and to say it as it is and not beat around the bush.\" He credits writers like  James Baldwin  and  Toni Morrison  with inspiring him to make art as a personal form of activism. Musicologist Kernodle says these links in time — in instruments, themes and influences — are an essential part of the protest folk tradition. \"True protest music does this. It reflects on the past. It is documenting the present, and what it is speaking to is the hope of the future,\" she says. \"That's what we see in some of this material that is coming out of these digital platforms.\" Looking at the future For 28-year-old singer-songwriter  Jensen McRae , that lineage is a grounding exercise for facing the current political climate. \"I have Post-it notes above my desk, and it just has a list of all of the Black women from history that I admire and am trying to model myself after,\" she tells NPR. \"It says, 'You're standing on the shoulders of your ancestors, you can get through this.' \" McRae is a 21st century Laurel Canyon-style folk singer with indie rock sensibilities. Raised in Los Angeles with a steady soundtrack of pop, R&B and  Carole King , she studied music at the University of Southern California. As a college student, she traded in piano for acoustic guitar as her primary instrument when she realized it was much easier to carry from gig to gig. She wanted to become a storyteller, and to her that meant writing folk songs. \n       \n      Related Story:  NPR \n       In 2021, she wrote a viral  Phoebe Bridgers   parody  track about getting the COVID-19 vaccine at Dodger Stadium. She's released two acoustic-pop albums since then, full of heartbreaking and incisive lyricism (she jokes that as a woman, people expect her to write songs about the worst thing that's ever happened to her — and she delivers). She's sold out shows on both sides of the Atlantic, opened for acts like  MUNA  and  Noah Kahan  and  found a fan  in none other than  Justin Bieber . This summer, she also appeared in Spike Lee's  Highest 2 Lowest . But as she's found more mainstream success, McRae has also felt a deep responsibility to respond to \"the historical moment that we're in that's been going on for basically my entire adult life.\" Online, she shares defiantly unpolished protest songs like \"You Started It\" and \"The Men are Disappearing\" to her more than 500,000 followers across TikTok and Instagram. Shot on McRae's phone, the stripped-down videos of her singing and strumming the guitar don't necessarily look out of place on her social media feeds. She's the kind of Internet native who regularly posts works-in-progress song clips, covers and snippets of herself reading old diary entries. But in her more political songs, pinned to the top of her TikTok profile, McRae touches on school shootings, racial injustice, the military industrial complex and the  deportation  of migrants from the U.S. to a prison in El Salvador. She says that with how long it takes to craft an album, she's drawn to posting political songs online for the immediacy — she wants to meet the moment as it's happening. She also finds catharsis in not having to think about branding or marketing the music; instead, the songs are a tool for raising consciousness. \"There's a part of me that feels a little bit funny about profiting off of that music,\" she says, noting that her TikTok is not monetized. \"The reason that I'm writing it is to give other people the language to talk about this thing that maybe they don't understand.\" Existing as a folk artist closer to the pop mainstream, she sees her role akin to \"sneaking vegetables into people's brownies\" — sparking sociopolitical awareness in audiences that may not be overtly seeking it out. That in itself, she says, is a form of resistance. \"My hope is that in 30 or 50 years, my children or grandchildren will be living in a time where the pendulum has swung back in a more progressive direction,\" McRae says. \"They'll look back and go, 'Oh my God, I can't believe you were making art during that time when that administration and that court and those police forces were so conservative and were so combative.' I want to be a part of the reason why future generations feel like they can say anything and do anything.\" \n      \n"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/uk-china-cryptoqueen-bitcoin-fraud-b115ccc6e98f015dad01fa75d6ce0cf7","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"16:54:43Z","title":"Chinese Woman Convicted in Massive Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Zhimin Qian, a Chinese woman, was sentenced to 11 years and 8 months in a UK court for running a massive Ponzi scheme from 2014 to 2017 that defrauded over 128,000 people in China.

billion) in Bitcoin after defrauding more than 128,000 people in China in a Ponzi scheme was sentenced by a U.K. court on Tuesday to over 11 years in prison. Police said the investigation into Zhimin Qian, 47, led to officers recovering devices holding 61,000 Bitcoin in the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the U.K. Qian, dubbed “cryptoqueen” by British media, was arrested in April 2024 after spending years evading the authorities and living an “extravagant” lifestyle in Europe, staying in luxury hotels across the continent and buying fine jewelry and watches, prosecutors said. Police said she ran a pyramid scheme that lured more than 128,000 people to invest in her business between 2014 and 2017, including many who invested their life savings and pensions. Authorities said she stored the illegally obtained funds in Bitcoin assets. When she attracted the attention of Chinese authorities, Qian fled to the U.K. under a fake identity. Once in London, police said she rented a “lavish” house for over 17,000 pounds ($23,000) per month, and tried but failed to buy multimillion pound properties in a bid to convert the Bitcoin.

You left China without a thought for the people whose investments you had stolen and enjoyed for a period of time a lavish lifestyle.

(AP) — A rural Kansas county has agreed to pay a little more than $3 million and apologize over a law enforcement raid on a small-town weekly newspaper in August 2023 that sparked an outcry over press freedom. Marion County sheriff’s officers were involved in the raid on the Marion County Record and helped draft search warrants used by Marion city police to enter the newspaper’s offices, the publisher’s home and the home of a local city council member.

Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit Read More “They intentionally wanted to harass us for reporting the news, and you’re not supposed to do that in a democracy,” the editor and publisher, Eric Meyer, said Tuesday. He added he hoped the payment was large enough to discourage similar actions against other news organizations in the future. The raid prompted five federal lawsuits against the county, the city of Marion and local officials. Meyer’s 98-year-old mother Joan, the paper’s co-owner, died of a heart attack the next day, something he blames on the stress of the raid. During the raid, authorities seized cellphones and computers from the newsroom and rifled through reporters’ desks. Search warrants linked the raid to a dispute between a local restaurant owner and the newspaper, which had obtained a copy of her driving record while reporting on her request for a city liquor license. The raid also came after the newspaper had dug into the background of the police chief at the time who led the raid.

Police body camera footage from Meyer’s home showed his mother, who lived with him, visibly upset and telling officers, “Get out of my house!” Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Follow on An attorney for the newspaper, Bernie Rhodes, released a copy Tuesday of the five-page agreement resolving legal claims against the county. Claims against the city and city officials have not been settled, and Meyer said he believes they will face a larger judgment once those claims are eventually resolved. Marion County’s administrator and attorneys for the city and county did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Raid’s legality was questioned Under the judgment, the estate of Meyer’s mother will receive $1 million. Meyer, two former Record reporters and the paper’s business manager will split $1.1 million, and Ruth Herbel, the former city council member, will receive $650,000. Meyer said he’s considering a fund to ensure that the paper remains financially viable or a program to encourage young journalists to work in communities like his. “The goal isn’t to get the money. The money is symbolic,” Meyer said. “The press has basically been under assault.” Three days after the raid, the local prosecutor said there wasn’t enough evidence to justify it. Experts said Marion’s police chief at the time, Gideon Cody, was on legally shaky ground when he ordered it, and a former top federal prosecutor for Kansas suggested it might have been a criminal violation of civil rights. Doug Anstaett, a retired Kansas Press Association executive director, said Tuesday that the raid violated the state’s shield law for journalists. It allows law enforcement agencies to seek subpoenas to obtain confidential information from news organizations but requires them to show a compelling interest and that they can’t obtain it in another way. Anstaett was the association’s executive director when the law was enacted in 2010. The Record is known for its aggressive coverage of local issues, and Anstaett suggested police where trying to “get at” Meyer because of his adversarial relationships with local officials, adding, “it totally backfired.” “They didn’t follow any of those requirements and therefore it was really a slam dunk in terms of whether they broke the law or not,” he said. Genelle Belmas, a University of Kansas professor who teaches media law, described the raid as “an egregious violation of the First Amendment rights” of Meyer and the weekly. “I share his hope that an award of this size serves as a deterrent against future ill-conceived warrants with political motivations,” she said. “And no amount of money brings Joan Meyer back. We need to stay vigilant against government incursions on the press.” Sheriff issues apology The search warrants were premised on the idea that the newspaper and a reporter had illegally impersonated the local restaurant owner to obtain her driving record online and that the former city council member Herbel illegally circulated it by sending a cellphone screenshot to the city manager. Two special prosecutors who reviewed the raid and its aftermath said nearly a year later that the Record, its staff and Herbel had committed no crimes before the raid. The prosecutors also said the warrants signed by a judge contained inaccurate information from an “inadequate investigation” and that the searches were not legally justified. Cody resigned as police chief in October 2023. Cody is scheduled to go to trial in February in Marion County on a felony charge of interfering with a judicial process, accused by the two special prosecutors of persuading a potential witness to withhold information from authorities investigating his conduct. He had pleaded not guilty and did not respond to a text message Tuesday seeking comment about the county’s agreement. The charge against Cody stems from text messages between him and the business owner after the raid. The business owner has said Cody asked her to delete text messages between them, fearing people could get a wrong idea about their relationship, which she said was professional and platonic. The Marion County Commission approved the agreement Monday after discussing it in private for 15 minutes. The agreement required Sheriff Jeff Soyez to issue an apology. “The Sheriff’s Office wishes to express its sincere regrets to Eric and Joan Meyer and Ruth and Ronald Herbel for its participation in the drafting and execution of the Marion County Police Department’s search warrants on their homes and the Marion County Record,” the sheriff’s statement said. ___ Hollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-shutdown-trump-rates-e6aea0a5dcacc6087c492a0537ed6c40","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:06:45+00:00","title":"U.S. Stocks Rise as AI Frenzy Faces Market Skepticism","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"U.S. stock markets rose on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a new record and the S&P 500 recovering from a prior loss, driven by strong performances from companies like Paramount Skydance and FedEx.

The S&P 500 added 0.2% after erasing a loss taken during the morning. It’s been bouncing around lately, coming off Monday’s vigorous rebound following its first losing week in four. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 559 points, or 1.2%, to a record, surpassing its prior all-time high set two weeks ago . The Nasdaq composite lagged the market, though, as Nvidia got back to falling amid continued concerns that stocks caught up in the artificial-intelligence frenzy may have become too expensive . The Nasdaq dipped 0.3% Helping to lead the market was Paramount Skydance, which jumped even though the entertainment giant reported revenue and profit for the latest quarter that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. AP AUDIO: The Dow rallies 500 points toward a record even as Nvidia sags The AP’s Seth Sutel reports U.S. stocks are drifting in mixed trading. It was the company’s first earnings report since Skydance closed its acquisition of Paramount in early August, and investors appeared to be encouraged that it raised its cost-cutting target to at least $3 billion from the previous $2 billion. Its stock leaped 9.8%.

Instead of expecting growth from just the summer, the delivery company now also expects profit to rise in this year’s holiday-shopping season from last year’s. They helped pull the S&P 500 back within 0.6% of its all-time high , which was set two weeks ago. They also helped offset a 3% drop for Nvidia, which is Wall Street’s most influential stock because of its massive size. A major investor in Nvidia, Japanese technology giant SoftBank, said it had sold its entire stake in the AI chip company for $5.83 billion last month. SoftBank is not giving up on AI. It’s still focusing on OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. A big question on Wall Street has been whether investors will push the frenzy around AI stocks further. Their sensational growth has been one of the top reasons the U.S. market has hit records despite a slowing job market and still-high inflation . But their prices have shot so high that critics say they’re reminiscent of the 2000 dot-com bubble, which ultimately burst and dragged the S&P 500 down by nearly half. CoreWeave, whose cloud platform helps customers running AI workloads, fell 16.3% even though it reported a smaller loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue also topped expectations, and financial analysts praised its momentum. But investors seemed to focus instead on supply-chain issues that are delaying a data center and pushing some of CoreWeave’s revenue further into the future. Back on the winning side of Wall Street, BigBear.ai rose 6.1% after reporting better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also said it would buy AskSage, a generative AI platform built for national-security agencies and other highly regulated areas, for $250 million. All told, the S&P 500 added 14.18 points to 6,846.61. The Dow rallied 559.33 to 47,927.96, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 58.87 to 23,468.30. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.1% even though SoftBank climbed 2%. Besides the sale of its Nvidia stake, the tech giant also reported a much bigger profit than analysts expected. In the U.S. bond market, trading was closed for the Veterans Day holiday. Yields have been generally rising since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last month that further cuts to interest rates are not a sure thing . The Fed has already cut its main interest rate twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market. But it’s worried that inflation, which has stubbornly remained above the Fed’s 2% target, could reaccelerate. What’s making the Fed’s job potentially more difficult is that the U.S. government’s shutdown has delayed important updates on jobs and other areas of the economy. The Senate has made moves to end what’s become the longest-ever shutdown, but it’s not assured. That has left the Fed and investors looking at reports coming from sources outside of the government, which have offered a mixed picture. A job tracker at Goldman Sachs suggests growth slowed in October from September. After including the effect of a deferred resignation program at the government, U.S. employers overall may have cut 50,000 jobs in October, according to economist David Mericle. Such softening in the job market has traders betting on a roughly two-in-three chance that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting in December, according to data from CME Group. Expectations for such cuts, which Wall Street loves because they can goose the economy and investment prices, are another reason stocks have hit records recently. ___ AP Business Writers Chan Ho-Him and Matt Ott contributed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/germany-detains-man-accused-of-offering-to-pay-people-to-kill-politicians","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:50:11+00:00","title":"Germany detains man accused of offering to pay people to kill politicians","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"German authorities have detained Martin S., a German-Polish dual citizen, for allegedly running a darknet platform since June 2025 that called for the murder of politicians, including former Chancellors Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz.

He is accused of anonymously running a platform on which he published lists of names, self-styled death sentences and instructions for building explosives.\n\nProsecutors did not address his motive or suggest he was working for a foreign actor.\n\nMartin S. also allegedly called for donations in cryptocurrency that were intended to be offered as a reward for killing his targets. The platform contained sensitive personal data on potential victims, prosecutors said.\n\nWhile authorities did not name any of the politicians or public figures Martin S. had targeted, Spiegel news magazine reported that former chancellors Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz, as well as other former federal ministers, were on the list.\n\nGerman politicians complain that they are increasingly subject to attacks, both verbal and physical, at a time of deepening polarisation.\n\nThere has also been a general increase in the scale of cyber threats to Germany and other Western countries.\n\nInterior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, asked about the case at a previously scheduled news conference, said the investigation into a suspect trying to generate money to finance attacks against public figures via “a right-wing extremist platform” had been ongoing since June. He declined to give further details.\n\nFederal prosecutors are responsible for significant extremism-related and national security cases in Germany.\n\nProsecutors said in a statement on Tuesday that “the accused will appear before an investigative judge today, who will decide whether to issue an arrest warrant”."},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/britain-bbc-trump-panorama-resignations-5f1351093a493c637124d8ea758260b9","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"18:52:36+00:00","title":"BBC Resigns Top Executives Over Trump Speech Editing Scandal","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The BBC faced a significant crisis in late 2025 when it was accused of editing a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump to imply he urged supporters to ‘fight like hell’ during a January 2021 speech, leading to the sudden resignations of its director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.

blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning. The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and “fight like hell.” The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an “error of judgment.” A letter from Trump’s attorney threatened legal action , demanding that the broadcaster “retract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements” and compensate the president for the harm caused. Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting. “This is an existential crisis for the BBC,” said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George’s University of London. “In capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it’s relatively easy to cow the BBC.” Related Stories Britain’s once-mighty Conservative Party is battling to avoid extinction 5 MIN READ Starmer argues for inclusive patriotism and accuses Farage of trying to divide Britain 4 MIN READ Treasury chief says wars and tariffs are harming the UK’s economic outlook 3 MIN READ That is “incredibly dangerous” in an increasingly polarized environment “where the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,” she warned. A look at the scandal, past criticism of the BBC and uncertainty about its future: Accusations of institutional bias The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC. The memo raised concerns over how the BBC’s “Panorama” documentary program edited a speech by Trump. The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.

The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster’s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. Longstanding criticism from the right Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined “Trump goes to war with ‘fake news’ BBC.” Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were “corrupt” and “dishonest” and “tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage , told a news conference that the BBC “has been institutionally biased for decades” to loud applause from supporters. In recent months, the corporation came under sustained criticism from all sides over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, including its livestreaming of a rap duo’s chants calling for “death to the IDF” (Israel Defense Forces) at this year’s Glastonbury festival. It also had to remove a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of a Hamas official. Charles Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, alleged that the BBC has a consistent bias, “always from a sort of metropolitan, left position” on trans issues, as well as its coverage of race, Trump, Israel and Gaza. “I’m not, of course, saying that it should be right-wing either,” Moore said. “I’m saying it should take impartiality seriously and put in people capable of running this gigantic and self-satisfied bureaucracy.” Posetti disagreed and said the BBC, like many other news outlets, is under attack from right-wing voices and the Trump administration. She acknowledged the editing mistakes but said it is wrong to call the broadcaster fake news “when patently it is not.” “I’m not suggesting that there weren’t errors made, but I think that those errors needed to be addressed head-on, clearly and transparently and in a very timely manner.” Instead, she said, the resignations will have a “destabilizing effect.” Staff arrive at BBC Broadcasting House in London, Monday Nov. 10, 2025.

In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded. Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. Taxpayers provide funding The BBC is funded through an annual TV license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television. The corporation is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial and independent. It is not a state broadcaster beholden to the U.K. government. Its model has inspired the CBC in Canada, the ABC in Australia and other publicly funded outlets, Posetti said. Known affectionately — or mockingly — as “Auntie,” the BBC began in the 1920s and changed the history of television when many Britons bought a TV set specifically to watch the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. It still devotes more time and resources than other outlets to events such as the death of the monarch in 2022. Outside the U.K. the BBC World Service operates in over 40 languages and is one of Britain’s most significant cultural exports. Apart from news, it retains a huge global viewership with popular entertainment shows, including “Doctor Who,” “The Traitors” and “Strictly Come Dancing” and their spinoffs. Ahead of the renewal of its charter in the next few years, many critics have questioned whether the license fee model is still viable at a time when viewers are turning to streaming competitors, YouTube and social media. The BBC has lost millions of pounds as more households stopped paying the fee in recent years. “This is the BBC’s last chance,” Farage said. “If the BBC doesn’t now get a grip … then I think what you would see within the next couple of years are many, many millions just refusing, just not wanting to have the license fee.”"},{"source":"https://apnews.com/article/snap-food-benefits-trump-government-shutdown-c633d646f08f395e7d157d1145eaf727","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"05:10:38+00:00","title":"Supreme Court to Rule on SNAP Benefits During Government Shutdown","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"During a historic U.S. government shutdown, the Trump administration sought to freeze SNAP food aid benefits, arguing that judicial orders violating the executive’s spending power.

The request is the latest in a flurry of legal activity over how the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries should proceed during the historic U.S. government shutdown. Lower courts have ruled that the government must keep full payments flowing, but the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to keep them frozen for now. The high court is expected to rule Tuesday. The seesawing rulings so far have created a situation where beneficiaries in some states, including Hawaii and New Jersey, have received their full monthly allocations and those in others, such as Nebraska and West Virginia, have seen nothing. Brandi Johnson, 48, of St. Louis, said she’s struggling to make the $20 she has left in her SNAP account stretch. Johnson said she has been skipping meals the past two weeks to make sure her three teenage children have something to eat. She is also helping care for her infant granddaughter, who has food allergies, and her 80-year-old mother.

Many require patrons to live in a certain ZIP code or are dedicated to helping the elderly first. “I think about it 24 hours a day, seven days a week, literally,” Johnson said. “Because you’ve got to figure out how you’re going to eat.” Millions receive aid while others wait The Trump administration argued that lower court orders requiring the full funding of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program wrongly affect ongoing negotiations in Congress about ending the shutdown. Supreme Court Solicitor General D. John Sauer called the funding lapse tragic, but said judges shouldn’t be deciding how to handle it. The Senate Monday passed a compromise funding package that would end the government shutdown and refill SNAP funds. It now goes to the House for consideration. Trump’s administration initially said SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown. After some states and nonprofit groups sued, judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely. The administration then said it would use an emergency reserve fund to provide 65% of the maximum monthly benefit. On Thursday, Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell said that wasn’t good enough, and ordered full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday. Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients. Millions of people in at least a dozen states — all with Democratic governors — received the full amount to buy groceries before Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put McConnell’s order on hold Friday night, pending further deliberation by an appeals court. Delays cause complications for some beneficiaries Millions more people still have not received SNAP payments for November, because their states were waiting on guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP. Several states have made partial payments, including Texas, where officials said money was going on cards for some beneficiaries Monday. “Continued delays deepen suffering for children, seniors, and working families, and force nonprofits to shoulder an even heavier burden,” Diane Yentel, President and CEO, National Council of Nonprofits, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. “If basic decency and humanity don’t compel the administration to assure food security for all Americans, then multiple federal court judges finding its actions unlawful must.” Trump’s administration has argued that the judicial order to provide full benefits violates the Constitution by infringing on the spending power of the legislative and executive branches. Wisconsin, which was among the first to load full benefits after McConnell’s order, had its federal reimbursement frozen. The state’s SNAP account could be depleted as soon as Monday, leaving no money to reimburse stores that sell food to SNAP recipients, according to a court filing. New York Attorney General Letitia James said Monday that some cardholders have been turned away by stores concerned that they won’t be reimbursed — something she called to stop. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said Trump was fighting “for the right to starve Americans.” “It’s the most heinous thing I’ve ever seen in public life,” he said. The latest rulings keep payments on hold, at least for now States administering SNAP payments continue to face uncertainty over whether they can — and should — provide full monthly benefits during the ongoing legal battles. The Trump administration over the weekend demanded that states “undo” full benefits that were paid during a one-day window after a federal judge ordered full funding and before a Supreme Court justice paused that order. A federal appeals court in Boston left the full benefits order in place late Sunday, though the Supreme Court order ensures the government won’t have to pay out for at least 48 hours. “The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,” Judge Julie Rikleman of the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals wrote. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, presiding over a case filed in Boston by Democratic state officials, on Monday paused the USDA’s request from Saturday that states “immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits.” In a hearing later that Monday, Talwani said that communication to states was confusing, especially because the threat came just a day after USDA sent letters to states saying SNAP would be paid in full. Federal government lawyer Tyler Becker said the order was only intended for states to receive the full amount of SNAP benefits, and “had nothing to do with beneficiaries.” Talwani said she would issue a full order soon. ___ Associated Press writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin; Margery Beck in Omaha, Nebraska; John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas; Kimberlee Kruesi in Providence, Rhode Island; Nicholas Riccardi in Denver; and Stephen Groves and Lindsay Whitehurst in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/","dateOfPublication":"1212-11-20","timeOfPublication":"12:00:00-12:59","title":"News | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On 12 November 2025, a wide range of global events unfold, including a high-stakes UFC fight between Jack Della Maddalena and Islam Makhachev, allegations that the Gaza Now founder is financing Hamas, a massive US government shutdown causing 1,200 flight cancellations, threats of nuclear tests by Russia if the US resumes nuclear testing under Donald Trump, a film exposing systematic abuse by Israeli soldiers in Gaza, media bias allegations against a UK news network, a betting scandal in Turkish football described as a moral crisis, and a deadly bomb blast in New Delhi under investigation by India’s anti-terrorism force.

nuclear weapons, “Russia will respond in kind.”\n\nLavrov cited on Tuesday previous statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin laying out Moscow’s policy.\n\nHis comments came less than two weeks after US President Donald Trump said he  directed his administration  to “immediately” resume nuclear testing.\n\n“Putin outlined our position back in 2023, when he was asked about this issue during one of his speeches,” Lavrov told reporters, according to Russia’s state-owned news agency TASS.\n\n“He stated that if any of the nuclear powers conducts a nuclear weapons test – not a carrier test or a subcritical experiment, but an actual nuclear weapons test – then Russia will respond in kind.”\n\nLate in October, Trump claimed that other countries have testing programmes, saying that he instructed the Pentagon to start testing nuclear weapons “on an equal basis”.\n\nBut Russia’s last known nuclear test was in 1990; China’s was in 1996. The US has not tested a nuclear bomb since 1992.\n\nSince the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was signed in 1996, only India, Pakistan and North Korea have carried out known nuclear tests.\n\nRussia tested a missile powered by nuclear energy in October, but not an actual nuclear bomb.\n\nEarlier this month, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright – whose agency is responsible for the country’s nuclear programme –  said the US  will not carry out a nuclear explosion.\n\nRather, Wright told Fox News, the US will test components of nuclear weapons to simulate how they would work and ensure that the systems are operational.\n\n“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions,” he said.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia had not received direct information from the US regarding the testing issue.\n\n“So far, there have been no explanations from our US colleagues on this topic,” he was quoted as saying by TASS.\n\nPeskov said last week that Putin instructed the Russian military to “study the advisability of beginning preparations” for nuclear testing.\n\nFor its part,  China denied  that Beijing is conducting nuclear testing and said it hoped that Washington would abide by the nuclear moratorium put in place by the CTBT.\n\n“As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a responsible nuclear-weapon state, China is committed to peaceful development, follows a policy of ‘no first use’ of nuclear weapons and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defence, and adheres to its nuclear testing moratorium,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on November 3.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lavrov hit out at Pentagon nominee  Robert Kadlec , who told US lawmakers last week that Washington “needs to have credible nuclear response options for a theatre conflict below the strategic-level”.\n\n“Mr Kadlec, who is seeking the post of assistant to the secretary of war, stated that nuclear options should be developed to address certain potential regional conflicts,” Lavrov said.\n\n“This is quite a remarkable statement. In other words, it directly indicates that this individual, as assistant to the secretary of war, intends to view the use of nuclear weapons as a tool for achieving the objectives the United States deems necessary in specific regions.”\n\nRussia itself was accused of nuclear sabre-rattling in the early stages of its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 when Putin put Moscow’s nuclear deterrence force  on high alert ."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/could-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-27","timeOfPublication":"07:34:31+00:00","title":"Could COVID-19 mRNA vaccines also fight cancer?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"New research from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center shows that mRNA vaccines used during the COVID-19 pandemic may significantly improve survival in cancer patients by activating the immune system to recognize and attack tumors—especially in previously 'cold' or hard-to-treat cancers. Clinical data from over 1,000 patients revealed that vaccinated individuals had longer survival rates, with advanced lung cancer patients seeing a nearly doubling of median survival and melanoma patients surviving beyond three years. The mechanism appears to involve dendritic cell activation and improved immune cell recruitment. While not creating new tumor-killing T cells, the vaccines may make the immune system more alert. These findings are still preliminary and are being validated through a planned Phase 3 clinical trial.

COVID-19 vaccines built using the mRNA model – which were rapidly manufactured during the global pandemic – could also help the immune system recognise and attack cancer tumours, new studies have shown.\n\nStudies in mice and an analysis of medical records of cancer patients – who received mRNA shots for COVID-19 before starting immunotherapy for cancer treatment – revealed a startling pattern: the vaccinated patients lived significantly longer than those who had not received the shots.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Florida and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented the results this week at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress in Berlin and  published  in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature.\n\nThe results, they say, reveal that the mRNA vaccines do not just prevent infection – they also “wake up” and prompt the body’s immune system to fight tumours.\n\nThe discovery has come at a time when US President Donald Trump’s administration has  slashed funding  for mRNA research.\n\nSo, why is this being touted as groundbreaking? What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?\n\nUnlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.\n\nThe cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.\n\nThe body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.\n\nThis is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.\n\nWhen Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.\n\nPeople who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.\n\nMore strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.\n\nThe researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.\n\nThe researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.\n\nPatients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.\n\nThe researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.\n\nWhen the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.\n\nBut cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.\n\nWhen both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.\n\nWhile the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.\n\nThese findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.\n\n“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.\n\n“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”\n\nGrippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.\n\nIn the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.\n\nOnce the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.\n\nBut there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.\n\nThat’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.\n\nHaving an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/un-warns-of-millions-displaced-by-climate-change-as-cop30-opens-in-brazil","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"10:04:06+00:00","title":"UN warns of millions displaced by climate change as COP30 opens in Brazil","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United Nations, through its High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has issued a stark warning ahead of COP30 in Brazil that climate change is driving massive displacement, with 250 million people displaced by weather-related disasters over the past decade.

of millions displaced by climate change as COP30 opens in Brazil\n\nClimate-related disasters and conflict have displaced millions of people across the globe, the United Nations has warned before the opening of its annual climate change conference.\n\nThe UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a report, published on Monday to coincide with the launch of the 30th annual UN Climate Change conference (COP) in Brazil, that weather-related disasters caused about 250 million people to flee their homes over the past decade.\n\nThe migration agency issued its second major report on the effect of climate change on refugees – No Escape II: The Way Forward – in the run-up to COP 30, as it appears that the enthusiasm of countries to agree action to curb climate change continues to ebb.\n\n“Over the past decade, weather-related disasters have caused some 250 million internal displacements – equivalent to over 67,000 displacements per day,” the report said .\n\nThe UNHCR added that climate change is also increasing the difficulties faced by those displaced by conflict and other driving forces.\n\n“Climate change is compounding and multiplying the challenges faced by those who have already been displaced, as well as their hosts, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings,” it continued.\n\nFloods in South Sudan and Brazil, record heat in Kenya and Pakistan, and water shortages in Chad and Ethiopia are among the disasters noted in the report.\n\nThe number of countries facing extreme exposure to climate-related hazards is projected to rise from three to 65 by 2040.\n\nThose 65 countries host more than 45 percent of all people currently displaced by conflict, it added.\n\n“Extreme weather is … destroying homes and livelihoods, and forcing families – many who have already fled violence – to flee once more,” UN refugees chief Filippo Grandi said in a statement.\n\n“These are people who have already endured immense loss, and now they face the same hardships and devastation again. They are among the hardest hit by severe droughts, deadly floods and record-breaking heatwaves, yet they have the fewest resources to recover,” he said.\n\nBy 2050, the report reads, the hottest 15 refugee camps in the world – in The Gambia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Senegal and Mali – are projected to experience nearly 200 days of hazardous heat stress per year.\n\nThe refugee agency’s report emphasised that while the effect of climate change is growing, the commitment towards dealing with it has been weakening.\n\nThe UNHCR hopes to reawaken efforts to fight the effects at the conference in Brazil.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the United States, traditionally the world’s top donor, has  slashed foreign aid .\n\nWashington previously accounted for more than 40 percent of the UNHCR’s budget. Other major donor countries have also been tightening their belts.\n\n“Funding cuts are severely limiting our ability to protect refugees and displaced families from the effects of extreme weather,” Grandi said.\n\n“To prevent further displacement, climate financing needs to reach the communities already living on the edge,” he said. “This COP must deliver real action, not empty promises.”\n\nAbout 50,000 participants from more than 190 countries will meet in Belem, in the Amazon rainforest, to discuss curbing the climate crisis.\n\nOne topic on the agenda exposing the difficulties of agreeing on global action is the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n\nThe policy is designed to prevent “carbon leakage” by requiring importers of carbon-intensive goods like steel and cement to pay the same price for embedded emissions that EU producers face domestically.\n\nWhile the EU promotes CBAM as a necessary environmental tool to encourage greener practices, critics of the policy, including major trading partners like the US and China, view it as a veiled act of protectionism.\n\nDeveloping nations, meanwhile, are concerned that it unfairly shifts the financial burden of climate action onto them."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-summit-in-brazil-what-to-know-about-the-un-climate-conference","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"11:36:51+00:00","title":"COP30 summit in Brazil: What we know about the UN climate conference","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, marks a pivotal moment in global climate governance, focusing not on setting new goals but on accelerating the implementation of past commitments.

Brazil: What we know about the UN climate conference\n\nThe 30th annual United Nations climate change conference (COP30) begins on Monday in the Brazilian city of Belem. About 50,000 people from more than 190 countries, including diplomats and climate experts, are expected to attend the 11-day meeting in the Amazon.\n\nDelegates are expected to discuss the climate crisis and its devastating impacts, including the rising frequency of extreme weather.\n\nThe hosts have a packed agenda with 145 meetings planned to discuss the green fuel transition and global warming as well as the failure to implement past promises.\n\nAndre Correa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, emphasised that negotiators engage in “mutirao”, a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.\n\n“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators on Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”\n\nCOP is the abbreviation for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, which refers to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a treaty adopted in 1992 that formally acknowledged climate change as a global threat.\n\nThe treaty also enshrined the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility”, meaning that rich countries responsible for the bulk of carbon dioxide emissions should bear the greatest responsibility for solving the problem.\n\nThe UNFCCC formally went into force in 1994 and has become the basis for international deals, such as the 2015  Paris Climate Agreement , designed to limit global temperature increases to about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 to avoid the most catastrophic effects of global warming.\n\nThe first COP summit was held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1995. The rotating presidency, now held by Brazil, sets the agenda and hosts the two-week summit, drawing global attention to climate change while trying to corral member states to agree to new climate measures.\n\nBrazil wants to gather pledges of $25bn and attract a further $100bn from the global financial markets for a Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), which would provide financing for biodiversity conservation, including reducing deforestation.\n\nBrazil has also asked countries to work on realising past promises, such as COP28’s pledge to phase out fossil fuel use. Indeed, the Brazilian government’s overarching goal for this COP is “implementation” rather than setting new goals.\n\n“Our role at COP30 is to create a roadmap for the next decade to accelerate implementation,” Ana Tonix, the chief executive of COP30, was quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper.\n\nAt a summit last week before COP30, Brazilian President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”\n\nIn a letter to negotiators released late on Sunday, Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already – from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, super typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines to a tornado ripping through southern Brazil.”\n\nNot only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives”, Stiell wrote.\n\nCOP30 is also the first to acknowledge the failure to so far prevent global warming.\n\nMore than 50,000 people have registered to attend this year’s COP in Belem, including journalists, climate scientists, Indigenous leaders and representatives from 195 countries.\n\nSome of the more prominent official group voices will include the Alliance of Small Island States, the G77 bloc of developing countries and the BASIC Group, consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\n\nIn September, United States President Donald Trump told the UN General Assembly that climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, based on “predictions … made by stupid people”.\n\nTrump’s aggressive approach to deny the climate crisis has further complicated the agenda at the conference, which will have no representation from Washington. Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement twice – once during his first term, which was overturned by former President Joe Biden, and a second time on January 20, 2025, the day his second term began. He cited the economic burden of climate initiatives on the US. Trump has called climate change a “hoax”.\n\nThe US historically has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. On an annual basis, however, the biggest carbon polluter now is China.\n\nCOP30 organisers have been criticised for the exorbitant prices of hotel rooms in Belem, which has just 18,000 hotel beds. Brazil’s government has stepped in, offering free cabins on cruise ships to poorer nations in a last-minute bid to ensure they can attend.\n\nAs of November 1, only 149 countries had confirmed lodging. The Brazilian government said 37 were still negotiating. Meanwhile, business leaders have decamped to host their own events in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBrazil has also been slammed for clearing forest to build a new road to reach the conference venue.\n\nRenewables, led by solar and wind, accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added worldwide last year, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar energy has now become the cheapest form of electricity in history.\n\nMeanwhile, one in five of new cars sold around the world last year was electric, and there are now more jobs in clean energy than in fossil fuels, according to the UN.\n\nElsewhere, the International Energy Agency has estimated that global clean-energy investment will reach $2.2 trillion this year, which would be about twice as much as on fossil fuel spending.\n\nAt the same time, global temperatures are not just rising, they are climbing faster than ever with new records logged for 2023 and 2024. That finding was part of a study done every few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe new research shows the average global temperature rising at a rate of 0.27C (0.49F) each decade, almost 50 percent faster than in the 1990s and 2000s when the warming rate was around 0.2C (0.36F) per decade.\n\nThe world is now on track to cross the 1.5C threshold by 2030, after which scientists warn that humanity will trigger irreversible climate impacts. Already, the planet has warmed by 1.3C (2.34F) since the pre-industrial era, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAt the same time, governments around the world spend about $1 trillion each year subsidising fossil fuels.\n\nAt a preparatory summit with dozens of heads of state and government, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.”\n\n“Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable. We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down,” he said on Thursday.\n\n“Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”\n\nThe India-Pakistan  heatwave  began unusually early, in April this year. By June, temperatures had reached a peak of about 48C (118.4F) in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Hundreds of lives were lost, and crops were decimated.\n\nEurope also faced extreme heat this year. Over the summer, the region endured a heatwave that pushed cities like Lisbon past 46C  (114.8F). In London, a prolonged period of elevated temperatures in late June caused an estimated excess 260 deaths.\n\nAt the same time,  Mediterranean wildfires  ravaged large tracts of Southern Europe with more than 100,000 people evacuated and dozens of deaths.\n\nTurkiye suffered one of its worst droughts in decades, hitting agricultural areas. Rainfall dropped by up to 71 percent in some areas compared with the previous year, stressing ecosystems and energy and food production."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/pakistan-says-india-proxies-behind-islamabad-bombing-what-we-know-so-far","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:51:14+00:00","title":"Pakistan says ‘India proxies’ behind Islamabad bombing: What we know so far","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has blamed India for a suicide bombing at the District Judicial Complex in Islamabad, claiming it is part of a broader campaign of 'state terrorism' by Indian proxies.

The Sri Lankan cricket team, which was attacked in March 2009 by gunmen in Pakistan, was playing a one-day international match in Rawalpindi, about 10km (6 miles) from the court.\n\nThe suicide attack marked a dramatic escalation of violence at a time when the military was focused on rescuing hundreds of cadets held by fighters in a separate incident at Cadet College in South Waziristan, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the Afghan border.\n\nThe assault on the college in Wana, the district capital, occurred a day earlier when an explosives-laden car rammed the campus entrance. Security forces say at least 300 cadets have been rescued so far and that operations to free the remainder are ongoing.\n\nOn Tuesday, another bomb in Dera Ismail Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, injured at least 14 security personnel.\n\nSharif blamed India for both the Islamabad and Wana incidents without offering evidence. “Both attacks are the worst examples of Indian state terrorism in the region. It is time for the world to condemn such nefarious conspiracies of India,” he said.\n\nA day earlier, a  car explosion in New Delhi  killed at least 13 people. India’s Home Minister Amit Shah said on X that India would “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”.\n\nHere is what we know so far about the Islamabad blast.\n\nThe suicide bomber struck after 12:30pm (07:30 GMT) at the entrance of the District Judicial Complex on Srinagar Highway, one of Islamabad’s main arteries.\n\nOpened three years ago, the complex handles thousands of litigants and draws large numbers of lawyers daily. The complex has several gates, with a side entrance used primarily by judges and a main gate for litigants.\n\nKey political and civic institutions – the Parliament, Supreme Court, and offices of the president and prime minister – are about 15km (9 miles) away.\n\nThe Jamaa-ul-Ahrar, a breakaway faction of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) armed group, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe TTP, an ideological ally of the Afghan Taliban, itself denied any role in the Islamabad attack.\n\nPakistan has suffered a series of attacks from the TTP in recent years that have led to the deaths of hundreds of security officials and civilians. Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering the TTP, a charge Kabul denies. The TTP are at the centre of recent tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, including a series of deadly cross-border clashes.\n\nPakistan’s capital, however, has largely stayed peaceful in recent years. The last major attack in Islamabad was in December 2022, when a car rammed a police post and a police officer died. The TTP had claimed responsibility for that attack.\n\nAs Islamabad’s main district court, the judicial complex sees thousands of litigants visiting the court premises for their various cases. Thousands of lawyers also come to the complex for their daily duties.\n\nRaja Aleem Abbasi, a member of the Islamabad Bar Council, was taking a break in the main courtyard when the blast shook the compound.\n\n“It was a deafening blast, and complete chaos and panic set in. As we regained composure, I saw the head of the suicide bomber, which had flown from outside, rolling just in front of me, merely a few feet away,” a shaken Abbasi told Al Jazeera.\n\nAbbasi, 60, said hundreds tried to flee, but the main entrance was blocked. “Soon, the entrance used for the judges was open for the public, allowing us to escape,” he added.\n\nHe estimated about 2,000 people were on the premises when the device detonated.\n\nMushahid Dawar, another lawyer, said he had left the compound on his motorcycle minutes before the blast but returned when he heard it.\n\n“I had left for the office from the court when I heard the blast, and instinctively I turned back. However, as I saw so many bodies strewn on the road, I just could not bear the sight and decided to leave,” Dawar told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe attacks coincide with a fraught period in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties. The two neighbours were locked in a week of clashes last month before Qatar and Türkiye mediated a ceasefire in Doha on October 19.\n\nFollow-up talks in Istanbul have, however, failed to resolve differences, and negotiations collapsed again over the weekend following the third round of talks.\n\nPakistan long enjoyed close ties with the Afghan Taliban and many Pakistanis welcomed the militants’ return to power in August 2021.\n\nBut relations have soured, largely over Pakistan’s accusations that Kabul has provided sanctuary to the TTP, an armed group that emerged in 2007 and has waged a sustained campaign against Islamabad.\n\nBesides the TTP, Pakistan also accuses Afghanistan of sheltering the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the ISIL affiliate in Khorasan Province (ISKP). The Taliban government denies responsibility for Pakistan’s internal security concerns.\n\nRegional powers including China, Iran and Russia have urged the Taliban to act against the TTP. That message was reiterated at the Moscow Format consultations in early October, attended by Amir Khan Muttaqi, the Taliban’s foreign minister.\n\nShortly after the blast, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif wrote on X that the country was “in a state of war”.\n\n“Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan Army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: this is a war for all of Pakistan, in which the Pakistan Army is giving daily sacrifices and making the people feel secure,” he wrote.\n\nThe year 2025 has seen shifting regional alignments. Relations between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, once close, now stand at a breaking point, despite the current year seeing several attempts to patch up the relationship.\n\nPakistan appointed an ambassador to Kabul and engaged in multiple diplomatic dialogues, but relations have deteriorated.\n\nIndia, which long treated the Taliban as a Pakistani proxy and shunned contact, has, on the other hand, strengthened its diplomatic and strategic ties in recent years, as witnessed by a visit by Afghanistan’s foreign minister to India last year.\n\nIslamabad has historically accused New Delhi of stoking unrest in Balochistan and has more recently alleged Indian support for the TTP, charges India rejects.\n\nAnalysts warn that if tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan remain unresolved, instability is likely to spill across borders and provoke further attacks inside Pakistan’s cities.\n\nIhsanullah Tipu Mehsud, a security analyst in Islamabad, said the TTP has the capability to strike major cities but has largely concentrated its operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n“The Pakistani Taliban believe that if they continue attacking security personnel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, they can weaken the control of administration and that will allow them opportunity to capture parts of the province, where they can make their bases,” Mehsud told Al Jazeera.\n\nReferring to the recent Pakistan-Afghanistan clashes and the failed talks, Mehsud warned of a possible surge of violence in major cities. “If there is a war to take place against Afghanistan, Pakistan must be ready for the blowback, and to suffer losses,” he said. “There can be attacks against its key installations and symbols.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/turkish-military-plane-with-at-least-20-on-board-crashes-in-georgia","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:38:16+00:00","title":"Turkish military plane with at least 20 on board crashes in Georgia","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish military C-130 cargo plane, carrying at least 20 Turkish personnel including flight crew, crashed in the Sighnaghi area of Georgia’s Kakheti region near the border with Azerbaijan.

looming end of the government shutdown a “big victory” after the Senate passed a bill to fund federal agencies.\n\nTrump congratulated Republican House Speaker  Mike Johnson  and Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Tuesday for the soon-to-be-approved funding bill.\n\n“Congratulations to you and to John and to everybody on a very big victory,” Trump said, addressing Johnson at a Veterans Day event.\n\n“We’re opening up our country — should have never been closed.”\n\nThe US president’s comments signal that he views the shutdown crisis as a political win for his Republican Party, which is set to end the budgeting impasse in Congress without meeting the Democrats’ key demand: extending healthcare subsidies.\n\nThe Senate passed  the funding bill  late on Monday in a 60-40 vote that saw eight members of the Democratic caucus backing the proposal.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives is expected to pass the budget in the coming days to end the shutdown, which has been the  longest in US history . Assuming the House approves the bill, it will then go to Trump’s desk, and the president is expected to sign it into law.\n\nIn the US system, Congress is tasked with funding the government.\n\nIf lawmakers fail to pass a budget, the federal government goes into shutdown mode, where it stops paying most employees and sends non-essential workers home.\n\nThe current shutdown started on October 1.\n\nRepublicans control the House, Senate and White House, but their narrow majority in the Senate had previously prevented them from passing a continuing resolution to keep the government funded.\n\nIn the 100-seat Senate, major legislation must generally be passed with at least 60 votes to overcome the filibuster, a legislative procedure that allows the minority party to block bills it opposes.\n\nThe Democratic caucus holds 47 seats in the chamber, which allowed it to successfully wield the filibuster until this week’s divisive vote.\n\nUntil Monday, Democrats had largely been united in opposition to the Republicans’ funding bill. They had previously maintained they would only  approve government funding if the bill included provisions to extend healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nThose subsidies, Democrats argued, help millions of Americans afford their medical insurance.\n\nBut Trump had threatened to ramp up the pressure against Democrats by cutting programmes he associated with their party.\n\nDuring the shutdown, for example, Trump tried to withhold food benefits for low-income families – a policy that is being challenged in the courts.\n\nThe shutdown crisis has also led to flight  delays and cancellations  across the country due to a shortage of available air traffic controllers, who have been working without pay.\n\nMonday’s Senate vote paved the way for a resolution to the crisis. But it has sparked infighting amongst Democrats, with segments of the party voicing disappointment with senators who backed the bill.\n\nThe issue has also intensified criticism against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against the proposal but failed to keep his caucus united in opposition to it.\n\n“Sen. Schumer has failed to meet this moment and is out of touch with the American people. The Democratic Party needs leaders who fight and deliver for working people,” Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib said in a social media post on Monday.\n\n“Schumer should step down.”\n\nSenator  John Fetterman , one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, defended his vote on Tuesday.\n\n“When you’re confronting mass, mass chaos, you know, I don’t think you should respond with more chaos, or fight with more chaos,” Fetterman told the ABC talk show The View. “It’s like, no, we need to be the party of order and logic.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/yemens-houthis-appear-to-pull-back-from-red-sea-shipping-attacks","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:17:14Z","title":"Yemen’s Houthis appear to pull back from Red Sea shipping attacks","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Yemen’s Houthi rebels are reportedly pausing their attacks on Red Sea shipping, possibly due to developments in the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire, which has been repeatedly violated.

have stopped their attacks on Israel and shipping in the Red Sea as the US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza continues to hold.\n\nThe Houthis  have carried out  a military campaign of attacking ships through the Red Sea corridor in what they describe as solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel’s war on  Gaza .\n\nThe group has launched numerous attacks on vessels in the Red Sea since late 2023,

their attacks.

A total of 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks, and about 200 were taken captive.\n\nThe Houthis’ maritime campaign has killed at least nine mariners and seen four ships sunk, disrupting shipping in the Red Sea, through which about $1 trillion of goods passed each year before the war.\n\nThe attacks greatly disrupted transits through Egypt’s Suez Canal, which links the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. The canal remains one of the top providers of hard currency for Egypt, providing it $10bn in 2023 as its wider economy struggles. The International Monetary Fund in July said the Houthi attacks “reduced foreign exchange inflows from the Suez Canal by $6bn in 2024”.\n\nMore recently, Yemen’s Houthi authorities detained  dozens of  United Nations employees after raiding a UN-run facility in the capital Sanaa, the UN confirmed in late October. The Houthis have alleged that the detained UN staff have spied for Israel or had links to an Israeli air strike that  killed Yemen’s prime minister , without providing much evidence. The UN has strenuously denied the accusations.\n\nThe UN said at the end of October that a total of 36 UN employees were arrested after Israel’s attack. It says that at least 59 UN personnel are being held by the group.\n\nOn October 31, Houthi officials said the government would put  dozens of the detained UN staff  – who are Yemenis and could face the death penalty under the nation’s laws – on trial.\n\nTen years of conflict have left Yemen, already one of the poorest countries in the Arab world, facing what the UN describes as one of the gravest humanitarian crises globally, with millions reliant on aid for survival."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/israeli-forces-kill-three-in-gaza-as-settlers-attack-in-the-occupied-west-bank","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"22:13:44+00:00","title":"Israeli forces kill three in Gaza as settlers attack in occupied West Bank","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Israeli forces have killed at least three people in Gaza in the past 24 hours, contributing to a death toll of over 69,000 Palestinians since October 2023.

Gaza in the last 24 hours, according to Palestinian officials, as Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank ramped up attacks on Palestinian villages.\n\nAs Gaza’s Ministry of Health confirmed on Tuesday the killings in the last 24 hours, the enclave’s Civil Defence agency said in a statement on Telegram that it had transferred the bodies of 35 unidentified Palestinians to al-Shifa Hospital, where efforts will be made to confirm their identities.\n\nThe death toll of  Israel’s war on Gaza  has officially topped 69,000, with at least 69,182 Palestinians killed and 170,694 wounded since October 2023. Israeli forces have killed at least 245 Palestinians since the US-brokered ceasefire went into effect on October 10.\n\nA total of 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks, and about 200 were taken captive.\n\nIt is estimated that thousands of missing people’s bodies are still buried under rubble across Gaza after two years of Israel’s genocidal war.\n\n“Getting closure remains a distant prospect for families in Gaza, who have been visiting Nasser Hospital, morgues and identification rooms in search of their loved ones, trying to recognise their remains through fragments, personal belongings, scars, pieces of clothing or injuries,” Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from central Gaza.\n\n“Forensic experts are facing severe challenges, including the decomposition of bodies and a shortage of DNA testing equipment. This has left families in a state of deep uncertainty, especially mothers who continue to return to Gaza’s hospitals hoping to find their loved ones, only to go back to their shelters each time with broken hearts.”\n\nIsrael has  violated the ceasefire agreement  at least 282 times from October 10 to November 10, through the continuation of attacks by air, artillery and direct shootings, the Government Media Office in Gaza reports.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Al Jazeera, Israel has attacked Gaza on 25 out of the past 31 days of the ceasefire, meaning there were only six days during which no violent attacks, deaths or injuries were reported.\n\nDespite continuing attacks, the US insists that the ceasefire is still holding.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement stipulated that “full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip”. However, the United Nations children’s agency accused Israel on Tuesday of denying essential aid from entering Gaza, including 1.6 million syringes to vaccinate children and nearly one million bottles of baby formula.\n\n“Both the syringes and the… refrigerators are considered dual-use by Israel, and these items we’re finding very hard to get… through clearances and inspections; yet, they are urgent,” UNICEF spokesperson Ricardo Pires said.\n\n“Dual-use” refers to items Israel deems to have possible military as well as civilian applications.\n\nOn Tuesday, UNICEF said the blockage was preventing efforts to immunise more than 40,000 children who missed routine vaccines during the war.\n\nThe syringes have been waiting on customs clearance since August.\n\nAid organisations  have repeatedly said  that not enough supplies are entering the enclave to feed and care for a largely displaced and malnourished population of two million.\n\nFrom October 10 to November 9, only 3,451 trucks have reached their intended destinations in Gaza, according to the UN2720 Monitoring and Tracking Dashboard, which monitors humanitarian aid in Gaza.\n\nAs they wait on aid, Palestinians in Gaza are forced to live without electricity, with many relying on flashlights and spending nights in complete darkness.\n\nThe war has destroyed more than 80 percent of Gaza’s electricity networks.\n\n“For the past two years, no electricity has reached the Gaza Strip,” said Mohammed Thabet, an official with Gaza’s electricity company.\n\n“The amount of electricity reaching Gaza is zero,” he said.\n\nSeparately, in the occupied West Bank, dozens of masked Israeli settlers attacked a pair of Palestinian villages on Tuesday, setting fire to vehicles and other property, leaving four Palestinians wounded.\n\nIn Tuesday’s incidents, settlers attacked the villages of Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf, setting fire to four dairy trucks, farmland, tin shacks and tents belonging to a Bedouin community.\n\nPalestinian official Muayyad Shaaban said the attacks were part of a campaign to drive Palestinians from their land and accused Israel of giving the settlers protection and immunity.\n\nIsraeli police said that four Israelis were arrested in what it described as “extremist violence”.\n\nA video verified by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking unit, Sanad, shows several vehicles on fire as Palestinians try to extinguish the flames.\n\nBREAKING & HORRIFIC: Israeli settler terrorists have attacked the Palestinian village of Bayt Lid in the West Bank, carrying out a pogrom, setting homes on fire in an attempt to burn Palestinian families alive.\n\nResidents are pleading for help as flames spread through the…  pic.twitter.com/21lOmfkMec\n\n— Ihab Hassan (@IhabHassane)  November 11, 2025\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog described the attacks as “shocking and serious”, adding, “Such violence toward civilians and toward [Israeli army] soldiers crosses a red line, and I condemn it severely.”\n\nIsraeli soldiers were also attacked today by a group of settlers, and a military vehicle was damaged.\n\nIsraeli forces and settlers have carried out  2,350 attacks  across the occupied West Bank last month in an “ongoing cycle of terror”, the Palestinian Authority’s Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission (CRRC) reported last week.\n\nCRRC head Mu’ayyad Sha’ban said last week that Israeli forces carried out 1,584 attacks – including direct physical attacks, the demolition of homes and the uprooting of olive trees – with most of the violence focused on the governorates of Ramallah (542), Nablus (412) and Hebron (401).\n\nOn Monday, B’Tselem, the Israeli human rights group,  said  that settlers were attacking Palestinians “daily”, including “shooting, beating and threatening residents, throwing stones, torching fields, destroying trees and crops, stealing produce, blocking roads, invading homes, and burning cars”.\n\nIsraeli settlers are rarely held accountable for attacks on Palestinians or their property, and are sometimes accompanied by Israeli forces during such incidents."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/cop30-opens-in-brazil-with-calls-for-unity-amid-us","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-10","timeOfPublication":"22:01:12+00:00","title":"COP30 opens in Brazil with calls for unity to tackle climate crisis","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) has opened in Belem, Brazil, at the edge of the Amazon rainforest, uniting global leaders in a call for urgent and coordinated climate action.

UN climate boss noted that countries would have to move “much, much faster” in driving down greenhouse gas emissions. “Lamenting is not a strategy. We need solutions,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as a new UN analysis of countries’ climate plans found that the pledged reductions fall far short of the drop needed by 2035 to limit temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nIf this threshold is breached, the world will experience far more severe impacts than it has so far, experts say.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a threat of the future.

That we must take revenge on all of them, including civilians … that this is the only way,” she said.\n\nHamas’s armed wing led an attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, during which 1,139 people died and about 250 were taken captive.\n\nArmoured Corps Captain Yotam Vilk described the suspension of all rules for firing on civilians – that they must have the means, intention and ability to pose a threat to Israeli soldiers.\n\n“There’s no such thing as means, intent and ability in Gaza,” Vilk explained. “It’s just ‘a suspicion of walking where it’s not allowed’,” he said, describing the overcrowded and chaotic interior of Gaza, where the precise limits on movement were known predominantly to Israeli troops alone.\n\n“Anyone who crosses the line is automatically incriminated and can be put to death,” Vilk added.\n\nThroughout its war, Israel has denied the growing number of accusations of war crimes from multiple bodies, claiming that it has investigated any credible allegations.\n\nHowever, in August, a  report  by UK monitor Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) showed that, of the limited investigations into accusations of war crimes by military investigators, including  the killing of 15 paramedics in April , few have resulted in any action.\n\nResponding to Israeli denials that it did not use human shields, tank commander Daniel was clear that the army “is lying”.\n\n“It’s called the ‘mosquito protocol’,” he said of the routine practice of seizing Palestinian civilians, strapping an iPhone to them and using them to explore suspected Hamas holdouts remotely.\n\n“Every company has its own ‘mosquito’,” he said, referring to captured Palestinians as insects. “That’s three Palestinians per battalion, nine to 12 per brigade, then dozens, if not hundreds, per division.”\n\nSome soldiers in his unit decided to release two teenage human shields they had captured out of concern they were breaking international law, Daniel recalled, adding that a senior officer said at the time: “Soldiers don’t need to know about international law, just the ‘[Israeli military] spirit’.”\n\nThrough its two years of war on Gaza, Israel has destroyed or damaged  92 percent  of its housing stock and displaced at least 1.9 million people, according to the  UN , many multiple times.\n\nAll the institutions, from universities to hospitals, that make up a  society  have been targeted for destruction. Social media videos uploaded by Israeli soldiers show an orgy of violence, with  Palestinian homes and belongings ransacked  and held up for ridicule by soldiers.\n\n“You feel that every day could be your last and that you can do anything,” one conscript who only gave his name as “Yaakov” said. “Not out of revenge, but just because you can.”\n\nOther participants talked of routinely burning Palestinian homes or celebrated their bulldozing.\n\nSpeaking from the illegal Israeli settlement of Beit El in the occupied West Bank, rabbinical judge Avraham Zarbiv – the subject of a war crimes  complaint  to the International Criminal Court – boasted of driving a bulldozer to destroy people’s homes and belongings during his time in Gaza.\n\n“I post a lot of videos,” he says, before cutting to one showing him driving a bulldozer, destroying homes in clear contravention of international law.\n\n“Until the end, until victory, until settlement. We will not give up until this village is wiped out,” he says in the video, telling the camera how his video “lift[s] soldiers’ spirits”.\n\nContinuing his comments, Zarbiv claimed credit for pioneering the tactic of destroying entire homes that is now commonplace.\n\n“We changed the conduct of an entire army,” he bragged. “Rafah is flattened. Jabalia is flattened. Beit Hanoon is flattened. Shujayea is flattened. And Khan Younis is flattened.”\n\nCheered on by a  media  and a public that a film participant, platoon sergeant Yaakov, described as neither knowing nor wanting to know what was happening in Gaza, another soldier described the experience of sitting in a basement, half-dressed, killing Palestinians remotely via drone.\n\nAny life that was not Israeli meant little, Eli said, with Yaakov separately describing how soldiers at the private US-Israeli aid programme, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), would “open fire, even if they don’t see a concrete threat”.\n\nSome of the participants acknowledged they had taken part in genocide; others accepted the pain they caused.\n\n“All mosques, almost all hospitals, almost all universities, every cultural institution has been destroyed,” Yaakov told the camera.\n\n“You’ve destroyed a society. You don’t have to kill them one by one to destroy every sign of the society that once existed there.\n\n“I hope I can find a way to live without feeling shame with every step I take.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:15:46+00:00","title":"Why has Canada lost its measles-free status – and could the US be next?","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Canada has lost its measles elimination status after a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak began in October 2024, with cases reported across all provinces and territories.

Overall, 5,000 positive cases of the illness and the deaths of two premature babies have been reported.\n\n“Canada can re-establish its measles elimination status once transmission of the measles strain associated with the current outbreak is interrupted for at least 12 months,” the agency said.\n\nBut Antony Black, a senior lecturer in life sciences at the University of Westminster in England, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s loss of its elimination status represented a “major backwards step on the path towards the control of this highly infectious and serious disease”.\n\nHere’s what we know about the loss of the elimination status:\n\nIt is a highly infectious virus which can be life-threatening if not caught early.\n\nThe illness, which is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, begins with cold-like symptoms, including a runny nose, high temperature and sore, red eyes.\n\nA few days after infection, small white spots can appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips. A rash then begins on the face and behind the ears before spreading across the body – the main telltale sign of the illness, according to information from NHS England.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, measles can cause pneumonia and become life-threatening. Babies and anyone with a weakened immune system are most at risk.\n\nMeasles is widely prevented through the use of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which is administered in two doses to children at one year old and three years old.\n\nAccording to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective in preventing a measles infection.\n\nThe “elimination” designation, which Canada has had since 1998, indicates that no locally transmitted infections or outbreaks have been reported in the past 12 months. This is no longer the case.\n\nMark Joffe, Alberta’s chief medical officer until earlier this year, blamed low take-up of vaccinations and told the Reuters news agency last month that more could have been done in the country to boost immunisation rates.\n\n“If the vaccination rates were high, this would never have happened. There may have been [some spread], but nothing like this,” Joffe said.\n\nAccording to the WHO and the US CDC, the main reason measles is spreading is that  fewer people are taking up vaccines  across the Americas region generally.\n\nOne contributing factor for low vaccination rates is a growing distrust of healthcare providers following the COVID-19 pandemic, in which anti-vaccine misinformation spread.\n\nAccording to Black, the pandemic became a “major challenge to health systems worldwide” whose facilities were overstretched meaning people missed opportunities to be vaccinated.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has also increased in many places, Black explained.\n\n“Vaccine hesitancy has been around in different forms for over 200 years, but the huge success of the COVID-19 vaccines in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic had given some hope that vaccine hesitancy would diminish. However, that has not happened,” he said.\n\n“Instead, we see the rise of mistrust of vaccines in general. The causes of mistrust are many and complex, but a main reason is the spread of misinformation and disinformation…there now needs to be a push to counteract this mistrust, for example by public health outreach and awareness campaigns, in addition to strengthening Canada’s vaccination registry system to allow better and more targeted interventions,” he added.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths driving MMR vaccine hesitancy was the claim that it causes autism. This belief stemmed from a 1998 study, which has since been discredited and retracted. There is no scientific evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn some US states and Canadian provinces, exemptions for vaccine mandates – giving non-medical reasons for declining vaccines, such as for personal or religious reasons – are becoming more common. This has led to the existence of clusters of unvaccinated people who are more vulnerable to outbreaks when exposed to the virus.\n\nSome communities, such as the Mennonites – Anabaptist Christians who have communities in the US, Canada and Mexico – have low vaccination rates, as conservative branches of the community do not believe in modern medicine.  Several outbreaks  in the past year have been traced to Mennonite communities.\n\nOverall in Canada, according to public health data, measles immunisation also fell during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdowns made it harder to access general healthcare, and continued afterwards.\n\nIn 2019, 89.5 percent of children in Canada received their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But by 2023, that figure had dropped to 82.5 percent.\n\nIn the US, during the 2024-2025 school year, 92.7 percent of children received the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Mexico, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 79.86 percent of children received the first dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\nAt least 95 percent of a population is required to be vaccinated in order to achieve “herd immunity” against measles. Herd immunity means enough people have been vaccinated to make it too hard for the disease to spread.\n\nExperts say the safest way to maintain herd immunity is through vaccination programmes.\n\nAccording to the WHO, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 31.7 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2020.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, widely used around the world, provides about 97 percent protection against the measles virus, according to public health agencies.\n\nThe vaccine is normally given to children in two stages: The first dose at 12 months and the second at about three years and four months of age (when the child is nearing pre-school age), as part of routine immunisation programmes in countries like  the United Kingdom .\n\nBreakthrough cases in vaccinated people are rare and usually mild.\n\nAccording to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), part of the wider World Health Organization, Canada’s loss of its status means that “the Region of the Americas has lost its verification as free from endemic measles transmission”.\n\nOnce the MMR vaccine was approved for distribution in 1963, healthcare practitioners and school programmes were initiated in Canada, pushing for families to receive immunisation.\n\nBy 1998, Canada had achieved its measles elimination status. Two years later, the US achieved its elimination status, as well.\n\nBy 2016, the Americas region was declared free from measles, which meant that every country in the region had reached elimination status.\n\nFollowing an outbreak in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018, the Americas lost its regional elimination status, only to have it reinstated last year once the outbreak was brought under control.\n\nNow, the Americas region has lost its elimination status once again because of the Canadian outbreak. While many individual countries within the region still have their elimination status, measles cases are on the rise, generally.\n\nAs of November 7, the PAHO said, there were 12,596 cases of measles across the region, with about 95 percent reported in Canada, Mexico and the  United States .\n\nThe PAHO said this was a “30-fold increase compared to 2024″.\n\nTwenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.\n\nJarbas Barbosa, director of PAHO, said the region’s loss of its elimination status was a “setback – but it is also reversible”.\n\n“Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement,” Barbosa said.\n\nCurrently, active outbreaks are occurring in Mexico, the US, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Belize, which have been “mostly triggered by imported cases”, according to PAHO.\n\nMexico had reported 5,019 measles cases by October 31, according to  data  from PAHO. The cases are concentrated in the northern state of Chihuahua.\n\nJust seven cases were reported in the whole of Mexico last year. A 31-year-old unvaccinated man from Ascension, Chihuahua, died from the disease in early April this year and at least 14 deaths have been reported since then, according to PAHO.\n\nIn the US, since January, a measles outbreak has led to 1,681 confirmed cases, according to the CDC last week.\n\nIn February, it reported its first measles death in a decade after an unvaccinated child fell ill amid an outbreak in Texas. The school-aged child died overnight after being hospitalised in Lubbock, northwest Texas, the state’s health department said.\n\nOf those who have tested positive for the disease, 92 percent were unvaccinated or had unknown  vaccination status .\n\nDemetre Daskalakis, a former CDC official, told Reuters that the US has a deadline of January 20 to prove that it has curbed the outbreak if it is to retain its elimination status.\n\nYes. In late 2023 and early 2024, there was a surge in measles cases in the UK, particularly in England.\n\nIn 2024 as a whole, there were 2,911 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, the highest number of cases recorded in a year, since 2012, according to the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nIn comparison, there were only two confirmed cases of measles across the whole of the UK in 2021 and 54 one year later.\n\nThere was another surge in cases in April 2025 – particularly in London and the northwest of the country – the agency said, but cases have since been declining. In 2025 so far, there have been 811 confirmed measles cases in England.\n\nWestern Australia, where 54 cases of measles have been recorded since the start of this year, is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of measles since 1997, according to Australian media."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/11/live-israel-kills-three-in-gaza-as-crews-work-to-find-thousands-of-missing?update=4100403","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:46:12+00:00","title":"Updates: Israel kills three in Gaza crews work to find thousands of missing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-11-11T14:46:12+00:00\n\nTitle: Updates: Israel kills three in Gaza crews work to find thousands of missing\n\nThis live page is closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/11/live-israel-kills-three-in-gaza-as-crews-work-to-find-thousands-of-missing?update=4100401","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:46:12+00:00","title":"Updates: Israel kills three in Gaza crews work to find thousands of missing","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article discusses updates regarding Israel's actions in Gaza, specifically noting that Israel has killed three individuals, while crews are actively working to locate thousands of missing persons in the region.","keyTakeAways":[],"namedEntities":[],"importantDates":[],"importantTimeframes":[],"tags":[],"content":"Published: 2025-11-11T14:46:12+00:00\n\nTitle: Updates: Israel kills three in Gaza crews work to find thousands of missing\n\nThis live page is closed."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/james-watson-who-co-discovered-dna-double-helix-dies-at-97","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"22:44:26Z","title":"James Watson, who co-discovered DNA double helix, dies at 97","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"James Watson, a co-discoverer of the DNA double helix with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, has died at 97.

Upon first visualising how pieces of DNA could form “rungs” on a ladder, Watson is reported to have reacted by saying, “It’s so beautiful.”\n\nBut the famous scientist saw his reputation tarnished by his embrace of long-discredited racist theories.\n\nHe stated in 2007 during an interview that he believed the genetics of Black people made them less inherently intelligent than white people, in remarks that sparked an international outcry and resulted in the loss of his position as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nIn a television interview in 2019, he said that his beliefs on the matter had not changed. The lab released a statement at the time calling his remarks “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.\n\nThe long history of pseudo-scientific theories of racial inferiority being used as a pretext for policies of discrimination or even violent subjugation and elimination makes suggestions of genetic differences based on race and ethnicity especially controversial.\n\n“His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful,” Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.\n\n“I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/11/11/live-israel-kills-three-in-gaza-as-crews-work-to-find-thousands-of-missing","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:46:12+00:00","title":"Updates: Israel kills three in Gaza crews work to find thousands of missing","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports that Israel has killed three individuals in Gaza, while search crews are actively working to locate thousands of people who are missing due to the ongoing conflict.

threatened the BBC with a $1bn lawsuit over the editing of a 2021 speech he gave shortly before protesters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump’s  threat on Monday evening  is the latest turn in a saga which has embroiled the corporation for the past week, following the leak of a memo which criticised the BBC’s impartiality in a number of areas of its coverage.\n\nIn particular, the memo, which was written by a former BBC journalist and independent consultant to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board, Michal Prescott, singled out the misleading editing of Trump’s speech, which was featured in a Panorama documentary aired shortly before the US election last year.\n\nThe leaked memo has prompted outrage, mostly from right-wing media organisations and politicians, and prompted the  resignations  of Director-General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness on Sunday.\n\nAs a public broadcaster that is funded by a mandatory licence fee for all households in possession of a television, the BBC faces intense scrutiny from all sides of the political divide, with some claiming it is too conservative in its coverage, and others saying it is too left-leaning.\n\nThe organisation has also weathered several  scandals  in recent years over the behaviour of some of its presenters, as well as complaints from its journalists over its coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nThis year, it was forced to drop former professional footballer and sports commentator Gary Lineker over a pro-Palestine Instagram post that was widely seen as anti-Semitic.\n\nSome media insiders say this is all part of a push by right-wing figures in the BBC to reassert control over the BBC’s editorial content. Speaking to Radio 4’s flagship Today news programme on Monday, David Yelland, former editor of the Sun newspaper, said Davie and Turness were the victims of a “coup”.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper cited a “BBC insider” who said that board member Robbie Gibb, who is a personal friend of Prescott, had “led the charge”.\n\nGibb also served as director of communications for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May and was an editorial adviser at the right-leaning GB News, before being appointed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the BBC board in 2021. Gibb also sits on the Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC) along with BBC chair and committee head Samir Shah, Tim Davie and independent director Caroline Thomson.\n\nThe BBC, responding to queries from the Guardian, said Gibb was only one of the four board members who approved Prescott as a consultant to EGSC. Prescott, in his memo, said he had no political affiliations.\n\nThis is a timeline of events leading up to the Trump Panorama documentary scandal this week.\n\nSome of the dates highlighted here are taken from a letter sent by chair Samir Shah to parliament on Monday, and from the memo sent by Michael Prescott to BBC board members.\n\nAn hour-long BBC Panorama documentary titled, Trump: A Second Chance? was broadcast one week before the US presidential elections.\n\nIn it, two separate parts of a speech made by Trump before the Capitol Hill riots in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, were spliced together by editors.\n\nThis editing gave the impression that Trump had actively encouraged the riots, which turned violent. The edited clip showed Trump saying, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nHowever, transcripts from Trump’s speech show that he first said, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n\nThen, nearly an entire hour later, he said, “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” He was not directly referencing the march on the Capitol in the second part, and the Panorama documentary did not include a part where Trump said he wanted supporters to “peacefully” make their voices heard.\n\nConcerns about the editing of the Trump speech were raised at a meeting of the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Board (EGSB). However, this was raised as part of general reflections on coverage of the elections, according to Samir Shah.\n\nPrescott raised concerns, Shah said, but the committee also heard from the news department, which said it was edited to “better convey the message of the speech”. Feedback was sent to the Panorama team, but no formal action was taken, Shah said.\n\nPrescott later wrote in his memo that EGSC consultant David Grossman also delivered a report during the meeting showing the BBC had been biased in its coverage of Trump, and appeared to favour Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nIn February, the UK’s media regulator, Ofcom, said a BBC documentary about Palestinian children living through  Israel’s war on Gaza  had broken rules on impartiality as it was narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government.\n\nFive days after it was broadcast, the BBC removed the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, from its online streaming platform.\n\nAccording to Prescott’s memo, a senior member of the news team again defended the Panorama editing, saying, “There was no attempt to mislead the audience about the content or nature of Mr Trump’s speech before the riot at the Capitol. It’s normal practice to edit speeches into short form clips.”\n\nPrescott added that Turness also justified the editing at this meeting.\n\nIn his memo, Prescott said he emailed Samir Shah the following day to explain his concerns, saying, “This is a very, very dangerous precedent. I hope you agree and take some form of action to ensure this potentially huge problem is nipped in the bud.”\n\nPrescott said he received no reply.\n\nThis was undertaken by Chris Saul, a legal consultant who has been tasked with previous reviews of the transparency of BBC processes since  2019. The specific issues he was asked to report on for this review, and the outcomes, are unclear.\n\nAt some point after this, Prescott sent his detailed memo to all board members along with a cover letter stating his “despair” at being ignored by senior news leaders.\n\nThe memo accused the BBC of “misleading” edits, and claimed the BBC Arabic service had shown anti-Israel bias by over-emphasising stories critical of Israel. Prescott’s memo said BBC coverage was “misrepresenting” the number of women and children killed in Gaza, and also wrongly presented coverage on starvation in the besieged enclave.\n\nAt one point, Prescott appeared to take a swipe at Al Jazeera: When a senior news member defended BBC Arabic in meetings, saying it was almost as trusted as Al Jazeera, Prescott questioned if Al Jazeera “is the gold standard” the BBC should aspire to.\n\nThe memo further criticised what he called the BBC’s “one-sided” trans rights coverage, claiming stories highlighting women’s rights organisations and others who were critical of the trans rights movement had been suppressed.\n\nIn July, an internal BBC investigation found that the documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which was removed from its website in February, had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.\n\nMore than 100 journalists working for the BBC wrote a letter protesting this and claimed they were being forced to “do Israel’s PR”.\n\n“We believe the refusal to broadcast the documentary ‘Gaza: Medics Under Fire’ is just one in a long line of agenda driven decisions,” the journalists wrote. “It demonstrates, once again, that the BBC is not reporting ‘without fear or favour’ when it comes to Israel.”\n\nShah said he met Prescott afterwards to discuss “next steps”.\n\nThis was the first time the contents of the memo entered the public domain. The right-wing broadsheet newspaper accused the BBC of doctoring the Trump speech and reported that Prescott had revealed “systemic problems” which BBC management had failed to address.\n\nParliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, led by Conservative chair Caroline Dinenage, wrote to Samir Shah requesting access to Prescott’s full report, and demanding to know what actions had been taken by the BBC in response to the memo when it was first sent.\n\nDinenage also requested an update about the EGSC review, which began in June. “The BBC clearly has serious questions to answer regarding both its editorial standards and the way in which concerns are handled by senior management,” Dinenage wrote  in the letter.\n\nShe added that members of parliament “need to be reassured that those at the very top of the BBC are treating these issues with the seriousness they deserve”.\n\nIn a statement, a BBC spokesperson said, “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback, it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.”\n\nAccording to reporting by the Guardian newspaper, Gibb was present at this meeting and was one of the board members who pressed CEO Turness over Prescott’s claims. Gibb had also pressed Turness on the memo in an earlier board meeting, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe parliamentary website announced that Michael Prescott would give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Wednesday, November 12 at 10am, as the UK government prepared to launch a review of the BBC generally in advance renewal of its Royal Charter, which sets the terms for its operations, and which is due in 2027. In a later update, the session was postponed to an as-yet-undisclosed date.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticised the BBC in an interview with The Daily Telegraph following the leak. Leavitt said watching the BBC on her trips to the UK “ruins” her day and that the BBC is “100 percent fake news” and a “propaganda machine”.\n\nIn a column in the right-wing Daily Mail newspaper, Johnson accused Director-General Tim Davie of failing to provide any explanations about the issue of impartiality at the BBC following the leak.\n\n“No one has even come close to resigning,” he wrote.\n\nJohnson accused the BBC of being a “sort of mouthpiece for Hamas”, and added that until Davie responded to the memo, “I am simply going to stop paying my licence fee and suggest you do the same.”\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie said “ultimate responsibility” lay with him, and that he had decided to resign after “reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times”.\n\nChief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness said the “buck stops with me”. She added that “while mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong”.\n\nTrump reacted triumphantly to the news of the resignations on his Truth Social network.\n\nHe wrote: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt “Journalists.” These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”\n\nThe BBC chair and head of the EGSC, Shah responded to Parliament’s letter of November 4.\n\nShah said many of the issues Prescott raised were already under review.\n\nHe pushed back against claims by Prescott that management had not acted on the points raised regarding the Trump documentary.\n\nShah wrote, “There was concern expressed by members of the Committee as well as Mr Prescott of the way programme was edited. However, the EGSC also heard from BBC News that the purpose of editing the clip was to convey the message of the speech made by President Trump so that Panorama’s audience could better understand how it had been received by President Trump’s supporters and what was happening on the ground at that time.”\n\nHe said he met with Prescott after an October 17 board meeting to discuss the issues and next steps.\n\nShah apologised for the BBC’s “error of judgement” over the editing of Trump’s speech, but said there was no institutional bias at the BBC.\n\nHe also laid out steps being taken to review the issues Prescott had raised and to overhaul the EGSC more generally.\n\nUS President Donald Trump threatened a $1bn lawsuit via a letter  to the BBC from his counsel, Alejandro Brito, alleging “malicious, disparaging” edits.\n\nThe letter demanded a retraction of the documentary, an apology, and payments to “appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused”.\n\nThe broadcaster has been given until Friday 22:00 GMT to respond or, Trump’s lawyer said, he will be: “left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 in damages. The BBC is on notice. PLEASE GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY”.\n\nOutgoing Director-General Davie and BBC chair Samir Shah spoke to staff for 40 minutes. Davie admitted a “mistake” in the Panorama documentary and said that pressure following criticism of the film had contributed to his decision to resign. However, he also sounded a defiant note, and told staff, “I think we’ve got to fight for our journalism.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/venezuela-prepares-massive-deployment-of-forces-in-case-of-us-attack","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"22:23:17+00:00","title":"Venezuela prepares ‘massive deployment’ of forces in case of US attack","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Venezuela has announced a massive military deployment in response to the arrival of the US Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group in the Caribbean, sparking fears of a potential US attack.

armed forces in the event of an invasion or  military attack  by the United States.\n\nA statement shared by Minister of People’s Power for Defence Vladimir Padrino on Tuesday said that the preparations include the “massive deployment of ground, aerial, naval, riverine and missile forces”, as well as the participation of police, militias and citizens’ units.\n\nThe announcement comes as the arrival of a US aircraft carrier in the region fuels speculation of possible military action aimed at collapsing the government of Venezuelan President  Nicolas Maduro , a longtime US rival.\n\nTensions between the two countries have escalated since the return of US President Donald Trump for a second term in January.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Pentagon confirmed that the Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group — which includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier — had arrived in the Caribbean Sea, bearing at least 4,000 sailors as well as “tactical aircraft”.\n\nIn recent weeks, the US government has also surged troops to areas near the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, El Salvador, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago, for training exercises and other operations.\n\nThe Trump administration has framed such deployments as necessary “to disrupt illicit drug trafficking and protect the homeland”. Trump officials have also accused Maduro of masterminding the activities of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with a relatively modest presence in the US.\n\nBut Maduro and his allies have accused the US of “imperialistic” aims.\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether Venezuela is equipped to fend off any US military advances.\n\nExperts say the  Maduro government  has sought to project an image of military preparedness in the face of a large buildup of US forces in the Caribbean, but it could face difficulties from a lack of personnel and up-to-date equipment.\n\nWhile the government has used possible US intervention to rally support, Maduro is also struggling with widespread discontent at home and growing diplomatic isolation following a  contested election  in 2024, marred by allegations of widespread fraud and a crackdown on protesters.\n\nThe military buildup in the Caribbean region began after the start of a series of US military strikes on September 2.\n\nThe US has carried out at least 19 air strikes against alleged  drug-trafficking vessels  in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nTrump has suggested that land strikes “are going to be next”. But  when asked  in late October whether he was considering attacks within Venezuela, Trump replied, “No”.\n\nLegal experts say that a military attack on Venezuela would likely violate international law, and recent polling from the research firm YouGov suggests that about 47 percent of people in the US would oppose land attacks on Venezuelan territory. About 19 percent, meanwhile, say they would support such attacks.\n\nWhile Venezuela’s armed forces have expressed support for Maduro and said they would resist a US attack, the Reuters news agency has reported that the government has struggled to provide members of the armed forces with adequate food and supplies.\n\nThe use of additional paramilitary and police forces could represent an effort to plug the holes in Venezuela’s lacklustre military capacity. Reuters reported that a government memo includes plans for small units at about 280 locations, where they could use sabotage and guerrilla tactics for “prolonged resistance” against any potential US incursion."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/4/scientists-watch-flare-with-10-trillion-suns-light-from-massive-black-hole","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-04","timeOfPublication":"15:09:09+00:00","title":"Scientists watch flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists have recorded the most energetic flare ever observed from a supermassive black hole, which briefly emitted light equivalent to 10 trillion suns.

flare with 10 trillion suns’ light from massive black hole\n\nScientists have documented the most energetic flare ever observed emanating from a supermassive black hole, a cataclysmic event that briefly shone with the light of 10 trillion suns.\n\nThe new findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy, with astronomer Matthew Graham of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) leading the study.\n\nThe phenomenal burst of energy was likely triggered when an unusually large star wandered too close to the black hole and was violently shredded and swallowed.\n\n“However it happened, the star wandered close enough to the supermassive black hole that it was ‘spaghettified’ – that is, stretched out to become long and thin, due to the gravity of the supermassive black hole strengthening as you get very close to it. That material then spiralled around the supermassive black hole as it fell in,” said astronomer and study co-author KE Saavik Ford.\n\nThe supermassive black hole was unleashed by a black hole roughly 300 million times the mass of the sun residing inside a faraway galaxy, about 11 billion light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nThe star, estimated to be between 30 and 200 times the mass of the sun, was turned into a stream of gas that heated up and shined intensely as it spiralled into oblivion.\n\nAlmost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its centre. But scientists still aren’t sure how they form.\n\nFirst spotted in 2018 by the Palomar Observatory, operated by the Caltech, the flare took about three months to reach its peak brightness, becoming roughly 30 times more luminous than any previously recorded event of its kind. It is still ongoing, but diminishing in luminosity, with the entire process expected to take about 11 years to complete.\n\nBecause of how far away the black hole is located, observing the flash gives scientists a rare glimpse into the universe’s early epoch. Studying these immense, distant black holes helps researchers better understand how they form, how they influence their local stellar neighbourhoods, and the fundamental interactions that shaped the cosmos we know today."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/us-senate-votes-to-end-shutdown-why-democrats-are-upset-with-chuck-schumer","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:20:20+00:00","title":"US Senate votes to end shutdown: Why Democrats are upset with Chuck Schumer","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Senate voted to end a 40-day government shutdown by approving a bipartisan deal that funds parts of government until January 30, 2025, but excludes critical healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which serve 24 million Americans.

seven Democrats broke ranks with the party to vote for a Republican-led proposal to end the government shutdown without receiving concessions.\n\nThe deal does not resolve extending healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was one of the main demands from the Democrats.\n\nThe progressive section of the Democratic Party has blamed Schumer for the passing of the bill in the Senate on Monday, ending the longest shutdown in the country’s history.\n\n“He’s the leader of the Senate. This deal would never have happened if he had not blessed it. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of other senators who are saying that they kept Senator Schumer in the loop the whole time,” Democratic Representative Ro Khanna told CBS News.\n\nThe measure approved by the Senate would fund parts of the government until January 30, but excludes ACA health insurance subsidies that benefit some 24 million Americans.\n\nThe Senate Republicans, however, have agreed to hold another vote in December to decide on the healthcare subsidies. But it is not guaranteed that the healthcare subsidies will be approved.\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans hold 53 seats and Democrats have 47, but Republicans do not have the 60 votes needed to advance bills. Eight senators who caucus with the Democrats voted to move the Republican measure forward.\n\nDemocratic senators who voted for the motion to advance the bill included Dick Durbin of Illinois; Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire; John Fetterman of Pennsylvania; Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada; and Tim Kaine of Virginia.\n\nIndependent Senator Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, also voted in favour of the measure.\n\nSchumer, 74, did not vote in favour of the measure on Monday, but he is being accused by the party leaders of allowing the centrist Democrats to strike a deal with the Senate Republicans.\n\nIn his Senate speech on Monday, Schumer raised the issue of healthcare, saying, “The American people will not forget Donald Trump’s cruelty and heartlessness over the past six weeks,” Schumer said.\n\nBut progressive Democrats have not absolved him for failing to stop the defections.\n\n“Leadership is about changing and adapting when there is real need, and unless we hear that, we will fail to meet the moment,” Democratic Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin said in a statement.\n\nRepresentative Khanna wrote on X on Monday, “Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced.”\n\nIn another interview with an online US politics show, Khanna slammed Schumer for his stance on Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, as well as his support for the 2003 Iraq war.\n\n“You’ve had Schumer cheerleading the Iraq War, cheerleading a blank cheque to [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, betraying us on the first shutdown … and now he’s not even willing to fight!” he told the Breaking Points.\n\nKhanna added that Schumer should be “replaced” and the only reason more Democrats are not calling for it is that it would “offend a lot of donors”.\n\n“Are we gonna be beholden to the donors that have gotten us two terms of Donald Trump, or are we gonna listen to people?” he asked.\n\nWhile Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) of New York did not explicitly call out Schumer, she wrote in an X post on Monday: “The average ACA benefit is up to $550 a person/mo. People want us to hold the line for a reason. This is not a matter of appealing to a base. It’s about people’s lives. Working people want leaders whose word means something.”\n\nCongresswoman Rashida Tlaib said that “the Democratic Party needs leaders who fight and deliver for working people. Schumer should step down.”\n\n“After 40 days of holding firm, with public opinion and momentum on our side, establishment Democrats decided to cave to Trump,” left-wing activist Saikat Chakrabarti, who is running for Congress to represent San Francisco, said. “Schumer and the entire democratic leadership need to step down — and if they run for re-election, we need to primary them.”\n\nThe Senate vote came days after democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the  New York mayoral election  on the Democratic Party ticket. Mamdani was not endorsed by a number of Democrats, including Schumer.\n\nBut House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries defended Schumer. “Leader Schumer and Senate Democrats over the last seven weeks have waged a valiant fight on behalf of the American people,” he said on Monday.\n\nSince the beginning of the shutdown, Democratic senators voted 14 times not to reopen the government as they demanded the extension of the ACA tax credits.\n\nSchumer also faced the ire of party leaders when he backed a deal to avert a shutdown in March without getting concessions on healthcare subsidies.\n\nCongresswoman AOC, a member of the progressive wing of the party, had called the vote a “tremendous mistake”. “I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,” she had told reporters.\n\nWhile Democrats saw success in the recent local elections, emerging rifts now highlight a widening gap between the establishment Democrats and progressive and left-wing Democrats.\n\nSchumer can be removed from his position as the Senate minority leader in internal Democratic leadership elections, which would be held after the November 2026 Senate elections. The 45 Democratic senators and two independents who caucus with Democrats get to vote on this.\n\nEven if Schumer is removed as the Democratic leader in the Senate, his seat as a senator is secure until 2028."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/7/why-are-scientists-rushing-to-study-a-comet-from-deep-space","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-07","timeOfPublication":"07:49:12+00:00","title":"Why are scientists rushing to study a comet from deep space?","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Scientists are urgently studying the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, the third such object ever detected to pass through our solar system, after it made a close flyby of Mars in October 2025.

scrambling to study an ancient comet from another star system that entered the solar system this year, and which has already swung past Mars.\n\nDubbed 3I/ATLAS, the comet poses no threat to Earth or its neighbouring planets, but has aroused immense interest as space agencies train their sights on what is only one of three interstellar objects detected by scientists.\n\nHere is what we know about the object that is intriguing scientists:\n\nThe comet is only the third interstellar object ever recorded to pass through Earth’s solar system from another star. Comets are celestial bodies made of ice, dust and gas which orbit the sun. They are considered remnants from when the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July by scientist Larry Dennau of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope team, located in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The project is funded by NASA and is operated by researchers at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy.\n\nBefore this, 1I/’Oumuamua, a rocky, cigar-shaped object, was discovered by Canada’s Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2019, 2I/Borisov, a “rogue comet” – one that is not bound by gravity to any particular star system, so is travelling freely through space – was discovered by the Crimean astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea.\n\nComets are typically named after their human or station founders. The “I” in their names stands for “interstellar”, meaning that it has originated from another solar system.\n\nIt zipped past Mars earlier in October, coming within 29 million km (18 million miles) of the red planet at a breakneck speed of 310,000km/h (193,000mph).\n\nThe comet made its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and is expected to pass closest to Earth in December, when it will be about 270 million km (170 million miles) away, according to NASA. It will still be farther from Earth than the sun, which is 150 million km (93 million miles) away.\n\nA host of spacecraft and other assets have already set eyes on the celestial visitor, particularly as its current trajectory has hidden it behind the sun, making it untrackable from Earth for now. NASA notes that it will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.\n\nScientists are eager to understand more about the comet’s actual size and physical properties.\n\nAside from the Hubble telescope, other space assets owned by NASA will track, or are already tracking, the comet and relaying information about it, including:\n\nSeparately, the ESA’s Juice spacecraft, launched in 2023 and heading to Jupiter and its icy moons, will also keep an eye on the zipping interloper throughout November.\n\nUsing these multiple resources, researchers have been able to capture clear enough images of the object to determine that the object is indeed a comet, as indicated by the hyperbolic shape of its orbital path, that is, the fact that the object does not follow a closed orbital path around the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe NASA Hubble Space Telescope first captured images in July showing that the comet has a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust coming off its solid, icy nucleus, according to the agency.\n\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope put the comet’s nucleus at no more than 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across. It could be as small as 440 metres (1,444 feet), according to NASA.\n\n3I/Atlas’s coma – the fuzzy halo which appears around comets – is full of carbon dioxide, meaning it must have formed somewhere very cold, and therefore quite far from its star, Darryl Seligman, a planetary scientist at Michigan State University, told US Magazine, Scientific American."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/3/how-will-limited-us-nuclear-tests-avoid-any-explosions","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-03","timeOfPublication":"12:27:39+00:00","title":"How will ‘limited’ US nuclear tests avoid any explosions?","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article addresses the controversy sparked by President Donald Trump's announcement to restart U.S. nuclear weapon testing, which has been clarified by Energy Secretary Chris Wright as involving only noncritical, non-explosive component tests—such as subcritical experiments and system evaluations—without any nuclear detonations.

These are what we call noncritical explosions.”\n\nWright explained that for now, only the components of nuclear weapons will be tested to ensure they work properly and can trigger a nuclear explosion. He said these tests will be conducted on new systems to ensure that replacement nuclear weapons are improvements on earlier models.\n\n“With our science and our computation power, we can simulate incredibly accurately exactly what will happen in a nuclear explosion,” Wright said. “Now, we simulate what were the conditions that delivered that and, as we change bomb designs, what will they deliver.”\n\nAccording to the website of the Washington, DC-based nonpartisan organisation Arms Control Association, several nonnuclear explosive techniques can be used for nuclear weapon development, monitoring and maintenance. These can also include “subcritical” experiments, which use plutonium but avoid nuclear chain reactions.\n\n“In this context, ‘noncritical’ nuclear tests involve testing of nuclear weapons delivery systems or components but not the detonation of a nuclear warhead,” Georgia Cole, a research analyst at the International Security Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Noncritical tests typically take place in laboratories or testing facilities, often using advanced computer simulations to assess the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads without detonation. There are also ‘subcritical’ tests, which are nonnuclear explosions carried out underground, often in former nuclear test sites.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform: “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.” Trump signed an executive order in September to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War.\n\nTrump added in his post that while the US has “more Nuclear Weapons than any other country”, China “will be even within 5 years”.\n\nTrump justified his testing decision by citing China’s rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal. The announcement came minutes before Trump’s  meeting  with Chinese President Xi Jinping which resulted in a truce on tariffs and some Chinese export restrictions of rare earth metals.\n\nOn Sunday, during an appearance on the CBS News programme 60 Minutes, Trump said in reference to nuclear weapons: “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. You know, we’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it.”\n\nTrump added: “We’re gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing.”\n\nHowever, none of the countries Trump mentioned has openly conducted nuclear weapons tests in recent years, and he did not provide any evidence to support his claims. It is also unclear why he believes China could catch up with the far larger US arsenal of nuclear warheads in just five years.\n\n“There is no credible evidence that Russia, China or Pakistan are conducting explosive nuclear tests. The only country to have tested a nuclear weapon in the 21st century is North Korea, which has observed a self-declared moratorium since 2018,” Cole said.\n\n“While all nuclear-armed states routinely test their delivery systems, such as missiles, there is no indication that any have resumed nuclear detonations.”\n\nNine states have nuclear arms: the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) yearbook report published in January, Russia has the highest number of total warheads at 4,309.\n\nRussia is followed by the US, which has 3,700 warheads. China has 600. France has 290. The UK has 225. India has 180. Pakistan has 170. Israel has 90, and North Korea has 50.\n\nA SIPRI report from June stated that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing more rapidly than any other country’s, increasing by about 100 warheads every year since 2023. A report published by the Pentagon in December estimated that China would likely have 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.\n\nThe US has retired 1,477 nuclear warheads while Russia has retired 1,150. A retired warhead is one that has been removed from a country’s military arsenal and is awaiting dismantlement. According to a report published in March by the Federation of American Scientists, a US-based think tank, the retired warheads “are still relatively intact”, however.\n\n“In some cases, retired warheads could technically be restored, depending on how far they are through the dismantlement process. However, this can be a lengthy and resource-intensive process. More commonly, states may reuse components from older warheads in the production or refurbishment of a new weapon,” Cole said.\n\nThe US  began testing nuclear weapons  in 1945 with the first detonation taking place over New Mexico’s desert. The last time it tested nuclear weapons was more than 30 years ago in 1992. In total, the US has conducted 1,032 nuclear tests, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests – the last one in 1990. Russia, which inherited the Soviet nuclear arsenal, has not conducted any nuclear tests.\n\nChina has conducted 45 tests and last tested nuclear weapons in 1996.\n\nFrance last tested nuclear weapons in 1996. It conducted 210 tests from 1945 to 1996. The UK conducted 45 nuclear tests from 1952 with the last one conducted in 1991.\n\nMost countries  have ceased nuclear weapons testing after signing the global Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was introduced in 1996.\n\nSince then, 10 nuclear tests have taken place: two by India and two by Pakistan in 1998 and six by North Korea in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016 (twice) and 2017, according to the UN. India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed the CTBT.\n\nThe US did sign the CTBT in 1996 but did not ratify it. Russia signed the CTBT in 1996 and ratified it in 2000, but in 2023, President Vladimir Putin withdrew Russia’s ratification of the treaty.\n\nWhen a country signs a treaty, it signals its general agreement with the treaty’s terms and its intention to adhere to it in the future. Only upon ratification does the treaty become legally binding for that country under international law.\n\nPolitical and scientific authorities in the US have asserted that the US does not need to conduct new nuclear tests.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is a semiautonomous agency within the US Department of Energy. The agency oversees nuclear weapons security, maintenance and stockpile stewardship. The NNSA has repeatedly made it clear that the US does not need new tests.\n\nThe agency’s new administrator, Brandon Williams, said during his Senate confirmation hearing in April: “The United States continues to observe its 1992 nuclear test moratorium and since 1992 has assessed that the deployed nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure and effective without nuclear explosive testing.”\n\nWilliams added that every year, national security lab directors and the commander of the US Strategic Command review the nuclear stockpile to decide if underground nuclear testing is necessary. Previous NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby also stated that new testing was not necessary, according to a 2023 interview with the Arms Control Association.\n\nIf the US breaks this moratorium on testing nuclear weapons – rather than just their components – other countries are likely to follow suit, experts said.\n\n“If the US were to resume explosive nuclear testing, other powers would almost certainly respond in kind. Russia has already stated that it would mirror any US tests, and such moves could prompt China and North Korea to follow. The result would be the collapse of a 30-year moratorium on nuclear testing, undoing decades of restraint and sharply increasing global nuclear risks,” Cole said.\n\nShe added that Wright’s clarification about the tests being noncritical is an important one. “Had [Trump] been referring to explosive tests, as many initially assumed, that would represent a dramatic policy shift and a serious escalation in nuclear tensions.”"},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/science-and-technology/","dateOfPublication":"1111-11-20","timeOfPublication":"11:00:00-11:59","title":"Science and Technology | Today's latest from Al Jazeera","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores a range of science and technology developments, from concerns over the wellness industry's profitability and misinformation regarding Tylenol and autism, to geopolitical tensions involving nuclear weapons claims by Trump against Russia, China, and Pakistan.

challenges US ban on transgender TSA officers conducting pat-downs","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A transgender TSA officer, Danielle Mittereder, has filed a federal lawsuit alleging sex discrimination against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for implementing a policy that bars transgender officers from conducting pat-downs or serving as witnesses in private screening areas. The policy, introduced in February 2025 to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes, contradicts a prior 2021 directive allowing officers to work according to their gender identity.

In addition, transgender officers will no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveller elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area”.\n\nUntil February, the TSA assigned officers work consistent with their gender identity, based on a 2021 management directive. The agency told the AP that it rescinded this directive to comply with Trump’s January 20 executive order.\n\nAlthough transgender officers “shall continue to be eligible to perform all other security screening functions consistent with their certifications” and must attend all required training, they will not be allowed to demonstrate how to conduct pat-downs as part of their training or while training others, according to the internal documents.\n\nA transgender officer at Dulles international airport, Danielle Mittereder, alleged in her lawsuit filed on Friday that the new policy, which also bars her from using TSA facility restrooms that align with her gender identity, violates civil rights law.\n\n“Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits Plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialised certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities, and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,” the complaint says.\n\nMittereder declined to speak with the AP, but her lawyer, Jonathan Puth, called the TSA policy “terribly demeaning and 100 percent illegal”.\n\nTSA spokesperson Russell Read declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But he said the new policy directs that “male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers, and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs”.\n\nThe legal battle comes amid mounting reports of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during Trump’s second administration. It is also happening at a time when the TSA’s ranks are already stretched thin due to the ongoing government shutdown that has left thousands of agents working without pay.\n\nOther transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder.\n\nKai Regan worked for six years at Harry Reid international airport in Las Vegas before leaving in July, in large part because of the new policy.\n\nWorried that he would be fired for his gender identity, he retired earlier than planned rather than “waiting for the bomb to drop”.\n\nRegan, who is not involved in the Virginia case, transitioned from female to male in 2021. He said he had conducted pat-downs on men without issue until the policy change.\n\n“It made me feel inadequate at my job, not because I can’t physically do it but because they put that on me,” said the 61-year-old.\n\nSkye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organisation that has repeatedly challenged the second Trump administration in court, called the TSA policy “arbitrary and discriminatory”.\n\n“There’s no evidence or data we’re aware of to suggest that a person can’t perform their duties satisfactorily as a TSA agent based on their gender identity,” Perryman said.\n\nThe DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that its policy is discriminatory.\n\n“Does the AP want female travellers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin asked in a written response to questions by the AP. “What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritise mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travellers.”\n\nAirport security expert and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor Sheldon H Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, said that the practice of matching the officer’s sex to the passenger’s is aimed at minimising passenger discomfort during screening.\n\nTravellers can generally request another officer if they prefer, he added.\n\nDeciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty”, Jacobson said. But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of the TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays.\n\n“It could be a bit of an inconvenience, but it would not inhibit the operation of the airport security checkpoint,” Jacobson said.\n\nThe TSA’s policy for passengers is that they be screened based on physical appearance as judged by an officer, according to internal documents. If a passenger corrects an officer’s assumption, “the traveller should be patted down based on his/her declared sex”.\n\nFor passengers who tell an officer “that they are neither a male nor female”, the policy says officers must advise “that pat-down screening must be conducted by an officer of the same sex” and contact a supervisor if concerns persist.\n\nThe documents also say that transgender officers “will not be adversely affected” in pay, promotions or awards, and that the TSA “is committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation”.\n\nBut the lawsuit argues otherwise, saying the policy impedes Mittereder’s career prospects because “all paths toward advancement require that she be able to perform pat-downs and train others to do so”, Puth said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Mittereder started in her role in June 2024 and never received complaints related to her job performance, including pat-down responsibilities. Supervisors awarded her the highest-available performance rating, and “have praised her professionalism, skills, knowledge, and rapport with fellow officers and the public”, the lawsuit said.\n\n“This is somebody who is really dedicated to her job and wants to make a career at TSA,” Puth said. “And while her gender identity was never an issue for her in the past, all of a sudden, it’s something that has to be confronted every single day.”\n\nBeing unable to perform her full job duties has caused Mittereder to suffer fear, anxiety and depression, as well as embarrassment and humiliation by forcing her to disclose her gender identity to co-workers, the complaint says.\n\nIt adds that the ban places an additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties.\n\nAmerican Federation of Government Employees national president Everett Kelley urged the TSA leadership to reconsider the policy “for the good of its workforce and the flying public”.\n\n“This policy does nothing to improve airport security,” Kelley said, “and in fact could lead to delays in the screening of airline passengers since it means there will be fewer officers available to perform pat-down searches”."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism","dateOfPublication":"2025-10-29","timeOfPublication":"23:36:41+00:00","title":"RFK Jr walks back Trump administration’s claims linking Tylenol and autism","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Robert F.

Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials.

It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He  falsely  said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/11/typhoon-fung-wong-leaves-philippines-with-10-dead-1-4-million-displaced","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"06:50:12+00:00","title":"Typhoon Fung-wong leaves Philippines with 10 dead, 1.4 million displaced","category":"Environment & Climate","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Typhoon Fung-wong, known as Super Typhoon Uwan in the Philippines, devastated the northern region of the country, killing at least 10 people and displacing over 1.4 million individuals.

upcoming  social media ban  for children under 16 years old will include the online forum Reddit and livestreaming platform Kick in addition to seven other well-known sites, according to the country’s online safety commissioner.\n\nThe social media ban will go into effect on December 10 and will also restrict access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube, Communications Minister Anika Wells said on Wednesday.\n\n“Online platforms use technology to target children with chilling control. We are merely asking that they use that same technology to keep children safe online,” Wells said.\n\n“We have met with several of the social media platforms in the past month so that they understand there is no excuse for failure to implement this law,” Wells told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“We want children to have a childhood, and we want parents to have peace of mind,” she said.\n\nSocial media platforms have had 12 months to prepare for the ban since  Australia passed its landmark  online safety legislation in November last year.\n\nInitial discussions focused primarily around Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, but the list was later expanded, and Wells said the list could continue to change.\n\nWhile more than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last year opposing the age limit ban as a “blunt” instrument,  Canberra’s move  is being closely watched by countries that share concerns about the impacts of online platforms on children.\n\n“Delaying children’s access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen forces of harmful and deceptive design features such as opaque algorithms and endless scroll,” eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\n\nInman Grant said she would work with academics to evaluate the impact of the ban, including whether children sleep or interact more or become more physically active as a result of the restrictions on using social media.\n\n“We’ll also look for unintended consequences, and we’ll be gathering evidence” so others can learn from Australia’s ban, Inman Grant said.\n\nCritics have questioned how the restrictions will be enforced because users cannot be “compelled” to submit government IDs for an age check, according to a government fact sheet.\n\nDiscussions are under way with platforms about how to comply with the new rules, the commissioner said, while failure to comply could lead to civil fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.1m).\n\nNews that Australia would add more names to the list of banned platforms came as French authorities said they had opened an investigation into the social media platform TikTok and the risks of its algorithms pushing young people into suicide.\n\nParis prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the probe was in response to a parliamentary committee’s request to open a criminal inquiry into TikTok’s possible responsibility for endangering the lives of its young users.\n\nBeccuau said a report by the committee had noted “insufficient moderation of TikTok, its ease of access by minors and its sophisticated algorithm, which could push vulnerable individuals towards suicide by quickly trapping them in a loop of dedicated content”.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Paris police cybercrime unit will look into the offence of providing a platform for “propaganda in favour of products, objects, or methods recommended as means of committing suicide”, which is punishable by three years in prison.\n\nThe unit will also look into the offence of enabling “illegal transactions by an organised gang”, punishable by 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million euros ($1.2m).\n\nWith more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has come under fire from governments in Europe and the United States in recent years.\n\nConcerns raised over the platform have included content encouraging suicide, self-harm or an unhealthy body image as well as its potential use for foreign political interference.\n\nA TikTok spokesman told the French news agency AFP in September that the company “categorically rejects the deceptive presentation” by French MPs, saying it was being made a “scapegoat” for broader societal issues."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkypezze8o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:40:28.449+00:00","title":"US aircraft carrier group arrives near Latin America","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A US naval strike group centered on the USS Gerald R Ford has arrived in the Caribbean, ordered by former President Donald Trump to counter alleged drug trafficking and regional instability.

in the Caribbean, the US Navy has confirmed.\n\nThe arrival of the strike group, which was ordered to the region by President Donald Trump last month, comes amid ongoing strikes against alleged drug boats and tensions with Venezuela.\n\nThe US has so far carried out at least 19 strikes against boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, killing at least 76 people.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials have accused the US of \"fabricating\" a crisis and seeking to topple the country's left-wing socialist government.\n\nThe aircraft carrier movement also comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro, whom Trump has  characterised as \"a thug and a bad guy\" .\n\nPetro on Tuesday ordered his country's public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with US agencies until the boat attacks in the Caribbean stop.\n\nHe wrote on X that the fight against drugs \"must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people\".\n\nIn a statement, the US Navy said that the strike group entered the area of responsibility of US Southern Command - which oversees Latin America and the Caribbean - on 11 November.\n\nThe force includes the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, which itself includes more than 4,000 sailors and dozens of aircraft. The strike force also includes guided-missile destroyers and various other vessels.\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the force will \"bolster US capacity to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit actors and activities that disrupt the safety and prosperity\" of the US and will help \"disrupt narcotics trafficking\" and criminal groups in the region.\n\nThe carrier group is joining substantial military forces already deployed in the region, including thousands of troops, a nuclear-powered submarine and military aircraft based in Puerto Rico.\n\nCollectively, they form the largest US presence arrayed in and around Latin America in decades.\n\nThe US has continued to launch strikes on alleged drug boats in the region. The Trump administration says the attacks are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US.\n\nEarlier this week, the US announced it had conducted two additional strikes in the Pacific, killing six people.\n\nIn addition to fueling tensions with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela, the strikes have led to concerns from some observers about violations of human rights and due process.\n\nColombia's Petro has also faced criticism as well as US sanctions over his reluctant response to drug-trafficking groups.\n\nOn Tuesday, Colombia's military officers revealed that they had launched their own deadly airstrikes against a drug-running guerrilla group in the Amazon region, killing 19, AFP reported.\n\nEarlier in November, Trump downplayed suggestions he was planning to topple the Venezuelan government or start a war.\n\nIn an interview with CBS - the BBC's US news partner - Trump said that \"every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"\n\nPushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that...

2025-11-11T15:56:32.266+00:00\n\nTitle: Biologist bitten in head by shark hopes to meet animal again\n\nMauricio Hoyos still remembers the pressure that the jaws of a female Galapagos shark, over 3m (10ft) in length, exerted on his skull.\n\nThe animal had lunged at him with astonishing speed, giving him barely enough time to duck his head in a last ditch effort to protect his jugular vein.\n\n\"When it closed its jaw, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then, after what I think was a second, it opened it again and it let me go,\" Hoyos told BBC Mundo from his home in Baja California, Mexico, a little over month after surviving the incident.\n\nHoyos, a marine biologist with over 30 years of experience studying sharks in their natural habitat, was on a research trip in Costa Rica when he was attacked by the shark in September.\n\nLess than two months on, and still bearing the scars from the attack on his face, he describes his recovery as \"incredible\" - and says he even hopes to encounter his assailant again.\n\nFor Hoyos, what happened to him that day in the waters off Cocos Island is the result of normal animal behaviour when confronted with a perceived threat.\n\n\"In this case, this bite was like a dog's,\" he says.\n\n\"Have you ever seen how dogs, when another dog gets too close, throw a quick bite? It doesn't hurt it, but it calms the other dog down.\"\n\nHoyos - who along with his colleagues attaches acoustic tags to sharks to help pinpoint their mating and spawning grounds as part of his work - was alerted to the shark's presence in the water by tourists.\n\nIt was at a depth of 40m, and Hoyos told the captain of the boat he was on that he would be there \"for a maximum of five minutes\".\n\nHe then entered the water and began his slow descent.\n\nHoyos recalls encountering the shark: \"This giant female, measuring between 3 and 3.5m (11.5ft), swam by and headed toward the bottom, and I positioned myself to tag her at the base of her dorsal fin.\"\n\nBut Hoyos, who has tagged many kinds of sharks in his decades-long career, says this animal reacted differently to others.\n\n\"Obviously the tip - the metal tip attached to the cable hanging from the probe - goes in, and unlike the other sharks I've tagged that immediately flee, she turns around and stares at me,\" he recalls.\n\n\"I saw her little eye looking at me, and I saw her very calmly turning around.\"\n\nHoyos says he held the shark's gaze as it swam away - but then, suddenly, out of nowhere, it lunged at him.\n\n\"I lowered my head, and what I felt was its lower jaw digging into my cheek and its upper jaw into my head. I was there, I imagine for a second, no more, inside its jaw, and then it simply opened it again.\"\n\n\"When it closed it, I felt the pressure of the bite, and then it just let me go,\" he marvels.\n\nThe Galapagos shark's 29 serrated teeth not only left Hoyos with deep wounds to his face and head, but also severed the air line of his diving apparatus.\n\nHe had survived the shark attack but was still in mortal danger.\n\nIn addition, one of the teeth had torn his diving mask, and the blood-tinged water was further blurring his already limited visibility.\n\n\"When I realised that no air was coming out of the hose, I grabbed a second one we have, which we call an octopus, that is used to give air to someone else if they need it,\" he tells BBC Mundo.\n\n\"But then I realised that the regulator wasn't working and was blowing air instead of regulating it, so I had to remember my training and start regulating it with my lips.\"\n\nBleeding, blinded, and with the air escaping, Hoyos calculated that he had less than a minute to reach the surface.\n\n\"Since I couldn't see anything, what I did was look for the light that I knew was the surface. I started swimming upwards, in a very coordinated manner, because I wanted to avoid erratic movements that would attract the shark.\"\n\nAfter Hoyos reached the surface, a young man pulled him aboard the boat, and when the captain saw his condition, he called the park ranger station to report the incident.\n\nHoyos explained that he didn't feel the pain of his injuries until much later.\n\n\"Obviously, I had adrenaline in my system, but the bite didn't hurt that much. What hurt the most was the impact: when the shark bit me - an animal 3m long and at that speed - it was like being hit by a car. In fact, I ended up with a huge bruise all over my jaw; I thought it was broken.\"\n\nWhen they docked, a team of paramedics was ready to provide him with emergency care.\n\nHoyos was lucky: as well as surviving the attack and the subsequent ascent, none of his wounds became infected, and the healing process took less time than anyone could have imagined.\n\n\"The doctors told me it was amazing: the attack happened on 27 [September], I had a 34-hour trip, they performed a surgical debridement [removing damaged tissue], and two days later they were already evaluating whether they could perform reconstructive surgery.\"\n\nIt could have been far worse for Hoyos. According to the doctors, a young man who survived a Galapagos shark attack in the same area in 2017 had to remain in a hyperbaric chamber for almost a month because his wounds weren't healing properly.\n\n\"They told me my recovery had been incredible. After the surgery, the doctors confessed how worried they had been about an infection, because being on my face, it was a direct path to the brain.\"\n\nSmiling broadly, Hoyos adds that he is already planning to get back into the water and has a diving trip booked for 14 November.\n\nAnd he says that after having survived an attack of this magnitude he has even more respect for the animals he studies.\n\n\"Many people think the oceans would be better off without sharks, but they really say that because they don't understand the crucial role sharks play in maintaining their delicate balance.\"\n\nPointing to the large scar on his cheek, he says: \"This is the proof that this female spared my life; I can't put it any other way. And this will allow me to continue speaking well of sharks and advocating for their conservation in the future.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Galapagos shark that had Hoyos in its jaws continues its natural life in the depths, and he hopes to see it again. And since he was able to mark it before it attacked him, that possibility exists.\n\n\"In January I'm going to Cocos Island, we have a trip from the 20 to 27. And obviously I'm going to Roca Sucia [where the attack happened], I'm going to dive down there,\" he says, undeterred."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0z2q2g2ro","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"20:56:58.853+00:00","title":"Prime Minister will fight any attempt to replace him, friends say","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article reports on growing concerns within the Labour Party that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer may face an imminent leadership challenge from within, with several cabinet members and backbenchers, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, being discussed as potential successors.

fight any challenge to his leadership from Labour MPs.\n\nThere are fears from those loyal to Sir Keir Starmer that his job might be under immediate threat, perhaps as soon as shortly after the Budget in a fortnight's time.\n\nCritics say it is evidence that Downing Street is \"in full bunker mode\" which \"won't help the government out of the hole we're in.\"\n\nFriends of Sir Keir are deeply worried about what they see as plotting going on to try to replace him and are seeking to make clear what they see as the grave risks of a leadership challenge.\n\nThose names being discussed by Labour MPs as potential candidates to displace Sir Keir include some of his closest cabinet allies, especially Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.\n\nSome also speculate about the ambitions of Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, and backbenchers including the former transport secretary Louise Haigh.\n\n\"He will fight this,\" one minister said, before making reference to a key by-election in 2021 which Labour lost to the Conservatives, prompting Sir Keir to consider resigning as Labour's leader.\n\n\"This is not a Hartlepool moment,\" they added.\n\n\"He is one of only two people alive who have won a general election for Labour. It'd be madness to run against him after 17 months.\"\n\nFor months now, plenty in the Labour Party have acknowledged that the government faces a likely crunch point after devolved elections in Scotland and Wales and local elections in many parts of England next May.\n\nLabour is widely expected to do badly in those elections, but there are growing concerns from some in the party that it can't wait until then to contemplate a change of leader.\n\nDowning Street is aware of the potential imminence of such a threat to them.\n\nOne senior Labour MP told us: \"It's all very well to say wait for the locals, but that's my activist base I'm sending into the gunfire. I can't lose all my councillors.\"\n\nAnother Labour source said: \"The list of reasons for people to move after the Budget are growing by the day.\n\n\"If Wes is brave and moves he may well be rewarded by being prime minister by Christmas.\"\n\nThe ambition of Streeting is seen with particular suspicion from some loyal to the prime minister.\n\nA spokesman for Streeting told the BBC \"these claims are categorically untrue\".\n\n\"Wes's focus has entirely been on cutting waiting lists for the first time in 15 years, recruiting 2,500 more GPs, and rebuilding the NHS that saved his life,\" he added.\n\nThe health secretary is due to do a round of interviews on Wednesday morning which were due to be focused on his plans for shaking up the NHS in England.\n\nA government source said Downing Street \"has gone into full bunker mode, turning on their most loyal cabinet members for absolutely no reason\".\n\n\"Unfortunately there is a pattern of Keir's team briefing against his own people - they did it to Angela, Lisa, Lucy, now it's Wes's turn,\" the source added.\n\n\"A circular firing squad won't help the government out of the hole we're in,\" a government source said - referring to the former and current deputy leaders, Angela Rayner and Lucy Powell respectively, and the Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy.\n\nThe prime minister's supporters are telling Labour MPs they should be careful what they wish for.\n\nThey argue a leadership contest would plunge the party into the chaos associated with the final years of the Conservative Party's stint in office which came to an end last year, and install a leader who does not have their own mandate from the country.\n\nThey are trying to convince their colleagues that a contest could destabilise the international markets too, and would jeopardise the good relationship the prime minister has established with President Trump.\n\nBut others, including some ministers, fret about what they perceive to be the desperate position the government is in.\n\n\"It's terrible. He [Starmer] is hated out there. It is worse than it got under Corbyn. I don't see how this is sustainable until May,\" one minister said.\n\nOpinion  polls suggest  Sir Keir is deeply unpopular, perhaps even the  most unpopular British prime minister  in the history of modern opinion polling.\n\nPolls also suggest the Labour Party has commanded the support of  no more than a fifth of the electorate  in recent months.\n\nA cabinet minister who is supportive of the prime minister sums up the mood among their colleagues as they see it: \"There are those who see it as a choice between this Labour government and perfection.\n\n\"The closer they can nudge us towards the policies they see as perfect, the happier they are.\n\n\"But the choice isn't between us and perfection, it's between us and Reform.\"\n\nThe rise of Reform UK has concentrated minds in Downing Street in recent months.\n\nThe prime minister sees Labour's battle with Reform leader Nigel Farage as generation-defining – and the prospect of losing to Reform at a general election as vastly worse than Labour losses to the Conservatives.\n\nHe believes he has the energy and wherewithal to take on and defeat Farage.\n\nBut a growing number of his colleagues are not convinced.\n\n\"We are not like the Tories.

plan\n\nStarbucks has been working hard to bring back customers, promising faster service and a return its coffeehouse roots, with ceramic mugs and hand-written notes.\n\nBut though sales show signs of perking up, the company is still wrestling with a years-long labour fight that threatens to hamper its turnaround.\n\nPicket lines could greet customers collecting their morning latte at some US stores on Thursday,   as the company faces another strike by unionised baristas, calling for better pay and increased staffing.\n\nThe walkout, expected to affect stores in at least 25 cities, is the third major strike to hit the company in the US since the union, Starbucks Workers United, launched four years ago.\n\nBaristas and their union say the new turnaround policies, have only added to their workload.\n\n\"Every single day at this company, as of recently, has been very, very difficult to be a barista,\" said Michelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the union, which says it represents workers at more than 600 stores in the US.\n\n\"You should not be evolving to the point of running your workers to the ground,\" said Eisen, who worked as a barista for 15 years before leaving Starbucks this May.\n\nStarbucks says it does not expect the strike to disrupt operations at the \"vast majority\" of its more than 10,000 company-operated stores in the US.\n\nBut the action, timed to coincide with Starbucks' Red Cup day, a major holiday sales event, risks returning unwanted scrutiny to the company at a delicate moment.\n\nIn recent years the brand has faced   consumer boycotts, a wave of new competitors and a customer backlash over high prices, as well as turmoil in its leadership ranks.\n\nThe arrival last year of new chief executive Brian Niccol, a veteran of successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, raised hopes he could do the same for Starbucks. Investors sent the chain's shares up 24%.\n\nHe quickly embarked on changes, part of what he called his \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. He banned non-customers from bathrooms, enforced a stricter dress code for staff and re-introduced comfy seating that he said would help restore the chain's appeal.\n\nAt the same time, Starbucks has outlined plans to invest more than $500m to improve coffeehouse staffing and training.\n\nProgress has been slow. Last month, Starbucks reported 1% growth in sales at global stores open at least one year - its first quarterly increase in almost two years. But in the US, sales were flat.\n\n\"We have more work to do, but we're building momentum,\" Mr Niccol said on a recent call with analysts.\n\nBut the new strategy has been accompanied by hundreds of store closures, thousands of layoffs and the sale of a 60% stake in its China business, and labour tensions have continued to fester.\n\nStarbucks Workers United leaders say relations improved last year, but that contract discussions stalled when Mr Niccol - who was in charge of Chipotle when it faced complaints of labour rights violations - took the helm of the company last September.\n\nEven after the two sides agreed to bring in a mediator in January, they remained at odds over pay, staffing and hundreds of unresolved charges of unfair labour practice.\n\nA union spokesperson said Starbucks has offered no pay raises in the first year of a contract, then 2% in the years following, which he said fails to account for inflation and the cost of healthcare. Baristas overwhelmingly voted down the contract offer in April.\n\nThe company, on the other hand, blames the union for stalled talks. The union's demands for pay increases would \"significantly affect store operations and customer experience\", Sara Kelly, the company's chief partner officer, said in a statement last week.\n\n\"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" Jaci Anderson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said in a statement.\n\n\"Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail,\" she added, pointing to low staff turnover rates, and pay and benefits, that the company says add up to an average hourly wage of $30.\n\nUnionised coffeeshops account for only about 5% of all Starbucks stores that are directly owned by the corporation in the US, but union organisers say they have added roughly 100 more stores over the last 12 months.\n\nThis continued stand-off could pose both an operational and a reputational risk for the firm, say analysts.\n\nThe brand had already shown signs of being under pressure, said Laurence Newell, managing director in the Americas for Brand Finance, a consultancy that tracks brand strength. Starbucks fell to 45th place in its 2025 annual ranking - its lowest level since 2016 - driven in part by a decline in its reputation among customers.\n\n\"Happy customers have to come from happy employees,\" said Stephan Meier, a professor of business strategy at Columbia Business School. \"You can't do that top down.\"\n\nThis week, more than 80 Democrats in the House and Senate sent letters to Mr Niccol, accusing Starbucks of \"union-busting\" and urging the company to bargain in good faith.\n\nJoe Pine, management adviser and co-author of the \"Experience Economy\", said Mr Niccol had a lot on his plate, but he was \"surprised\" that he had allowed the issue to remain unresolved.\n\n\"This would seem to be one of the first things you need to do: you need to have your people on board,\" he said."},{"source":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/12/dozens-of-athletes-call-on-uefa-to-ban-israel-over-rights-abuses","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:15:49+00:00","title":"More than 70 athletes call on UEFA to ban Israel over rights abuses","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Over 70 athletes, including Paul Pogba, Anwar El Ghazi, Hakim Ziyech, and Adama Traore, have joined human rights groups such as the Hind Rajab Foundation and Gaza Tribunal in calling on UEFA to suspend Israel due to widespread human rights abuses, including genocide, apartheid, and the killing of at least 69,182 Palestinians in Gaza.

As many as 69,182 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli assault, including  421 footballers .\n\nThe war destroyed the sport’s infrastructure in Gaza, including stadiums and training facilities.\n\nMoreover, Israel continues to entrench its occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, imposing a regime that the International Court of Justice says is “tantamount to the crime of apartheid”.\n\nThe rights groups’ letter argued that Israel has used football to legitimise its occupation in those areas.\n\nThe country, for example, allows clubs from illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank to participate in its professional leagues, in an apparent violation of FIFA rules.\n\n“The participation of teams from illegal settlements in Israeli football leagues is a breach of fundamental principles of international law,” Tuesday’s letter read.\n\n“UEFA’s relationship with the IFA – providing funding and allowing Israeli teams to play in international tournaments – means that UEFA may also be facilitating these violations and may themselves be accountable.”\n\nIsraeli clubs’ participation in European football competitions has been a source of debate and controversy over the past two years.\n\nLast year, clashes between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv FC fans broke out in Amsterdam after Israeli hooligans were heard chanting “death to the Arabs”, attacking taxi drivers and removing Palestinian flags from the walls of private homes.\n\nIn October, a  ban on visiting  Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in a Europa League game against Aston Villa sparked a political crisis in the United Kingdom, as well as accusations of anti-Semitism.\n\n“This decision is based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the 2024 UEFA Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel-Aviv in Amsterdam,” the West Midlands Police said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nBut the government of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer was quick to oppose the police’s decision and dismiss the security considerations behind it, sparking criticism from Palestinian rights advocates.\n\n“We will not tolerate anti-Semitism on our streets,” Starmer said in a social media post in response to the ban.\n\n“The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”\n\nMaccabi Tel-Aviv, which sits in 34th place in the Europa League standings with one point from four games, ended up losing the match 2-0 to Aston Villa last week.\n\nTuesday’s letter to UEFA stressed that banning a country that violates international law would not be unprecedented; it is, in fact, the norm.\n\n“It is well-known that football governance bodies, such as UEFA, have historically suspended states from football for egregious violations of international law – apartheid South Africa, post-war Germany, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and  more recently, Russia ,” it said.\n\n“We urge you to follow international law and moral precedent and suspend Israel immediately.”"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mxylxw48yo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:25:31.953+00:00","title":"Israel has destroyed more than 1,500 buildings in Gaza since ceasefire","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Since the ceasefire agreement with Hamas began on 10 October 2023, Israel has destroyed over 1,500 buildings in areas of Gaza under its control, as revealed by satellite imagery analyzed by BBC Verify.

2025-11-12T00:25:31.953+00:00\n\nTitle: Israel has destroyed more than 1,500 buildings in Gaza since ceasefire\n\nIsrael has destroyed more than 1,500 buildings in areas of Gaza that have remained under its control since the ceasefire with Hamas started on 10 October, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show.\n\nThe new photos - the latest of which was taken on 8 November - show that entire neighbourhoods controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been levelled in less than a month, apparently through demolitions.\n\nThe actual number of destroyed buildings could be significantly higher, with satellite imagery for some areas being unavailable for BBC Verify's assessment.\n\nSome experts have argued that the demolitions may violate the terms of the ceasefire brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. But an IDF spokesperson told BBC Verify that it was acting \"in accordance with the ceasefire framework\".\n\nUS President Donald Trump's 20 point peace plan for Gaza - the basis for the ceasefire - stated \"all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended\". He has since repeatedly  stated that \"the war is over\" .\n\nBBC Verify's visual analysis of satellite imagery has found that the destruction of buildings in Gaza by the Israeli military has been continuing on a huge scale. We used a change detection algorithm to analyse radar images taken before and after the ceasefire to highlight changes, which might indicate destruction, then manually counted visibly destroyed buildings.\n\nWe looked at buildings destroyed behind the Yellow Line - a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. Under October's ceasefire deal Israel agreed to withdraw its forces to that marker, annotated by a yellow line on maps released by the IDF.\n\nMany of the razed buildings did not appear to be damaged prior to being destroyed, for example, in eastern Khan Younis, around Abasan al-Kabira.\n\nIt's hard to be conclusive from a satellite image taken from above, but these buildings did not have visible damage to their structure or tell tale signs like nearby rubble or changes to their outlines. There were houses with gardens, trees and some small orchards.\n\nA comparison between satellite images of this area captured at the start of the war in October 2023 with images captured around the date of the ceasefire shows little change to many buildings.\n\nLana Khalil used to live in Abasan al-Kabira before she was displaced to nearby al-Mawasi. She described her home as being a \"heaven\" and full of \"farms and vegetables\".\n\nNow, like so many other parts of Gaza, the area has been reduced to rubble.\n\n\"The Israeli military left nothing to us, they demolished everything,\" she said. Ms Khalil added that former residents could hear the demolition of the area \"from our tents in al-Mawasi\".\n\n\"Our hearts are broken,\" she said.\n\nIn another area, near al-Bayuk, east of the city of Rafah, satellite imagery tells the same story. Numerous buildings that seemed from above to be undamaged before the ceasefire have since been destroyed. Aerial footage of a huge explosion published at the start of November shows dust rising from the ruins of the neighbourhood.\n\nDestruction has also continued in Gaza City itself, in the eastern neighbourhood of Shejaiya as well as near the Indonesian hospital on the edge of Jabalia camp.\n\nEitan Shamir, ex-head of the National Security Doctrine Department in the Israel Ministry of Strategic Affairs, suggested that the IDF's actions were not a violation of the ceasefire terms, arguing that they don't apply to areas of the Strip behind the Yellow Line.\n\nVerified videos showing controlled demolitions and excavators tearing down buildings published to social media since the ceasefire have also been geolocated to areas behind the Yellow Line.\n\nThe IDF has defended its actions and a spokesperson said: \"According to the agreement, all terror infrastructure, including tunnels, is to be dismantled throughout Gaza. Israel is acting in response to threats, violations, and terror infrastructure.\"\n\nOn 18 October, Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that \"demilitarizing Gaza by destroying the terror tunnels and all terror infrastructure\" was a \"clear\" part of Israel's security policy.\n\nPoint 13 of Trump's peace plan published by the White House - the closest thing to publicly released terms of the ceasefire - stated that all \"military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt\".\n\nBut it also states the process of demilitarisation of Gaza will be \"under the supervision of independent monitors\".\n\n\"This is definitely a violation of the ceasefire,\" said Dr H A Hellyer, a RUSI Senior Associate Fellow. \"But [Washington] DC is unwilling to recognise it as such, insisting that the ceasefire has to hold, even when it isn't actually holding.\"\n\nBut Mr Shamir denied the IDF was breaching the ceasefire. He told BBC Verify that according to his sources within the IDF there was a view that: \"Hamas is allowed to do what it wants in the territory it controls, and Israel is allowed to do what it wants in the territory it controls.\"\n\nThe IDF was taking the view that it was unlikely Hamas would follow through with the second stage of the agreement, according to his sources.\n\n\"Therefore, the space must be prepared for the continuation of the fighting, so as not to leave [them] any options to ambush our soldiers.\" He also said that there were frequent attempts by Hamas to infiltrate beyond the Yellow Line and that there were still long sections of tunnel to be dealt with.\n\nSome analysts - such as Adil Haque, professor of law at Rutgers University - said Israel could be violating the laws of war, which prohibit the destruction of civilian property by an occupying power.\n\nHe noted that exceptions to the rule can only arise \"from military operations, that is, from combat or direct preparations for combat,\" arguing that during a ceasefire \"it is not plausible that such significant destruction of civilian property has been rendered absolutely necessary by military operations\".\n\nHugh Lovatt, Senior Policy Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said ultimately the demolitions could jeopardise the peace plan.\n\n\"The problem of Israeli demolitions will grow the longer Israel stays in the zone behind the Yellow Line.\n\n\"Ultimately, the sense that Israel is stalling its withdrawal and looking to create new permanent facts on the ground, as it has in the West Bank, will become an increasingly greater threat to the maintenance of the ceasefire.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Alex Murray\n\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3k7egvp3xo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"22:34:31.994+00:00","title":"Dominican Republic: 'Cascade of failures' causes nationwide blackout","category":"Science & Technology","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The Dominican Republic experienced a nationwide power blackout at 13:23 local time (17:23 GMT), caused by a substation failure that triggered a 'cascade of failures' across the power grid.

spending bill to end the longest-ever government shutdown, the budget fight now moves to the House of Representatives.\n\nThe lower chamber of Congress is expected to vote this week on the funding measure.\n\nUnlike in the Senate, if House Republicans stay united, they don't need any Democrats to pass the budget. But the margin for error is razor thin.\n\nHere are four potential hold-ups for the budget, before it can clear Congress and land on the president's desk for signing into law.\n\nA key sticking point throughout the shutdown has been a desire on the part of Democrats to attach to the spending bill a renewal of tax credits that make health insurance less expensive for 24 million Americans.\n\nSenate Republicans instead only agreed to grant Democrats a vote in December on whether to extend the subsidies –  something they had already offered weeks ago.\n\nAnd House Speaker Mike Johnson would not commit on Monday to allowing a vote in his chamber on the tax credits.\n\nThis entails a fair degree of political risk for Republicans, however. If they torpedo the subsidies, health coverage premiums could rocket, handing Democrats a ready-made campaign issue for next year's midterm elections.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, a conservative Republican congresswoman from Georgia, has broken ranks with President Donald Trump to warn that her party must ensure health insurance premiums do not spike.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the subsidies expiring by the end of December, Republicans are working out their plan.\n\nThey want income caps on who can receive the tax credits, and are proposing the tax dollars bypass insurance companies and go straight to individuals - although the details are unclear.\n\nOut of power in Washington, where Trump's Republicans control the House and Senate, Democrats appeared finally to have some political wind in their sails after a handful of election wins last week in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City.\n\nBut those victories, like the shutdown fight, have accentuated strategic tensions between the pragmatic and progressive, or left-wing, factions of the party.\n\nThe Democratic left is furious at defectors who voted with Senate Republicans to pass the budget on Monday, seeing this as a capitulation to Trump.\n\nFrom that wing of the party, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said giving up the fight was a \"horrific mistake\". California Governor Gavin Newsom called it \"surrender\".\n\nCongressman Greg Casar of Texas, the chairman of the House Progressive Caucus, warned: \"A deal that doesn't reduce healthcare costs is a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them.\"\n\nHowever, centrist lawmakers like Jared Golden of Maine, who represents one of the most conservative districts in the nation held by any Democrat, may cross the aisle.\n\nGolden, who recently announced he won't run for re-election, is likely to vote for the package, his office indicated to Axios, a political outlet, on Monday.\n\nAnother moderate Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, could help get the Republicans' spending plan over the line.\n\n\"It's past time to put country over party and get our government working again for the American people,\" he posted on social media on Sunday.\n\nRepublicans control the House, holding 219 seats against the Democrats' 213, but can only afford to lose two votes to pass the spending plan.\n\nWhile most House Republicans are expected to support the funding package, given that Trump backs it, fiscal hawks in the party will raise objections.\n\nThomas Massie of Kentucky - who has repeatedly voted against such stopgap funding extensions - is expected to vote no.\n\nThe proposed deal would leave the federal government on a path to keep adding about $1.8tn (£1.4tn) a year to its $38tn of debt.\n\nRand Paul of Kentucky cited this spending glut as he became the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the budget.\n\nThe Senate plan would extend funding only until January, but the conservative House Freedom Caucus wants a budget that would last longer and do more to rein in spending.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the chamber out of session for the last seven weeks to focus pressure on Senate Democrats to make a shutdown deal.\n\nNow he is urging lawmakers to start returning immediately to Washington with a vote set for Wednesday afternoon at the earliest.\n\nBut members of Congress face the same flight delays that have plagued other Americans during the spending impasse.\n\nFrom Tuesday, the rate of reduction in US flights will increase to 6%. Cuts have been made as the nation's busiest airports reduce their capacity to cope with shutdown-related sickness by air traffic controllers, who have been working without pay during the shutdown.\n\nRecord-cold temperatures and heavy snow have also hit the Great Lakes region in the Midwest, adding to the delays.\n\nYou can also get in touch by following this link"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6ng8w1xrjo","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-12","timeOfPublication":"00:37:29.926+00:00","title":"Katseye: Girl group have received 'thousands' of death threats","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Katseye, a globally diverse girl group formed through a cross-cultural reality show by Hybe and Geffen Records, has faced thousands of online death threats and racist, sexist, and non-consensual comments since their debut.

online death threats since they made their debut last year.\n\nThe six-piece, who were recently nominated for best new artist at the Grammy Awards, told BBC News that the messages, which have also targeted their families, \"can get really heavy\".\n\n\"I try to tell myself it doesn't matter, but if 1,000 people are sending you death threats, it's jarring,\" said singer Lara Raj. \"Even if it's not going to happen, it's heavy.\"\n\nRaj, who is a US citizen with Tamil Indian heritage, has also been subjected to racist comments, and was falsely reported to ICE for \"working and residing in the United States without legal authorisation\".\n\nThe 20-year-old said she had \"deleted Twitter\" (now known as X), to avoid seeing negative comments.\n\n\"I realised I am not the audience for other people's opinions,\" she said.\n\nKatseye did not specify the nature of the threats they have received; but aggressive and inappropriate behaviour is  depressingly common amongst fan communities .\n\nLast year,  Chappell Roan criticised  the \"many nonconsensual physical and social interactions\" she had had with fans, including people harassing her family and friends.\n\nThe pop band Muna chastised some of their supporters for \"spreading falsehoods about us and our loved ones for clout and attention\"; while Doja Cat called out \"creepy\" behaviour from a section of her fanbase.\n\n\"Our career has been really short, but I feel like we've gotten a lot of things already said to us, to our families,\" said Katseye singer Sophia Laforteza.\n\n\"We know that we signed up for being so public. We know it's a part of fame. But it doesn't change the fact that we are human.\"\n\nRaj also pointed out the sexist nature of the comments the band have received.\n\n\"People see us as women to rank. They'll grade us based on how pretty we are, our singing skill, dancing skill, and then add it up and give us a percentage.\n\n\"That's so dystopian.\"\n\n\"I feel like it's very terrorising on the mind,\" added her bandmate Manon Bannerman.\n\nDespite the online negativity, Katseye are having a remarkable year.\n\nTheir second EP, Beautiful Chaos, peaked at number two in the US album charts, thanks to the gratingly brilliant lead single, Gnarly, and the Charli XCX-penned follow-up, Gabriella.\n\nAn advert they filmed for the clothing brand Gap went viral in August, racking up 400 million plays and 8 billion social media \"impressions\" (\"Isn't there only 7 billion people in the world?\" asked singer Megan Skiendiel when presented with the statistic).\n\nLast month, they won best performance at the MTV Awards. Five days ago, they became only the third girl group in history to receive a best new artist nomination at the Grammys, following SWV and Wilson Phillips.\n\nThe six members, who range in age between 17 and 22, are truly international.\n\nDaniela Avanzini is a Venezuelan-Cuban American from Atlanta. Raj is an Indian-Sri Lankan American from New York. Bannerman is a Ghanaian-Italian from Zurich. Megan Skiendiel is a Chinese-Singaporean American from Honolulu. Laforteza is from Manila in the Philippines. And Yoonchae Jeung was born and raised in South Korea.\n\nThey were hand-picked to form Katseye on The Debut: Dream Academy, a reality show created by Korean entertainment giant Hybe – the label behind BTS and Le Sserafim - and America's Geffen Records, home to Olivia Rodrigo and Guns N' Roses.\n\nThousands applied, but only 20 made it through to the training and development stage – a gruelling, two-year bootcamp of daily dance lessons, vocal practice and brutal feedback.\n\nRehearsing one dance routine, they were scolded for their lack of synchronisation: \"It's got to sound like one person walking down the stairs. It can't sound like a group of people falling down the stairs.\"\n\nThose days are long behind them. The sextet learned the intricate, aerobic choreography for their Gap advert in just one day.\n\n\"The longer we're together as a group, the shorter it takes,\" said Skiendiel.\n\n\"One day of rehearsals and we're really in sync. Then we nitpick the rest.\"\n\nLast year's SIS (Soft Is Strong) EP established the band with a confident, slick pop sound. But it was Gnarly that really put them on the map.\n\nReleased in April, the song is two minutes and seventeen seconds of aggressively chaotic beat drops, juddering synths and gang vocals.\n\nIt instantly divided opinion: \"Genuinely atrocious\" was one of the kinder comments. “But people kept coming back for more. At the time of writing, it's been streamed more than half a billion times. No less than The New York Times called it  “the future of K-pop”.\n\n\"When we first heard it, we knew it was going to be shocking,\" said Avanzini.\n\n\"That was so exciting, the idea of making people upset,\" agreed Raj. \"Not giving them something that's just okay - we were really giving something thrilling.\"\n\nIt may have been polarising - but Gnarly turned Katseye from a pop curiosity to a burgeoning cultural phenomenon.\n\nOne early fan was Melanie C, who hosted a showcase for the band in London last month.\n\nSpeaking on stage, she said Katseye reminded her of the Spice Girls.\n\n\"Something about the Spice Girls was so many people felt they could identify with one of us,\" she said. \"And I think that's so beautiful about [the diversity of] your band: You open that door even further for so many people.\"\n\n\"We pride ourselves so much that our group is so diverse,\" Bannerman told the BBC.\n\n\"It's our number one priority to show the girlies out there to be proud of where they come from, no matter what they look like.\"\n\nAnd, despite the online pushback she's received, Raj encourages musicians from diverse backgrounds to pursue their dreams.\n\n\"Please do it,\" she told the BBC. \"You cannot feel held back.\n\n\"Our skin colour, our culture is our power. Use it and own it.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4w1g9ezko","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:44:10.438+00:00","title":"Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion jailed over £5bn Bitcoin stash","category":"Law & Justice","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Qian Zhimin, a Chinese woman who fled to the UK in 2017 under a fake passport, was sentenced to 11 years and eight months in prison for orchestrating a massive cryptocurrency fraud targeting over 100,000 Chinese pensioners.

2025-11-11T15:44:10.438+00:00\n\nTitle: Cryptoqueen who fled China for London mansion jailed over £5bn Bitcoin stash\n\nA woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, has been sentenced to 11 years and eight months for money laundering.\n\nPassing sentence at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Sally-Ann Hales  told Qian Zhimin she was \"the architect of this offending from its inception to its conclusion... your motive was one of pure greed\".\n\nAfter fleeing China, Qian moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures.\n\nMore than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say.\n\nInvestors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities. Anything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul.\n\n\"If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,\" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. \"Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost.\"\n\nQian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after  Chinese police started investigating her .\n\nShe moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend.\n\nSo she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property.\n\nAs Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could \"get rich while lying down\". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping.\n\nBut Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke.\n\nHer grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022.\n\nIn the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth.\n\nPolice raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history.\n\nQian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices.\n\nBut UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme.\n\n\"The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,\" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC.\n\nOne of her investo r s, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day.\n\n\"That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,\" he says.\n\nHe and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more.\n\nIn addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them.\n\n\"There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment.\"\n\nInvestors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found.\n\nA former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends.\n\nLantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: \"We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance.\"\n\nThe company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready.\n\nLantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly.\n\n\"Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,\" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. \"They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world.\"\n\nA range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said.\n\n\"We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?\"\n\nThe company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to.\n\n\"That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,\" Mr Yu says.\n\nDespite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog.\n\nBut she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li.\n\n\"Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,\" he remembers. \"We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth.\n\n\"She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations.\"\n\nMr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them.\n\nA Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme.\n\n\"The payouts suddenly stopped,\" Mr Yu recalls. \"The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough.\"\n\nWhat helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police.\n\nWhat he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money.\n\nQian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project.\n\nWhen she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told.\n\nAt the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.\n\nQian's lawyer issued a statement after her sentencing on Tuesday which described her client as a \"Bitcoin pioneer\", adding that Qian accepted her conviction but that she \"never set out to commit fraud but recognises her investment schemes were fraudulent and misled those who trusted her\".\n\nBefore her jail term was announced, Mr Li told the BBC Qian's guilty plea offered victims a \"glimpse of sunlight\".\n\nThe cryptocurrency Qian brought to the UK has multiplied more than 20 times in value since her arrival. Its fate will be decided by a  civil \"proceeds of crime\" case  that will start in earnest early next year.\n\nThere are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us. They will need to prove their claim - and in many cases they did not transfer money to Qian's company directly, but to accounts of local promoters who then passed the cash up the chain.\n\nIt is not clear whether the victims, if successful, will receive only their original investment, or an inflated amount which reflects Bitcoin's subsequent rise in value.\n\nAs in other \"proceeds of crime\" cases, any money left over after this process would normally default to the UK government. The BBC asked the UK Treasury what it plans to do with any remaining money, but it did not respond.\n\nSeparately, last month, the CPS said it was considering a compensation scheme for those with no representation in the civil case. We asked the CPS what level of evidence this alternative scheme would require, but it told us it was not able to share any details at this stage.\n\nThe toll on Mr Yu - whose wife invested alongside him - has not just been financial, but personal, culminating in divorce and little contact with his son, he told the BBC.\n\nStill, he considers himself relatively lucky. One lawyer we spoke to said many of Qian's investors were left without money for food or medicine.\n\nMr Yu knew one such person - from Tianjin, northern China. She died of breast cancer after discharging herself from hospital, unable to afford treatment, he said.\n\n\"She was at death's door, and she knew I could write, so she asked me to write her an elegy if the worst came to the worst.\"\n\nMr Yu says he kept his word and wrote a poem in her memory which he posted online. It ends with the lines:\n\n\"Let us be pillars, holding up the sky / Rather than sheep, to be led and misled / To those who  survive - strive harder / That we might right this grave injustice.\""},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj41g5w0vgno","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"22:16:26.637+00:00","title":"Catherine and Queen lay Armistice Day wreaths as nation pays tribute","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On Armistice Day 2025, the Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla took part in national remembrance ceremonies in the UK, with Catherine making her first visit to the National Memorial Arboretum where she laid a wreath and a poem by poet Arji Manuelpillai was read.

me,\" he told BBC News, \"so this challenge was best described as tediously joyful\".\n\nHis feat has been  officially recognised  by Guinness World Records.\n\nDance Dance Revolution is a Japanese video game series which was first released to arcades in 1998.\n\nPlayers stand on a dance platform or mat and hit coloured arrows with their feet, to score points in time with visual cues and the music from a catalogue of songs.\n\nThe series has spawned dozens of spin-offs in arcades and many more across home consoles.\n\nThe games have also become popular as a way to keep fit, featuring in UK and US school exercise programmes.\n\nIn 2004 the series was even recognised as an official sporting event in Norway.\n\nMore recently the game has grown in popularity in the esports community, with players across the world competing in official and fan-run tournaments.\n\nMr Csépe said he was inspired to try the challenge after watching the attempt of previous holder Carrie Swidecki, from the US, who spent a little over 138 hours playing Just Dance in 2015.\n\nBut the avid gamer, who works in IT engineering, had already broken several records before attempting this dancing feat.\n\nIn 2021, he achieved the longest videogame marathon playing a Naruto game (28 hr 11 min 32 sec playing Narutimetto Akuseru 2) and the longest videogame marathon playing a puzzle game (32 hr 32 min 32 sec playing Tetris Effect).\n\nAnd in 2023, a 90-hour gaming session on Gran Turismo 7 earned him three more endurance-testing accolades, including the longest videogame marathon playing a racing simulator game.\n\nMr Csépe, who earned the nickname GrassHopper as a child because he was \"always jumping around\", told the BBC he had been playing Dance Dance Revolution for almost 20 years, but the marathon was far from a dance in the park.\n\nMr Csépe said he was allowed to have breaks \"through well-earned rest times\", with one hour of dancing earning him a ten minute break, which could be accumulated to allow him to sleep for an hour or two.\n\nDespite the immense effort, the world record holder added that if the record got beaten in the future, he would \"certainly return\" to defend his dancing crown.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter  to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

must fight to restore trust, Nandy tells MPs\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the BBC must fight to restore trust after criticism that a Panorama documentary misled viewers by editing a speech by Donald Trump.\n\nShe said a review of the broadcaster's charter would ensure a \"genuinely accountable\" BBC, defending it as a \"national institution\".\n\nBBC director general Tim Davie earlier told staff \"we've got to fight for our journalism\" after the US president's threat to sue the corporation for $1bn (£760m).\n\nA leaked internal BBC memo said the Panorama film misled viewers by splicing together parts of Trump's speech on 6 January 2021 and made it appear as if he had explicitly encouraged the Capitol Hill riot. BBC chair Samir Shah has apologised.\n\nDavie resigned on Sunday alongside BBC News CEO Deborah Turness after mounting pressure over that memo, which was written by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to the broadcaster's editorial standards committee.\n\nThe memo also accuses the BBC of issues within its Gaza coverage, particularly by BBC Arabic, anti-Trump and anti-Israel bias and one-sided transgender reporting - among other \"troubling matters\".\n\nDavie told staff on Tuesday: \"We have made some mistakes that have cost us, but we need to fight\", adding that \"this narrative will not just be given by our enemies, it's our narrative\".\n\nHe said the BBC went through \"difficult times… but it just does good work, and that speaks louder than any newspaper, any weaponisation\".\n\nLater on Tuesday, speaking in the Commons, Nandy warned MPs attacking the broadcaster to \"consider just what is at stake\".\n\nShe told the Commons: \"There is a fundamental difference between raising serious concerns over editorial failings and members of this House launching a sustained attack on the institution itself, because the BBC is not just a broadcaster, it is a national institution that belongs to us all.\"\n\nShe added that the BBC \"has faced criticism from all sides for its coverage of highly contentious and contested issues, and [has been] accused of giving too much airtime to particular parties, and for giving them too little\".\n\nThe BBC's charter expires at the end of 2027 and the once-a-decade process of reviewing it is set to begin shortly, which she said would help it \"renew its mission for the modern age\".\n\nNandy said there was a concern over how long the BBC took to respond to criticisms which undermined trust.\n\nShe acknowledged \"serious concerns and failings\" on the part of the BBC Arabic Service, but urged strong support for the World Service, which she said was \"a light on the hill for people in places of darkness\".\n\nBBC figures on the corporation's editorial guidelines and standards committee will face questions at a hearing in the coming weeks.\n\nShah and board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson are expected to attend a session called by the Commons culture, media and sport committee.\n\nFormer editorial standards advisers Michael Prescott, the author of the leaked memo, and Caroline Daniel will also be invited to give evidence.\n\nShadow culture secretary Nigel Huddleston said there are \"too many examples of bias\" at the BBC and said the corporation required \"institutional change\".\n\nIn a post on social media on Tuesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that while the BBC as an institution \"ought to be treasured\", it has \"continually let down licence fee payers\".\n\nTrump threatened to take legal action if the BBC did not make a \"full and fair retraction\" of the Panorama programme by Friday. The corporation has said it will reply in due course.\n\nIn the staff call on Tuesday neither Davie nor the BBC chair mentioned Trump's legal threat.\n\nDowning Street has said this was a \"matter for the BBC\".\n\n\"It is clearly not for the government to comment on any ongoing legal matters,\" the prime minister's official spokesperson said.\n\n\"Our position is clear, the BBC is independent and it's for the corporation to respond to questions about their editorial decisions.\"\n\nAsked whether there were concerns the issue would affect Sir Keir Starmer's contacts with Trump, the spokesperson said the two had a \"very strong\" relationship.\n\nThe spokesperson would not be drawn on whether the BBC should apologise directly to the president."},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dryrz8823o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:34:57Z","title":"Turkish military cargo plane crashes with at least 20 on board near Georgia and Azerbaijan border","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A Turkish military C-130 cargo plane crashed near Sighnaghi in Georgia, approximately 5km from the Azerbaijan border, while en route from Azerbaijan to Turkey.

functioning hospital in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher before a reported massacre by paramilitary troops says he has lost all hope and happiness.\n\n\"I have lost my colleagues,\" Abdu-Rabbu Ahmed, a laboratory technician at the Saudi Maternity Hospital, told the BBC.\n\n\"I have lost the people whose faces I used to see smiling... It feels as if you lost a big part of your body or your soul.\"\n\nHe was speaking to us from a displaced persons camp in Tawila some 70km (43 miles) to the west of el-Fasher, the regional hub which was taken over by paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the last week of October after an 18-month siege.\n\nThe RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into a civil war.\n\nThe alleged killings of at least 460 patients and their companions at the Saudi Hospital  were one of the most shocking among widespread accounts of atrocities  - some of them filmed by RSF fighters and posted to social media.\n\nIn a statement of condemnation, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was \"appalled and deeply shocked\" by the reported shootings, and by the abductions of six health workers - four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist.\n\nThe RSF has dismissed the accusations as disinformation, declaring that all of el-Fasher's hospitals had been abandoned. It disputed the claims by filming a video inside the hospital grounds showing female volunteers tending to patients.\n\nA freelancer based in Tawila gathered interviews for the BBC.\n\nMr Ahmed told him he had carried on working at Saudi Hospital since the beginning of the war, despite regular shelling by artillery, tanks and drones - which destroyed parts of the buildings and injured doctors and nurses as well as patients.\n\nMedical staff used to share what little food was available as the RSF blockade tightened, he said, sometimes working without breakfast or lunch.\n\nMost of them fled when the paramilitary fighters launched their final assault.\n\n\"The shelling started around six in the morning,\" Mr Ahmed said.\n\n\"All civilians and soldiers headed out towards the southern side. There was a state of terror, and as we walked, drones were bombing us. And heavy artillery too - I saw many people die on the spot, there was no-one who could save them.\"\n\nMr Ahmed said some of the fleeing medical workers arrived with him in Tawila, but many were detained in locations north-west of the city, naming the Garni area, the villages of Turra and Hilla al-Sheikh and the town of Korma.\n\nSome were transferred to Nyala, he said, the RSF's de facto capital in South Darfur.\n\n\"This is the information I received from colleagues we know,\" he told the BBC, saying that he later heard medical staff who remained at the hospital were executed.\n\nMr Ahmed also lost much of his family: a sister and two brothers were killed that day, and his parents are missing.\n\n\"I am very worried about the fate of the people inside el-Fasher,\" he added.\n\n\"They may be killed. And they may be used as human shields against the [Sudanese air force] airstrikes.\"\n\nAccounts of the alleged hospital massacre were reported by two Sudanese doctors' groups, citing sources on the ground, and an el-Fasher activist network.\n\nYale University's Humanitarian Research Lab said satellite imagery corroborated the reports, apparently showing blood on the ground and white grouped objects that looked like bodies in the hospital compound.\n\nIn a satellite image from 1 November, the white objects are seen being placed at an area that had been dug within the compound of the hospital. In a subsequent one, taken on 6 November, these objects are seen charred and with smoke still rising from the area.\n\nBBC Verify has authenticated footage filmed at the nearby University of El-Fasher's Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences: it shows bodies lying on the floor and an RSF fighter shooting one of the men still alive.\n\nA spokesman for the Sudan Doctors Network, Dr Mohamed Elsheikh, told the BBC this building was being used as an extension to the Saudi hospital for wards and patients.\n\nHe went on to explain that the RSF had been demanding ransoms for the release of the abducted health workers.\n\n\"The six kidnapped doctors or medical staff, one of them, his family, managed to pay the ransom equivalent to $30,000 [£23,000], and he arrived safely to Tawila town,\" said Dr Elsheikh, now working for the NHS in the UK.\n\n\"The other was executed,\" he added, saying the group has no information on the fate of the remaining four.\n\nBack in Tawila, Mohamed Abdu-Teia, who had been a patient at the Saudi Hospital when the RSF closed in, can do little else but lay on the ground with his leg in a tattered cast.\n\nIt was broken in a shelling attack, he tells the BBC, but he managed to flee the city on foot the morning of the final RSF assault.\n\nLike many other men suspected of being soldiers, Mr Abdu-Teia was stopped at the Garni checkpoint and interrogated, he says. The two men with him were taken, but the RSF let him go.\n\n\"They didn't beat me, but they questioned me a lot, because of my injury, I think. They said: 'We know you are a soldier, but you're finished - you will die on the road. So just go.\"\n\nMr Abdu-Teia says the RSF brought some medicine to Garni but \"the injuries were too many - two or three people died every hour.\n\n\"The same day we arrived, vehicles came and took people to unknown places. Any young man who looked physically OK was taken.\"\n\nHe managed to get a lift to Tawila from \"people who had cars\". They charged passengers 500,000 Sudanese pounds ($830, £630) and turned on wi-fi hotspots so they could call their families to transfer money, he said. \"We left with them - we had nothing, not even plans.\"\n\nMany children arrived at the Tawila camps without parents. Fifteen-year-old Eman was one of them.\n\nHer father was killed in a drone strike in el-Fasher, she told the BBC, and her mother and brother were detained by the RSF as they fled.\n\n\"Whoever did not die, [the RSF] ran them over with vehicles,\" she said. \"They took our belongings and told us all of you are soldiers. They beat my brother and choked him with a chain.\n\n\"They wanted to beat my mother. She told us: 'Go, I will come to you.' We got into a vehicle and left. They did not allow my brother to get into the vehicle. We left them behind.\"\n\nEman escaped but saw other girls and women who did not.\n\n\"They took some women. They took them in their vehicles and stabbed some of them with knives. Some were taken while their mothers couldn't do anything.\"\n\nFemale survivors have told horrific stories of gang rapes and the abduction of young girls.\n\nAnother teenager on her own, 14-year-old Samar, said she had lost her mother in the chaos at the Garni checkpoint, and her father was arrested.\n\nShe was told he was taken to the Children's Hospital in el-Fasher.\n\nThat building had reportedly been serving as an RSF detention centre, and it is where the Yale researchers also said satellite images showed evidence of killings: apparent clusters of bodies as well as earth excavations that could have been a mass grave.\n\nThe RSF has issued videos to counter these allegations, declaring that the Children's Hospital in el-Fasher is ready to receive patients.\n\nOne shows a man dressed in a blazer standing outside its gate with a group of what appear to be doctors in hospital scrubs.\n\n\"These medical personnel and cadres, they are not hostages,\" the man in the blazer says. \"We are not taking them as war hostages. They are free. They are free to practise medicine.\"\n\nAnother man in the video, who introduces himself as Dr Ishaq Abdul Mahmoud, associate professor of paediatrics and child health at el-Fasher University, says: \"We are here to help any person in need of medical service.\n\n\"We are out of politics. Whether soldiers or [civilians] we are ready to help them.\"\n\nDr Elsheikh of the Sudan Doctors Network dismisses the RSF videos as propaganda.\n\nAnd Mr Ahmed, the Saudi Hospital laboratory technician in Tawila, knows what he has seen, and he has seen too much.\n\n\"I do not have any hope of returning to el-Fasher,\" he says.\n\n\"After everything that happened and everything I saw. Even if there was a small hope, I remember what happened in front of me.\"\n\nMohamed Zakaria is a freelance journalist from Darfur based in Kampala\n\nAdditional reporting by BBC Verify's Peter Mwai\n\nGo to  BBCAfrica.com  for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter  @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at  BBC Africa  or on Instagram at  bbcafrica"},{"source":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx276px3280o","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"17:22:05.703+00:00","title":"Pokrovsk: Russian forces use fog cover to push further into key Ukraine town","category":"Military Actions & War","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Thick fog in eastern Ukraine has enabled Russian forces to advance deeper into the strategic city of Pokrovsk, where they have increased their troop presence to around 300 soldiers.

further into the key strategic city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's 7th Airborne Assault Corps says weather conditions, particularly dense fog, have prompted Moscow to intensify its bid to get increasing numbers into the ruined city and then encircle Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussian forces have spent more than a year trying to capture the city, and Ukrainian President Voloydymyr Zelensky says the fog has favoured Russian attacks and the situation remains difficult.\n\nA video that has gone viral on social media shows Russian soldiers openly driving through a hazy road on civilian cars and motorbikes.\n\nThe BBC has verified the location where the video was filmed as the southern outskirts of the town on the Selidove-Pokrovsk highway.\n\nFor several days fog obscured visibility to carry out aerial reconnaissance, says a drone pilot from the \"Shershni Dovbusha\" unit of the 68th brigade with the call-sign \"Goose\".\n\nThat's why, he told the BBC, the Russians had even \"dared\" to launch assaults using a column of vehicles, which would normally have been wiped out immediately by Ukrainian drones.\n\nThe Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC his unit had regularly detected and eliminated small Russian groups trying to advance on foot and on motor bikes.  He added they were also involved in repelling the attack featured in the viral video, said to have been filmed on Sunday.\n\nThe convoy was partly destroyed, \"Goose\" claims, however weather conditions meant there was no video monitoring of the moment they repelled the attack so he was not sure if the entire group was hit.\n\nThe 7th Corps claims that there are now 300 Russian soldiers in Pokrovsk, although that was the figure initially shared by Zelensky last Wednesday. The video suggests those numbers have probably increased in that time.\n\nRussian troops appear to be closing in on most areas of Pokrovsk, according to mapping by the Ukraine-based DeepState monitoring group. Some observers say that its fall is imminent.\n\nMost parts of the city are now in a grey zone that neither side fully controls, says \"Goose\". \"We might hold positions in one building, but the enemy can be in the next one. They're trying to get behind our backs,\" he says.\n\nMoscow is trying to encircle Pokrovsk and neighbouring Myrnohrad in what is known as a \"cauldron\".\n\nEven if the \"lid\" is not closed, Russians can constantly target all routes in and out of it using FPV drones.\n\nTo prevent such an encirclement, Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian troops back from Suvorove and Rodynske on the eastern part of the \"cauldron\", creating a bigger gap between Russian flanks.\n\nRussian forces are trying to cut off logistical routes supporting Ukrainian troops in Pokrovsk.\n\nThey attack supply routes, not only remotely using drones and artillery but also by sending in soldiers on the ground, the Ukrainian drone pilot told the BBC.\n\nThis tactic is called infiltration and it has proved quite successful, says Ukrainian military analyst Kostyantyn Mashovets.\n\nHe argues that Russian forces have specifically targeted Ukrainian FPV pilots so they do not have sufficient resources to detect the movement of smaller Russian groups.\n\nIn an urban environment, Russian soldiers sometimes infiltrate by dressing up as locals or as Ukrainian military, says Mashovets.  Their main goal is to cause chaos among Ukrainian defenders, which is then followed by a push from the main forces of the Russian army, he adds.\n\nThe Kremlin is also trying to push in other parts of the front line – in Kupyansk in the north-east and in Zapporizhzhya region in the south.\n\nViktor Tregubov, spokesperson of the Joint Forces Operation, denied Moscow's claim that they had managed to surround Kupyansk but admitted that Russian troops were present in the south of the town and the situation was difficult."},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/travel/shutdown-private-air-travel.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:42:13-05:00","title":"Who Didn’t Suffer During the Shutdown?

unlike their Senate counterparts.\n\n\"I'm not promising anybody anything,\" said Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nIn the US system, both chambers of Congress must approve a spending plan to send to the president to be signed into law.\n\nThe Republicans currently control both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but at the end of September, they were seven short of the 60 votes needed to pass an earlier spending bill in the Senate.\n\nThat gave the Democrats some negotiating leverage. The party's main demand was that the bill should include an extension of expiring tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans.\n\nThe House was able to pass a temporary funding bill to avoid the shutdown, but it could not clear the Senate amid Democratic resistance.\n\nSo on 1 October, the US government shut down for the first time in nearly seven years.\n\nThousands of government employees deemed non-essential have been furloughed - temporarily put on unpaid leave.\n\nBut not all aspects of government   stop during a shutdown.\n\nFederal law enforcement are expected to operate as usual, Social Security and Medicare cheques are still distributed, and mail is delivered. The Trump administration has so far found money to pay the troops.\n\nAir traffic controllers are also expected to work without pay, but some of them have been calling in sick, leading to many flights being cancelled or delayed.\n\nMore than 42 million Americans who rely on SNAP food aid benefits have received only partial payments after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to withhold some funding pending further legal hearings.\n\nWhile most federal employees are not paid during a shutdown, members of Congress do continue to receive their salary.\n\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically limited and temporary - similar to the disruption caused by a hurricane or major storm.\n\nBut it still causes problems. Approvals for loans and permits are delayed and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal contracts are suspended.\n\nUnlike government employees, contractors do not receive back pay once a shutdown ends, and many of them are small businesses without other big clients.\n\nOverall,  analysts estimate this shutdown will knock roughly 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off economic growth  for each week that it continues - about $15bn a week.\n\nShutdowns over budgets  are a unique aspect of US politics .\n\nThe second-longest ever shutdown dragged on for 35 days, beginning in late 2018 during Trump's first presidential term.\n\nBut these legislative standoffs predate the current president.\n\nThere were eight shutdowns during the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, though all were relatively brief.\n\nFormer Democrat President Bill Clinton had a 21-day shutdown in 1995, while his fellow Democrat Barack Obama had a 16-day shutdown in 2013.\n\nDo you have questions about the US government shutdown?

It will continue to bedevil President Trump, especially as the midterm elections draw closer.\n\nThe burden is now on Mr. Trump and Republicans to bring down costs or risk peril in the those elections, after a splinter group of Democrats agreed to end the shutdown by dropping their party’s demand to extend certain health insurance subsidies. Despite repeated promises to offer an alternative to Obamacare, Mr. Trump has nothing much to show on the issue, beyond a vague plan to send money directly to policyholders.\n\n“We want a health care system where we pay the money to the people instead of the insurance companies,” he told reporters in the Oval Office Monday. “We’re going to be working on that very hard over the next short period of time.”\n\nMr. Trump’s statement highlights the pressure on Republicans to articulate their own vision to improve the affordability of health care now that the subsidies that millions of people rely on to pay for coverage are set to expire by the end of the year. Like Mr. Trump, Republicans in Congress who have spent years attacking Obamacare have not offered up a serious alternative, since their failed effort to repeal the law in 2017.\n\nThe White House declined to provide more details of Mr. Trump’s latest idea. But the proposal assumes that giving patients a bigger role in purchasing their own care will lead to lower costs and better health outcomes.\n\nThe evidence that such an approach could significantly lower costs is not strong. Most health spending goes to very sick people who don’t have much choice in the care they receive. Research suggests that financial incentives and information about prices can shape behavior for patients seeking elective care. But that kind of spending is a small share of the country’s health care bill.\n\nMillions of Americans who will lose access to subsidies when the current formula expires are looking at a jump in premiums, in some cases hundreds of dollars a month or more. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that two million Americans will lose insurance altogether next year as the prices rise Mr. Trump seems to be arguing that the subsidy money should not be used to help people buy insurance, but rather be offered to the same people in special accounts.\n\nExtending the extra subsidies would be expensive, costing $23 billion next year and nearly $350 billion over the next decade, according to the budget office estimate. But even without them, most consumers can still get some help paying their insurance premiums through tax credits established under Obamacare.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010, has been attacked since its inception for failing to constrain health costs, which are higher in the United States than in other rich democracies. But its expansion of health coverage to tens of millions of Americans who would otherwise lack coverage has made the law popular.\n\nDemocrats expanded funding for people who buy their own insurance during the pandemic, leading to a surge in new insurance signups. It is these added subsidies that are on the line now.\n\nDemocrats have embraced health care costs as a central issue this year, mindful of Mr. Trump’s first term when he tried — and failed — to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nIt was an early and messy defeat for him. Republicans in Congress, who had rallied around the cause for nearly a decade, were unable to agree on a substitute. Democrats ran campaigns focused on the legislative debacle and took back the House the next year.\n\nDuring his campaign last year, Mr. Trump barely talked about health reform. When asked about Obamacare during the presidential debate, he said he would be open to adjusting it “if we can come up with a plan that’s going to cost our people, our population, less money and be better health care.”\n\nWhen pressed on whether he had a specific proposal in mind, Mr. Trump said he had “concepts of a plan.”\n\nDemocrats forced the government shutdown over health care costs, insisting that Republicans extend extra subsidies that help people pay their insurance premiums and that Republicans reverse the recent cuts they made to Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans have said such an extension does not belong on a spending measure, and some have argued that Congress should let the subsidies expire.\n\nThe handful of Democratic senators who agreed over the weekend to end the shutdown extracted a promise from Republican leadership for at least a symbolic vote on extending the subsidies next month. But the effort has succeeded in thrusting the challenges Americans face in paying for their health care into the political spotlight at a time when Mr. Trump would prefer to focus on other things.\n\nFor the most part, Mr. Trump’s policy efforts on health care have tended to focus on ancillary issues, such as improving the transparency of health care prices, reducing the supply of illegal fentanyl, and requiring drug companies to offer discounts to patients who buy prescription drugs with their own money.\n\nHis health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has had little to say about how to improve the affordability of insurance coverage, and instead often focuses his attention on topics like vaccines or encouraging a healthier diet.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have floated some ideas. Their major tax and domestic policy bill cut nearly a trillion dollars from Medicaid — about half by scaling back Obamacare’s expansion of coverage to the working poor. Some lawmakers continue to talk about Obamacare replacement approaches, though the issue has lost prominence in recent years. This week, Senators Rick Scott, of Florida and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, expressed enthusiasm in proposals similar to Mr. Trump’s idea.\n\nMr. Trump supported the health care cuts passed this summer, but he frequently downplayed the scale of the changes, inaccurately saying they were narrowly aimed at eliminating fraud.\n\nMr. Trump’s newly articulated proposal shares a consumerist bent with those policies, by replacing insurance subsidies with cash payments to individuals. It appears to echo a recent proposal made by Mr. Cassidy, who suggested taking the expiring subsidy money and giving it to consumers in the form of a “pre-funded flexible savings account,” which can only be used to pay medical bills.\n\nBut Dr. Cassidy’s plan would account for around $350 billion in spending over the next decade, not “trillions and trillions” of dollars that Mr. Trump has spoken about.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/flights-canceled-shutdown.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:29:57-05:00","title":"Duffy Won’t Give Timeline to Restore Flights as Shutdown Appears Near End","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the government shutdown appears to near its end, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy has refused to provide a timeline for lifting flight restrictions at 40 busy airports, warning that without swift congressional action, airlines may ground their fleets due to worsening air traffic controller shortages.

We’re not going to keep flying anymore,’” predicting that such a disruption could happen even before the Thanksgiving travel rush, perhaps as soon as this weekend.\n\nThroughout the shutdown, Mr. Duffy has warned of impending chaos, drawing rebukes from Democrats that his forecasts were more about pressuring them to end the shutdown than offering impartial assessments of the air-travel system.\n\nLast week, Mr. Duffy and the F.A.A. ordered mandatory flight reductions at 40 airports nationwide. The cuts, which began with a 4 percent reduction on Friday and were slated to rise to 10 percent by the end of the week, were based on the F.A.A.’s analysis of data, Mr. Duffy has said, and were imposed to alleviate strain on air traffic controllers, who have been increasingly struggling with absences in their ranks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Duffy said he would reverse the restrictions only if that data — which includes the frequency of close calls between planes and of delays forced by shortages of air traffic controllers — improved.\n\nControllers have been forced to work without pay through the shutdown, and have missed two full paychecks since the funding lapse began. The lack of pay has accelerated retirements, Mr. Duffy said, and has forced some newer controllers with lower salaries and smaller savings accounts to seek outside income.\n\nThe resulting shortfall of controllers led to an uptick in delays caused by low staffing, known as staffing triggers, at some control towers, according to Mr. Duffy and the controllers’ union, exacerbating already crippling problems. For years, most certified controllers have been forced to work overtime to compensate for vacancies in more than 20 percent of their positions.\n\nLast weekend, a high number of staffing triggers — 81 on Saturday alone — signaled how much worse it could get if the shutdown dragged into the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel season. But on Tuesday, there were signs of marked improvement, Mr. Duffy said, with only four staffing triggers as of 4 p.m.\n\n“I think our air traffic controllers are seeing an end to the shutdown and are feeling more hopeful,” Mr. Duffy said, adding, “If the House does their work tomorrow, I think we’re well on our way to getting to more normal air travel, less cancellations.”\n\nMr. Duffy said that air traffic controllers would receive approximately 70 percent of their missed pay within 24 to 48 hours of the shutdown ending, and the rest within a week. He also endorsed President Trump’s proposal, issued on social media on Monday, to reward controllers who never missed a shift during the shutdown with a $10,000 bonus.\n\n“Brilliant,” Mr. Duffy said of Mr. Trump’s proposal, adding that perhaps the controllers with perfect attendance “should come to the White House and he should present them with their checks.”\n\nBut Mr. Duffy did not endorse Mr. Trump’s simultaneous exhortation to air traffic controllers who had missed shifts during the shutdown to quit.\n\n“I’m trying to bring more air traffic controllers in,” Mr. Duffy said. “I’m not trying to take controllers out.”\n\nHe said he reserved his concern for controllers who called in sick before even missing a first paycheck. “I’m concerned about their dedication,” Mr. Duffy said, adding: “If we have controllers who were systemically not doing their job, we will take action.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/us/politics/congress-gerrymander-redistricting-elections.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:24:44-05:00","title":"A State-by-State Guide to the Gerrymandering Fight for Congress","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"As the 2026 midterm elections approach, several U.S. states are engaging in or have recently completed congressional redistricting efforts, either through partisan legislature action, judicial intervention, or voter referendum.

Republican and Democratic state legislators who have yet to redraw congressional maps in their favor have only a short window before candidate filing deadlines and the primary season end their opportunities.\n\nRedrawing maps to squeeze out more safe seats before any votes are cast is not part of the ordinary run-up to an election. But when President Trump demanded that Republican-led states gerrymander their House maps to stave off Democratic control, he shattered decades of settled norms regarding how and when legislative lines are drawn.\n\nThe Texas legislature kicked things off. Missouri and North Carolina legislators followed suit. An already scheduled redrawing in Ohio just finished, potentially netting Republicans more seats, while a judge in Utah on Monday tossed out a congressional map proposed by the state’s Republican legislature, a decision that Democrats welcomed ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nAnd last week, voters in California approved a ballot measure that temporarily set aside an independent redistricting commission and instead redrew the maps by referendum. That potentially netted Democrats five House seats next year.\n\nSo which states are likely to be the next — and which ones are not?\n\nVirginia —- Democrats now hold six of 11 seats in Congress. But two weeks ago, in a surprise, Democratic state legislators, nursing a razor-thin edge in both chambers, said that they would redraw the maps to potentially give their party two or three more House seats. Any new maps would require legislative approval, and then a statewide referendum, which could go before voters early next year. But after Tuesday’s Democratic romp, more than a dozen seats in the House of Delegates flipped from red to blue, and the party will hold a huge majority in the state house, though the Democratic majority in the State Senate remains tight.\n\nMaryland — Democrats now hold seven out of eight House seats. On Tuesday, Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, announced the formation of a new five-member redistricting commission “to make sure Maryland has fair and representative maps.” That commission, chaired by Senator Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, is expected to come back with recommendations by the end of the year, though one of its members, State Senate President Bill Ferguson, has warned that any midcycle redistricting efforts could backfire against Democrats.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He celebrated his efforts to rename the Department of Defense to the 'Department of War,' a move that reflects his political ideology but lacks congressional approval. Trump also criticized the Department of Veterans Affairs, claiming it was inefficient and blaming it for poor veteran care, while downplaying the impact of workforce cuts and contract cancellations, such as those with Harvard, which disrupted medical research.

The measure, which now goes to the House, would quell concerns over how to pay federal workers and members of the military if the shutdown continued.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump paid the military during the shutdown by reprogramming funds and accepting a private donation from a billionaire, his administration warned that eventually the payments to service members would be at risk.\n\n“They said, Let’s close up our country,” Mr. Trump said of the Democrats immediately after his speech during an appearance on the “The Pat McAfee Show,” a daily sports talk show. “They were not successful in renegotiation, and it looks like it’s going to open up.”\n\nMr. Trump also used the Veterans Day moment to talk up his decision to try to revert the Defense Department back to the Department of War, a name it used for 150 years until shortly after World War II. Formally changing the name would require sign-off from Congress, which the Trump administration has not received.\n\n“We brilliantly decided to change the name of this great, this great thing that we all created together, and we became politically correct,” Mr. Trump said. “We don’t like being politically correct.”\n\n“So we’re not going to be politically correct anymore,” he added. “From now on, when we fight a war, we only fight for one reason: to win.”\n\nMr. Trump’s refusal to abide by the traditional strictures of such speeches reflected his larger relationship with the military, which he has begun to use in unconventional, and sometimes questionably legal, ways.\n\nHe has recently shown more interest in the aggressive use of military might than in deterrence. His administration has been attacking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that it says are smuggling drugs, even though a broad range of legal specialists on the use of lethal force have said the deadly strikes are illegal extrajudicial killings.\n\nHe has also increasingly used the military to advance his domestic policy priorities, placing the armed forces at the center of partisan political issues.\n\nMr. Trump also deployed about 10,000 troops to the southwestern border after he declared a national emergency over illegal border crossings. The troops are still there, even though crossings have plunged.\n\nUnder Mr. Trump, thousands of National Guard troops and Marines were deployed to Los Angeles to help quell protests that erupted during immigration raids, eroding the morale of some service members. The administration has deployed the Guard to a number of other Democratic-led cities to help drive down crime, including Washington, where crime had already been falling.\n\nThe domestic deployments are highly unusual, according to military historians, who say the military has at least tried to maintain the perception of being nonpartisan and the trust of the American public.\n\nJames R. Stark, a retired rear admiral of the U.S. Navy who served during the Vietnam War, said members of the armed services had mixed views about Mr. Trump.\n\n“The military is not monolithic at all,” said Mr. Stark, who also worked on the National Security Council in the Reagan administration. “I think officers tend to be more questioning of Trump than the enlisted troops because he appeals to that macho side of people. But I think that you’ll find that most people in the military are ill at ease, are very uncomfortable, with the way that he’s starting to use the military.”\n\nMr. Stark made his own views clear. “I think it’s ironic that President Trump is now lauding the military so much,” he said. “He uses it as his own personal toy almost.”\n\nMr. Trump faced objections from veterans’ groups this year when he said he planned to change the name of Veterans Day to “Victory Day for World War I.” Critics of the move argued it would ignore the sacrifice of most living veterans. Mr. Trump did not end up changing the name, but a White House statement on Tuesday recognized the holiday by his preferred name.\n\nDuring his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump bragged about the firing of “thousands of people who didn’t take care of our great veterans” at the Department of Veterans Affairs, calling them “sick people.”\n\nBut the Trump administration’s push to downsize the federal work force resulted in thousands of firings of federal employees who were veterans, Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee have said. And the upending of the federal bureaucracy has rippled across programs for veterans.\n\nEfforts to cancel federal contracts with Harvard set off a clash at the V.A. over the impact on medical research intended to help veterans. And Mr. Trump’s push to get federal workers back in the office forced many V.A. clinicians to work from crowded makeshift spaces, raising complaints that patient confidentiality was violated.\n\nStill, the Trump administration promoted its handling of veterans affairs issues on Tuesday, including opening 20 veterans health facilities across the nation.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/kansas-redistricting-sharice-davids-congress.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"14:24:26-05:00","title":"Kansas Redistricting Was on the Fast Track.

Then Some Republicans Said No.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T14:24:26-05:00\n\nThe top Republicans in Kansas were ready to join President Trump’s redistricting push and redraw the state’s political map to deliver another seat in Congress to Republicans. Democrats feared that a special session to pass new district lines was inevitable.\n\nThen something surprising happened. Some Republicans refused.\n\nThe pushback on the Plains leaves in place, at least for now, the one Democratic-leaning congressional district in Kansas. It comes as a small but rising number of lawmakers across the country, Republicans and Democrats, have balked at joining the drive to carve up congressional districts to boost their side’s odds in the midterm elections.\n\nThe national flurry of remapping, set off this summer when Texas Republicans drew a new one at the president’s behest, happened quickly in several states. But growing resistance from state lawmakers, for reasons both practical and philosophical, has put a chill on the effort.\n\nWhen the Republican governor of Indiana called a special session for redistricting last month, the Senate Republicans said the votes were not there. Maryland Democratic leaders are divided. And in Kansas, where top Republicans had hoped to meet about a new map last Friday, House leaders failed to get enough support.\n\nThe debate over remapping in Kansas is not over, and new boundaries could still pass when lawmakers return for their regular session in January. Some Republican legislators were stripped of committee leadership roles on Friday, a punishment for bucking the party line on redistricting. And several lawmakers said they had considered the possibility of more political repercussions if the president were to become more involved.\n\nBut the depth and breadth of Republican skepticism, both conservative and moderate, from both rural areas and cities, suggests that redistricting faces an uphill climb in Kansas even if political pressure continues to increase.\n\n“I would rather just stand on principle and stand on my morals and ethics,” said State Representative Brett Fairchild, a conservative Republican, who said he believed redistricting went against the intent of the country’s founders and could backfire on his party in future elections. “That way I can actually look at myself in the mirror and sleep at night. It’s not all just about getting re-elected.”\n\nState Representative Clarke Sanders said he first heard a pitch for redistricting in September at a retreat with his fellow Republicans in Wichita.\n\nHe said the House speaker, Daniel Hawkins, presented to members of his caucus a letter that would call a special session, and that Mr. Hawkins described meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House, where the president made the case for a new congressional map that would help Republicans in the state. Two-thirds of the Kansas House and two-thirds of the Kansas Senate would have needed to agree for lawmakers to return to the Capitol on Nov. 7 to consider a new map.\n\nDemocrats were never going to sign that letter, meaning that Republicans could afford only a handful of dissenters from the supermajorities they hold in both chambers. The speaker “told us that if we don’t sign on to this, be expecting a call from the White House,” said Mr. Sanders, a conservative from Salina, a city of 46,000 people in central Kansas.\n\nMr. Sanders did not sign the letter. Sure enough, he said he got that phone call from Washington.\n\nMr. Sanders said he did not remember the name of the caller, who identified himself as a White House staff member, and that they talked for perhaps 30 minutes. The staff member “was saying that it was really important that we get this done,” he recalled. Mr. Sanders, who described the call as cordial, explained his belief that drawing a new map would be politically risky.\n\n“I just thought that this would give Democrats a club to beat us over the head with if we went forward,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview.\n\nWhite House officials did not answer questions about redistricting in Kansas.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Sanders got a call from Speaker Hawkins, he said. He was told that he was being removed from his role as vice chairman of the Higher Education Budget Committee because he had not agreed to the special session.\n\nMemos sent by Mr. Hawkins to lawmakers and obtained by The New York Times showed that at least six committee chairs and vice chairs were removed from their posts on Friday, and that other committee assignments were also reshuffled. Mr. Hawkins said in his newsletter that 10 House Republicans had not signed the special session letter.\n\nIn an interview over the weekend on the “John Whitmer Show,” a local talk radio program, Mr. Hawkins said that “any leader that is not working with the other leaders to make things happen really doesn’t deserve to be a chair anymore, and, quite frankly, that’s the reason why I made a move.”\n\nMr. Hawkins, who is running for state insurance commissioner, did not agree to be interviewed. He sent a statement that said: “Democrats have been gerrymandering for years, and now folks want to clutch their pearls that Republicans are finally fighting back. That’s rich.”\n\nRedistricting usually takes place once a decade, but that convention went by the wayside this summer after Texas Republicans passed new boundaries. California Democrats responded with a plan of their own, approved this month by voters. Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina and Democrats in Virginia also forged ahead. Leaders in both parties have urged more states to join in.\n\nIn Kansas, skepticism over redistricting extends beyond the 10 Republicans who did not sign the letter seeking a special session. At least one House member, Mr. Fairchild, said he had signed the letter because he wanted to consider other topics in a special session, but was always a firm no on redistricting. And while the State Senate mustered the support it needed for a special session, not everyone who signed was fully persuaded.\n\n“I worry that if we go in and try to redraw now, and if we don’t have good reasons to do so, I think there could be a backlash,” said State Senator Mike Thompson, a Republican from the Kansas City suburbs who signed the letter but said he was undecided on redistricting.\n\nKansans reliably vote for Republicans in presidential elections, and Mr. Trump carried the state last year by 16 percentage points. But the state’s voters have an independent streak, too. They rejected an effort to strip abortion rights from the State Constitution in 2022 and have twice elected Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat whose veto pen complicates Republicans’ redistricting goals.\n\nVoters have also continued to re-elect Representative Sharice Davids, the only Democrat in Kansas’ congressional delegation, even after Republicans made her district more conservative when they last drew maps. Ms. Davids, who flipped a Republican-held seat in the 2018 midterms, has beaten recent Republican challengers by at least 10 percentage points.\n\nIn late September, when redistricting had seemed more likely, Ms. Davids described herself as “legitimately livid that this is happening.” She spent the weeks that followed making the case against redistricting in her district.\n\n“It’s infuriating, but it’s also a little bit confusing because it’s such a bad idea,” said Ms. Davids, who was one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress. “Just basic principles: Voters should be choosing their representatives, and not the other way around.”\n\nSome statehouse Democrats in Kansas thought a special session was inevitable. But Republican legislators, both those who signed the letter and those who did not, said those Democrats had misunderstood their opposition.\n\n“It wasn’t just Trump snaps his fingers and we redistrict,” said Mr. Thompson, the state senator. “If that were the case,” he added, “it would have been done weeks ago.”\n\nState Representative Pat Proctor, a redistricting supporter from Leavenworth, described remapping as essential to supporting the president’s agenda. But on an issue like redistricting, he said, there are often a range of Republican views.\n\n“We are a big, big tent,” said Mr. Proctor, who is running for secretary of state. “And so it’s hard to wrangle us.”\n\nThe redistricting fight is not settled. Mr. Proctor said he expected redistricting to come to the floor in January. Ms. Davids said that “their plan to cheat the system isn’t over.” Both Speaker Hawkins and Ty Masterson, the State Senate president, indicated in statements that a new map was still a goal.\n\nKansas Republicans have also noted that Ms. Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, has spoken in support of Democratic-led states passing new maps in response to Republican gerrymandering.\n\n“President Trump asked Republicans to fight for fair maps and for America’s future,” said Mr. Masterson, part of a large field seeking the Republican nomination for governor in 2026. “We did our part — and we’ll keep leading the charge here in Kansas.”\n\nIn order to enact a new map over Ms. Kelly’s near-certain veto, Republicans will need two-thirds support in both chambers, the same threshold the House failed to reach in calling the special session. Some Republican holdouts say they will not budge.\n\nState Representative Mark Schreiber, a moderate Republican from Emporia, said he opposed redistricting and feared that it “would just ruin the confidence people have in our political system.”\n\n“I’m very comfortable with my reasoning,” Mr. Schreiber said. “If the president called, I would tell him the same thing. And if he ran a primary challenger, I’d say, ‘Bring it on.’”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/business/commercial-shipbuilding-us-china.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"11:41:41-05:00","title":"Halt in Fees on Chinese Vessels Endangers U.S. Shipbuilding Efforts","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States and China suspended fees on commercial shipping vessels for one year, ending a trade dispute initiated under President Trump to curb China’s growing dominance in global shipbuilding.

Vessels Endangers U.S. Shipbuilding Efforts\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T11:41:41-05:00\n\nThe United States and China called off a fight over commercial shipping on Monday, but the truce could weaken Washington’s efforts to curb China’s rise as a maritime power.\n\nPresident Trump had recently started imposing fees on Chinese commercial ships when they docked in American ports. The policy was designed to limit the use of Chinese vessels for transporting goods to the United States.\n\nChina retaliated with similar levies on American vessels. But the countries agreed to suspend the fees for a year as part of their recent trade pact. They announced on Monday that fee collection had stopped.\n\nThe decision to halt the fees showed that Mr. Trump’s efforts to revive American shipyards, which produce almost no large commercial vessels, face obstacles. He has promised a maritime action plan, due last week, to support shipyards and train up mariners.\n\nChina made 60 percent of the world’s large vessels in 2024, up from 44 percent five years earlier, according to BRS Shipbrokers. China has produced over 700 large commercial vessels this year and the United States just one, according to BRS.\n\nChina’s shipyards, benefiting from significant government support, have in recent years overtaken those of South Korea and Japan, two big shipbuilding nations.\n\nThe United States imposed fees not just on Chinese shipping companies, which had been expected to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in levies, but also on large vessels made in China. Many of the largest shipping companies that transport goods to the United States — like France’s CMA CGM — own vessels made in China.\n\nThe U.S. fees stemmed from a trade investigation that began under the Biden administration, and they had bipartisan support. Their supporters criticized the Trump administration for putting them on hold.\n\n“We want to blunt China’s dominance of this industry,” said Michael Roberts, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a right-leaning research organization. “So it’s a disappointment in that respect.”\n\nSenator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in a statement that China’s unfair policies had undercut American shipbuilding workers. “Instead of holding China accountable, the president folded, leaving American workers behind,” she added.\n\nThe White House did not respond when asked why it had halted the fees, and whether it had given up too much.\n\nAsked when Mr. Trump’s maritime action plan might appear, Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said the president had established an “Office of Shipbuilding” and to “stay tuned!”\n\nSupporters of the fees hoped that they would deter shipping companies from buying the Chinese vessels and thus push ship orders to South Korea, Japan and, eventually, the United States.\n\nThe ultimate fate of the fees is not clear. The Office of the United States Trade Representative, the agency that formulated the policy, said on Sunday that it would negotiate with China over the issues raised in the investigation that had led to the fees.\n\n“While taking these actions, the United States will continue its domestic efforts and its discussions with key allies and partners on revitalizing American shipbuilding,” the office said in a news release.\n\nA bill in Congress aimed at improving American commercial shipbuilding — called the SHIPS for America Act — intended to use the fees on Chinese ships to subsidize the creation of a new fleet of American cargo vessels.\n\nAsked where the money to finance the fleet would come from if the fee revenue did not exist, Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana and a co-sponsor of the bill, said the legislation envisioned other ways to raise money.\n\n“Regardless of whether this suspension moves forward, the SHIPS Act is critical to rebuilding America’s commercial shipping industry and vital to our national security,” Mr. Young said in a statement.\n\nAmerican ships can cost as much as four times those made in Asia, and, as a result, there is little demand for them. The shipping companies that buy large American vessels do so essentially because they have to. The companies transport goods from one American port to another, voyages that, under U.S. law, must be done by American-made ships crewed by Americans.\n\nBut there are signs that Mr. Trump’s shipbuilding push is gaining some traction.\n\nCompanies from South Korea say they intend to make ships in the United States and invest in American shipyards. Hanwha, a South Korean conglomerate, has said it wants to expand the shipyard in Philadelphia that it bought last year.\n\nWhen retaliating against the American shipping fees, China said it had put five American subsidiaries of Hanwha on its sanctions list, accusing them of “supporting and assisting” the United States in its moves in the shipbuilding industry.\n\nOn Monday, China said it was suspending the sanctions on the Hanwha entities for a year.\n\n“We are aware of China’s Ministry of Commerce’s announcement, and we will continue to work to deliver for our maritime customers around the world,” James Hewitt, a spokesman for Hanwha Global Defense, said in a statement.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/world/middleeast/israel-extremist-attack-west-bank.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:33:56-05:00","title":"Israel Arrests 4 After Jewish Extremist Attack in Occupied West Bank","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"On November 11, 2025, four Israelis were arrested after a coordinated attack by masked civilians in a West Bank industrial zone between Nablus and Tulkarem, where they set fire to vehicles, beat Palestinians, and damaged a military vehicle.

Jewish Extremist Attack in Occupied West Bank\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T18:33:56-05:00\n\nThe Israeli police said four Israelis had been arrested after dozens of masked civilians attacked Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Tuesday and set fire to property, in an assault the authorities labeled “acts of extremist violence.”\n\nThe Israeli attackers burst into a Palestinian industrial zone between the West Bank cities of Nablus and Tulkarem, torching vehicles, said Monjed al-Juneidi, one of the owners of a warehouse in the zone for dairy products.\n\n“They arrived prepared and organized, with incendiary material,” he said.\n\nMr. al-Juneidi said that the company’s 25 employees in the area had taken shelter inside the warehouse, and that the marauders had smashed windows in an attempt to break inside.\n\nThe assailants also beat several Palestinians who lived nearby, who were rushed to Nablus for medical treatment, according to Ghassan Daghlas, the Palestinian governor of the district. The Israeli military said four Palestinians had been evacuated for treatment.\n\nThe attackers later fled to a nearby Israeli industrial zone, where some of them set upon Israeli soldiers, damaging a military vehicle, the Israeli military said.\n\nIsrael’s domestic security agency, the Shin Bet, was helping investigate the assault, according to the police, who did not immediately identify the suspects.\n\nInternational monitors say assaults by Jewish extremists on Palestinians in the West Bank like the ones on Tuesday, which skyrocketed in parallel with the war in Gaza, have escalated in recent weeks.\n\nThe assaults have also increased substantially in recent weeks during the yearly olive harvest, as Palestinians head to the fields to gather produce. Over the weekend, Israeli settlers wielding stones and clubs assaulted a group of Palestinians who had sought to harvest olives from their groves. A Reuters journalist and a security adviser were also assaulted, according to the news agency.\n\n“We used to see them attack in bands of three or four,” said Mr. Daghlas, the Nablus governor. “Now they’re in crowds.”\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 264 settler attacks in October caused casualties, property damage or both — the highest monthly toll in nearly two decades. The U.N.’s humanitarian affairs office in Jerusalem, which collected the data, warned of “a sharp rise in settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, both in frequency and severity.”\n\nPalestinian and Israeli human rights groups often say that the Israeli government turns a blind eye to the violence. They say Israeli soldiers and police who disperse the clashes frequently leave without detaining the assailants or arrest only Palestinians.\n\nAnd relatively few of the alleged Israeli perpetrators are ever indicted, let alone convicted, rights groups say.\n\nMr. al-Juneidi, the warehouse owner, later accompanied the Israeli police and military as they examined the scene. He said he hoped they brought the perpetrators to justice, but noted that this rarely happens.\n\nYesh Din, an Israeli rights group that examined more than 1,700 police investigations into offenses committed by Israelis against Palestinians in the West Bank from 2005 to 2024, found that more than 93 percent of cases were closed with no indictment filed.\n\nIsaac Herzog, the Israeli president, condemned the assailants for attacking “civilians and Israeli soldiers,” saying they had crossed “a red line.” He said that the attacks had been carried by a “violent and dangerous few.”\n\nThe assaults even drew criticism from one of Israel’s top settler leaders, Israel Ganz, the head of the Yesha Council, a settler umbrella organization. Mr. Ganz condemned the attack.\n\n“I back up the Israeli military and the police in arresting the anarchists who harmed soldiers and civilians,” Mr. Ganz said in a statement. “Anyone who takes the law into their own hands and harms others should be punished under the law.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/justice-department-to-investigate-protests-at-turning-point-event-at-berkeley.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:46:47-05:00","title":"Justice Department to Investigate Protests at Turning Point Event at Berkeley","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Justice Department announced a formal investigation into the University of California, Berkeley, following protests at a Turning Point USA event on November 10, 2025.

conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk.\n\nBy Tim Arango\n\nThe Department of Justice said on Tuesday that it will investigate the University of California, Berkeley, after protesters confronted attendees of a campus event hosted by Turning Point USA, the conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September.\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, who leads the department’s civil rights division, wrote on X that the division would “investigate what happened here.” Ms. Dhillon, a conservative lawyer from California, described the protesters as members of Antifa, a label that the Trump administration has applied to broad groups of people protesting against the government.\n\nShe wrote that, “I see several issues of serious concern regarding campus and local security and Antifa’s ability to operate with impunity in CA.”\n\nLate on Monday afternoon, anticipating that the event would draw protesters, police began cordoning off an area outside Zellerbach Hall, on the Berkeley campus’s Sproul Plaza. But when organizers had difficulty scanning tickets, a line began snaking out from the theater and friction grew between attendees and protesters.\n\nDan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university, said there had been “a single violent incident” involving two people on a sidewalk just off campus property, and that they had been arrested by the city of Berkeley’s police department. He said that two others had been arrested by the campus police for minor, nonviolent infractions.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department sent a letter to the university, notifying it of the investigation and requiring that it preserve records related to the protests, including communications among board members and administrators, as well as video and audio recordings of the protests.\n\nThe department said earlier this year that it was investigating the University of California system over allegations that it failed to protect Jewish students from antisemitism, and for its diversity hiring practices. Its examination of Berkeley’s response to the protest on Monday may be folded in to those investigations, or a new one may be started, the department said.\n\nIn a statement, the university said that “there is no place at UC Berkeley for attempts to use violence or intimidation to prevent lawful expression or chill free speech.”\n\nThe university also said that it was cooperating with the Justice Department and would work with the F.B.I. to “identify the outside agitators responsible for attempting to disrupt” the Turning Point event. “UC Berkeley will take all appropriate steps to safeguard the right of every member of our community to speak and assemble freely,” it said in the statement.\n\nMore than 900 people had attended the Turning Point event, Mr. Mogulof said, adding that it “went on safely, successfully and without disruption.”\n\nMore than 200 demonstrators gathered late Monday afternoon and stayed through the evening to rally against the event, which featured the comedian Rob Schneider and Frank Turek, a Christian author. Protesters chanted, “No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA,” and “Trump must go now!”\n\nAt one point the crowd briefly scattered after hearing loud noises that resembled gunshots. The situation quickly de-escalated when the crowd realized the sounds were fireworks.\n\nAmong those attending was Grayson Peters, a sophomore at Berkeley studying applied mathematics, who described himself as a liberal who was interested in hearing opposing points of view.\n\n“I’m a Democrat, and I wanted to hear Turning Point USA at Berkeley, and how they would react, how this would be,” he said. “I’ve never been to one of these rallies before, and I really like hearing the other side’s opinions.”\n\nAndrew Kolvet, a spokesman for Turning Point USA, posted a video on X of attendees inside the hall waving posters of Mr. Kirk and chanting his name. “Despite Antifa thugs blocking our campus tour stop with tear gas, fireworks and glass bottles,” he wrote, “we had a PACKED HOUSE in the heart of deep blue UC Berkeley.”\n\nCoral Murphy Marcos contributed reporting\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/business/economy/trump-tariffs-immigrants-grocery-stores.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:03:29-05:00","title":"Where the Taste of Home Comes With a Tariff Charge","category":"Economy & Business","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article explores how tariffs imposed by the Trump administration—particularly targeting countries like Bangladesh (20%), India (50%), and Laos (40%)—have led to significant price increases in traditional foods for immigrant communities across the United States.

that revolves around a one-block stretch of 36th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, just west of the N/W train, where signs beckon in Bengali and notes of cumin, coriander and green chilies waft across the sidewalks.\n\nThe staples found here are not available in your typical supermarket. Species of fish that don’t exist in the United States, such as the river-dwelling keski, arrive from Bangladesh. So do frozen sweets and processed grains like poha, a flattened rice.\n\nMany of them have gotten markedly more expensive over the past few months as the Trump administration’s tariffs have hit Bangladesh — as well as alternative sources, such as India, Pakistan and Thailand — especially hard.\n\nShohel Ahmed, 48, a tall man with a trim beard who has owned Bonoful Grocery since 2009, shuttles inventory to the store most days from wholesalers in the warehouse districts of Queens.\n\n“New shipment coming, and they increase all the products,” Mr. Ahmed said, with some frustration. He has raised prices in turn. He pointed at one type of rice, for example, that now costs $23 a bag, up from $17. But there are limits to what his customers will pay. “We cannot put too much price, because the community say no,” he said.\n\nPresident Trump’s broad and hefty tariffs have boosted food prices across the board, extending a period of high inflation from after the pandemic. But the pinch is especially sharp for the immigrant diasporas from countries where tariffs are the highest.\n\nBangladesh bears 20 percent duties under the “reciprocal” tariff schedule that the White House imposed in August. Queens County has the largest population of Bangladeshi immigrants in the country, about 62,000 spread beyond Astoria into Jamaica and Ozone Park, where several grocery stores supply the tastes of home.\n\n“The first generation of the Bangladeshi community, it’s their historic habit — they can’t change all of a sudden,” said Abu Taher, who runs Time Television, a Bengali-language station in New York City. “Second generation, they can change.”\n\nFor centuries, New York has absorbed immigrant communities with their own cuisines and flavors. Grocery stores catering to them have anchored neighborhoods including Flushing, a hub for people from China (average tariff rate: 58 percent), and a Staten Island enclave of arrivals from Sri Lanka (20 percent).\n\n“For many New Yorkers, those provide a sense of cultural identity and connection,” said Kate MacKenzie, the director of the city’s Office of Food Policy. “That is really important, perhaps more so than a sense of food security, finding belonging.”\n\nThe effect extends beyond New York. In St. Louis, émigrés from Bosnia (tariff rate: 30 percent) are feeling it, as are Indianapolis’s immigrants from Myanmar (40 percent). America’s largest concentration of people from India (50 percent) lives in the Bay Area, where dozens of South Asian grocery stores have raised their prices.\n\nThe first line of defense in the tariff wars are distributors. They have been drawing down credit lines to cover tariffs in the 30 or 45 days before they get paid by their own customers and trying to find countries with lower tariffs that can export similar goods.\n\nDaniel Demeshulam is the chief executive of Bedemco, which imports from all over the world and sells to domestic manufacturers and retailers. There are alternatives for some commodity goods such as cashews, which predominantly come from Vietnam (tariff rate: 20 percent). But he has had to stop buying golden raisins from South Africa (30 percent), for which there is no perfect substitute.\n\n“Everyone is having to borrow more than they had, and with interest rates where they are, it’s going to squeeze us more and more,” Mr. Demeshulam said. Even though he passed some price increases on to customers, the tariffs have wiped out his profits. “We’re losing money on some deals just to keep the business going,” he said.\n\nBrad Koshar runs Jorday Foods, a New Jersey-based importer that supplies grocers, restaurants, food banks and schools with foods from Europe, South America and Asia, including the Middle East. He has had to stop importing from India because, he said, customers wouldn’t accept high enough prices to account for the 50 percent duties. That means a wide variety of snacks and spices are no longer available.\n\n“Small retailers, specialty retailers are suffering because there’s only so much they can pass through on a cost increase,” Mr. Koshar said.\n\nCarrie Garlejo runs a small grocery store in San Diego County, Calif., the home of the nation’s largest community of immigrants from Laos (tariff rate: 40 percent).\n\nMs. Garlejo’s parents met in a refugee camp in Thailand in the late 1970s. They came to the United States in 1980 and worked in manufacturing until 2004, when they bought a recently opened grocery store in Escondido, called Oriental Food Market, that catered to Laotian immigrants.\n\nIt wasn’t an easy business, but they kept it going. Sales accelerated during the pandemic, when more people were cooking at home. Ms. Garlejo took over the company in 2023, after her own career in catering wilted, and rebranded it Rice Pantry.\n\nAlthough the store specializes in Lao ingredients, importing directly from Laos is difficult for regulatory and logistical reasons. So Ms. Garlejo gets most of her goods from Thailand (tariff rate: 19 percent), where the cuisine is very similar. She can still import the silkworms, mackerel and a dark, earthy type of spinach that people from villages in Laos put in soups.\n\nThe business fell off soon after she took over, as inflation forced her to raise prices almost immediately. Over the past few months, tariffs have supercharged the increases. A 50-pound bag of rice went from $48 to $55, and her sales dropped. Food stamp benefits have also been cut over the past couple of years, and more shoppers have tried to economize by driving farther to the big Asian supermarkets like 99 Ranch.\n\nFor Ms. Garlejo, 43, the stress is mounting.\n\n“The steady days are the good days,” she said. “The down days are the days where you’re like, ‘I don’t know if I’m going to make it through this.’ I just took it over a couple years ago, and I’m in this position where I may let my parents’ legacy just crumble.”\n\nIn Astoria, Mr. Ahmed’s small grocery has generated enough income for him to buy a house in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens for his four children. But it hasn’t been profitable over the past year, as his clientele has bought only what it really needed and has been bargain-hunting for the rest.\n\nMr. Ahmed has thought of a way out: becoming a distributor himself. He used to import directly for his store, but got out of the business when dealing with health regulations became too onerous. Now, cutting out the middleman seems like the only viable way to keep prices in check. He traveled to Bangladesh in November to get started.\n\nOn a recent sunny Saturday, the tiny store was busy with shoppers peering at prices and examining their receipts. Among them was Ahn Karim, 40, a cheery Astoria resident with a young son in tow.\n\nHe came to the United States in 2010 and works as a building inspector for the city; his wife is a teacher. Their modest incomes have been stretched in recent years. Mr. Karim shops in Jackson Heights for better prices on produce, but for the kind of fish he remembers from home, he prefers Bonoful Grocery. It’s now $8 a pound, up from $4 earlier this year.\n\n“Tariffs are terrible,” Mr. Karim said. “At the end of the day, we pay for this price, not the government. They put it on the customer.”\n\nJeff Adelson contributed reporting.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/world/middleeast/israel-ron-dermer-resigns-netanyahu.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:43:31-05:00","title":"Key Netanyahu Minister Steps Down From Israel’s Government","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Ron Dermer, a key strategic advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has resigned from his position as Minister of Strategic Affairs.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a central figure in shaping Israel’s policies during the Gaza war, submitted his resignation letter on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Dermer, who had been signaling his intention to depart from the government for several months, said he had pledged to his family that he would serve in the position for two years, but stayed longer to work with Mr. Netanyahu during what he called a “critical” period in Israel’s history.\n\n“This government will be defined both by the attack on October 7th,” Mr. Dermer wrote, and by the prosecution of the multifront war that followed. Mr. Dermer was referring to the Hamas-led assault that ignited the devastating war in Gaza.\n\nThe resignation comes about one month after the last of the living hostages in Gaza were returned to Israel as part of a cease-fire deal with Hamas and as the remains of most of the deceased captives have now been turned over.\n\nAs one of Netanyahu’s closest aides, Mr. Dermer, 54, led Israel’s cease-fire negotiations with Hamas and helped secure American support for joint airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, leaving an outsized mark on the country’s war strategy.\n\nMr. Dermer is a polarizing figure in Israel. While some see him as instrumental in securing the recent cease-fire deal, others believe he helped Mr. Netanyahu prolong the war for the prime minister’s own political survival.\n\nThe Israeli military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. It has also led to widespread privation and hunger and has destroyed much of the enclave.\n\nThe war brought in Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Israel also struck in Syria and conducted extensive raids in the West Bank throughout the war.\n\nMr. Dermer thanked Mr. Netanyahu for the opportunity to serve him “closely” and for trusting him “to handle the most significant issues facing Israel at this critical time.”\n\nHe praised Mr. Netanyahu’s leadership in his letter, writing, “Standing up to both internal and external pressures, you wisely navigated Israel through this war, standing firm to protect our vital interests when necessary and showing flexibility when those same vital interests required it,” Mr. Dermer wrote.\n\nThe international Criminal Court has issued a warrant for Mr. Netanayhu’s arrest for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza, allegations that Mr. Netanyahu denies.\n\nMr. Dermer, who moved to Israel from the United States as an adult, previously served as Israel’s ambassador to the United States between 2013 and 2021, working with both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nIn 2022, he continued helping Mr. Netanyahu’s diplomatic efforts, taking on the role as Israel’s strategic affairs minister, many times leading relations with the Biden and later Trump administrations, as well as other countries. He also played a key role in hostage negotiations with Hamas, mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States.\n\nA native of Miami Beach, Fla., Mr. Dermer is the son of a former Democratic mayor of the city. He moved to Israel after graduate school, never serving in the Israeli military, which is mandatory for most Israeli citizens.\n\nHe has advised the prime minister since 2000 and, in a sign of their close ties, was once described as “Bibi’s Brain,” a reference to Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname, Bibi, by the online magazine Tablet, which is focused on Jewish culture.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, Mr. Dermer developed a relationship with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and former Middle East adviser. In the past year, the two worked closely together on advancing a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nMr. Dermer said in his resignation letter that he is not sure what his next steps will be.\n\nIn a post on social media, the prime minister on Wednesday thanked Mr. Dermer for his “tremendous help” to him and the state of Israel. “I am sure you have much more to contribute in the future,” Mr. Netanyahu said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/business/merchant-marines-shipbuilding.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"13:27:05-05:00","title":"Mariners Wanted: Six-Figure Salaries and Months at Sea","category":"Society & Culture","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The United States is facing a significant shortage of American mariners due to declining enrollment in maritime academies, a lack of American-flag commercial shipping, and a growing demand driven by legislative efforts to revive the domestic shipbuilding industry and counter China's dominance in global trade.

works as an officer on American cargo ships.\n\n“It was either this or art school,” said Ms. Caputo, who has worked on 10 vessels since graduating from New York’s state maritime college in 2018. “I was younger, and I was like, ‘Oh, that sounds exciting,’ so I gave it a shot.”\n\nThere are few American mariners today because only a small proportion of international commercial shipping is done with vessels flying under the American flag, meaning they are registered in the United States, follow the Coast Guard’s regulations and employ American citizens. The jobs pay well, but often require people to be away from home for months at a time.\n\nDemand for civilian mariners could soon rise because President Trump and a bipartisan group of legislators in Congress want to revitalize the American shipbuilding industry and counter China’s rise as a commercial shipping power. The United States made 38 large commercial vessels in the past decade, compared with over 7,500 produced by Chinese shipyards, according to BRS Shipbrokers.\n\nLegislators have drafted a bill that would provide subsidies for  a fleet of new American vessels for international trade that would have to have American officers and engineers. Roland Rexha, the secretary-treasurer of the Marine Engineers’ Beneficial Association, a union for merchant marine officers, said the fleet would require thousands more American crew members.\n\nMariners can earn over $100,000 and get as much as six months of paid leave a year. The pay was what initially attracted Ms. Caputo, 29, to working at sea. “I can afford to take care of myself and my family fairly well,” she said.\n\nEven so, fewer new officers are entering the profession. There are only seven maritime academies in the United States — six state schools and the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y. The federal academy is free to attend, but the state schools are not. The number of students graduating with Coast Guard qualifications to work on vessels has been falling, to 810 last year from 1,048 in 2017, according to data from the Maritime Administration, part of the Department of Transportation.\n\nMr. Rexha said shipping companies had made changes that were helping to attract and retain mariners, like improving food and providing internet connections at sea. “But they have to address wages,” he said.\n\nThe Military Sealift Command, a fleet of ships that supplies the U.S. Navy and is crewed by civilians, has struggled to employ mariners, even though it is offering high pay — an annual salary of more than $220,000 for a first officer along with a $71,000 signing bonus, according to its jobs page.\n\nThe fleet took vessels out of regular service last year because of a lack of civilian mariners.\n\nThe high salaries on American vessels are a draw, but working at sea for long periods — and being away from home and families — can be hard for mariners.\n\n“You’re seeing different things — you meet all kinds of people,” said Ms. Caputo, a second mate, the third-highest rank on a vessel. “But it’s also isolating, because you’re away from your people, your family, for three to four months at a clip.”\n\nCole Johnson, an engineer who graduated from the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, said that he was excited for a career as an engineer, but that he often wondered how he might meet someone and start a family.\n\n“I knew it was going to be tough with this job,” Mr. Johnson, 24, said.\n\nOne possibility, he said, is to eventually switch from long hauls at sea to a maritime job that does not require being away for long periods. But the pay, he said, is likely to not be as high and he would have less time off.\n\nNathan Weymouth, most recently a chief engineer on a tramper, a ship that does not operate on a fixed route, said he had been home for five Christmases during his 22 years as a mariner.\n\nMr. Weymouth, 46, added that, while six months of paid shore leave might appear generous, mariners worked such long days at sea that they put in far more than half a year’s work while on vessels. He said that he worked more than 12 hours a day, and that some shipping companies did not provide enough well-trained people to run vessels.\n\n“You get off the ship, and you’re so burned out,” he said.\n\nStill, Mr. Weymouth said he had earned enough to buy 84 acres in North Carolina on which he was planning to start a tree farm. He felt somewhat optimistic about the future of the profession, he said, because his union, the Marine Engineers’ Beneficial Association, was “holding companies accountable and advocating for improved wages.”\n\nStudents at the maritime academies learn to be either deck officers, who command, navigate and steer vessels, or engineers, who oversee the functioning of a ship’s engines and equipment.\n\nSeveral shipping companies were on the lookout for hires at a career fair last month for mariners at Texas A&M Maritime Academy in Galveston, one of the six state academies.\n\nFairwater, one of the shipping businesses at the fair, recruits as many as 70 new mariners a year, said Jordan McDonald, a senior director at the company. He said Fairwater, which transports petroleum products and chemicals on a fleet of 42 ships, was able to find a sufficient number of recruits.\n\nAidan Ussery, a student at Texas A&M’s academy, said he had “absolutely loved” the 100 days he spent on a tanker in the Gulf of Mexico as part of his training. “Most people don’t know what this career is,” Mr. Ussery, 21, said while standing in a ship simulator. “Once I explain it, they’re like: ‘Oh, my gosh, that’s so cool. You’re going to make how much?’”\n\nHe said that he was thinking of joining the Military Sealift Command, and that he expected to earn around $120,000.\n\nCommercial shipping has also struggled to attract women and people from underrepresented groups. From 2013 to 2022, just 13 percent of the students at maritime academies were women and 2 percent were Black, according to a report last year from the Maritime Administration.\n\nAllegations of sexual assault have also plagued the industry. A student from the federal maritime academy, Hope Hicks, said she was raped in 2019 while working on a ship operated by Maersk, a large shipping company based in Denmark. Maersk settled a lawsuit brought by Ms. Hicks in 2022 for an undisclosed sum. That same year, Congress passed legislation that sought to require shipping companies to do more to prevent sexual assault.\n\nChristine Dunn, a lawyer who represented Ms. Hicks, said that the law had provided important safeguards, but that it had to be consistently enforced.\n\nHope Germanakos, a graduate of the Merchant Marine Academy and now working on a Chevron vessel, said the company had regular trainings aimed at preventing sexual assault on ships. Since working on vessels, she has been treated as an equal, Ms. Germanakos, 25, said.\n\n“My opinion always seems to be valued,” she said.\n\nFor there to be an upswing in demand for mariners, Mr. Trump and Congress have to succeed with their efforts to revive American shipping.\n\nBut there have already been setbacks.\n\nIn his recent trade truce with China, Mr. Trump suspended for a year fees that were recently imposed on Chinese commercial ships that dock in the United States. The bill in Congress relies on the fees to subsidize the new fleet made up of American vessels crewed with Americans.\n\nThe bill also intends to bolster the maritime academies and study whether more are needed.\n\nCol. Michael Fossum, a former astronaut who is now superintendent of Texas A&M’s academy, said his institution was ready to respond.\n\n“If they build them, we will provide the crews,” he said.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/bishops-coakley-immigration.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:29:01-05:00","title":"U.S. Bishops Elect New Leader as Concerns Mount Over Treatment of Migrants","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The U.S. Roman Catholic bishops elected Archbishop Paul S.

Nicolás Maduro surely knows well. A Latin American strongman was in hiding, surrounded by American troops, heavy metal blaring through the night.\n\nIn December 1989, Gen. Manuel Noriega’s run as dictator of Panama was reaching a humiliating end. American troops had invaded the country with orders to capture Mr. Noriega and bring him to trial.\n\nThey would wind up surrounding his final hide-out, tormenting him for 10 days with loudspeakers blasting songs from the likes of Black Sabbath and Guns N’ Roses until he surrendered into handcuffs.\n\nToday, as President Trump considers military action in Venezuela, the parallels between Mr. Noriega and Mr. Maduro grow more and more significant, and some Trump officials hope the Venezuelan president will meet a similar fate.\n\nLike Mr. Noriega more than 30 years ago, Mr. Maduro has been federally indicted on drug trafficking charges. And U.S. officials maintain that the Venezuelan is not a foreign leader but a criminal who must be “brought to justice,” as Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently said.\n\nIn a national address announcing the invasion of Panama, President George H.W. Bush laid out his grounds for moving against Mr. Noriega, a defiant nationalist who brandished a machete in public and hosted cocaine-fueled parties at his lavish mansions. They included Mr. Noriega’s dictatorial rule, concerns about the security of the Panama Canal, and the brash general’s increasing hostility toward the United States. (In a final straw, Mr. Noriega’s forces had killed a U.S. Marine at a roadblock.)\n\nBut Mr. Bush also stressed Mr. Noriega’s status as a wanted criminal. The Justice Department had indicted him on charges of taking huge bribes in return for letting drug traffickers ship cocaine through his country.\n\n“I directed our armed forces to protect the lives of American citizens in Panama and to bring General Noriega to justice in the United States,” Mr. Bush said.\n\nFor Mr. Noriega, escape was never an option. As Operation Just Cause began, a team of Navy SEALs crept onto an airfield and blasted Mr. Noriega’s personal Learjet with an anti-tank gun. SEAL divers sank a potential getaway boat with explosives. In all, some 27,000 American troops deployed.\n\nAs the assault began, a panicked Mr. Noriega, accompanied by a mistress, wove through Panama City in an unmarked Hyundai and went into hiding. At one point, he ducked incognito into a Dairy Queen before taking refuge in the embassy of the Holy See in Panama City. Delta Force commandos and U.S. Army tanks quickly surrounded the building, which they could not storm, and demanded his surrender.\n\nWhen he refused, the music kicked in. The playlist was designed for maximum stress — and ridicule: Bon Jovi’s “Wanted Dead or Alive,” Van Halen’s “Panama,” Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.”\n\nBrent Scowcroft, who was serving as national security adviser to Mr. Bush, later called the tactic “a low moment in U.S. Army history.”\n\nBut Mr. Noriega eventually surrendered and was hauled to Florida for trial. (The general’s years of service as a secret C.I.A. asset providing intelligence about Latin America were not enough to save him.) He was convicted and spent the rest of his life in prison until just before his death in 2017 in a Panamanian hospital after brain surgery.\n\nMr. Noriega may be gone, but his story has not been forgotten — not by Mr. Maduro or Trump administration officials, many of whom have spent years trying to topple the Venezuelan leader.\n\nMr. Noriega’s capture sometimes came up during debates in Mr. Trump’s first term about how to deal with Mr. Maduro, according to two former officials from the time. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, then the national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence and now a presidential envoy to Ukraine, had firsthand experience in Panama as an infantry assault commander during the operation.\n\nAmong the options Trump officials considered at the time were a large-scale U.S. invasion of the country and “a smaller, special operation targeted directly at Maduro,” Mr. Trump’s former defense secretary Mark Esper wrote in a 2022 memoir.\n\nBut the similarities between Panama 1989 and Venezuela 2025 are dangerously misleading, some analysts warn. Any U.S. effort to apprehend or kill Mr. Maduro, they say, would be far more treacherous than the operation to corral Mr. Noriega.\n\n“When people talk very loosely and say, ‘Well, we’ll just take him out,’ it’s useful to recall 1989,” said Michael Shifter, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service with extensive experience in Latin America.\n\n“When one confronts the realities of what it would require, you conclude how crazy it would be to commit American troops for regime change in Venezuela,” he added.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, U.S. efforts to depose hostile Latin American rulers have largely been failures. They include Mr. Trump’s own unsuccessful first-term push to oust Mr. Maduro, which sought to capitalize on the street protests across Venezuela in 2019.\n\nStill, experts say the similarities between 1989 and today must be unsettling to Mr. Maduro.\n\n“There are parallels,” said Elliott Abrams, who served as U.S. special envoy for Venezuela during Mr. Trump’s first term. “One is that the guy running the government is someone we do not view as a legitimate head of government. And both are drug traffickers.”\n\nIn September, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Mr. Maduro was “one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.” The Venezuelan leader, she added, “will not escape justice.”\n\nAnd like Mr. Noriega, who ran Panama though puppet politicians, Mr. Maduro is considered an illegitimate ruler by the United States because of the fraudulent elections that have kept him in power since 2013. Trump officials say he is more accurately described as a criminal cartel leader.\n\nAs a Republican senator from Florida in 2019, Mr. Rubio posted images on Twitter of several toppled dictators in what was widely seen as a warning to Mr. Maduro, as domestic unrest and U.S. pressure mounted. They included before-and-after shots of Mr. Noriega — first waving his machete before a crowd, next posing for his federal mug shot.\n\nMore recently, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida and an ally of Mr. Rubio’s, warned in a late September interview that Mr. Maduro might “rot in jail for the rest of his life like Noriega.”\n\nMr. Trump may be deterred from major military action in Venezuela by the scale of the challenge. Panama was an easy target — a small country with a weak military, and in 1989, U.S. troops were already stationed there guarding the Panama Canal. Venezuela is about 12 times larger than Panama, with a population more than 10 times greater than Panama’s in 1989.\n\nAnd even the puny Panama Defense Forces put up enough resistance to kill 23 U.S. troops, including four of the elite Navy SEALS who carried out the assault on Mr. Noriega’s  jet. The United States has estimated that 314 Panamanian soldiers and 202 civilians died during the operation.\n\nMr. Maduro also enjoys a “highly skilled” inner ring of protection, Mr. Abrams said, with an elite force of bodyguards supplied by his close political allies in nearby Cuba.\n\nMr. Maduro, in other words, would be unlikely to be found hiding out in a Dairy Queen.\n\nBut like Mr. Maduro, Mr. Noriega was also defiant to the end. In April 1988, he thrilled a crowd when he concluded a fiery anti-U.S. speech by smashing a podium with his machete.\n\n“This machete represents the dignity and courage of the Panamanian people,” Mr. Noriega said. “It says, ‘not one step back.’”\n\nJust as Mr. Noriega rejected U.S. efforts to negotiate his exit from power, Mr. Maduro has similarly refused to step down, instead offering Mr. Trump a U.S. stake in his country’s mineral wealth.\n\nThe Venezuelan leader has also invoked the memory of 1989, weaving it into a larger narrative about his defiance of what he calls American imperialism.\n\nDuring a visit to Panama City in 2015, Mr. Maduro stopped to lay a wreath at a memorial to Panamanians killed in the U.S. invasion.\n\n“Never again a U.S. invasion in Latin America,” he declared.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/us/politics/marco-rubio-equatorial-guinea.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:05:00-05:00","title":"Senator Criticizes Rubio for Paying $7.5 Million to Equatorial Guinea to Take Deportees","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"A U.S. Senate Democrat, Jeanne Shaheen, criticized Secretary of State Marco Rubio for paying $7.5 million to Equatorial Guinea to take deportees from the United States, calling the payment 'highly unusual' and raising serious concerns about transparency, corruption, and human rights abuses.

Criticizes Rubio for Paying $7.5 Million to Equatorial Guinea to Take Deportees\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T19:05:00-05:00\n\nA Democratic senator has criticized Secretary of State Marco Rubio for paying $7.5 million to the government of Equatorial Guinea to agree to take deportees from the United States who are not its citizens.\n\nThe senator, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to Mr. Rubio on Monday saying that the “highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe $7.5 million is by far the largest payment the Trump administration is known to have made to another government to take deportees who are not its citizens.\n\nMs. Shaheen noted that Transparency International, a research group, ranked Equatorial Guinea 173 out of 180 countries for corruption. And the State Department itself said in its 2023 human rights report that the country’s “president and members of his inner circle continued to amass personal fortunes from the revenues associated with monopolies on all domestic commercial ventures” and that “corruption at all levels of government was a severe problem.”\n\nA State Department report from 2025 on human trafficking pointed to multiple “credible sources” who had said government officials were involved in trafficking, including for sex.\n\n“I have serious concerns over whether, without appropriate oversight mechanisms and guardrails, a direct payment to Equatorial Guinea’s government could be used to facilitate human trafficking,” Ms. Shaheen wrote. “I am also concerned about what protections are in place to ensure that third-country nationals removed to Equatorial Guinea are themselves not vulnerable to human trafficking, smuggling or human rights abuses.”\n\nWhen asked about Ms. Shaheen’s statements, the State Department declined to comment on its arrangement with Equatorial Guinea, saying it did not want to reveal details of “diplomatic communications with other governments.”\n\n“Implementing the Trump administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” it said in a statement. “As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”\n\nIn one of its most contentious policies, the Trump administration has aggressively tried to deport a wide range of immigrants from the United States. Mr. Rubio has ordered diplomats to try to forge agreements with other nations to take deportees who are not their citizens.\n\nA New York Times investigation that was based mostly on reviews of U.S. diplomatic cables and other federal documents found that, as of June, American officials had approached at least 58 governments about this effort. Many of the nations that were asked to take deportees had records of persistent human rights abuses and torture. Equatorial Guinea was one of them.\n\nThe State Department has agreed to make large payments in some cases. It paid Rwanda $100,000 to take an Iraqi man and was discussing further arrangements with the country. Most notably, it agreed to pay El Salvador $4.76 million to take up to 300 deportees whom the Trump administration accused of being members of a Venezuelan gang, according to a court filing.\n\nThe men, at least some of whom had no clear ties to any gang, were put into a notorious prison. The Times found many suffered physical and mental abuse there.\n\nIn her letter, Ms. Shaheen noted that the $7.5 million payment to Equatorial Guinea was staggering compared to previous foreign assistance given to the country. Over the past two administrations, the most aid money the United States ever gave to the country was $2 million in a year. The most given in one year by the first Trump administration was $780,000. The current amount given exceeds the sum of the past eight years of payments.\n\nAnd in previous years, the United States did not give the aid directly to the government, with the exception of limited medical supplies. It sent the assistance to vetted partners that included nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations.\n\nThe $7.5 million payment is from a fund set up by Congress for the U.S. government to help with migrant and refugee issues, and specifically to help resettle those in need.\n\nThe ruling family of Equatorial Guinea, a West African nation that has abundant oil and natural gas reserves, has been widely accused of corruption.\n\nTeodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of the president and a vice president who is the expected successor, was convicted by a French court in 2017 of embezzling millions of dollars of public money that allowed him to lead a lavish lifestyle in Paris. The court imposed a suspended prison sentence of three years and a suspended fine of 30 million euros, or about $35 million.\n\nOn Sept. 29, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, met with Mr. Obiang Mangue in Washington after the State Department had given him a waiver on corruption sanctions to travel to the United States during the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York. The State Department said the two officials “reaffirmed joint commitments to deepen commercial and economic ties, combat illegal immigration and advance security cooperation.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/nyregion/manhattan-doctor-anointment-extradition-japan.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"07:49:35-05:00","title":"Accused of Desecration, a Doctor Faces the End of His Life’s Work","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Dr. Masahide Kanayama, a 63-year-old U.S. obstetrician-gynecologist renowned for treating endometriosis, is facing extradition to Japan on charges of vandalizing religious sites by anointing pillars at a Buddhist temple and a Shinto shrine in March 2015.

Life’s Work\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T07:49:35-05:00\n\nOne day in March 2015, surveillance cameras at a thousand-year-old Buddhist temple on the outskirts of Tokyo captured a man wearing a hooded windbreaker, a white collared shirt and black shoes, dabbing at wooden pillars with oil on his fingertip.\n\nLess than an hour later and 17 miles away, Japanese authorities said, a man with a similar build and clothing was caught on video anointing an offerings box at another site, a Shinto shrine founded in 643 B.C. during the reign of Japan’s first emperor.\n\nThe faiths predate Christianity by centuries, and the sites draw 12 million pilgrims and tourists each year. They venerate the Buddha and the Shinto kami, the spirits that the faithful believe animate natural forces and inhabit the land. The smears of oil, as the authorities saw them, despoiled Japan’s religious heritage.\n\nThe authorities found their suspect in New York, roughly 7,000 miles away, and issued arrest warrants for him on two counts of vandalism.\n\nHe is Masahide Kanayama, 63, a single, childless doctor who had devoted his life to helping women bear children; a man whose Christian faith was inseparable from his work. He has practiced in Manhattan for nearly three decades and is an expert in endometriosis, a condition in which cells similar to the uterine lining grow outside the uterus. His patients describe how his surgeries ended years of crippling pain and, in some cases, allowed them to have children.\n\n“I believe the Holy Spirit works through me by giving me an ability to perform my unique surgical technique,” Dr. Kanayama said. “When guided by faith, medicine becomes a way to serve God by serving others. My goal is to let God’s love be reflected through my actions and services.”\n\nNow, a decade after the hooded man was seen at the holy sites, that work may soon become impossible. The Japanese authorities say they found YouTube videos from 2012 in which Dr. Kanayama discussed anointing shrines with oil for religious purposes. They are seeking to bring him back to Japan for trial.\n\nDr. Kanayama’s lawyers said in a statement that he did not damage any sites, and added that “even if true, his actions damaged nothing.”\n\nHis lawyers have gone to federal court seeking to block the extradition, arguing that there is insufficient evidence to charge him. They have also asked the State Department, which has the final say on extraditions, not to approve this one.\n\nThe State Department recently told Dr. Kanayama’s lawyers they had denied the request, but U.S. officials agreed to delay any removal until Dr. Kanayama’s legal challenge is decided.\n\nA federal appeals court heard oral arguments last month and could issue a decision at any time. If the court rules against the doctor, he would face extradition to Japan, his native land, and prosecution.\n\nThe charges could bring five years of hard labor in a Japanese prison.\n\nOne Sunday morning in mid-October, Dr. Kanayama entered the Times Square Church on West 51st Street near Broadway. The nondenominational church, a former theater, welcomes thousands of worshipers in person and online to services that draw on the Pentecostal tradition. There is a live band and gospel singing, and congregants approach the pulpit seeking healing. He closed his eyes as he prayed, sang and swayed to the music.\n\nDr. Kanayama, whose ethnic Korean heritage already makes him an outlier in Japanese society, came to his faith at 17 when his mother took him to an evangelical missionary church in Tokyo. There, he had a spiritual awakening that he says led him to become a Christian and move to the United States.\n\n“I will show my healing power through your hands,” he said God had told him.\n\nHe attended Creighton University, a Jesuit school in Omaha, where in 1985 he graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in chemistry; and in 1991, he obtained his M.D. from the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nIn 1995, he completed four years as a resident at the Mayo Clinic’s medical school, and then moved to New York, where he worked for several years as a professor at the Mount Sinai medical school’s department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences. He also began practicing at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut, where he performs his surgeries, using an excision technique that he developed.\n\nDr. Kanayama, a legal permanent resident of the United States, now runs the New York Endometriosis Center in Manhattan, which he says has drawn patients from around the world, including Japan. The office includes a meditation room lined with rice paper and bamboo flooring. Dr. Kanayama said he wanted to provide patients with an atmosphere of tranquillity and calm.\n\n“Healing is not only physical, but also mental, emotional and spiritual,” he said.\n\nJessie Lambiase, 34, a Westchester County resident who owns two fitness studios and a jewelry store, had long struggled with the pain and fatigue of endometriosis. Doctor after doctor seemed dismissive. One suggested a therapist.\n\nShe said Dr. Kanayama had immediately recognized her condition and told her it wasn’t all in her head. She has undergone two surgeries with him, most recently this year.\n\n“He’s been the only doctor who has been able to help me,” she said. “Looking at a future where I still have this disease and he’s not here, and there’s really no other surgeon who does what he does — that’s terrifying.”\n\nMary Giuliani, a 50-year-old Manhattan writer and caterer, said she had seen a half-dozen doctors before Dr. Kanayama’s surgery finally relieved her pain in 2022.\n\nShe said that if he were extradited, the effect on patients would be dire, as so many could miss out on a life without pain or the ability to create a family.\n\n“It’s only him,” she said. “There’s nowhere else to go.”\n\nDr. Kanayama’s schedule, his lawyers said, is booked months in advance, with patients from all over the world. He has told few of his patients of his legal predicament, and says he finds a haven in church, a respite from the long surgeries he performs during the week and the stress of his case.\n\nThroughout much of the two-hour service that day at the Times Square Church, Dr. Kanayama stood in the packed rows, his left hand gripping a Japanese-language Bible and his right arm raised in the air.\n\nHe often carries that Bible, with its dog-eared pages and underlined verses. “I underline everywhere,” he said.\n\nHe has loved going to other churches as well. Years ago, he created a nonprofit called International Marketplace Ministry and traveled to Europe, South Korea, Japan and around the United States. He spoke to church groups and to businesspeople about living spiritual lives, not just in church but also in the workplace.\n\n“I’m just a doctor,” he said. “But I know the Lord. I know God. I know how to communicate, so I just share my experience and I encourage people.”\n\nAdherents of his strain of marketplace Christianity strive to marry their faith and their vocation, following the model of John the Baptist, who preached to tax collectors and soldiers. They believe that work life and spiritual life must be one.\n\nDr. Kanayama said he ended the trips and his nonprofit activities in 2015, after the Japanese authorities charged him.\n\n“Anointing” appears throughout the Bible as a sacred practice. The oil, smeared, rubbed or poured, is a symbol that God has chosen a person or object for a holy purpose. It is used to sanctify physical spaces: In the book of Exodus, God tells Moses, “Thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.”\n\nAt the ancient Naritasan Shinsho-ji Temple in the city of Narita, the Japanese authorities said Dr. Kanayama had left oil on pillars that were part of the main gate used to enter the sanctuary.\n\nThe gate was built in a traditional Japanese architectural style and is itself an object of worship, a temple official said in a declaration filed with the court. The oil had left blackish stains, the official wrote.\n\nAt the Katori Jingu Shrine in nearby Katori, oily liquid was left on wooden poles on both sides of the front stairs, on the stairs themselves and on the box where worshipers can make donations, a shrine official said in another declaration. The oil left stains, although over time they became almost invisible unless observed up close, the official said.\n\nThe Japanese authorities concluded that it was possible that one person committed both crimes in the 51 minutes that had elapsed between them. They also determined that the figure seen in the security footage at both sites resembled the driver of a gray Toyota Prius that was caught on an expressway tollgate camera around the same time.\n\nThe Prius’s license plate number led investigators to a car rental agency at a nearby airport, where Dr. Kanayama’s name was found in the rental records. Flight records showed he had traveled to Japan from New York a few days earlier.\n\nDr. Kanayama said he had been targeted because he was a Christian in a country where members of the faith had suffered repression for hundreds of years and today represent only about 1 percent of the population.\n\n“This is a religious persecution,” Mr. Kanayama’s lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, said. “Why else would they be so enthusiastic about destroying not only this man’s life, but ending his ability to help thousands of women who suffer from a very serious medical malady?”\n\nThe Japanese consulate in New York did not have any immediate comment on the case.\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2022, Dr. Kanayama sat with his lawyers in a federal courtroom in Lower Manhattan as an American prosecutor argued that Japan’s extradition request should be honored. If the judge agreed, the question of whether to hand him over to Japan would be up to the U.S. secretary of state.\n\nThe prosecutor, Tara La Morte, said the standard for sending Dr. Kanayama back to Japan had been met. For one thing, as the mutual extradition treaty required, there was a crime in New York — criminal mischief — that was equivalent to the offense Dr. Kanayama faced in Japan. And the evidence had shown there was probable cause to believe that he had damaged the sites.\n\nShe pointed to the 2012 YouTube videos of a man Japanese officials said was Dr. Kanayama talking about pouring oil on shrines.\n\n“This is evidence, your honor, of intent and motivation,” Ms. La Morte said.\n\nDr. Kanayama’s lawyers dispute whether Dr. Kanayama is clearly shown in the videos, and say that his comments about pouring oil on shrines were translated incorrectly. In court, Mr. Lichtman did not concede that his client had been present at the sites or had left any oil on them. But if he had, Mr. Lichtman said, the purpose had not been vandalism.\n\n“There was never any intent here for him to damage anything,” Mr. Lichtman said. “He was there to purify.”\n\nMs. La Morte noted that the case was of particular significance to Japan because of other incidents in which historical sites had been vandalized.\n\n“It’s important to Japan to figure out why it’s happening and who is doing it,” Ms. La Morte said.\n\nMr. Lichtman suggested that Japan’s motives were less benign. “This is a political case,” he said, citing what he called the relative insignificance of the allegations against his client weighed against the fact he is “a world-renowned OB-GYN” who had “helped thousands of women globally.”\n\n“It’s our position that this is a grotesque abuse of the extradition treaty,” he said.\n\nIn January 2023, the judge, Edgardo Ramos, ruled that Dr. Kanayama could be extradited; a second judge, who was asked to review the case, concurred. Dr. Kanayama’s appeal is pending.\n\nDr. Kanayama’s recent visit to the Times Square Church came days after the State Department had denied his lawyers’ request to stop his extradition on legal and humanitarian grounds.\n\nAfterward, on a bench outside, he turned the pages of his Bible to a passage from the Book of Micah he had underlined. He said its message was that God asks three things: Do justice, love mercy and humbly walk together with him.\n\nDuring the service, the pastor had referred to people enduring hard times, people who were broken.\n\n“I’m totally broken right now,” Dr. Kanayama said. “But I’m still alive,” he added. “They’re not crushing my spirit.”\n\nThe pastor, apparently alluding to a popular Christian song, had also said of God, “There’s no wall you won’t pull down, no lie you won’t tear down.”\n\n“I think that statement is coming to answer my prayer,” he said.\n\nSusan C. Beachy and Georgia Gee contributed research.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/opinion/antisemitic-politics-carlson-fuentes.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"17:00:05-05:00","title":"Meet the New Antisemites, Same as the Old Antisemites","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"The article argues that antisemitism is resurging within American conservative politics, despite past efforts by figures like William F.

That includes Senator Ted Cruz, who called out his fellow Republicans for being too timid to condemn Carlson; The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, which denounced “this poison in their own ranks”; and Heritage Foundation people who resigned in disgust after Kevin Roberts, the organization’s president, offered a lickspittle apologia for Carlson. Even Roberts felt compelled to disavow his own performance, though he persisted in describing Carlson as “my friend.”\n\nThe bad news is that none of this is going away anytime soon. If ever.\n\nAntisemitism was supposedly banished twice from the conservative universe: first in the 1950s, when William F. Buckley Jr. decreed that nobody on the masthead of the antisemitic American Mercury would appear in the pages of his own National Review; second in the 1990s, when he said it was “impossible to defend” Pat Buchanan from charges of antisemitism. Such was Buckley’s prestige on the right that none other than Carlson issued his own denunciation of Buchanan: “I’m not hysterical on the subject,” he said on C-SPAN’s “Washington Journal” in 1999, “but I do believe that there is a pattern with Pat Buchanan of needling the Jews.”\n\nNow the Heritage Foundation and various conservative publications are pressing the Trump administration to award an unrepentant Buchanan the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The notion that Winston Churchill, not the German Führer, was the villain in World War II — another of Buchanan’s hobbyhorses — is again gaining ground on the right. Buchanan’s obsessive loathing of Israel, along with his conviction that the pro-Israel lobby dictates U.S. foreign policy, is also gaining ground — a mirror image of the views of the anti-Israel left and a reminder of the French aphorism “Les extrêmes se touchent.” Extremes meet.\n\nHow did this happen? Cynicism is one reason. “The fact that antisemitism is the socialism of fools is an argument not against, but for, antisemitism; given the fact that there is such an abundance of fools, why should one not steal that very profitable thunder?” Leo Strauss, the philosopher, observed in 1962. Bluntly, his point was that a bigotry for morons — a.k.a., “The Jews did it” — will always be political gold in a world of morons. Candace Owens, the right-wing podcaster, gets this: Her popularity has soared as her Jew-hatred has become more overt.\n\nA second factor is the forced merger of Christianity with conservatism.\n\nMainstream American conservatives used to believe our sacred texts were the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution; “Reflections on the Revolution in France” and “The Road to Serfdom.” Now it’s the New Testament. We once thought that religious convictions should be a little more respected in our secular Republic. Now this is supposed to be a Christian regime that tolerates Jews. (Others, not so much.) When Carlson, speaking at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, compared the slain conservative to Christ brought down by “a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus thinking about, ‘What do we do about this guy telling the truth about us?’” the inference could have been lost on nobody. Among conservatives, he paid virtually no price for it.\n\nThen there’s political ideology. The MAGA movement is not antisemitic. But many of its core convictions are antisemitic-adjacent — that is, they have a habit of leading in an anti-Jewish direction.\n\nOpposition to free trade, or to a welcoming immigration policy, or to international law that crimps national sovereignty, are legitimate, if often wrongheaded, political positions. But they have a way of melding with hoary stereotypes about “the International Jew” working across borders against the interests of so-called real Americans. You can be sure that, somewhere on social media, someone will respond to this column by pointing out that my Kishinev-born grandfather changed his name from Ehrlich to Stephens — evidence, supposedly, of sneakiness in my DNA. It’s the type of right-wing identity politics you inevitably get where the question of where you are from matters more than the question of where you are trying to go.\n\nFinally, it bears reminding that antisemitism isn’t merely a prejudice. It’s a conspiracy theory about Jews. Who actually killed Christ? Or brought on the bubonic plague? Or got America embroiled in unnecessary wars in the Middle East? Or replaces American workers with cheap immigrant labor? The idea that modern politics amounts to a malicious scheme organized by an insidious cabal of deep-state insiders and globalists at the expense of ordinary people is now received wisdom on the right, paralleling far-left convictions about the purported evils of Zionists and their billionaire backers.\n\nJews don’t have the luxury of being indifferent to either threat. The tsunami of progressive antisemitism that hit after Oct. 7 is being followed by another wave, just as tall.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Deserts\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T14:22:36-05:00\n\nStaysha Quentrill is often called to work in the middle of the night. Occasionally, she needs to get a ride in an off-road vehicle to a mother in labor. Once this year, she oversaw a birth in an Airbnb. Ms. Quentrill catches babies in bedrooms and bathrooms, on living room floors and in inflatable birthing pools.\n\nOne of the few midwives attending home births in West Virginia, Ms. Quentrill has added some 30,000 miles to her car’s odometer in the last year, traveling across the state to provide care. She has attended hundreds of births, most of them uncomplicated. But even in the best of circumstances, midwifery is high-stakes work. “You’re responsible for two lives,” Ms. Quentrill, 36, said. She has seen shoulders wedged tight behind a pubic bone. With a firm rub and a few squeezes from a ventilation bag, she has resuscitated babies born not breathing, she said, their “lungs like a closed balloon.”\n\nBut for her, the job comes with additional risks.\n\nWest Virginia is one of 13 states that do not license midwives unless they are nurses, even if they have been nationally certified, as Ms. Quentrill has. With no laws around midwives who aren’t nurses and no available state licensure, Ms. Quentrill is left to operate in what she considers a “sort of legal gray area.” In other states, midwives in similar positions have faced charges of practicing medicine without a license. In Georgia, one woman was threatened with a $500 fine for each time she called herself a midwife.\n\nStill, Ms. Quentrill believes the work is too important for her to stop. Today in West Virginia, as in a growing number of states, there is a need for people who know how to deliver babies.\n\nMore than a quarter of the state’s hospitals have closed their delivery units since 2010. More than 60 percent have no obstetric care. In nearly half of the state’s counties, there are no birthing hospitals, and not a single practicing obstetrician. The state is also home to only one birth center, a childbirth facility typically run by midwives. Pregnant women spend hours driving to appointments. Babies are born on the side of highways and in emergency rooms. When due dates approach, women sleep on other people’s couches to be close to a hospital.\n\nOne delivery at a time, Ms. Quentrill and other midwives are trying to provide another option, by reviving the region’s culture of community-based care.\n\nNationally, a small but growing number of women are giving birth at home, and West Virginia is no exception. In the United States, most of these home births are overseen by people with Ms. Quentrill’s credential: certified professional midwife. The North American Registry of Midwives, the credentialing body, does not require a nursing license or university degree, though some of the midwives have one or both. But the certification does call for extensive training, including attending at least 55 births under the supervision of an experienced midwife. It is also the only certification that requires out-of-hospital birth experience.\n\nMany doctors and nurses are opposed to certified professional midwives and home births in general, seeing them as unnecessarily risky. But Beth Redden, who for years was the rare midwife with a nursing license attending home births in West Virginia, said she found practitioners like Ms. Quentrill “provide evidence-based, safe, effective, high-quality care.”\n\n“Every year West Virginia fails to license them, they’re failing their constituents,” she added. “They’re failing Appalachian people who are just looking for care.”\n\nBefore Ms. Quentrill joined the profession, midwives delivered her own babies. She had the first four of her seven children at the birth center. But because the risk of complications rises after a certain number of deliveries, the center’s policy at the time was to refer women having a fifth baby to the hospital.\n\nInstead, she had her fifth baby at home with midwives, and then two more. The experience gave her a feeling of unwavering support and complete autonomy. In 2020, Ms. Quentrill decided she wanted to pass on that feeling to others.\n\nShe sought training she felt harked back to a community of midwives, many of them Black, who operated in Appalachia over a century ago.\n\nIn the early 20th century, though, that community came under attack, part of a broader push to shift the birthing process out of the home and into hospitals, and to curb high infant and maternal mortality. In 1925, West Virginia began requiring midwives to apply for a license. The same year, a nurse named Mary Breckinridge established what became known as the Frontier Nursing Service, which trained nurses as midwives and deployed them, on horseback, to families in Appalachia.\n\nMs. Breckinridge is sometimes hailed as the “mother of American midwifery.” But she refused to hire or educate Black midwives, and denounced those still practicing in Appalachia.\n\nIn West Virginia, the state said midwives had to be able to read and write, possess a diploma from a midwifery program or have a doctor verify their skills and prove their cleanliness and moral character.\n\nFor many community-based midwives, the educational criteria were difficult to meet, and their numbers dwindled. In the 1970s, West Virginia amended the 1925 law, removing any path to licensure for midwives who were not nurses.\n\nNationally, midwives moved into hospitals and birth centers, and the home birthrate dropped below 1 percent. Appalachia’s culture of community midwifery died off almost entirely.\n\nLearning of this history, Ms. Quentrill decided not to pursue a nursing degree, though she understood that meant she’d be practicing without legal recognition in her state.\n\n“I knew I wanted to focus specifically on home birth and being in the community,” she said. “Especially when it comes to Black midwifery, this is our birthright.”\n\nOn a warm afternoon earlier this year, Ms. Quentrill sat in Carmen Squires’s living room as a 9-week-old Rottweiler sniffed around her ankles.\n\nMs. Squires, who is Black, said she sought out Ms. Quentrill because it felt more comfortable to have “a midwife who looks like me.” Thirty percent of Black women report mistreatment during pregnancy and childbirth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many feel ignored, their concerns dismissed. Ms. Squires felt that working with Ms. Quentrill might insulate her from that possibility.\n\nThe traditional obstetric care Ms. Squires received during her first three pregnancies often felt rushed. Appointments with Ms. Quentrill felt more like a visit between friends. Ms. Squires’s two youngest children drifted in and out of the room. Her older children’s laughter spilled from the kitchen. The puppy fell asleep leaning against Ms. Quentrill as the two women talked.\n\nIt was close to 45 minutes before Ms. Quentrill opened her backpack full of supplies. Eventually, Ms. Quentrill drew some blood from Ms. Squires, 35, for routine first-trimester testing, then moved closer on the couch to sweep a hand-held Doppler wand along Ms. Squires’s belly.\n\nBecause she doesn’t have a state license, she has had to figure out workarounds. Unable to bill insurance, she charges $5,000, though she and other midwives sometimes offer discounts or barter midwifery services for car repairs or landscaping. She’s accompanied by another midwife or birth assistant at each delivery. If a patient needs antibiotics or other medications, Ms. Quentrill brings a nurse to administer them.\n\nShe said she does carry and, when necessary, injects clients with a synthetic oxytocin to stop postpartum hemorrhage. Because the drug can be lifesaving, she said she’s willing to defend the choice to administer it herself, should that ever become necessary.\n\nMs. Quentrill believes that home birth is not for everyone. She doesn’t attempt breech deliveries or accept clients having twins or triplets, and she carefully considers other risks, including the mother’s weight, age and blood pressure. She refers higher-risk women elsewhere. And she always has a plan in place for getting to a hospital, which she said she acts on around 15 to 20 percent of the time.\n\nDr. Kimberly Farry, an OB-GYN in Buckhannon, W.Va., said that in her experience, certified professional midwives were “for the most part, pretty darn good at really assessing the risks of their patients.” If they were licensed, she could imagine calling on them to check on clients deep in West Virginia’s hills in the event of an emergency. And for some women with low-risk pregnancies, Dr. Jeremy Applebaum, an OB-GYN at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said home birth is a good option.\n\nMs. Quentrill said she has never had a mother or baby die on her watch. And some studies have found planned home births to be relatively safe for women with low-risk pregnancies. But they do often list midwives as co-authors, and the official stance of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is that the safest place to give birth is a hospital or accredited birth center.\n\nThe organization cites research by Dr. Amos Grünebaum and Dr. Frank Chervenak, both professors of obstetrics and gynecology at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, which found home births are associated with an increase in the risk of infant death.\n\n“There’s no way to get around this,” Dr. Chervenak said. “It is risky to deliver at home. There are many clinical scenarios where things can go wrong.”\n\nStill, Dr. Grünebaum said state licensure of community midwives could potentially help make home birth safer, by creating a pathway to connect midwives to doctors and hospitals, or requiring that they carry insurance and accept only low-risk patients.\n\nAnd, Dr. Chervenak added, “it’s better to have a midwife at a home birth than to have nothing at all.”\n\nFor years, Beth Redden, the nurse-midwife who attended home births in West Virginia, covered nine counties, often driving three hours to get from one client’s home to another. It was a recipe for burnout, and led her to lobby for years for certified professional midwives to be licensed.\n\nIn at least seven states, certified professional midwives are vying for licensure. This year, Ms. Quentrill and two other midwives worked on a state bill, which passed unanimously in the West Virginia Senate but was removed from the House agenda without explanation a few days before the end of the session.\n\nSoon after, Ms. Redden closed her home birth practice and went to work at the birth center. Without licensure to draw more midwives into the profession, she said she felt like help simply wasn’t coming.\n\n“You get tired after a while of beating your head against the wall,” she said. Though she feels guilt over the decision, “when nothing was changing, it was like ‘Man, I can’t do this anymore.’”\n\nBut Ms. Quentrill isn’t quitting. She intends to get a bill reintroduced early next year and, if needed, “every single year until it passes,” she said. In the meantime, she’ll keep showing up when mothers call.\n\n“It’s necessary,” she said, “and we’re going to continue to do it.”\n\nRead by Kate Morgan\n\nAudio produced by Sarah Diamond.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/nyregion/nypd-ccrb-chairman-resign.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"18:22:03-05:00","title":"Head of N.Y.P.D.

Oversight Board Resigns, Citing Pressure From Union\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T18:22:03-05:00\n\nThe chairman of New York City’s police oversight board has resigned, citing intense pressure from the head of the city’s largest police union, whom he accused of waging a “campaign of lies” against him.\n\nThe board chairman, Dr. Mohammad Khalid, submitted his resignation on Friday, leaving the position vacant less than two months before the inauguration of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who has supported giving more power to the agency. The 15-member panel, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, reviews investigations of police officers accused of misconduct and votes on whether to recommend discipline.\n\nDr. Khalid, a dentist with a practice on Staten Island, said he could no longer withstand the attacks of Patrick Hendry, the president of the Police Benevolent Association. Mr. Hendry has spent the last several months criticizing Dr. Khalid in opinion articles and on social media, accusing him of prejudice against police officers.\n\n“Mr. Hendry’s attacks have been relentless and untrue, and they have negatively impacted me, my family and my health,” Dr. Khalid said in a resignation letter addressed to Mayor Eric Adams and to Adrienne Adams, the speaker of the City Council. (The mayor and speaker are not related.)\n\n“To be clear, I would have liked to continue my work with the C.C.R.B.,” Dr. Khalid wrote. “But I will not do so when he can brazenly lie about me without consequence.”\n\nMayor Adams appointed Dr. Khalid, 77, as interim head of the board in December 2024.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Khalid said that in recent months he had lost sleep and been so stressed that he had to see a doctor. He said he felt he “had no other choice” but to resign.\n\n“He pushed me to the brink,” Dr. Khalid said of Mr. Hendry, adding, “It’s really heartbreaking that you cannot do the job for which you have been appointed.”\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Hendry accused Dr. Khalid of having a “biased voting record” against police officers accused of misconduct, saying he had voted to discipline officers 95 percent of the time, a figure the board does not dispute.\n\nHe said he also took issue with Dr. Khalid’s support for taking steps to give the board final say on disciplining officers. Currently, the police commissioner has the sole authority to decide whether to set discipline for an officer found guilty of misconduct. Previous board chairs have also recommended giving the board the final say on discipline, and Mr. Mamdani has said he would support that change.\n\nMr. Hendry said Dr. Khalid’s “dangerous plan to strip away the police commissioner’s authority made it clear that police officers were never going to get fair treatment,” and that Dr. Khalid’s resignation was “an important first step” in making the board an “impartial agency.”\n\n“Dr. Khalid must be replaced by a fair-minded chair,” Mr. Hendry said, “and every case that went against a police officer should be thrown out.”\n\nThe board has long had an acrimonious relationship with the city’s police unions, which often criticize the agency’s decisions. The previous chairwoman, Arva Rice, left her post in July 2024, three months after Philip Banks III, then the deputy mayor for public safety, asked her to resign. The request came after she criticized police officials for delaying an investigation into the fatal shooting of a Bronx man by failing to turn over evidence in a timely manner.\n\nDr. Khalid, who previously served on the board for 10 years under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said he returned to the board last year after representatives from Mayor Adams’s office asked him to come back as chairman.\n\nBut months into his tenure, Mr. Hendry began criticizing him, calling him “anti-cop.” This month, he called for Dr. Khalid’s resignation, saying he had violated the city’s charter by serving on the board while also keeping a seat on a community board on Staten Island.\n\n“I was never, ever anti-cop,” Dr. Khalid said in the interview. “My own father was a police superintendent in Pakistan.”\n\nDr. Khalid said his community board seat was a volunteer position that he disclosed when he was appointed board chairman.\n\nIn a statement, Mayor Adams thanked Dr. Khalid for his role in “providing police accountability and oversight.”\n\n“We wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors,” Mayor Adams said. “We are committed to working toward a future that allows for healthy discourse and respectful rhetoric.”\n\nDakota Gardner, a spokesman for the review board, declined to comment on Dr. Khalid’s resignation letter. In a statement, Mr. Gardner said that Dr. Khalid “cared deeply about each case he reviewed.”\n\n“He led by example in letting the values of objectivity and impartiality guide his decision-making,” Mr. Gardner said. “He always sought to follow the law and the facts, no matter what.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/arts/cleto-escobedo-dead-jimmy-kimmel-live.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:34:13-05:00","title":"Cleto Escobedo III, Jimmy Kimmel’s Bandleader, Dies at 59","category":"Politics & Governance","summaryOfNewsArticle":"Cleto Escobedo III, the longtime bandleader of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' since 2003, died at 59.

childhood friendship with the comedian Jimmy Kimmel led to a decades-long role as the leader of the house band on Mr. Kimmel’s late night show, “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” died on Tuesday. He was 59.\n\nMr. Kimmel announced the death on Instagram. He did not cite a cause or say where Mr. Escobedo had died.\n\nMr. Escobedo’s band, Cleto and the Cletones, has been with “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” since the show’s inception in 2003, but his association with Mr. Kimmel dated to their time growing up together in Las Vegas.\n\n“Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was 9 years old,” Mr. Kimmel wrote on Instagram. “The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true.”\n\nIn a 2013 interview with Variety, Mr. Kimmel recalled that Mr. Escobedo was a “musical prodigy.”\n\n“When ABC offered me my show, I prayed that they’d let me hire Cleto, and to my amazement they agreed, sight unseen,” Mr. Kimmel said. To ensure that the network would stick with the band, Mr. Kimmel said he had taken ABC executives — including Lloyd Braun, the chairman of the network’s entertainment division at the time — to see Mr. Escobedo’s ensemble play live.\n\n“They were blown away, and they loved the idea that he’s my best friend and that his dad’s also in the band,” Mr. Kimmel told Variety.\n\nCleto Valentine Escobedo III was born Aug. 23, 1966, in Las Vegas, the only child of Sylvia Escobedo and Cleto Escobedo Jr. The elder Mr. Escobedo was also a saxophonist who would later join his son in the Cletones, and Mr. Escobedo said his father’s influence had been a driving force in his decision to become a musician.\n\n“There was music everywhere,” he said of his childhood in an interview with the podcast “The Jake Feinberg Show” last year. “I distinctly remember my dad was playing in Hawaii. I was 5 years old and watching his band and him play, and I used to get teared up watching my dad play. I was so excited by the music of it all.”\n\nMr. Escobedo was studying at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, when he began gigging along the Las Vegas Strip. His first big break came in 1990, when he landed an audition to join Paula Abdul’s touring band. A world tour with Ms. Abdul led to a record deal with Virgin Records, and tours with other artists, including Luis Miguel and Marc Anthony. He was touring with Mr. Anthony when he got a call from Mr. Kimmel asking him to lead the band on his new show, Mr. Escobedo recalled in an oral history interview with Texas Tech University in 2022.\n\nMr. Escobedo described the early days of his friendship with Mr. Kimmel as full of mischief — a sign of things to come.\n\n“We used to order cabs for people on our block, like, really late,” Mr. Escobedo recalled. “I don’t know, we used to all do the normal crank calls.”\n\nBut mostly, he said, the duo “mainly liked to just watch a bunch of comedy stuff, and we were big David Letterman fans when we were kids, so we’d watch a lot of that.”\n\nMr. Kimmel paid tribute to Mr. Escobedo on his show when Mr. Escobedo turned 50. Their “lifetime of friendship,” he said, “was highlighted by the kind of torture” that only ”an older brother can inflict on you without getting arrested.”\n\nBy the time Mr. Kimmel hired Mr. Escobedo as his bandleader, Mr. Escobedo’s father had retired from playing and was working backstage at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Mr. Kimmel suggested that his friend bring the elder Mr. Escobedo into the band. Playing on the television show became a family affair.\n\n“I’m in seventh heaven every night,” Cleto Escobedo Jr. told The San Antonio Express-News in 2013, adding in reference to Mr. Kimmel: “I’m playing music with my son on a show with my other son. If I screw up a couple notes, Cleto won’t fire me. There’s not another son and dad on late-night TV.”\n\nMr. Escobedo’s survivors include his parents; his wife, Lori; and his children, Cruz and Jesse.\n\nThe younger Mr. Escobedo’s boyhood friendship with Mr. Kimmel made him a staple on one of the longest-running comedy institutions in television.\n\n“There’s only a handful of these gigs in this country,” he told Texas Tech University, “so I’m very fortunate to have one.”\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/nyregion/nyc-casinos-revenue-taxes.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"15:46:14-05:00","title":"N.Y.C.

Casino Bids Promise an Economic Boom. The Reality Might Differ.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T15:46:14-05:00\n\nResorts World has promised up to $4 billion in annual revenue from a casino near Kennedy International Airport. Hard Rock Hotel & Casino has pledged revenues of $3.9 billion and 6,000 permanent jobs from a casino in Queens. And Bally’s has said it would spend $4 billion on a casino resort in the Bronx and pay $370 million in taxes every year.\n\nThe three contenders vying for one of up to three licenses to open a Las Vegas-style casino in New York City have made eye-popping claims about the potential economic impact of their proposed gambling houses.\n\nEven in the $115 billion casino industry, the projections by each operator stand out. Meeting or nearly meeting their revenue estimates would make any of them the highest-grossing commercial casino nationwide, outside Nevada and Mississippi. And the promises of major investments and financial rewards have enticed elected officials and won over some residents who believe the casinos will be economic stimulants, job creators and major tourist destinations.\n\nBut time and again at new casinos across the country, including ones that have opened recently elsewhere in New York, reality has not matched the initial forecasts, especially in urban areas. While substantial, revenues have missed targets and have been fleeting, with tax payments sliding year after year.\n\n“We have seen the same in other big cities like Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston,” said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute. “Rosy forecasts and promises never materialize.”\n\nExperts and researchers who have studied casinos describe their impact as far from a potent economic jolt. It is more like a reshuffling. The casinos absorb jobs from nearby companies, shift consumer spending away from other establishments and contribute taxes that would otherwise have been paid by other businesses.\n\n“They’re dressed up as if they’re generating revenue that is new to the economy when it simply is not,” said Jonathan Krutz, an emeritus professor at Boise State University’s College of Business and Economics who has studied casinos for decades. “Their target audience is then not going to be spending that money buying a used car or a dishwasher or a meal in a restaurant.”\n\nWhen casinos first rose in the Las Vegas desert and later on the Atlantic City boardwalk in the mid-20th century, they became tourism magnets and fueled an employment boom that extended to other local businesses. But today, the novelty of flashing slot machines, blackjack tables and dazzling casino floors has faded.\n\nCasinos are in almost every state, with new ones popping up all the time that cannibalize one another’s business and rely on loyal gamblers from their neighborhoods.\n\nThey are also facing emerging threats, mainly the multibillion-dollar mobile sports betting and online gambling industry that has attracted young players who tend to skip brick-and-mortar casinos.\n\nDoug Walker, an economics professor at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, said that with New York City’s high population density and high personal incomes, a casino would undoubtedly bring in sizable revenues. But it would otherwise operate like most others across the country, depending on a local customer base and attracting few out-of-town bettors.\n\n“A development of $5 billion will be big for any area, but in terms of the big picture and the city overall, you probably wouldn’t notice much,” Professor Walker said. “In an urban environment, it’s like any other industry.”\n\nNew York City would be the largest urban area in the country with a casino, fulfilling a long-held dream of the gambling industry.\n\nIn recent years, large casinos have opened in other major metropolitan areas, like Chicago and Boston. But those casinos have not met their initial goals.\n\nThe Encore Boston Harbor projected $800 million in annual gambling revenues. But after six years it has yet to reach that amount, and revenues have declined in the past three years. The Bally’s Chicago casino made $125 million in 2024 — half of what the city had forecast.\n\nIn a paper published this month, researchers who examined casinos in urban settings found that they had created small pockets of economic activity. They often hire hundreds or thousands of people and fuel a rise in employment in the blocks near them, forming an entertainment district of restaurants, bars and event venues.\n\nBut beyond that area, there were job losses that canceled out the gains, the researchers found.\n\nAri Anisfeld, an author of the report who is an assistant professor of economics at the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, said it was “a bit disappointing if you are trying help create job opportunities in an area.”\n\nIn 2013, New York voters authorized the state’s first commercial casinos, with seven licenses to hand out. The first four were reserved for operators outside New York City.\n\nSince opening, their performances have been mixed. Many have become the top employers in their counties, but just one site has surpassed its projected annual gambling revenue. Half of them have had declining incomes over the past three years, and the county that hosts Resorts World Catskills, in Monticello, N.Y., recently approved up to $585 million in bonds to help that struggling casino.\n\nSoon, the upstate casinos could face competition from major operators in the state’s most populated area.\n\nWith as many as three licenses up for grabs, the remaining bidders could each be awarded one as soon as December, though it is not guaranteed.\n\nTwo sites would be built from scratch — Bally’s in the Bronx, next to the company’s public golf course at Ferry Point, and the Hard Rock, on the parking lots of Citi Field, the ballpark of the New York Mets. The third, the Resorts World bid, already exists as a so-called racino, a racetrack with slot machines, and would be expanded upon.\n\nAltogether, the three properties have pledged to create more than 50,000 jobs, most of them temporary construction jobs. About a third would be permanent positions after they open. Bally’s said its median wage would be $62,400 a year, slightly below the median income for New York City workers.\n\nA 2021 report on the casino industry in New York commissioned by the state’s Gaming Commission estimated that three casinos in the city could together generate up to $4.4 billion in annual gambling revenue. The contenders themselves are more bullish.\n\nResorts World, which is the top grossing video gambling house in the country with about $1 billion a year in revenue, said it could quadruple that amount if it were the only casino awarded a license. If all three bidders were allowed to open, Resorts World estimated that it could make $2.7 billion a year from its New York City casino.\n\nIn its application, Bally’s Bronx estimated it could make more than $1 billion in gambling revenue, and Hard Rock said it could generate $3.9 billion in its third year of operations.\n\nMost casinos generate their income from slot machines, where players can make or lose money in just seconds, and these casinos would be no different. They would have thousands of slots and far fewer dealer tables for blackjack and poker.\n\nThe licenses handed out by the Gaming Commission will last between 10 and 30 years. Over that period, casinos will have to confront an aging customer base and the rising popularity of other forms of gambling, like betting on sporting events, researchers said. Sports bettors in New York wagered nearly $24 billion on their phones in the last fiscal year.\n\nOne expert, Kahlil Philander, said the biggest threat to casinos over the next 30 years would not be the potential for new casinos in the New York City area but “the confluence of demographic and technological preferences changing.”\n\nMr. Philander, an assistant professor at Washington State University’s School of Hospitality Business Management, used as an example the lottery, which “used to be very popular with high-income areas and middle-income people.” Those same people still play, he said, but they are getting much older.\n\nAll three bidders predicated that they would each contribute hundreds of millions of dollars every year in taxes. Up front, the state would receive a one-time bonus: Each winner will pay a fee of at least $500 million.\n\nMs. Dadayan of the Urban Institute said states typically see a boost in tax revenue from casinos as the initial excitement draws visitors. But it is not sustained. Since 2019, taxes paid by New York casinos and racinos have declined by more than 9 percent when adjusted for inflation, she said.\n\nStill, in small municipalities, that revenue can be a boon. The four commercial casinos elsewhere in New York State contribute 5 percent of their annual taxes to their host towns. In the rural town of Tyre, between Rochester and Syracuse, del Lago Resort & Casino has provided more than $2 million a year in local taxes. It was enough for Tyre, population 1,015, to eliminate its town tax rate.\n\n“It has been a tremendous benefit to the town, economically speaking,” said Elizabeth L. Partee, the town supervisor.\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/health/byheart-infant-formula-recall-botulism.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"19:03:20-05:00","title":"Infant Formula Recall Expands as Botulism Outbreak Grows","category":"Health & Public Safety","summaryOfNewsArticle":"An expanded voluntary recall has been announced by ByHeart, a maker of organic infant formula, after federal health regulators identified a botulism outbreak linked to its powdered Whole Nutrition Infant Formula.

Hurdles\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T15:59:46-05:00\n\nFor the BBC, President Trump’s threat of a $1 billion lawsuit has thrust the already-reeling British broadcaster into uncharted territory. For its American media counterparts, being threatened by the litigious president is familiar terrain.\n\nThe record of Mr. Trump’s litigation in the United States offers both hope and warning to the BBC, which has been convulsed by the resignation of two top executives, and by uncomfortable questions about its journalism.\n\nAs in some of the American cases, lawyers said, Mr. Trump would face formidable hurdles if a suit ever went to trial. He would have to persuade a court that a misleadingly edited clip in a BBC documentary caused him to “suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” as his lawyer claimed in a letter to the BBC on Sunday.\n\nWhile the broadcaster has yet to issue a formal reply to Mr. Trump, its board chair, Samir Shah, has apologized for the splicing together of footage of the president’s speech on Jan. 6, 2021, in a way that suggested a more direct link between his words and the insurrection at the Capitol hours later.\n\nThat concession, lawyers said, may weaken the BBC’s position somewhat. But there are other factors that suggest it would still be hard for Mr. Trump to prevail over the BBC in a Florida court, which is where his lawyer, Alejandro Brito, indicated he would file the suit.\n\nMost important, perhaps, two senior executives who had oversight of the BBC Panorama film, “Trump: A Second Chance?”, both said they believed it never aired in the United States. They asked for anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly. The BBC did not respond to a question about where the documentary was distributed.\n\nIf the executives are right, that could allow the BBC’s lawyers to argue that Florida is the wrong jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n“The court in Florida may potentially rule that the proper jurisdiction is England and Wales, as that is where the vast majority of viewers saw the broadcast,” said Daniel Taylor, a media lawyer at the London firm Taylor Hampton.\n\nThe problem for Mr. Trump is that in Britain, where the film aired in October 2024, he has missed the 12-month statute of limitations for filing a libel suit. Britain would have been a less attractive venue, in any event, because the maximum damages awarded in such cases is capped at about 300,000 pounds, or $395,000.\n\n“Obviously, the damages he can claim would be much higher in the U.S.,” Mr. Taylor said.\n\nEven if Mr. Trump survived a jurisdictional challenge, lawyers said he would face a high bar in proving that the BBC showed “actual malice” in splicing the footage of his speech — the standard for a libel judgment in American law. To do so, his lawyers would need to obtain evidence, like internal emails or texts, from the BBC and the production company, October Films, through a discovery process.\n\nThe BBC, in turn, would be entitled to demand from Mr. Trump evidence of the financial or reputational harm the broadcast caused him. It is far from clear, lawyers said, that the president would welcome that.\n\n“There would need to be a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the key players involved in the editing published the falsehood deliberately or acted with a high degree of awareness of its probable falsity,” said RonNell Anderson Jones, a professor of law at the University of Utah.\n\nBeyond the BBC’s actions, lawyers said, Mr. Trump would also need to demonstrate that the editing of the film substantially altered the way people viewed the events of Jan. 6, 2021, which began with the president rallying supporters in front of the White House and ended with crowds rampaging on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe BBC acknowledged that the footage was edited to take separate statements by the president — “We’re going walk down to the Capitol,” and “We fight. We fight like hell” — which were uttered about 50 minutes apart, and made them sound like a single statement that could be interpreted as a call to arms.\n\nBBC News has said it did not intend to mislead anyone. It said in a statement that its editing meant “to convey the key messages of the speech in a condensed format, since the whole speech was over an hour long.”\n\nLegal experts noted that multiple documentary accounts of Jan. 6 suggested that the president incited the crowd to attack the Capitol, a conclusion endorsed by the House of Representatives, when it voted to impeach the president on a count of “incitement of insurrection.”\n\n“There is a plausible argument that it did not alter the meaning of what he said during that speech,” said Lee Levine, a first amendment lawyer who has represented media companies, including the BBC and The New York Times.\n\nMr. Levine said the BBC’s admission of an “error in judgment” in the editing of the film would make it difficult for the broadcaster to dismiss Mr. Trump’s complaints out of hand. But he said previous lawsuits show that the president is often less interested in a legal victory than a lucrative settlement.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Trump sued The New York Times and three of its reporters for $15 billion for what he claimed were false and malicious stories about him that appeared in the newspaper. He also sued Penguin Random House, the publisher of a book written by two Times reporters.\n\nJudge Steven D. Merryday, of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, initially rejected the complaint, saying a complaint “is not a public forum for vituperation and invective.”\n\nIn some of his actions against media companies, Mr. Levine said, Mr. Trump has been able to wield the threat of other government action — legal or regulatory — to compel them to settle even dubious cases.\n\nIn July, Paramount Global, the owner of CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle Mr. Trump’s lawsuit against the CBS News program “60 Minutes” for the way it edited an interview with Kamala Harris in 2024, when she was the vice president and Democratic presidential nominee. At the time, Paramount and Skydance were seeking federal regulatory approval for a merger — approval that came later that month.\n\nWhile the BBC does not have major business operations in the United States, it does have a network of news bureaus and its programs are carried on BBC America, a cable channel owned by AMC Networks. With its partial public funding in Britain, it also has quasi-state status, which Mr. Trump could use to pressure the British government.\n\nThe Times and other media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, have fought lawsuits or threats of suits from Mr. Trump. But Mr. Levine noted that in Britain, where libel cases are easier to win, settlements are more common. He represented the BBC in a privacy case in the United States in 1990s, which the broadcaster settled.\n\n“Whereas in the U.S., there is a stigma to a U.S. company settling a defamation suit,” Mr. Levine said. “That’s not the case in the U.K. Media companies in the U.K. settle defamation suits all the time.”\n\nKim Darroch, who served as Britain’s ambassador to Washington during Mr. Trump’s first term, said that given the BBC’s unique stature and funding, the decision of how to respond to the president’s threat of a lawsuit would likely be as much political as legal or commercial.\n\n“I’m not sure, politically, there’s much support in this country for the BBC to whack out a lot of money to Trump,” Mr. Darroch said. But, he added, “This may be the moment for a little abject groveling.”\n\nJane Bradley contributed reporting\n\n"},{"source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/opinion/mamdani-election-strategy-democrats.html","dateOfPublication":"2025-11-11","timeOfPublication":"05:03:00-05:00","title":"Steve Bannon Thinks Zohran Mamdani Is a Genius.

It’s Not a Feint.\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T05:03:50-05:00\n\nIt’s only been a week, but the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York last Tuesday raises key questions for those seeking to put the Democratic Party on a winning path.\n\nDid his victory reveal the potential of a movement driven by legions of young, disaffected voters — especially struggling college graduates who are part of the so-called precariat — determined to wrest power from the party’s old-guard establishment and push the party’s platform to the left?\n\nOr will the Mamdani movement deteriorate and fall into the long tradition on the left of flames that all too quickly burn out, another in the list of protest movements that includes Occupy Wall Street, the pink pussy hat resistance and even Black Lives Matter?\n\nLet me say at the outset that I don’t claim to have the answer. I am instinctively pessimistic, based on covering the struggles of liberalism and the left for more than a half-century. That puts me on the side of doubters.\n\nAt the same time, however, key elements of Mamdani’s campaign have enormous potential for a party badly beaten in 2024, one that continues to be held in disdain by much of the electorate, including by many of its own members.\n\nTo an unusual degree, researching and writing this column has changed my thinking, leaving me more impressed with what Mamdani achieved and with the possibilities he has raised for the Democratic Party.\n\nThere is no question that Mamdani demonstrated an extraordinary, if not magical, ability to change the character and composition of the electorate in the nation’s largest city.\n\nThe turnout rate of voters age 18 to 29 rose to 41.3 percent this year from 11.1 percent in the 2021 election for mayor. The share of total turnout composed of 18-to-29-year-olds grew to 16.6 percent from 8.9 percent four years ago\n\nTurnout rose for all groups, but much more among young voters than among voters over 50.\n\nI am not going to try to address two related but unknowable questions — whether a Mamdani administration will succeed and whether Mamdani himself is a potential candidate for higher office. Instead, my focus is specifically on the broader applicability of the Mamdani campaign strategy for the national Democratic Party.\n\nMamdani built an insurgency within the Democratic Party primary electorate first by mobilizing traditionally quiescent young voters — many of whom have found that their B.A.s do not guarantee a good job or any job at all — and then drawing in nonwhite voters and more of the college-educated middle class.\n\nDemocrats have been trying to win for two decades with what came to be known as an upstairs-downstairs coalition of largely white college-educated voters and nonwhite voters of all educational backgrounds.\n\nThe Mamdani movement added two crucial ingredients: anger and moral purpose — and in so doing actually expanded the electorate itself.\n\nIn sharp contrast, say, to the campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the Mamdani campaign was, in effect, an intraparty insurrection seeking to displace what its backers see as a dysfunctional and failed old guard. It is this semi-revolutionary element that gave the Mamdani campaign its larger moral legitimacy: the reform of a moribund institution.\n\nBy achieving this, Mamdani’s admirers argued, he demonstrated the potential for initiating similar intraparty insurrections elsewhere in the country, campaigns seeking to convert internal discontent from a disadvantage into a tool to awaken and mobilize the electorate:\n\n“Simply put, the Democratic Party is primed for a hostile takeover.” Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, argued in a Substack post right after the election, “Mamdani and the Future of the Democratic Party.”\n\nMamdani has tapped into a new political marketplace for enterprising candidates, Enos contended:\n\nAs talented as Mamdani may be, there are many more people out there with similar talents and who are, like Mamdani, outsiders to the party establishment or will be willing to run as outsiders if this is the path to electoral success.\n\nGiven the national mood and the fact that virtually nobody really likes the Democratic Party, we can anticipate that these politicians will emerge as contenders for various levels of office, perhaps even as the next Democratic presidential nominee. And many, as with Mamdani, will likely be able to overcome establishment forces and gain power.\n\nMamdani’s significance, Enos argued,\n\nlies more in the fact that there was enough enthusiasm for change rooted in dissatisfaction with the status quo and anger at those who perpetuate it, that voters in a major election were willing to elect a true outsider candidate and to work hard enough to do so in the face of enormous establishment resistance.\n\nFrom an entirely different perspective, Steve Bannon, who oversaw Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and remains one of the most powerful voices on the right, sees great potential in the Mamdani campaign.\n\nBannon warned his fellow conservatives, including the president, that they risk self-delusion if they dismiss the significance of Mamdani’s victory. In an interview last Wednesday with Politico, Bannon declared:\n\nPeople better understand they have a fight on their hands. This guy is a serious guy. … The national Republican Party and some of the smartest strategists do not realize the power of the Working Families Party and the [Democratic Socialists of America] for ground game. Modern politics now is about engaging low-propensity voters, and they clearly turned them out tonight, and this is kind of the Trump model. This is very serious.\n\nBannon shares Enos’s view that Mamdani has opened a political window for the left: “You’re going to see a whole new group of Mamdanis in these major urban cities. This is the flower of what the progressive left has delivered over the last 40 or 50 years.”\n\nJohn Mollenkopf, director of CUNY’s Center for Urban Research, has studied the demographics, neighborhood dynamics, immigration patterns and politics of New York for more than four decades.\n\nHe has been impressed by the Mamdani campaign. In a phone interview, Mollenkopf described the mayor-elect as “an exceptionally talented communicator and campaigner, very thoughtful, very smart, very anticipatory about the kinds of criticisms he’s going to get.”\n\nMamdani was deluged with hostile questions throughout the campaign, Mollenkopf pointed out, and “one sign of how talented he is is that he doesn’t react with his gut. He reacts with his brain.”\n\nContrary to critics who argued that Mamdani is too far left, Mollenkopf argued that Mamdani\n\ndid exactly what the centrist critics of the woke Democratic Party said he should do. He constantly stressed kitchen-table issues, affordability, cost of living. He focused on that relentlessly.\n\nHe didn’t say, “I’m bringing socialism to New York.” He didn’t say, you know, “We’re going to seize the means of production.” He said, “We’re going to make your buses free and fast. We’re going to freeze your rent.”\n\nIn other words, “He followed the conservative advice about how Democrats could win.”\n\nMollenkopf argued that as mayor one of Mamdani’s key challenges will be managing and containing the more radical wing of the Democratic Socialists of America, “who think that the election is the road to revolution. Mamdani is going to have to confront those people sooner or later.”\n\nThe get-out-the-vote drive led by D.S.A. organizers was a key factor in Mamdani’s victory, in Mollenkopf’s view:\n\nThey got somewhere between 70 and 110,000 people out in canvassing efforts, both for the primary and for the general election. I’ve never seen anything like it in New York, including the Obama campaigns.\n\nThere is a more ambivalent view of the Mamdani campaign.\n\nZachary Donnini, a graduate student in data science at Harvard and a data adviser to the Yale Youth Poll, captured this equivocality in his prescient June 27 Substack posting, “How Zohran Mamdani Could Deliver the Left’s Most Important Win in Years.”\n\nThe general election “is definitely set to be the left’s biggest win since AOC defeated Joe Crowley, and potentially even bigger,” Donnini wrote,\n\nbut let me play devil’s advocate and throw some cold water on the excitement. It’s nothing new for the left to prove they can win Democratic municipal primaries in the most lefty cities in the country. Sure, this was against a massive disadvantage in name recognition and fund-raising, and N.Y.C. is a much bigger fish to fry that gets far more national media attention.\n\nBut Brandon Johnson won in Chicago just two years ago and now sits at a 6 percent approval rating as mayor. Progressive D.A. George Gascón won in Los Angeles in 2020, only to get absolutely demolished by an independent in 2024, running a staggering 53 points behind fellow Democrat Kamala Harris in the same county. …\n\nThis is shaping up to be the left’s biggest electoral win in forever, but it could all be for nothing (and potentially really damaging to the gaining momentum of the movement) if Mamdani can’t break the recent pattern of his progressive predecessors having spectacularly unsuccessful tenures actually governing.\n\nIn an email, Donnini elaborated:\n\nIt’s worth remembering that New York City is demographically exceptional. Mamdani’s strongest areas (Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and western Queens) represent a concentration of young, progressive voters found in only a handful of places nationwide, like Chicago’s North Side.\n\nWhile his appeal won’t translate everywhere, certain elements are replicable: his social media savvy and focus on affordability clearly resonate with a segment of the electorate. The challenge for Democrats is harnessing that enthusiasm without alienating swing voters in the process.\n\nThere are, of course, a substantial number of Democrats who view the Mamdani campaign as a political and ideological dead end that will collapse in failure, providing ammunition to Trump and his allies on the right.\n\nIn an email, Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist who played a key role guiding the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton to victory, made a detailed case that the moderate strategies adopted by Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, governors-elect of Virginia and New Jersey, offer a far better model for Democratic candidates than Mamdani’s approach:\n\nWe have empirical data after Tuesday. A real-life test case in which Spanberger, a centrist Democrat, flipped a G.O.P.-held governorship in a purple state with a centrist, persuasion-based strategy; while a socialist with a mobilization strategy limped across the finish line, an astonishing 18 points behind Kamala Harris.\n\nBegala argued that the very fact that “Mamdani ran on cost of living and did not focus on the woke white left’s agenda of identity, guilt and grievance” demonstrated the continuing strength of a centrist, pragmatic approach. “If a democratic socialist refuses to run on the far left’s social and cultural elitism, you can be sure it’s dead.”\n\nBegala did acknowledge the success of the Mamdani’s overarching strategic guideline:\n\nKeep it simple, stupid. Free buses. Freeze rent. Free child care. City-owned grocery stores. Tax the rich. Regardless of how you feel about these ideas, each one would fit on a hat.\n\nContrast those slogans with how Kamala Harris summarized her housing policy at an August rally in North Carolina: “As president, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy. We will take down barriers and cut red tape including at the state and local levels. And by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building three million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class. And we’ll do that together.”\n\nAll that said, Begala continued,\n\nLet me get to the heart of your question: Zohran Mamdani had the weakest win of a successful New York Democrat in 35 years. Fifty-point-four percent is weak. Eric Adams got 67 percent. Bill DeBlasio got 73 percent his first election and 66 percent in his second.\n\nContrast that weakness with Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill’s strength. Each outpaced Harris by 4 to 5 percent. It seems to me the question is, why were Spanberger and Sherrill so much stronger than Mamdani — while running in much more challenging terrain than he?\n\nWhile some of Begala’s points are well taken, he misses a strength of Mamdani’s that sets him apart from his fellow Democratic victors on Election Day: He mobilized disgruntled and angry young voters, who have long been seen as the potential to be the party’s sleeping giant.\n\nIn New Jersey, voters 18 to 44 made up 31 percent of the electorate. In Virginia, it was 33 percent. In New York City, it was 40 percent, according to CNN exit polls. Differences of seven or nine percentage points in the composition of the Democratic electorate may seem modest. In practice, they are seismic, with the potential to revitalize an almost lifeless political party.\n\nG. Elliott Morris, a political analyst who publishes his work on Substack at Strength in Numbers, described this aspect of Mamdani’s victory in an essay on Sunday, “The Mamdani Youthquake Suggests a Way for Democrats to Repair Their Brand.”\n\nExamining the election results, Morris wrote, “one chart that really caught my eye,” which showed “the percent of voters participating in New York City’s mayoral election that were less than 45 years old.”\n\nOf the two million voters who cast ballots in person, he continued,\n\n42 percent were under age 45 — a much higher share than in recent mayoral races. In 2021, just 27 percent of those who voted for New York City mayor were under 45.\n\nFirst-time voters also made up an abnormally high 20 percent of the electorate on Tuesday. These new voters broke for Democratic Party and democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani over former governor Andrew Cuomo by a margin of 66 to 30. This group was as pro-Mamdani as young voters, who broke 70 to 25 in his favor.\n\nCrucially, Morris wrote, “Mamdani also won two-thirds of voters with an unfavorable view of both political parties. This is something that Donald Trump managed to do in 2016, 2020 and 2024, as well.”\n\nMaybe, Morris concluded, “the party can learn something from Mamdani’s success in turning out new voters and engaging anti-system voters with an agenda aimed at affordability and the American dream. That is, after all, what most voters say they want out of politics anyway.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Shares His Favorite Movies Ahead of Vatican Event\n\nPublished: 2025-11-11T17:05:30-05:00\n\nThe Vatican is going Hollywood this weekend. Or, perhaps more accurately, Hollywood is going Vatican.\n\nAs part of the Roman Catholic Church Jubilee celebration, which takes place every quarter century, Pope Leo XIV is expected to host dozens of actors and directors in a star-studded “World of Cinema” gathering on Saturday at his official residence, the Vatican announced this week. Some of the actors expected to attend are Cate Blanchett, Adam Scott, Chris Pine, Viggo Mortensen, Alison Brie and Dave Franco — as well as the directors Judd Apatow, Spike Lee, George Miller and Gus Van Sant.\n\nOn Tuesday, Variety posted a video of Pope Leo sharing his four favorite movies of all time: Frank Capra’s “It’s a Wonderful Life” (1946), starring Jimmy Stewart; Robert Wise’s “The Sound of Music” (1965), starring Julie Andrews; Robert Redford’s “Ordinary People” (1980), starring Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore; and Roberto Benigni’s “Life Is Beautiful” (1997).\n\n“In this Jubilee Year, Pope Leo XIV has expressed his desire to deepen dialogue with the World of Cinema, and in particular with actors and directors, exploring the possibilities that artistic creativity offers to the mission of the Church and the promotion of human values,” the Vatican statement read.\n\nThe yearlong Jubilee, a rare Catholic tradition of penance and forgiveness, began last December and will end in early January 2026. This particular event is promoted by the Church’s culture and education department, along with its communications department and the Vatican Museums.\n\nPope Leo, who was born in Chicago and is the first pope to hail from the United States, was elected in May to lead the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics. Last week, he met with the actor Robert De Niro at the Vatican, and in June, Al Pacino visited with him there.\n\nSaturday’s gathering is the first such meeting of its kind, though Pope Francis, who died in April, hosted comedians from around the world in 2024. Among the attendees were Conan O’Brien, Whoopi Goldberg, Tig Notaro, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock and Jimmy Fallon.\n\nPope Leo’s move to connect with the film world could be seen as an extension of one of his predecessor’s interests. In 2013, the year he was elected, Pope Francis founded Scholas Occurrentes, a global educational movement that developed a project for youth communities around the world to create short films highlighting their identities, histories and values. Martin Scorsese, who had a long relationship with Pope Francis, is producing a feature-length documentary titled “Aldeas — A New Story” as part of that project. The documentary includes what is said to be Pope Francis’s final on-camera interview, recorded at Vatican City last December, months before his death.\n\n"}]}
